"FrontAlleyBoys","1","478","687","11 July 2012"," If the studio doesn't care, why should I?
","No one involved with this movie cared about making a good movie. Because they don't need to. The Spiderman movies will make money no matter good or bad they are. But that doesn't mean they should not try to. Why did this movie get made? Simple, Sam Raimi wasn't given enough time to make a fourth spider-man film so he quit, and the fans wanted to see the lizard on screen. This movie wasn't made for any other reason.<br/><br/>First off, Peter Parker doesn't have a goal in this movie. At first its to find out what happened to his parents, which isn't explained in this movie. After half an hour he now tries to control his new powers, in scenes that don't help the audience. In the original spider-man, Peter learned about his powers in a controlled environment, he didn't beat up innocent people on a subway train. It's nice to know no one on that train reported that a man beat up five people while climbing walls. But Peter learning his powers can't be an entire focus in the movie, so we kill Uncle Ben. This time it doesn't work because the only reason Peter let the criminal get away was because Peter couldn't get a chocolate milk. To get so upset that he couldn't afford a chocolate milk that he would let a robber get away with the stores money is a contrivance in every way. So for about ten minutes Peters new goal is to bring uncle Ben's murderer to justice, let the police can't link all these look alike criminals spider-man does capture with the man who did kill peters uncle. After a while he just stops doing this, with no reason! And there is still about an hour left, so what are we going to do now? How about introduce that main villain you've been promising us? The Lizard is horribly written in every scene he's in. Why does he go to so much trouble to knock cars off of a bridge just to tell one guy (who is never seen afterwords) that their vaccine isn't ready yet? Because we needed another action scene. After that they bring up that the daily bugle wants pictures of the lizard, a point that doesn't amount to anything, except the lizard finding out who spider-man is. For someone as smart as Peter Parker has been set up to be it was really stupid for him to put his name on the camera he was using to take pictures of the lizard.<br/><br/>The climax doesn't work for 2 reasons. The first being this is the same climax we've seen in about four other superhero movies. The second one being there are no stakes. Only half of Manhattan would be infected 8 minutes after the lizard started his chemical missile, decreasing the people at risk greatly. Also THERE'S A CURE FOR THIS!! You know, the thing Gwen has been working on for the past 6 minutes? Whoever gets infected can just get the cure shot into them afterwords, and as of right now there are only 10 people infected, so why waster your time trying to put the cure into the missile that will stretch half of Manhattan and only effect 10 people?! <br/><br/>Gwen Stacy's dad dies and tells Peter to leave Gwen out of this, and proceeds to still date Gwen. What a great way to respect someone who died protecting people! Don't watch this movie, don't waste your time with this movie, even Spiderman 3 was better than this, so just watch the Sam Raimi trilogy, at least those movies had effort put into them."
"AmbushBug26","8","46","61","15 July 2012"," The Spider-man Film That The Comic Fans Will Love But Sam Raimi Fans Will Hate
","Being a Spider-man comic book fan I can say that a lot of the stuff that happens in this story is true to the comic book Spider-man. Spider-man has web shooters, Spider-man likes to joke a lot, Gwen Stacy was Spider-man's first love, etc. So Anyone who is a fan of the comics will respect this movie on that merit, the merit that it was faithful to the source material while bringing in new stuff without losing what made Spider-man who he is.<br/><br/>People who've only seen the Spider-man films and never bothered to read any of the comics. Won't like this film as much. They'll say the same old stuff. ""Why was this made? We've seen this already?"" Blah blah blah.<br/><br/>Let me go off saying that behind Spider-man 2, this is probably the best of the Spider-man trilogy for one reason.....it avoids all clichés that the original trilogy didn't. In fact the film pretty much avoids all clichés at all. I'll try and explain a few without spoiling the film.<br/><br/>Well first of all the woman in this film aren't morons. One of the main problems I had with Sam Raimi's films was the fact that all woman were pretty much portrayed as objects that Spider-man can save. None of them do anything helpful. Sure Mary Jane tried to hit Doctor Octopus with a plank in the second film, but she couldn't even do that right. That's not the case here. Gwen actually has a confrontation with with villain and she doesn't screw around, I won't say what she does but when I saw it happen I couldn't help but cheer. Finally a Spider-man film where the woman have a brain-stem.<br/><br/>The second cliché it avoids is being predictable. The original films basically have Spider-man going through the motions. Girl gets kidnapped, Spidey saves girl, Spidey defeats villain or jumps out of the way so the villain can do harm to himself. That is not the case with this film, a lot of the time you think one thing is going to happen but then it doesn't and the opposite happens.<br/><br/>The third cliché it avoids is having silly moments. The first trilogy had a lot of them, yes even Spider-man 2 (The raindrops keep falling on my head scene). Going back an having re-watched the Sam Raimi trilogy before seeing this one, the films are more like popcorn films. Sam Raimi is the master at making B movies and that's what the original trilogy was, an epic scale B Movie. With this film, they get a little more serious. There's not really any goofy moments that I can think of and if there are then it's usually played for laughs.<br/><br/>Also THANK GOD They got Flash Thompson right. Sam Raimi used Flash so he could be the stereotypical bully, and at the beginning you think that's what Marc Webb plans to do, but then he shows that Flash isn't as big a douche as he makes himself out to be. Flash is one of my favourite Spider-man characters in the comics, and I'd like to say ""thank you Marc Webb for avoiding the cliché of him just being a bully and actually making him a human being with depth."" The film also does other things right besides avoiding clichés. The actors all do fantastic jobs and I will go on record saying that Andrew Garfield is the perfect Spider-man and a great role model for young boys even though he has his flaws. Martin Sheen was great as an Uncle Ben who is kind, understanding, but at the same time doesn't take any crap. Emma Stone was great as the kind of jokey but intelligent Gwen Stacy who is a strong positive role model for young woman. The Guy who played the villain was great, The girl who played Aunt May was good in the few scenes she was in. Not a weak link in the bunch.<br/><br/>So I've done nothing but praise this film so far, so why is it still behind Spider-man 2 in my books? Well the film does have flaw, mainly two. One it's rushed, the only one who really pays for it being rushed is the villain who only gets one line of dialogue to explain his motives and even then we're not sure why he's doing that. The second flaw is that it doesn't have this big epic feel that Spider-man 2 had, it doesn't feel like it was made to be a big summer blockbuster, instead it was made to be an Indy film with a big budget....although maybe that's why I liked it so much, it focuses more on characters than action.....hurm.....I'm still on the fence with that last one.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-man is a good film. It avoids most if not all clichés, it's fresh, it's interesting, it's got characters you love to see and actually feel for played by fantastic actors, it's a great Spider-man film and it's sad that a lot of fans seem to be hating it right now. I honestly can't see what's to hate.<br/><br/>Good film, go see it.....oh by the way.....I wouldn't recommend seeing it in 3D, there are a few moments where you're like ""Whoa cool"" but not much."
"Ben_Horror","5","493","741","17 July 2012"," The Amazingly Unnecessary Spider-man
","With the success of the first X-Men movie in 2000, Bryan Singer pretty much paved the way for all the comic book movies we see today. That included a certain super hero movie made by Sami Rami in 2002 where a nerdy guy (Tobey Maguire) gets bitten by a radioactive spider and inherits superhuman powers. If Singer had paved the way, then Rami provided the icing on the cake: a faithful, smart, well-acted super hero flick that had as much heart and sincerity packed in as it had all those set pieces. It also lead to a superior sequel and the much maligned, though underrated, third episode.<br/><br/>Which brings us to what we have here: while not a beat for beat remake, you get the same story more or less with a different love interest and villain. Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) sneaks into a research facility and gets bitten by a radioactive/genetically enhanced spider. He gets super powers and becomes Spider-Man. Meanwhile, a doctor (Rhys Ifans) working at the same facility, is being forced to close down his research into tissue regeneration. In desperation, he injects himself with an untested self-generating lizard vaccine and becomes a half man/half lizard thing. Spider-Man is then forced into action to stop him from spreading this contagion throughout the city of New York. Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) is the damsel in distress/love interest and plays a role in trying to stop the crazed beast.<br/><br/>First things first: this is not a bad film. It's well acted by all the principals, has good effects, a scary and menacing villain, some nice action sequences and web swinging effects that are generally slightly more realistic than the Rami version. Parker is more evidently scientific and intelligent here. Also the police's notion that Spider-Man is a menace to the public is more clearly defined, especially in the scene where he disarms an officer. The new idea is that Parker can hear the movements of spiders and it's a good addition. So where does it all go wrong? The short answer: it's just that it's so pointless. <br/><br/>We had already seen the story before. There was absolutely no reason to tell it again. This movie could easily have been Spider-Man 4 with Andrew Garfield filling in the Spidey spandex instead of Tobey Maguire. But Marvel – in their infinite wisdom – just chose to tell the same story a second time. Going by that rationale, presumably Andrew Garfield will be cast aside like a disused sock when they inevitably choose to 'reboot' the franchise again in ten years or so. It is a scarily unimaginative tactic and it is one they will continue to do until there is a massive financial failure.<br/><br/>This movie follows the same set up as the 2002 version: Parker being picked on, getting advice from his sage-like uncle (Martin Sheen), being bitten, getting his powers/climbing walls, and turning his back on a situation which unfortunately has tragic consequences for a family member. It's all a case of been there, done that. If you want to compare it to the Rami original, then the short answer is; as good as Andrew Garfield is, Tobey Maguire was better. Maguire filled the suit better; on occasion, Garfield is prone to looking thin and scrawny during several scenes. Even the suit looked better in the Rami movies. And those earlier movies had a heart and sincerity – especially in the relationship between Peter and his aunt and uncle that you don't see here. Again we ask: why does this movie exist?<br/><br/>And there are holes: there's a massive lizard running around, wreaking havoc; yet the police are more preoccupied with pointing their guns at Spider-Man – despite the fact that he saved a child in a (surprise, surprise) rehashed scene set on a bridge taken from Rami's first movie. In another part, the citizens of the city (once again - in a bit taken from Rami's movie) unite to help Spider-Man cross the city using tower cranes – despite the fact that there are buildings all around him. Heck, even the villain is initially a do-gooder like Norman Osborn and Dr. Octavius – again from the Rami movies.<br/><br/>It also seems to pull inspiration from another super hero movie: Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins (2005) in that it's slightly darker, tells such a large origin story that just like Batman Begins, Spider-Man doesn't actually show up on screen for the first hour. So if you take two parts Batman Begins and add a touch of Rami's Spider-Man, the result is what you have here. Additionally, the introduction of the web shooters, while being faithful to the original comics and emphasizing Parker's intellect, is a bit of a mixed blessing. The notion of the web being an organic material rather than being fired from mechanical devices actually made more sense.<br/><br/>It's not that reboots are a bad idea, they're not. In certain situations they can work well, provided for example, enough time has elapsed. But there is no point in retelling the same story if the initial release is still relatively recent. In addition, it helps if the story wasn't covered well the first time, or it was a bad movie to begin with. Going by this criteria, Marvel's latest cash cow is unnecessary on all three accounts.<br/><br/>In closing, if you haven't already seen the Rami movie from 2002, go watch it instead. If you have seen it, then this probably won't live up to it and you will be left feeling a little underwhelmed. It's fair to say that for anyone over the age of eighteen, this movie will seem rather half-hearted and senseless; for those under eighteen, this movie will probably be the greatest super hero flick ever. Yes, it's a movie that will divide opinions, primarily on the sole reason for its existence. Not a bad, or a badly made flick, by any means just a pointless one."

","In one scene, right after a spider in the Oscorp Laboratories bites Peter Parker: he falls asleep in a subway only to be awakened by a random loser who (for some strange reason) places a beer bottle on Parker's head. A drop of water from the bottle rolls down onto Peter's face, causing him to fling to the top of the car and stick to the ceiling – like a spider.<br/><br/>Over a dozen people witness this spectacular feat... and what happens next? A lady gets miffed because some of the beer spilled on her clothes. That particular reaction sums up how amazing the entire film is. After fully realizing his powers and using them to skateboard with furious bravado outside his high school, Peter Parker (much too) quickly dons the Spidey outfit that seems more like a surfer's wetsuit than a real transformation.<br/><br/>He seeks his uncle's murderer from the supposedly pivotal scene lacking the tragic fate of the protagonist's mentor in Sam Raimi's version. This doesn't perpetuate Parker into a vengeful vigilante misusing his powers, but gives him reason to fly around wielding his skills that actor Andrew Garfield never seems in any particular awe about. The SOCIAL NETWORK star, resembling Anthony Perkins had he become a melancholy hipster, doesn't give Peter Parker the underdog value Tobey Maguire successfully conveyed – but that's the scripts fault. Parker's not a nerd or even an outcast; having lost his parents for mysterious reasons, he's simply not a happy camper.<br/><br/>Other than the rushed changeling into the titular superhero, there's hardly any character arc for the good guy or the villain. Osco's resident genius Dr. Curt Conner's transforms into The Lizard so quick, running amok New York City like a raptor on steroids, there's not much reason, or worthy motivation, for his actions.<br/><br/>But (all) this lack of purpose fits a movie that, when not wallowing in romantic melodrama between Parker and girlfriend Gwen Stacey whose dad is a hard-nosed cop and a weak replacement for a much-needed human antagonist like J. Jonah Jameson doesn't live up to the original film or the comic books that at least, for better or worse, had a good time.<br/><br/>For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com"
"TheNorwegianGuy","9","135","197","10 November 2012"," I really don't get all the hate!
","I admit that I too didn't exactly get that excited when I heard that this was in the making. The Sam Raimi trilogy was a fun ride, and the idea of making another Spider-Man movie with a completely new cast seemed strange and unnecessary. When the cast was announced, I got a little bit curious, but nothing more.<br/><br/>However, when I watched it, I got a whole other impression. I really liked it. The atmosphere was great, and perhaps a little darker than the Sam Raimi movies at times. I know many of you who read this will hate me for saying this, but I actually think this movie was a LITTLE bit better that the previous ones. Not much, but just a hint better. One thing is the cast. I really didn't like Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man that much. I didn't have a huge problem with him back then, but now when I saw this, I must say that I like Andrew Garfields ""version"" better. He's a little more tougher, both physically and in personality. Also, I think Emma Stone did good as Gwen Stacy. I liked her better as Peter Parker's girlfriend than Kirsten Dunst. The Villain, too, was great. I won't say more about him, not wanting to spoil anything.<br/><br/>When I read many of the reviews in here, I don't see much positivity about this movie. I think that's unfair. At least, it's mediocre. Giving this a 1/10 is criminally wrong. At least I think so. If you wonder if you should see this or not, at least give it a chance. Don't let the bad reviews scare you away."

","IMO, i think the super A plus to this movie is the realistic application of physics. It shows a more limited spiderman. He must operate within parabolic physics and they tie that into the story.<br/><br/>I thought this spiderman was a more fun, spunkier, angstier Peter Parker. He was definitely way more nerdy than Toby Mcguire.<br/><br/>The addition of Gwen was great and I really look forward to seeing how this franchise manages upcoming installments under the new label.<br/><br/>Dialogue was slightly lame, key point being, ""Gwen! Gwen! I understand! Your boyfriend is a man of many masks!"" CHEESY!!!!<br/><br/>My other knock was that it spent the entire time developing the angst of peter parker and didn't give enough development to Gwen, Aunt May, and Doc. Connor.<br/><br/>I am a huge marvel guy, so i will continue to watch with a sense of forgiveness for the many flaws that Comic to Movie translations present.<br/><br/>I am glad I waited for DVD because so few movies obtain that silver screen quality. If you liked this movie check out the other Marvel and DC titles. They are doing some decent work."
"hnt_dnl","10","46","63","1 May 2013"," Now this is more like it!
","Hardcore fans of Sam Raimi's Spiderman can rail all they want to. THIS version of the Marvel Comics superhero, Marc Webb's THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN (2012) is BETTER! While I really did like Raimi's 2002 initial Spidey flick, I absolutely loathed the incredibly overpraised 2004 sequel. Thankfully, there is a bit more debate about which film is actually better, because I've always been in the small camp that believes Spiderman 1 is better than Spiderman 2. Part 2 regressed all the good will that Raimi built up in 1. And there is pretty much universal agreement that 3 isn't very good. But I still contend that 2 SUCKS. The huge difference that I already see in this 2012 reboot that is better than anything from the 2000s trilogy is that while the Raimi flicks TRIED and FAILED to have emotion and depth in telling the story of Peter Parker/Spiderman, Webb's reboot actually SUCCEEDS! TAS stars the pretty ""amazing"" newcomer Andrew Garfield (who was superb in The Social Network) as the well-known iconic character of Peter Parker/Spiderman. Peter is a bullied nerd whose parents mysteriously left him with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May (superbly played by acting legends Martin Sheen and two-time Oscar winner Sally Field) as a child.<br/><br/>Peter's father was a brilliant scientist working on cross-genetics technology that allows an organism to cure and re-generate itself by merging with another. Peter, a novice photographer who inherited his father's science acumen, accidentally stumbles upon some of his father's work in his Aunt and Uncle's attic, including a formula that solves the cross-genetic puzzle that his father's former colleague Dr. Curt Connors (sublimely played by Rhys Ifans) has been trying to solve for years. After sneaking into the Oscorp facility and passing himself off as an intern, Peter snoops into a lab full of test subject spiders, one of which latches onto him and bites him, giving him spider-like abilities: strength, speed, elusiveness, scales, web-shooting.<br/><br/>Connors works for Oscorp, whose founder and leader Norman Oscorp is dying and in need of a cure, and so Connors is trying to use the cross-geneticism to accomplish this. With Peter's help, the puzzle is ""solved"" and Connors ends up using himself as the first human test subject as he has only arm, which becomes regenerated, but it also has enormous side effects, transforming him into The Lizard, Spiderman's first enemy.<br/><br/>During this time, Peter, caught up in his work with Oscorp and bemoaning his parents' abandonment, selfishly chooses to ignore a robbery, which inadvertently leads to his Uncle Ben's death, so Peter initially uses his newfound powers to go an a rampage to find his Uncle's killer as he stalks the streets of New York on a nightly basis, bringing lowlife criminals to justice.<br/><br/>A romance develops between Peter and his fellow high-schooler, the equally scientifically inclined Gwen Stacy (played with exquisite charm and maturity by the gifted Emma Stone). The Peter-Gwen relationship is really the heart of this film. Very beautiful and engaging. In addition to his Aunt and Uncle, Gwen actually gives Peter a purpose and direction. Even though in virtually every modern superhero film, the girlfriend always seems to find out the secret identity, this is the first film that I think does it in a truly genuine, clever, mature, and natural way, and not just for shock value or cheap effect. I dare say that the romantic aspect is really the MAIN reason why this film works, whereas in Raimi's flicks, I couldn't wait for the ""romantic"" parts to come and go to get to the action! Credit really must go to Garfield and Stone for having incredible chemistry and being terrific actors. The Raimi films are really juvenile by comparison when it comes to the realistic love story in TAS. <br/><br/>Special mention should also go to legendary comedian Denis Leary, who does an extremely effective and refreshing turn as Gwen's father Police Captain Stacy, injecting the character with his trademark sarcasm, but also coming across as very commanding.<br/><br/>Another thing this film does is that it literally builds Peter from the ground up as a hero, making him learn the hard way through attempts, failures, experiences, pain, loss, and gain. Even many times when Peter is wearing the suit, he still acts very human and down-to-earth. He has to LEARN how to be a hero by still using his own instincts and common sense. It's not just about looking cool scaling walls and kicking ass! Spiderman isn't Superman! <br/><br/>The film also stages the action as realistic as possible, with a healthy dose of CG effects, of course. But, here, unlike in Raimi's films, every action scene makes sense and we get to see how Spidey must use his webs on ACTUAL surfaces! Not just magically touching the sky, the webs hit just about everything in sight: buildings, cars, windows, and even other people! <br/><br/>Garfield is simply superb as the awkward, gifted teen-aged Peter Parker, who has led a tragic existence, but finds a purpose through the memory of his parents, his aunt and uncle, Gwen, and the innocent citizens of New York. I usually think sequels suck, but I patiently await the sequel to his underrated, under-appreciated, extremely compelling and original superhero flick!"
"legioner8800","3","227","345","4 July 2012"," A pathetic movie
","Probably it's because I've seen the Tobey-Man and this is the reason I give this movie such a low score. I wanted to learn more about Peter's parents, but did not. ""They were scientists."" So what? That's not even 5% of what I needed to find out. Tobey-Man was on par with emotions, stunts and discovering the character. Here your uncle dies and what you see is 2 mins of drama about him. They really did not expand the characters and that led to my disappointment. <br/><br/>This really isn't the spider-man I wanted to see (full of questioning, thoughts and hardship). This guy was crying one minute and kissing the girl in another. Did I even mention that the suit did not fully fit him? Did I mention that Peter became a super scientists in 5 mins after he start reading 2 books and a couple of documents that do not make sense? Since when kids study genetics in school so deeply? <br/><br/>Tobey-Man's story deeper and more interesting. You could see the bright side of having super powers and the dark of constantly having the responsibility to hide your identity and take care of the closest. The new Spidey did little effort to hide his id. I could actually say that he was waving his mask the entire movie...<br/><br/>If you were happy with Tobey-man, stick with him!"
"AbhisarSarmandal","3","553","886","29 June 2012"," The Weak Spiderman
","I've been a fan of Spiderman since childhood. In fact, he has been my favorite superhero. I liked Spiderman 1, 2 and 3; watched Spiderman 3 twice, despite many reviewers bashing it.<br/><br/>So it's natural I was waiting eagerly for The Amazing Spiderman. I was more eager because this movie was rebooting the Spiderman franchise with new cast that included Indian actor, Irfan Khan and it was getting released in India before US! Unfortunately, it turned out to be a big disappointment. It was like they didn't make a Spiderman movie, but a caricature-remake or a spoof of it. Bad script, confused and weak characters, bad direction and bad editing are some of the major flaws. Story was too bland, no spice, no excitement.<br/><br/>The important scenes where Peter gets bitten or hones his skills or makes his suit have been hurried and short, while the irrelevant scenes have been dragged.<br/><br/>Spiderman gets beaten, defeated, injured repeatedly. In fact, the audience was laughing hard on the repeated scenes of him coming home all thrashed and bruised and his aunt talking to him about it. He keeps removing his mask for just anybody and that's not very Spiderman-like.<br/><br/>Most action scenes were non-thrilling. In a scene where Spiderman rescues a boy from a falling and burning car, he wastes almost 5 minutes trying to convince Jack (the boy) to be brave, climb up and hold his hand. He even gives the boy his mask, but the boy doesn't follow him. So in the end he has to throw his spider-thread to pull Jack up. He could have done that already and spared us of that boredom.<br/><br/>It was just an example. Most encounters between the lizard-man and Spiderman were equally boring, dragged and nonsensical.<br/><br/>There were a lot of loose ends and missing links in the story. Like the story of Peter's parents was never shown, but the characters kept mentioning it. Dr. Ratha talks about some Mr. Osbourne, but neither the man nor his story was shown. Maybe they're keeping it for the sequel, but the confusion totally spoiled this movie. A lot of inconsistencies were there too. Sometimes things stick to Peter's hands and break by little force, sometimes they don't.<br/><br/>The romance between Peter/Spiderman and Gwen looked lukewarm and forced. The scene where the burglar kills Peter's uncle looked awkward and disconnected like many other scenes.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield didn't look much convincing either as nerdy Peter Parker or as Spiderman. He was good in The Social Network but a disappointment in this movie. In many body-close-up shots he was bending forward apparently to hide his penis-line from showing in the tight-suit. That made the already weak Spiderman look even weaker. Since when have Hollywood actors become this bashful?<br/><br/>Irfan Khan appeared in just 3 short scenes. He was more like an extra. But the audience welcomed him with a bout of whistling!<br/><br/>Everyone seemed to be waiting anxiously for the movie to end, which ends after further boring you for some time after the defeat of the villain. So much I wish, they had made Spiderman 4 with Tobey Maguire instead of this disaster.<br/><br/>I might as well watch Rajnikant's Robot now"
"g-bodyl","8","62","90","28 January 2014"," Exciting, Action-Packed Reboot,,,,,But Is It Worth It?
","Only five years after the universally-hated Spider-Man 3(not me, though), Columbia Pictures have decided to give Peter Parker and his alter ego, Spider-man a fresh start. This film is essentially quite similar to 2002's film, but also features a few differences mainly a personality change in Peter. I don't know if I like this film any better than the original trilogy. This film is action-packed, has a great cast, and a rather fun villain in ""The Lizard,"" but this film doesn't live up to the trilogy that gave Spider-Man a name for himself.<br/><br/>Marc Webb's film explores the origins of Spider-Man and also unlike the trilogy, we learn more about Peter's past including what happened to his family. As Peter is exploring his past, he is lead to his father's former partner who happens to be too smart for his own good. Also, Peter strikes a relationship with the daughter of the police captain, Gwen Stacy.<br/><br/>The acting is really not too bad. An Andrew Garfield/Emma Stone pairing is not as good as the Maguire/Dunst pairing, but they still do very good and it's nice to see some cockiness in Peter's attitude instead of complete nerdiness. The Lizard, played wonderfully by Rhys Ifans, is a good villain to watch. The rest of the cast rounded out with Denis Leary, Martin Sheen, and Sally Field gives this film some starpower.<br/><br/>Overall, this is definitely not a bad film and it's very entertaining. But we must ask ourselves, is this a necessary reboot? Honestly, I would rather have seen a Spider-Man 4, but who's to complain. This is a solid entry into the superhero genre despite really offering anything new. But hey I was entertained and that is all what matters. I rate this film 8/10."

","Alrighty this movie was awesome! Yeah it could of used a little here and there, but the fact of the matter is that it is SPIDER-MAN. I am a comic fan, and after watching this I could agree that they captured the true spider-man, not some Toby creation<br/><br/>The moment i realized that he was building his own web slinger i knew that this was going to be good! I loved how Spider-man made funny jokes, he didn't shoot his fingers as guns and people walking by, he actually was funny, nerdy, and AWESOME!!! Gwen Stacey is great! Dr. Connors is amazing, when he transforms its gnarly, it gives you the feel of how he is being taken over.<br/><br/>There are some plot errors, like how does he get the web slinger stuff, and what happens to the semi transformed cops, while they are transformed. but other than that it flows pretty nicely."
"christhebodishot","1","368","590","4 July 2012"," The worst Spider-Man yet...
","After the last film, I was hard pressed to think that this one could be worse. Well, sure enough it is.<br/><br/>Warning, spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>The reasons that this film isn't good are simple: Most of the action scenes, take place at night- and are visually uninteresting as the CGI and night sky don't make good bedfellows. There is one action scene at day in which you can actually see what's going on, and its in a high school that clearly isn't anywhere within a three mile radius of New York.<br/><br/>We all understand how they shoot interiors in Culver City.. But the last spiderman films seamlessly blended shoots from Chicago, New York, Los Angeles without the audience ever noticing. This film does not, in fact the only attempt to make the high school look like New York is a lame sign.<br/><br/>This film's story has been done before, you've seen it before and with the exception of the Osbournes and the color of the love interests hair, there is not much new to this story.<br/><br/>Dennis Leary is great, as is Martin Sheen but they're both killed off. Martin Sheen is killed off in the beginning of this boring movie, making it more painful as he was one of the only reliefs.<br/><br/>Aunt May is written so poorly, that she has nothing to do in this movie. She sits at home and watches TV and screams at Peter when she sees him. Not exactly a challenging role for the great Sally Field.<br/><br/>There was little care that went into the quality of this film, and the attempts at making it dark are just flat out Corny such as the cannibal rat, which is pure comedy and comes out of nowhere to 'shock' the audience.<br/><br/>There seems to be no conflict between Peter and his girlfriend at the end of the story, which one would logically want to assume that she holds out some contempt for spiderman as Harry did in the original spiderman after Spiderman played a hand in his death. Spiderman did play a hand in the Captain's death, yet the daughter doesn't seem to mind that Peter was there when he was murdered.<br/><br/>This film had great visual effects, obscured by the night time setting and slow down camera techniques. Other than that, it's a music video and it pulls NO surprises. You have already seen this film if you've seen the extended trailer, or the 2002 Green Goblin movie.<br/><br/>The chemistry between the two leads is lame, with Andrew Garfield who is wonderful in other films and stage productions giving a few moments of over-acting that take away Peter's humanity and spell the word HAM with it. Also, they appear to be improvising in some of their scenes, the result is two young, MEGA-RICH people trying to imagine what blue- collared kids from Queen's social customs would be like, and let me tell you they FAIL in a telling and Inauthentic way.<br/><br/>This movie does not have you believe in the setting or characters at all. It is just ridiculous."
"Califorever1","9","43","61","21 December 2012"," Best Spider-Man Yet
","I first was going to see another movie, but my cousin wanted to see this. I walk into the movie theater thinking: 'Yeah this'll probably suck and be boring' and came out with chills. I saw this movie in 3D and it felt like I was there with the actors, in all the scenes! Of course the fight scenes were a little bland and they could have added a little more action. But the part when Peter is Spider-man and he was doing flips up in the air, also swinging across buildings, literally gave me an adrenaline rush. It was an amazing feeling.<br/><br/>But the best part of this movie wasn't the action, but the chemistry between Peter (Andrew Garfield) and Gwen (Emma Stone). Every time they had a scene together, I could absolutely tell that they were in love. Their love story was one of the best parts of this movie because it blossomed from them being cute and flirty, to being completely head over heels in love with each other. They were both charming but also pulled it off as their character very well; Emma as the intelligent, graceful Gwen, and Andrew as the cute, but awkward and nerdy Peter. They were definitely the highlights of this film.<br/><br/>Like every movie, it had it's flaws. I think that they could have chosen a better villain than 'The Lizard'. Don't get me wrong, Rhys Ifans was a good actor in this film but his character just felt rushed to me. One moment I see him as a brilliant, kind-hearted scientist to him then becoming psychotic and turning himself into a giant green monster way too quickly. Also, I didn't think he looked like a lizard at all. Honestly, I think once he turned into 'The Lizard' he looked a lot like 'Lord Voldemort' from 'Harry Potter'. He was the only character I had an issue with though everyone else was great and was perfect for their part.<br/><br/>Another issue, that a lot of people complained about was the lack of thrilling fight scenes. The fight scenes in this movie were a little cliché like you have seen it in another action movie. Also the fight scenes just kind of came and went. They were so quick and just very boring, like you knew every move Spider-Man (AKA Peter) was going to make. I thought they should have put a little more effort into these scenes and they should've put a lot more action into them.<br/><br/>Honestly, overall this is a terrific movie! Despite some flaws, I think it is definitely worth seeing. Andrew and Emma are very charming in their parts and look adorable together on-screen. It has some cute lines were I had to laugh out loud because they were just really funny! If you like a super-hero movie with a comedic and romantic twist into it, I think you will enjoy this movie!"
"escalad89","8","30","41","1 November 2012"," Closest any Spiderman movie has come to the comics!!!
","This movie in my personal opinion was the best Spiderman film of the 4! This movie came the closest to the comic that any of the other three!!! This movie developed the relationship between Gwen and Peter and sadly left Mary Jane out of it!This movie was funnier better written and better actors than the first 3! Why they choose The Lizard for the villain is beyond me! That was the worst park of the movie!<br/><br/>The nest logical choice for the villain is: The Jackel, obsessed with Gwen, for the 2nd film. The Green Goblin, throws Gwen off a bridge, for the 3rd film. That way the can develop the romance between Mary Jane and Peter Parker in the 4th film, if this film franchise reaches that far."
"mrooney98","9","41","58","3 July 2012"," Great film, seems to be more geared toward a younger audience than previous films.
","I enjoyed this movie because it was a superhero film with many funny bits. I like to be able to laugh while watching a movie, not just watch loads of CGI action. I also liked the fact that the villain wasn't killed just defeated and put in prison, giving him a second chance. However, I do believe that was partially do to the fact that the producers/writers wanted something to write a future film on. I think that Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone did exceptionally in their roles. Garfield really seemed to actually be Peter Parker and I love to see that in a film. Although this movie is a superhero movie I do believe it was geared toward a younger audience, unlike the Dark Knight. The fact that Spider-man is a teenager in this one and that it is not nearly as dark as some other films certainly convinced me of this. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys action and superheroes. Side note: Denis Leary was great!"
"Robert_duder","8","26","35","3 May 2014"," Completely unnecessary but still entertaining enough
","Going back a few years when Sam Raimi's Spiderman released it was jaw dropping. It was sort of the spring board for the current excess of superhero films we see now. Most of us were definitively disappointed in Spiderman 3 but disappointed enough that we thought it should end the franchise and encourage a reboot only TWO years later? Fortunately for them the reboot isn't so bad and actually very entertaining and spidey fans won't be disappointed. I don't think its nearly as good as the original Raimi's Spiderman but then at that time it was new and fresh and captivating to see a live action, non-campy superhero on screen. The Amazing Spiderman does manage to make itself different enough to make you not feel like you're watching something you've seen a dozen times over. Its a different spin on the Spiderman story while still keeping key elements firmly in place (maybe Marc Webb should give Zack Snyder a few tips.) They also establish enough back story to make this a lucrative franchise for at least three films if they don't screw it up some way and get it scrapped like they did the first time around. At the same time of being different enough it isn't really that far fetched from Raimi's trilogy. It still has the same feel and intensity and solid special effects. As someone who despises CGI I didn't find it silly or overused (though its clearly used a lot) its done very well including The Lizard who is complete CGI.<br/><br/>If they absolutely had to do this then Andrew Garfield was a great choice for the role of Peter Parker and Spiderman to a lesser extent. Its funny because I always thought Tobey Maguire made a great Spiderman but lacked as Peter Parker and Andrew Garfield makes a great, awkward, angsty teen Peter Parker but lacks something significant as Spiderman. I don't know what it is...but its something. Still he is at least good in both roles. Emma Stone is terrific as Gwen Stacy. Her chemistry with Garfield is perfect (though again not quite as good as Dunst and Maguire) and she shows once again why she's one of the best young talents in Hollywood. Stone outdoes herself in her role. Rhys Ifans is also perfectly suited as our villain Kurt Connors/The Lizard. Playing a villain (especially a giant Lizard) is extremely difficult to not make campy but Ifans plays it very seriously and is a very viable enemy. He absolutely brings the comic villain genius to life. Denis Leary is a great addition to as Gwen's father and Police Captain who is also somewhat of a nemesis for Spiderman and Peter Parker. His character adds a certain layer of depth to the story and he plays it very seriously even when he's being sarcastic and angry. It wouldn't even be fathomable for me to mention Martin Sheen and Sally Field, two absolute legends of Hollywood playing Uncle Ben and Aunt May. Sadly they are very underused and only have a few good scenes in the beginning of the film but I wanted to see more of them because of who they are as actors.<br/><br/>Part of the issue I had with The Amazing Spiderman was perhaps the lack of emotional depth, the human side that we miss out on. The connection between Peter and his Uncle and Aunt isn't quite felt as well as it should have been. I wasn't moved enough when Uncle Ben was killed. However, this film gets definitively and absolutely better as it goes on. The end of the film is superior to the first part in every way. Its intense, emotional, action packed and jaw dropping. If the entire film was at the quality of the latter half it might have been a ten. The High School Spiderman/Lizard fight is legendary (especially with one of Stan Lee's best cameos), the scenes between Garfield and Leary and the final battle all make this an absolute must see. Marc Webb did an excellent job of creating something that could have and almost should have been a disaster into a viable and watchable franchise. I wanted to complain about how incredibly cheesy and melodramatic the ""crane"" scene was during the last scene but darned if it didn't make me get goosebumps and feel all warm and squishy. One thing is for certain, there isn't a Spiderman fan out there that can't say this isn't well done and very entertaining. There is some terrific Spiderman imagery (again especially towards the end.) Let's hope Marc Webb can hold this together throughout the franchise's life. Its greatest feat was to overcome was being far too soon for it to be made and it does overcome that. 8.5/10"
"philipjkite","3","180","284","3 July 2012"," Are you kidding me?
","I don't like to be the downer on this movie, but I've just got back from watching it at my local cinema and I've already forgotten about it! I was expecting good things, 215 million spent on the movie, Emma Stone (big fan), Andrew Garfield (up and coming, great in Social Network) and Martin Sheen as a co-star, come on it should have been better.<br/><br/>I got lost in the lack of a plot, it felt like it all happened over a day or two, the acting was limited, even Emma Stone only seemed to convince in a few scenes. At times it was as if I'd gone back in time and was stuck watching the Hulk again! please, please, not again! It just seemed so mixed up,there were a few, and when I say a few, I mean more than two! decent scenes! a couple of jokes thrown in, but then it was back to mediocre, what the heck happened to Denis Leary, after Rescue Me, you'd think that this guy could act now.<br/><br/>For me, and this is only my humble opinion, it was a bid disappointment that made me wonder why I went in the first place. Once again Hollywood got me, with their big budget advertising machine. <br/><br/>But maybe it's me, IMDb's never wrong is it? and maybe, just maybe, as I didn't watch it in 3D and could see the movie this time, I'm wrong!"
"thesar-2","3","285","462","4 July 2012"," The Amazing Spider-Man Movie Has Already Been Made
","I don't have an argument that Spider-Man's origin story didn't need to be remade for I've seen plenty of very decent to mediocre reboots before. But, what makes this a worthless remake was that it backtracked on all that was good before it.<br/><br/>Heart, soul, good soundtrack, excellent score, acting, chemistry, heroism, humor and quotable dialogue were present in the original Spider-Man movies – and yeah, even #3. This movie lacked ALL of those. Heck, it even deleted one of the main characters and often hilarious: J. Johan Jameson. Shame.<br/><br/>I was even willing to over look the obvious first hour or so that inevitably retold the same old story of pansy Parker, a love interest, the bullies, the Aunt & Uncle, the spider bite, the transformation and the first try-outs. Without anyone (and I guess me now) spoiling that, we all knew that was coming. But, what I didn't foresee was how blah it all was going to be. How boring and trite.<br/><br/>And pleasePLEASE do not let the advertisements fool you into filling a seat for a movie you've seen before: ""The Untold Story"" was about as revealing as finding out about Ellen Ripley's all-but irrelevant daughter in the director's cut of Aliens.<br/><br/>What the movie is trying to tell us is that Spider-Man is a hero, that he loves Gwen Stacy and that, despite how great the Hulk looked in The Avengers, a giant lizard man can look real on screen using 1996's technology. No apologies: I didn't buy any one of these things the script displayed. In fact, it showed so much and yet, so much felt left out. So many story lines began and either faded or we're given half-ass explanations.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong; I didn't full-on hate on The Amazing Spider-Man. Of the approximately 20 minutes (of 136) of screen time Spidey was on the screen, he lookeddecent, albeit the shots still looked like deleted scenes from the previous series. And even though Tobey Maguire spun webs around Andrew Garfield's Parker, he still did a good job. I will even give it to both the script and Garfield: Spider-Man's signature sarcasm was funnier this time around.<br/><br/>Is it redundant to give the synopsis since I already reviewed the 10-year-old original? Yes, except this time around instead of a green bad guy from Oscorp being human, this one had a green bad guy from Oscorp being a laughable CGI Godzilla offspring. Oh, and as much as I love Emma Stone, her character, Gwen Stacy, first introduced in Spider-Man 3, was so lifeless, you'd have to miss Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane.<br/><br/>I simply cannot recommend this movie. Again, of the 136 minutes, 40 were good, but that did not outweigh the bad-3-D effects or 96 other slow-paced, unoriginal and uninspiring minutes."
"amielwrite","10","38","54","2 February 2014"," this movie is what I've been looking for (despite the criticism)
","SPOILER WARNING:<br/><br/>let me make one thing clear the original spider-man movies never got it right, spider-man was not this punk little man who takes the heat from everybody he comes across and makes dumb statements like poetry quoting and crying, and in every film he was the same person when he puts on the mask and takes it off, hes never funny hes never doing anything science related and the ending villain fights are all the same. The villain comes, he threatens spider-mans girlfriend, they fight for a bit, and the villain kills himself. the movies rush any accuracy it was going for like making him spider-man after he graduates and giving him Mary Jane before Gwen, and don't get me started with the green goblin. making him the goblin before you show the power hungry business man what where they thinking? But when i saw this film i cloud have never been this happy since the dark knight, its not better than the dark knight or its equal, but just as the dark knight finally made a batman film I've been waiting for, the amazing spider-man did the same with spider-man, it made some changes necessary for it to be a movie while keeping true to its source material its the Peter Parker I've been waiting for, its the girlfriend I've been waiting for and hes funny hes smart his body looks like a spider rather than a sumo wrestler and the bad guy is serious, and the ending fight is different like when Parker warns his girlfriend that the lizard is coming instead of being kidnapped she helps people and uses a blow torch to fight him off, and the side characters are developed not so many throw away characters, so yeah i love this movie i want to see where they take it next."
"TheSquiss","8","36","51","6 August 2012"," Why a Spider-Man reboot so soon? Here's why
","I have to admit I had low expectations for The Amazing Spider-Man. Yes, I enjoyed the first of Tobey Maguire's outings as Spidey back in 2002 but the quality diminished with each sequel to the point that I didn't care if a fourth installment came to fruition or not. More than anything, it was the feeling I had a mere five years after the last installment, and I'm sure I'm not alone in this, of 'Why another Spider-Man so soon?' However, the decision to return to the timeline of the source comics and introduce Gwen Stacy as Peter Parker's girlfriend (instead of the more familiar Mary Jane Watson) increased the interest. Maybe this would be a new approach. Then the casting of Andrew Garfield intrigued. His superb turns in Never Let Me Go and in the more widely seen The Social Network certainly suggested he may have something new to bring to the part. The trailer clinched it for me, hinting at a Spider-Man Begins leaning. If Christopher Nolan could obliterate the camp, tarnished Adam West Batman with a completely reinvented trilogy, what could director Marc Webb (500 Days of Summer) create with The Amazing Spider-Man? It's not Batman Begins, let's get that straight immediately. Nolan's trilogy stands head and shoulders above all other superhero films at the moment and is unlikely to be dethroned any time soon. But The Amazing Spider-Man is a huge success and an extremely enjoyable first foray into Spidey world by all involved and this is down to some fine writing by James Vanderbilt (who has just penned next year's RoboCop reboot) and the courage of Webb not to rush into the action and villain chasing too soon.<br/><br/>A large part of the film is spent meeting, understanding and developing a relationship with Peter Parker through his childhood, the loss of his parents, his relationship with his aunt and uncle, the death of his uncle and his decision to become the superhero and gradual evolution of his crime-fighting alter ego. We see that Peter is flawed. He's cocky at times, he's angry, emotionally wounded, damaged goods and incredibly lonely. When he's bullied at school, it isn't the obvious type of bullying that results in a dramatic conversion to prize-fighting champion, it's the slow, constant drip-drip that niggles, that eats away at confidence and distills the inner turmoil to anger that could easily become rage but veers towards sulky stubbornness and carries its own consequences.<br/><br/>Such time is spent with the family that when Aunt May (Sally Field on fine form that surely must lead to more screen time in the sequel) rebukes Peter we, too, sit up and listen and when Uncle Ben (the ever-excellent Martin Sheen in another flawlessly strong and sincere performance) is murdered in front of his nephew, though we know it will happen and is only on a screen, it wrenches our gut and we know Peter's anguish for ourselves.<br/><br/>When Gwen steps into Peter's life it, too, is gradual and believable. There are no great fireworks or sudden changes but a slow maturing of their friendship into something stronger. The chemistry between Garfield and Emma Stone (so much more watchable here than in the good but overrated The Help earlier this year) is tangible and a pleasure to witness. They work together, they suit each other and one really hopes they stay together.<br/><br/>Inevitably, the superhero must eventually take centre stage and the catalyst has to be an (almost) equally super villain. In this instance it's Rhys Ifans' Dr. Curt Connors, aka The Lizard, with a destructive agenda. So good has The Amazing Spider-Man been up to this point that it's almost a pity when The Lizard arrives at all. It has to happen and it brings with it an increased level of excitement and action but something dims, the quality dips slightly and it becomes a more predicable, certainly a more standard comic book flick.<br/><br/>Ifans is dangerously close to panto villain at times but in his human form he is straight enough to offset the predictable swerves in naturalism and believability when he transmogrifies into lizard form. His make-up is better than the CGI and at times The Lizard's moves are clumsy and the facial expressions lacking in emotion. In the wide shots, however, Spider-Man's leaps and swings are far smoother and more elegant than in the Maguire years and are a minor annoyance when they are less than perfect rather than a jarring disturbance.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man is very good indeed and I am, for the first time, looking forward to Spidey sequel but I'm guessing the real amazement will come next week when at last The Dark Knight Rises.<br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.uk"

"barok_232","1","99","154","14 July 2012"," Amazing Spiderman a total failure
","This movie is a cash-in.First thing that occurred to me was that I previously saw everything worth watching in the movie's trailer.For example, note that Spidey's swinging scenes which are spread out in the trailer ended up being one scene in the movie (the crane scene)!Also,I didn't see ONE new bit of action in the movie that I hadn't already seen in the trailer and if I did,it was not a highlight.It really gets on my nerves when Hollywood manages to fool me with an impressive trailer that I am going to see a good movie, only to discover that it's far from that.<br/><br/>It is more than obvious that everyone's eyes are on the Parker character, played by Garfield.I believe he did a decent job with what he was given and if at times there was some awkwardness with the character,it wasn't his fault.The bad thing is at some points I got a ""Harry Potter"" feeling by him.The rest of the cast did well,Stone was great and cute,Field and Sheen felt like cameo appearances just to help the film sell more(although happy to have seen them),Leary was very fitting to the role of captain Stacey and Ifans was sufficient as Connors(again he did nothing wrong,not his fault that his character was poorly developed). I also got a question here: would a half-arm person lift his sleeve up to the point where his rest arm is shown unless he is a beggar on the street? I think not.As for the Peter-Gwen romance,it was cute but I honestly think it never got deep emotionally.The movie also failed to explain to me why Gwen got attracted to Peter.<br/><br/>The film is about Peter trying to find the truth about his parents. I honestly couldn't care less.And besides,there are only repeated references of that matter and no actual clues to follow,another cheat sponsored by the trailer.The rest of the film focuses on Peter getting bitten by the spider (since the movie is a reboot) and then on the lizard matter. Comparing with the original Spiderman(Sam Raimi's) at this point is inevitable. The question is raised: is there anything more they could possibly tweak/alter? Couldn't they stick to the comic plot at all? It's as if they are changing everything no matter what.The result was to go worse everywhere since the Raimi version did amazingly well with Spidey's story.Huge example is uncle Ben's death.What was that?No guilt was established for Peter as nobody in the audience would assume Peter was obliged to stop the thief and Ben's death had no actual impact on him,just a shallow crying scene over Ben lying on the sidewalk. Since they like to alter things so much, I say, let Ben live in this one flick!Connors is underdeveloped,so his motives are not clear,lizard wants to turn everybody like himself, although able to talk (with fantastic pronunciation!!!)and be sane.I don't get if there is a second persona or a crazy Connors behind the lizard,the film doesn't really explain and the scene where Connors hears the lizard talk to him only complicates things more.<br/><br/>The director,in order to promote this film,boasted that this film uses very little cgi technology if any.That is a big lie.Not only there is extensive use of cgi, it's actually also very bad.I can't comment further on this matter as it is something one has to realize on his own.What gives it away is motion,colors are OK. Gravital issues also occur as the lizard sometimes appears to be really heavy(Hulk-Godzilla-like)and at other scenes he climbs and jumps like a feather. The only action scene I enjoyed in its entirety was the car thief scene. There is no cgi there as far as I'm concerned and it is a very enjoyable scene overall(Garfield's humorous lines help too).The flaw there is how the heck did so many police cars get there so quick!.At this point I want to comment about the suit.I really hate it.Had there not been the Spiderman mask,I would never recognize the man wearing this suit as Spiderman.Mechanical (-electrical?) web shooters are indifferent although faithful to the comics(let's give them that),but I think Raimi's idea of giving Peter organic web shooters was a real improvement.Like I said above, in this new film they did EVERYTHING differently.The scene when Peter tests the web shooters is far from realistic as he chose to fall off a skyscraper in order to do that!.<br/><br/>One of my first thoughts was how many times had the director(Webb)taken me to Peter's school and Oscorp.Most of the film's scenes take place either at school or Oscorp.I find this unacceptable unless this is a television series or something. Furthermore,Webb never seemed to understand what is important or not in this film and I believe his whole approach to this project was false.Few examples:Peter Parker being a skateboarder (!) while a genius geek at the same time.There are more than enough scenes after Parker was bitten by the spider where his hands glue. Spider sense was not portrayed properly.I could literally go on forever.To conclude, there is no stigma,style,interesting shots, there is nothing.I don't know where this guy Webb came from and I haven't seen his other movie, but he did an amateur job.Take out the CGI and production money and you have yourself a fan-made film.Christopher Nolan did another take on Batman but you can see he can direct,and his movies are really ""heavy"",meaning important and professional.<br/><br/>I fear for what's coming next for the Spiderman franchise.It is certain that I will avoid seeing the future amazing Spiderman films.The biggest problem is that they do no honor to Spiderman and tend to destroy him before the eyes of us fans."

"classicsoncall","8","30","42","9 July 2012"," ""Why the sudden interest in cold blood?""
","There was no way I was going to miss this film, but after reading a number of reviews by fans here I began to have some reservations. Most of that had to do with the retelling of the origin, and fundamentally I agree that this probably wasn't necessary after only ten years since the Tobey McGuire version. But now that I've seen it, I can say my second thoughts were unwarranted because this film provides an adrenaline rush with every spider web fired.<br/><br/>I always had this unsettled feeling with the McGuire Spider-Man, or more accurately, with the McGuire Peter Parker. I found him to be too much of a wuss, wimping out whenever confronted as the timid teenager. With Andrew Garfield, I didn't get the impression he was OK to let things go whenever a bully came on the scene. With only one picture under his belt as opposed to Tobey's three, I'm going with the new kid in town.<br/><br/>Whether intended or not, I also preferred the darker tone to this take on the Spidey character. Many of the action scenes occurred at night and better conveyed a sense that this costumed hero might be more of a menace than a friend. Peter Parker's dinner clash with Captain Stacy (Denis Leary) helped push that agenda and it worked pretty well.<br/><br/>As for the main villain, a mixed reaction. There were times The Lizard (Rhys Ifans) looked a bit corny and other times truly menacing. It seemed to me that the film had trouble establishing the villain's proportion in relation to Spider-Man and other humans. In some scenes he looked like a monster, at others merely somewhat larger than Spider-Man. However the concept of cross-species genetics on which The Lizard came to being was handled rather well and proved effective.<br/><br/>As always, my favorite moment in a Marvel hero movie did not leave me disappointed. Stan Lee makes a cameo appearance once again, this time as the oblivious librarian listening to a symphony while Spidey and The Lizard make a shambles of the bookcases in the background. I can't believe he'll be ninety at the end of this year."
"davidisgoliath38","8","35","50","30 March 2014"," So many wrong butt hurt fans
","Toby Magure was never believable as Spiderman, I mean Stan Lee's Spiderman. He wasn't enough of a smart ass. He was hard to take seriously, he lacked the ability to make his character believable, because maybe he thought the whole superhero/spiderman thing was corny. Andrew Garfield grew up reading the comics, and that comes through. This is not just a rehashing, it's treating Stan Lee's characters and story with the respect they deserve. People really thought Spiderman 3 did Gwen Stacy justice? In Stan Lee's Spiderman Gwen Stacy is his first love, and she's a sweet girl (pretty much what the first three films did with Mary Jane). In the comics Mary Jane is a fiery redhead who's not anything like the Mary Jane in the first 3 spiderman movies. In fact it would make sense for MaryJane not to appear at all in the first 2 or 3 movies. This movie really does a great job of playing out these characters the way they should be played out. I wasn't a fan of the darker look from the trailers but I got over it. Spiderman isn't the avengers, and if you think about all of the arcs in the Spiderman comics you realize that his life is just filled with tragic irony and bittersweet moments. For that reason the dark direction actually makes sense. People saying this isn't as good as the first 3, maybe you haven't watched them in a while. I remember being blown away by Spiderman and Spiderman 2 as a kid. But comic movies have gotten a lot better since then. You've had incredible ones like the Dark Knight and Iron Man and the Avengers. The first three Spiderman movies are over the top with the cheesiness to a degree that should make real Spiderman fans cringe. They made green goblin just the first villain instead of the mastermind behind the rising if other villains. You shouldn't fight the big boss in the first level. Gwen Stacy was an afterthought in the third movie, when Stan Lee has said that Gwen Stacy was supposed to be Spider-man's true love. To sum it up, Amazing Spiderman is a LOT better than those terrible first 3 films, and people who aren't able to see that are blinded by nostalgia."

","Right i'd like to get into this by first saying that I've never wrote a movie review in my life, but as a lifetime comic book fan and collector i was the first person to say ""ah no can't believe they are doing a reboot!""

Like Spiderman wasn't Spiderman. The running down the street pulling the shirt open was a little Superman but it worked. Mary Jane? Well if your on the track of Ultimate Spiderman yeah cool. But we're not<br/><br/>Rami had a vision if he threw the Spiderman humour in there then this movie couldn't touch it but he didn't. No fault of his own. Spiderman 2 had that bank scene it had comedy it was how Spiderman works. Irritating, annoying getting the bad guy frustrated, brilliant! But i think i got my expectations a little high because Spiderman 3 came out and Spiderman/Toby became irritating, annoying, crying baby! I mean come on man up your Spiderman!! I'm not gonna talk about the rest because it was poppycock really. Youtube ""how it should have ended and you'll agree"".<br/><br/>Now The Amazing Spiderman. Where shall i start. Cast Awesome! Emma Stone Gwen Stacey? Have you seen the comic book back in the 60's? she looks the same almost spit image, and she was Peter Parkers first love interest way before Mary Jane came along. Rhys Ifans was powerful and this is a guy who does a lot of B movies (Twin Town, Mr Nice) We haven't got to talk about Aunt May and Uncle Ben because they are obviously well established. It makes me laugh the people who say the cast was week! Come on! Get a grip! Its dark its got web shooters, backstory( which was probably open because it can be continued in the sequel. <br/><br/>Some numpty said in an earlier review ""the high school doesn't look like it was set in New York!"" my question to his is There is a reason its called ""Middletown"" high school, and if you read Ultimate Spiderman you'll know its set in a suburb of Queens ya dick!"
"ryokan_wc","8","33","47","13 July 2012"," The Amazing Spiderman is amazing.
","When i first saw the trailer of this movie last year, i thought- another Spiderman movie?, and again earlier this year- seriously, another Spiderman move?. In all honesty, i was not compelled to watch the movie- may be it was the trailer or that thought of how far can a Spiderman movie be different than the one produced about a decade ago? How 'amazing' can it be, as its title suggests?<br/><br/>After going against the odds, i came out from the movie very pleased. In fact, i enjoyed the move thoroughly and felt very entertained. And i finally understood the word 'amazing' in the title- because it is really, pretty amazing!<br/><br/>It is not one of those movies with excessive ZOMG factor, for sure. The movie is amazingly captured with great use of CGI. The first half of the movie explores the dark side of Peter Parker's family history in a fairly comical manner. I got to know about Peter's father, which was not much explained in the previous trilogy and i don't exactly read the comics.Then there is his high school stories of his love. The next half of the movie was gripping and fast-paced, with well angled shots to make you feel like swinging from building to building and climbing up towers- i watched it in 2D and i could still feel the height! This part of the movie focuses on the transformation of Dr Connors as the Lizard, the villain of this movie, who happens to be Peter's father's working partner. His wish to regenerate his arm goes awry, leading him to produce a biological threat that forces Spiderman to a race to save the people in the city.<br/><br/>As i said, i was entertained. The movie was light hearted, like watching The Captain America, with brilliant cast. Andrew G performs magnificently as Peter Parker, to a certain extent, i felt him outshine Tobey M. He fits the character well. I enjoyed the scene where he first discovers of his special ability, particularly with the flipping of his skateboard. Much credits to Emma Stone, Sally Field, Martin Sheen and Rhys I, and director Marc Webb for taking the risk of rebooting this franchise. Watch out for Stan Lee in a show-stopper scene. Flash, played by Chris, gives me the feeling of a sequel where he will be featured in a bigger role- like Jacob in Twilight.<br/><br/>Give this Spiderman a try. For a two-hour movie, this movie does not fall short and does not feel long. And a sequel is pretty likely- stay for the post-credit (duh! almost all Marvel movies has this).<br/><br/>I have to say this one more time: The Amazing Spiderman is amazing."
"freemantle_uk","8","26","36","11 July 2013"," The Retold Story
","In a cinematic scene of superhero films and reboots one of the most controversial was The Amazing Spider-Man, the reboot of a series that was critically and commercially popular. The Amazing Spider-Man is divisive, with opinions ranging from it being the best Spider-Man film so far to being a waste of space.<br/><br/>Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is a nerdy outsider who enjoys photography, inventing and skateboarding. His parents mysteriously run off in the middle of the night when he was young and he has been living with his Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field) ever since. One evening Peter finds his father's briefcase which contents his research that he wanted to hid from mysterious forces. Peter is led to Oscorb, meeting his father's old research partner, Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) and he ends up getting bitten by a genetically altered spider giving his spider powers.<br/><br/>When Uncle Ben is murdered on the streets Peter goes on the hunt for his killer, leading him to become Spider-man. But at the same time Connors is forced to test an experimental serum on himself, leading him to become the Lizard, a powerful creature that is a deadly threat to the whole of New York.<br/><br/>Let's get the comparisons to the original Spider-man films out the way: the special effects are better, I preferred the hyper-realistic look of this version then the original film and Garfield is a stronger Peter Parker/Spider-man then Tobey Maguire was. But Cliff Robertson was a better Uncle Ben and Rosemary Harris was perfect as Aunt May and Field was not able to compete. On the whole I felt that the original film was generally a better origins story: I preferred that Peter was bitten by a spider in a lab visit and I especially preferred Uncle Ben's death in the original film because it had more emotional impact and handled better because Peter comes up a real dick in The Amazing Spider-Man.<br/><br/>There are also comparisons to actual scenes and ideas between the original film and the reboot which will lead to some spoilers. We get similar scenes of Peter awkwardly using his powers when he first gets them, citizens of New York (crane lift operators) helping Spider-Man during his confrontation with the villain and Peter losing a father figure which results in Peter having to reject the woman he loves. There are even similarities between the villains as both men are scientist are forced to experiment on themselves and developed a split personality.<br/><br/>The Spider-Man origins story is equal to Superman and Batman for well-known it is and there is less leeway for reinterpretation. I personally felt that it was a waste going through the origins story again because it is so well known, killing the pacing especially because it takes an hours before we get to see Peter Parker don the spandex. It would have been more effective if Peter Parker was Spider-Man and the origin was done in flashbacks. But once Spider-Man does show up the pacing picks up with gusto and director Marc Webb shows great confidence with the action sequences and special effects (even more impressive considering his previous film was (500) Days of Summer).<br/><br/>As a comic book fans I would have liked to have seen Curt Connors' family, adding to the dilemma of Peter Parker trying to stop the Lizard without harming him too much and made Connors more sympathetic. I also would have preferred to see more of a snout and be a raging beast: but Ifans is talented actor and it is good to see him in a Hollywood film. Ifans did have a great sinister delivery as The Lizard.<br/><br/>One more small criticism is some of the humour in the first half film which was weak, a little awkward and was topped off by comedy music. It was out of place for a film going for a more serious tone.<br/><br/>Danny Elfman did supply strong scores for the first two films, particular giving the series a signatory theme tone. Whilst James Horner's score for The Amazing Spider-man does not quite those heights he still gives the new series some good music that is dramatic, soaring and triumph when needed.<br/><br/>On the whole there are elements which The Amazing Spider-Man does improve upon the original Spider-Man whilst the original Spider-Man was better on other parts. If there was a way to blend both films together then you would properly get the perfect Spider-Man film."
"notstone","9","26","36","8 August 2012"," i loved it!
","I'll keep it simple. I loved this movie. Spiderman has been my favorite super hero since around 1983 when I got my first Spiderman action figure. This is the Spiderman movie I have been waiting for. Fine, it's a reboot, and everybody wants to compare it to the first series, but I don't care. I felt that the movie had just enough humor, cheese, drama and teenage angst and awkwardness. I liked that Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy actually had some chemistry. P.P. felt more believable as a teenager than in the first serious...and I dig that he made his own webbing rather than it just spitting out of his wrist. <br/><br/>The spidey suit was way cooler in this flick than the first series. It didn't look CGI throughout the whole movie like the originals. It's actually a dude in a suit. When he takes out his cell phone to talk to whoever, that's pretty hilarious. <br/><br/>It's got action, fun, adventure, a coming of age aspect, drama and cheese. It makes for a good film."
"jakeflowers1305","9","26","36","28 July 2012"," A Refreshing Restart for the Franchise.
","Whilst this film may not be the untold story it says it is, it's still a very well told story that I feel explores the past in a way previous Spider-man flicks have not, without spending too much time dwelling on the past.<br/><br/>The acting is far better than the previous Spider-man films. Andrew Garfield portrays the character of Peter Parker in the geeky way he should be portrayed, without being the full blown nerd that Toby Maguire came across as. In addition to this he's got a decent sense of humour too, making the film more enjoyable in parts for it's comedic value. Now I come to the absence of MJ. Sam Raimi's Spider-man films brought in many new fans for the franchise and made the hero more 'mainstream', meaning that many of those fans who aren't familiar with previous stories regarding the character would not realise that MJ didn't actually come into Peter's life until later. I think the absence of MJ was a good decision in terms of this film, not only because Gwen Stacy played an important role in his younger years but also because the whole Peter Parker/MJ thing in the previous films just got on my nerves (especially with MJ being as stuck up as she was). In addition to this, Emma Stone is a far better actress than Kirsten Dunst. Rhys Ifans is a great and well established British actor anyway so I don't need to go on and explain why he's another benefit to this film.<br/><br/>Now for the film itself, I thought the effects were superb. Especially when compared to those of Sam Raimi's films. The swinging looked far more realistic and the suit just looked cooler somehow, they were simple changes to the suit but they added up to make a very refreshing new look to the character. The film also seemed darker than previous incarnations of the superhero, not as dark as Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy but darker than some other Marvel films. Which I like and think could be good for this franchise, seeing as this film was a hundred times better than Sam Raimi's trilogy and left me eagerly anticipating a sequel (unlike its predecessors). The Lizard was a great choice of villain for this film, not only because it helped to tie in the storyline but also because if they'd chosen one of the more known Spider-man villains such as the Green Goblin or Doc-Oc there would have been no end of complaints from half-wits claiming they're just trying to copy Sam Raimi's renditions. Also, the effects for The Lizard were just splendid. I've heard a few people complaining that once the Lizard started showing up in the film that it was just silly and far-fetched, but they're the people who claim to know about Spider-man, yet know nothing beyond Sam Raimi's trilogy.<br/><br/>The only thing about this film that lets it down is the 'convenience' of the layout of the cranes throughout the city towards the end of the film. The film was going so well without any silly coincidences before then and the cranes had to go and ruin it. Still, I don't see this as too much of a bad thing, seeing as almost every film today has moments like these with most films being worse than this. So all in all I think Marc Webb and the gang have done a superb job on the Spider-man reboot. I just wish it did better at the Box-Office, because it deserves a $700+ million gross far more than its predecessors did."
"aharmas","8","24","33","8 July 2012"," Other than that lizard... it's very good
","Great previews usually lead to great movies, and there's a fantastic preview right before ""Spidey"". When I first heard about Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone heading this cast, I thought that it would be amazing. This film's previews looked great. Here's finally, the end product, and it's for the most part a fantastic movie, and the only criticism that we can come up with is that too bad it wasn't perfect, that the villain was well, not up to the rest of the story. Originally, the fear was that it was too soon to remake it; then you hope some good writer is part of the package (Argent) comes in, and we can see his touch, giving each of the central stars juicy lines to make them real, interesting, and endearing.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield is the best thing that could have happened to the franchise. His eyes are full of wonder, inquiring, able to convey a myriad of emotions in seconds, and his genuine chemistry with Stone certainly makes us care about what could happen to either one. She is not a typical damsel-in-distress, and here's a hero who can shed a few tears in the right place without looking insincere or stupid. This is particularly important in the early scenes involving the incident with his uncle, and his yearning for his long-lost father.<br/><br/>Yet the film is a lot of fun, specially in the learning stages of his newly-acquired powers, when he can't really understand what is happening to his body. ""Chronicle"" did this effectively, but there was always an impending sense of doom. Here's only our expectations about how powerful he might become, which leads to the point of his nemesis, a terrific looking being that is well, not very threatening, particularly in this summer, full of some terrific antagonists.<br/><br/>The special effects are fantastic, and New York hasn't looked this great in years. Watching Spiderman swing from building to building, and his little adventure in the sewer system of Gotham City is exciting. The best we can say is that here is another part that feels just right. If only Lizard Man's ego has been unleashed in the way that a few other egomaniacs have shown up recently. Remember the psychotic Joker, and that prince from another galaxy demanding respect from his ""new subjects""? I loved the claws, but if the best you can do is scratch people with it...? Back to Garfield's acting... This young man is one of the best things to come out of England/Hollywood recently. He can certainly carry a film and make it better and stronger than it might be. We want to continue seeing his adventures. Let's just give someone or something more terrifying and more threatening to go against next time.<br/><br/>**** out *****."
"spiderdan101","7","41","60","15 June 2013"," Great film, especially for spidey fans! Equal to Spiderman 2
","First off, Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Martin Sheen, Sally Field, and Dennis are all Perfect in their roles. This movie is very different from the original, except for the origins which can obviously not be changed. The action is what spidey fans have always dreamed off. The chemistry between peter and Gwen is priceless. New and interesting story lines are created to be explored through out the trilogy/saga. The new suit is great in my opinion, but it has been changed for the sequel, yet either way I like them both. Andrew Garfield's emotional scenes are unbelievable. Finally, I absolutely loved the humor. And the ending left me satisfied and happy, yet excited for what is yet to come. Overall, this is an origin that succeeds on many levels and out does the previous origin (which is still great) and only Spider-man 2 is equal in its acting, style, humor, action, and theme."
"camcrafton","10","44","65","15 December 2012"," Great reboot!!!
","""Spoiler Warning Just to be Safe!!!"" I liked the original three Spiderman films as much as anybody, if not more, but I really feel like they did an amazing job with this reboot. I may be in the minority, but I feel like this film did a great job at handling Peter's change from nerd to hero. Every character in this film felt human, and every actor did a fantastic job with their respective characters. A lot people keep comparing this to the original three films, and even more are saying that they should of just made a fourth film instead of reboot...I disagree. This film didn't reinvent the story, nor did it switch it up much but what it did do was make the characters more relatable and made this A lot closer to the comics, although it still isn't exactly like the comics. One of my main gripes about the original Spiderman film was a petty one, I'll admit that, but it got addressed and was fixed in this one. That would be the fact the Parker actually has to make his web shooters in this one whereas in the original the spider bite gave him his power to shoot webs. Now for the villain...while The Lizard obviously has nothing on The Green Goblin, I feel like he was a great choice for the film. While, yes Goblin is iconic, I feel that he should be the main focus in the movie he appears and not given a side role for over half the movie which they would of had to do in an origin story such as this one. A lot of people were upset about the CGI limiting The Lizar's movement,and I can honestly say it didn't bother me one bit. In fact I would prefer the CGI over some guy running around in a lizard costume...that wouldn't be very menacing now would it? In conclusion, I feel like this reboot was justified and in my humble and honest opinion proved to be BETTER than any of the original three Spiderman films, except for possibly the second one... Cannot wait for TSM2 to come out!"
"jaredclontz","10","34","49","28 July 2013"," better than the first ones
","I really enjoyed this movie. It brings new life to the franchise of THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN. It goes in great depth of how Peter Parker turns into SPIDERMAN. I mean it wasn't fake looking, like the high school looked as if it were real because in some movies you say that is nothing like how high school is like but it was portrayed very well. Then when he was making his web shooters you just saw all these blue prints and you saw him make. You can tell that this SPIDERMAN is closer to the one in the comics. Although the suit wasn't the same you can role with it. But the plot was well written and for once the girl friend was never kept hostage. The acting was really good Andrew Garfield is (29 or 30) Emma Stone is (24 or 25) in real life in there acting made you believe they were actually 17. There's a lot of kissing scenes but you know what who cares that is what makes you believe there young. The LIZARD was well done and everything made you think that this really could happen (cross genetics.) Screw the critics this is an awesome movie and if your a Spidey fan you will love it. P.S. They have really good songs chose too."
"supernatural136-112-438827","9","27","38","5 July 2012"," Really was Amazing
","I loved this movie. I know most of the reviews you're going to see will rebuke it just for being a reboot, no the original, but I have to say that I actually liked The Amazing Spiderman much better than the original. <br/><br/>First with the cast. I love, love, loved Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker. As a regular high school nerd talking with his crush, he managed to make the audience awkward for him, and thats something never explored by the first Spiderman. Overall, this movie was a much more accurate portrayal of what would happen if a teenage boy suddenly became a superhero. Emma Stone also impressed everyone as Spidey's new love interest Gwen Stacy, and she's a very much welcome replacement of Mary Jane Watson. The entire trilogy of Spiderman, and I think all Mary Jane did was scream and put on her best ""ahhhh, I'm captured"" face. Gwen Stacy is half the reason Spiderman triumphs in this movie, and wasn't once used as bait. <br/><br/>Secondly, the special effects. There's these two scenes, made even more amazing by the 3D, where the audience is actually seeing through Spiderman's eyes as he flies over the city. It's absolutely breathtaking. Most of the web-slinging scenes are beautifully made, but the other reviews are right when they say the action is not what it could have been. the Amazing Spiderman focused more on the characters than the original. It's more about why they do what they do and how they feel about it, not just about how they beat the bad guy. <br/><br/>In summary, I loved the reboot of the Spiderman franchise and can't wait for the next one. I give it a nine out of ten."
"japamo","10","32","46","26 November 2013"," The Amazing Peter Parker
","Initially, like many people, my knee-jerk response to ""The Amazing Spiderman"" (hereafter TAS) was ""unnecessary and redundant"". I felt that Tobey Maguire's interpretation on the famed arachnoid (and Peter Parker) was thoroughly satisfying and complete. Therefore, I didn't bother seeing TAS at the Cineplex. But recently on cable, Encore was periodically showing TAS and, eventually giving into my curiosity, sat down one Saturday morning to give TAS a chance. Now I wish I had seen TAS in the movie theatre. Although it covers the usual Spidey origin trajectory (nerdy but brainy loner, loving aunt/uncle, bite from genetically altered spider, subsequent infusion of powers and confidence, emergence of outlandish but deadly villain), I think TAS does a more touching, affecting, and dare I say it, grittily realistic depiction of Spiderman, and more importantly, Peter Parker.<br/><br/>Too often, superheroes eclipse their alter egos and give us the often mistaken impression that without their powers, they are nobodies (""Hero to Zero"", you might say). Many superhero movies seem to reflect that impression and somewhat rush the origin story so that we can get to the exciting hero as quickly as possible. I think Sam Raimi's ""Spiderman"" did that to some extent, acknowledging but accelerating Maguire's Peter Parker angst, sorrow, and alienation so that people didn't feel too down and could get to see their high-swinging, inspirational hero as soon as possible. Director Mark Webb's TAS takes more deliberate, measured time in revealing Spidey because I think he wants the audience to realize that Peter Parker is an amazing kid way before the fateful spider gets to him.<br/><br/>So instead of rushing through the tense high school drama to get to college, as Maguire's Parker did, Andrew Garfield's Parker remains in high school and emotionally, uncomfortably, but convincingly reminds us how harrowing that environment can be, especially to a reserved, sometimes inarticulate loner and orphan. And yet, Peter is far from pathetic. In TAS, he is a skilled photographer and skateboarder. He is also an accomplished science student, and he proves it when he deciphers his late parents' science papers, formulas, and algorithms, especially the missing formula that completes amputee Dr. Curtis Connor's (Rhys Ifans's) successful but horrifyingly reptilian tissue regeneration. Of course, unlike Maguire's Spidey's organic webs, Garfield's Parker devises the web fluid and dispensers himself. Furthermore, Garfield's Parker conducts extensive research to learn why, as a 4-year old (Max Charles), he was left with his uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field), and begins to uncover an intricate connection between his parents, Oscorp, and Dr. Connors (and a mysterious stranger).<br/><br/>Garfield, however, is careful not to make Parker into a perfect goody-goody. Perhaps because of his ""abandonment"" by his parents, Parker has rebellious, mischievous tendencies that would lure him into juvenile delinquency if not for his uncle/aunt and a potential love interest, Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). Parker can also be irresponsible, spiteful, and distracted, which leads to that life-altering, emotionally shattering family tragedy involving Uncle Ben. Although basically polite and respectful, Parker manages to antagonize and disconcert Gwen's father, Police Captain Stacy (Denis Leary) who (like Daily Bugle newspaper publisher J. Jonah Jameson in Raimi's film), considers Spiderman a selfish, dangerous vigilante, despite Parker's earnest protests.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I think Parker earns the audiences admiration as he begins to rise above his shortcomings and use his natural talents (with a little help with his spider powers) to balance, juggle, and reconcile his personal, romantic, and ""professional"" problems. In fact, I believe that Parker is such an intriguing character on his own, the movie would still be involving and entertaining even if Parker tackled his problems without his powers. As Uncle Ben's posthumous voicemail on Parker's cell phone mentions, Peter was always destined for great things. The spider powers just make his life a little more interesting.<br/><br/>P.S.: Commenting upon the Lizard's appearance in the movie, I personally had no complaints. As a cross between a Komodo dragon and the Hulk, the Lizard sported a too-human face, according to some detractors. I think that was essential to convey the Lizard's/Dr. Connors latent, if somewhat misguided, humanity and his final, merciful treatment of Parker/Spiderman. If the Lizard had had to speak and show his feelings with a snout like, say, a Velociraptor, I think it would have less effective, and even a bit laughable."

I still thought that Andrew garfield would do a good job in the movie or at least justice to the spider-man character but he too seemed lost in the school (He is only 28years old) Why did peter and gwen need to go to a school school which occupies half of Manhattan ? as if that is possible in NY.<br/><br/>Dr. Connors seemed deranged more than seeming like a genius. when you see a Marvel movie you expect the villain to display a lot of shades of grey and here we had an antagonist who seemed to be obsessed with improving mankind of all its weakness.<br/><br/>our dear Dr. Norman Osborn seemed to be dying in the movie (God save the green goblin, what are we going to do in the sequel if the green goblin is not saved !!!) Irfan khan was visiting from the sets of MIB4 or maybe 5 he seems better suited there and not as a scientist dressed in all black.<br/><br/>Peter's parents have a small side track which is left unexplained that it leaves viewers perplexed as to why did we just waste 20 minutes talking about them !!!

","The Amazing Spider-Man is supposed to be a reboot of the Spider-Man movie franchise. Tobey Maguire is replaced by Andrew Garfield in the protagonist role of Peter Parker. His main love interest switches from Mary-Jane Watson to Gwen Stacy, and the villain in this installment is Dr Curt Connors aka Lizard. As expected, this reboot goes back to the beginning when Peter Parker becomes Spider-Man only it is told in a rather different way to the 2002 movie. This time they also try to add a bit more character oriented storyline.<br/><br/>Is it a good movie? Yes, particularly since I saw this movie in IMAX. This made the action scenes more exciting to watch. It also uses a villain that hasn't been used in the previous movies so at least it does make it different from the previous movies.<br/><br/>Is it a successful reboot of the franchise? In my opinion, not really. It's been five years since the last Spider-Man movie came out, and ten years since the movie franchise was first introduced. Even when they made the announcement of this movie being made, I was questioning it because it's just too soon to make a reboot. For the same reason, this reboot is not refreshing. Without trying to give anything away, you can recognise that this movie takes some of the elements from the 2002 movie. The character oriented storyline doesn't add that much meat to the character of Peter Parker as its supposed to. Its easier to count this as another installment only with different actors playing the roles.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the first three Spider-Man movies, and yes that includes Spider-Man 3. This new Spider-Man movie is also enjoyable but it fails to refresh the series. It seems that I was right in thinking that its too soon to do so."

","Spider-Man is my favorite super-hero of all time. I've read the comics (mostly the Ultimate comics, but some of the 60's comics as well), played some of the video games, and watched the cartoons (The 1994 and 2008 series being some of my favorite animated shows of all time).<br/><br/>I enjoyed Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy (yes, even Spider-Man 3). When I heard that the series was being rebooted, I wasn't happy to hear about it. My expectations were neutral as time went by and when I walked out the theater, my expectations were blown away.<br/><br/>I don't want to compare this movie to the original trilogy, but I think it's necessary to see where this movie improved from the originals.<br/><br/>Let's start with the casting. Andrew Garfield is a great successor to Tobey Maguire. I can really relate to him like I always do with other incarnations of the web slinger. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy is even better than Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson. Gwen is a much stronger character and the chemistry between her and Garfield as Peter Parker is believable. Rhys Ifans is great as Doctor Connors (a.k.a. The Lizard) and I like how he is a ""Jekyll and Hyde""-type of villain (kind of like a few other villains... yeah). Martin Sheen and Sally Field as Uncle Ben and Aunt May, respectively, are also great as well. All the characters are portrayed very well and are believable.<br/><br/>The visual effects and the action scenes are good as usual, but nothing new.<br/><br/>The musical score by James Horner is also great, although I prefer Danny Elfman's score in the original trilogy because they felt more memorable and left a lasting impression. But, who knows? James Horner's score may grow on me over time.<br/><br/>If I have to name some complaints, it would have to be that some parts were rushed (although it's a minor nitpick) as well as a couple of parts not evaluated much. I think an extended cut of the movie would be necessary when it's released on DVD, but that's just me.<br/><br/>Overall, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a fresh new start on the franchise. It has superb acting, thrilling action scenes (especially the climax), an amazing score, and being faithful to the comics but at the same time taking liberties to make it more interesting. Best Spidey movie ever? It's too early to tell but maybe. It's definitely worth watching and I am looking forward to the sequel."

"sherring8290","8","24","34","15 July 2012"," The Amazing Spider-Man is just short of amazing
","This is a new origin tale of Spider-Man and how he came to be. Rather than action driven sequences, The Amazing Spider-Man consistently uses the strengths of its actors to create a compelling story and characters the audience cares about. Columbia pictures not only told me we are indeed ready to re-visit Spider-Man's Universe, but ready to finally do it right in the process.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man takes us on the journey of Peter Parker, a bullied, self-classified science nerd. On an uninvited trip to Oscorp in attempt to discover more about his perished father, Peter gets bitten by a genetically enhanced spider. After this event everything changes. It's a familiar story to those who have seen the original Spider-Man trilogy, but how this story is told is what makes it different. Almost two thirds of the entire film is dedicated to character development and it sure paid off.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield plays Peter Parker in this reinterpretation to the world of Spider-Man, and he couldn't be a better fit. Not only does he simply fit the suit better, he adds a level of emotion and comedy that Tobey Maguire severely lacked. The Spider-Man of the comic books was sassy during fights, spouting off insults and egging his opponents on; The Amazing Spider-Man nailed the character perfectly.<br/><br/>Emma Stone plays Gwen Stacy, a science wiz intern at Oscorp, and Peter's love interest. She does an excellent job of stealing the spotlight while on screen and remaining an afterthought while off of it. One scene in particular I enjoyed was the first time Gwen and Peter try to set up a date. Their innocence and insecurity is highlighted as they fumble for words which provided not only humor but a chance for the audience to connect with both leading characters.<br/><br/>Rhys Ifans plays Dr. Curt Connors, a top scientist at Oscorp studying cross genetic mutation, and ironically ""The Lizard"" as well. This was one character that I felt lacked in some areas. As a scientist Ifans nails it; he shows absolute interest in the studies and even possesses the personal goal of re-growing his right arm. Where the character falls apart is when the Lizard is introduced. After a certain point his goal completely changed: he was no longer about the science but purely selfish.<br/><br/>Other actors that gave excellent performances are Dennis Leary as Captain Stacy, Martin Sheen as Uncle Ben, and Sally Field as Aunt May. Their performances were over shadowed by the main three but I felt they deserved a mention.<br/><br/>Villains are a huge part to any super hero movie or comic and unfortunately this is the one area I feel this film falters. The lizard just didn't do it for me; he isn't the evil villain many including myself were hoping for. A scientist trying to cure his own ailment turned evil, which was not well explained causing a small hole in the plot.<br/><br/>The writers of The Amazing Spider-Man are clearly avid fans of the comic books and the accuracy of details really paid off. Attention to details like the fact Spider-Man made his web slingers (he did not possess the ability internally as shown in the original Spider-Man films) really increased the likability of the characters and script.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man is just short of amazing, which is no small feat for the folks at Columbia Pictures. Should this film be the success it is expected to be, sequels will no doubt come, and frankly I can't wait. This film not only left me wanting more but revitalized my faith in the genre. Oh, don't forget to stay for the credits! There is a short clip giving hints of what's to come.<br/><br/>see more reviews at http://www.thosetwoguysonline.com"
"ForTwentyYears","8","24","34","8 July 2012"," The Amazing Spider-Man was amazing.
","Perhaps it is because I'm not an needlessly cynical old man lacking a sense of humour, but many reviews I've read are unfair. <br/><br/>I just got back from the cinema, and I was so so so surprised by the awesomeness of this movie. I remember enjoying the first Spider-Man but this just completely blew that out of the water. <br/><br/>Firstly, I think I laughed more at this film than most comedy movies. I was literally in hysterics at some of it - as was everyone else in the cinema. Namely, the part where a robber gets out a knife and Spider-Man cowers on the floor saying sarcastically something like ""oh no you found my weakness - it's small knives"" before whipping up and shooting his badass webs at the dude. Oh god I laughed so much. And this part where he first gets bitten, comes home, proclaims he is hungry and proceeds to taking an armful of /frozen/ food upstairs while his aunt an uncle just stand there looking utterly confused. Honestly it was just hilarious. When he wakes up in the morning and practically demolishes his bathroom and all the doors. After kissing his girlfriend ""I'm going to throw you out of the window now."" ""Wha-?"" SMASH! Hahaha. Sarcastic protagonists make every film better. I want to see it all again! <br/><br/>The story was also good, I liked the way the webs didn't just blast out of his fingers without reason but instead he created them from wires. And the whole sci-fi aspect was really interesting. It was a great curveball that Connors didn't actually start out evil but in fact it was almost Peter's fault he turned all lizard-y. There were also some really emotional parts, and I won't say I didn't cry because the development and everything just made them tenfold more heart-wrenching! I also thought it was good that they kept the human aspect of the superhero - he get's injured and he feels pain which, to me, isn't a weakness it's just inevitability. <br/><br/>ACTORS. Oh my god. They were all epic as hell. Garfield was just amazing, it was a completely different role from The Social Network and yet he slotted into it so naturally. He got the emotion, connection, humour and just everything down to a T. Emma Stone was also beautifully flirty and awesome. I was glad she wasn't the usual whiny, helpless female sidekick. Every single actor was FLAWLESS.<br/><br/>The visuals were also very aesthetically pleasing. Camera angles and scenes which made the 3D aspect perfect. I'm also very happy that they didn't go down the whole ""OMG CRAM IT FULL OF CGI AND DAZZLING MONSTERS SO THEY DON'T NOTICE THE CRAPPY PLOT L0L"" route.<br/><br/>My only downside is the backstory which didn't fit together or wasn't fully explained in some parts, but it didn't really matter because the rest was so satisfying. I've seen people say Parker and Spider-Man were too different in personality, but honestly did they not catch the ""your boyfriend is a man of many masks"" part? Or the part with the kid where he wears the mask and it makes him brave? It's obviously like bravado. At least, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Oh I absolutely loved the ending, when he breaks up with Gwen because of the promise. Then when he comes into class late and promises never to be late again, to which the teacher replies ""Peter, don't make promises you can't keep"" and as he sits down behind Gwen he whispers ""but those are the best kind.""<br/><br/>To conclude, it was a wonderful entertaining movie which I thoroughly enjoyed. Ignore the whiny negative reviews!"
"christopher-tucker74","9","24","34","8 July 2012"," A great reboot for a true Spiderman fan!!!
","I saw The Amazing Spiderman 3 days ago now, I did not want to write on something without really taking time to digest what I saw in the theatre. <br/><br/>Is this movie perfect? No it is not. However it is very close.<br/><br/>As people keep comparing the Rami series to this new one I will tell you why it is a great movie buy itself then go into why it is better overall than the other three.<br/><br/>First, Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone played their respective roles perfectly. It is like they somehow pulled the characters right out of the comics and brought them to life. And the chemistry between them right on (the subtle way that love creeps up and your not really sure how to act or what to say) Andrew Shows a true Peter Parker and a true Spiderman with all his banter at the bad-guys and himself. Sally Field and Martin Sheen are a true looking Aunt and uncle that have taken the role of parent (I have a friend living in the same circumstance ) and shown what it is really like. The scene in the house when they fight is very touching and makes uncle Ben's' death more hart breaking. <br/><br/>Second, showing how peter figures out his powers was okay I didn't really like the football scene with the post bending (that was a little too much even for me) However the skateboarding to show how he has infinitely better balance and agility was a nice touch.<br/><br/>Third, The villain was not great CGI and a bit rushed in making, however the fight scenes where very entertaining. Doc Connors was shown as a man divided my moral and personal choices and I would have liked to have seen more between him and Rajit Ratha. <br/><br/>Oh and as my son is reading over my shoulder I have to put in he thought it was really funny through the whole movie<br/><br/>Okay now for the comparison. <br/><br/>People are complaining about No J.J, To bad J.J is not Spiderman nor was he in the Origin of Spiderman he comes in later on when he needs a job.<br/><br/>Gwen Stacy is no Mary Jane. Of course not THEY ARE DIFFERENT Gwen is Peters first true love and Mary Jane comes later after her death. Gwen is Peters Intellectual equal and loves Peter for Peter. Mary-Jane Loves Peter cause he is Spiderman <br/><br/>Toby vs Andrew - Andrew hands down, Toby is a brooding teen that nobody notices. This is not Peter Parker. Peter is a genus in is own right who tries to do the right thing based on the positive upbringing he had by his aunt and uncle and Andrew portrays this well.<br/><br/>Okay and here is the Main reason why I liked this one better. It was not as campy (yes there is campy and then there is Rami campy) Rami's Spiderman was swimming in campy from the really bad Goblin suit to the overall tone of the film and let us not forget the landlord (that was a wast of time to sit through)<br/><br/>This Spiderman brings us back to what Spiderman is about, trying to do the right thing but not always doing it right. And finding your way in a world that is very complicated. Are there plot holes and a few things that could be better sure, what movie is perfect (Except The Godfather) <br/><br/>Now Spiderman 2 was a great movie but that was cause of the villains in it."
"JamesAlexRandles","9","27","39","20 May 2014"," Why it's better than Rami's Spidey series
","The Amazing Spider-Man came out in 2012, but I only saw it about a year after it's release, but before Amazing Spider-Man 2 came out in theaters. I enjoyed Andrew Garfield allot more than Tobey Maguire's performance as both Peter Parker and Spider-Man. Andrew had the wise crack of Spider-Man because if you read the comics or watch any of the cartoons, you'll see Spider-Man as a wise cracker and as Peter Parker, he has nerdy, but he is more than just a nerd. He was also a teenager who had friends. Emma Stone was a much better romantic lead than Kristen Dunst. And I thought the action was much better than the first Spider-Man. Overall, I give The Amazing Spider-Man a 9 out of 10, a fantastic movie."
"robzilla915","10","27","39","15 July 2013"," Best Spiderman yet!!
","Okay, I had high expectations for this movie, and let me say that it exceeded those expectations. The story is perfectly done, the cast played there parts very well (especially Garfield and Stone ), the action was very well done and the score is absolutely astonishing. Seeing this made me excited for the sequels coming in the future. I can tell that the ""Amazing Spiderman"" movies will continue to get better and better. I am loving the different take on Spiderman. Andrew Garfield is the perfect choice for Spiderman. Now don't get me wrong, Tobey Maguire was a good Spiderman, but there was several things wrong with him. 1. Was his size. He was just too buff to be Spiderman. I know this is a stupid reason, but it's a reason none the less. 2. His tone was too monotone at most points. Those are just a few. Garfield embodied all that was needed to be Spiderman. Now, as everyone should have been able to tell, the cast had incredible chemistry with each other. Not saying the cast of Raimi's trilogy didn't have chemistry with each other, but the cast in this movie just worked and flowed with each other. That is one of the key things in making a movie."
"troy-manatunga","8","27","39","27 November 2012"," Super!
","Let's begin on a positive note shall we?<br/><br/>THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN 2 is been booked for release for the 2nd of May 2014. Marc Webb is indeed spinning this web absolutely stylishly as the viewers want it to be. Personally this reinvention comes too soon to the wide screen following the Tobey Maguire trilogy that unfolded in 2002.<br/><br/>The base behind the reinvention of one of marvels greatest superheroes isn't a complex algorithm as the one created by Peter Parker himself in THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN. It is referred to as the filming industry and if the financial potential is great why not make an extra buck? It would not come as a surprise to see Christian Bale hand down the cape to another crusader even as Nolan wraps up BATMAN.<br/><br/>Created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko in 1962 and as cleverly done by Raimi before, THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN is a differently narrated story of Peter Parker. As in the past his super powers are a result of a nasty bite from a radioactive happy spider and he is brought up under the guardianship of Aunty May and Uncle Ben. This is the only similarity one may draw from the Raimi Trilogy every frame of the movie from that point forward is a new spidey experience.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield is trusted with the daunting challenge of filling into the spidey suit from Toby Maguire. It has been a few years since and the old spidey isn't a neither forgotten nor lost memory apart from the 3rd movie that clearly lost its way (sorry Raimi fans, but you know it's true!). Lanky and tall Andrew is the skinny kid who wakes up to find him evolving into something greater. Loyal to the original comics (That I have owned myself) created by Lee and Ditko, Garfield strikes when the iron is hot with a lovable underdog that is Peter Parker. Outgoes the clueless girl from next door (AKA Mary J Watson) and enters college girl Gwen Stacey. Unlike the Peter Jane love story of 2002 the 2012 version of the Peter Gwen Chemistry is more often sidelined to allow time for Spiderman to try and save the day. This may come as a disappointment to some however this works in the benefit of the superhero. So do not expect the famous upside down kiss this time round folks, it ain't gonna happen! <br/><br/>Norman Osborne and the Green Goblin is retired. The Lizard takes center stage as the new nemesis. Whilst Nano technology and providing weapons to the military was the business of Oscorp industries back then, this time it is a more noble cause that leads to destructions much like in THE RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES. Dr.Connors is working on a formula to find a breakthrough in medicine. Dr.Connors connection and history with Peters father draw light to certain lose ends that Raimi failed to tie up in his trilogy. The fans will absolutely be thrilled with this exposure of Peters Past.<br/><br/>THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN is an action filled extravaganza. It does miss out on certain trademarks such as ""With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility"" etc, instead it falls back to basics of the comics itself. Webb picked up on minute details of the superhero that Raimi skipped to iterate on. The webbing device was originally written by Lee and Ditko as a Parker creation and this is honored in THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN. A must watch movie of 2012 and is on par with the 2002 production. The obvious question I need to answer is what movie I prefer better. To me THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN tops the predecessor by a minimum of a half start rating. Why? Simply because there is more Spiderman and much less Peter Parker.<br/><br/>TITLE: THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN DIRECTED BY: MARC WEBB STARRING: ANDREW GARFIELD, EMMA STONE and RHYS IFANS RATED: PG13 RATING: 08/10 RUNTIME: 136 MINUTES"

I am tired of comic book movies. The comic book movie has become the seen it done it before with the same old C G I effects. However, I went to see the Amazing Spider-Man because people keep saying Mike you got to see this film. After avoiding Spider-man over the summer I finally saw it. What a great film. Spider-Man is a great film because the movie is excellently direct were the old story is excellent told with new twists. The actors blend the character development into the story perfectly. Martin Sheen played a perfect Uncle Ben. The 3 D effect added to the C G I and give a new excitement to the usual special effects. The same old story told in a better way. I give The Amazing Spider-Man a nine out of ten."

"Hellmant","10","25","36","6 July 2012"," The 'BATMAN BEGINS' of Spider-Man films, I'd go as far as to say it's amazing!
","'THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN': Five Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>The 'BATMAN BEGINS' of Spider-Man films, this reboot to Sam Raimi's blockbuster trilogy doesn't disappoint and I'd go as far as to say it's amazing! Director Marc Webb (who made his debut with 2009's critically acclaimed hit '(500) DAYS OF SUMMER') takes over the franchise with Andrew Garfield (of 'THE SOCIAL NETWORK' fame) replacing Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker, a.k.a. Spider-Man. The film was written by James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent (who also co-wrote 'SPIDER-MAN 2' and '3') and Steve Kloves (who wrote every 'HARRY POTTER' film). This film focuses entirely on Peter's high school years while he learns to first develop his powers as well as cope with the disappearance of his parents and who his father really was (unlike the original Sam Raimi film). It's also a little more faithful to the comic, in some ways, by having Parker develop artificial web-shooters that he uses to swing around on, rather than being able to produce them physically as part of his super powers. It also goes back to having Gwen Stacy (his original love interest from the comics) as the object of his affection rather than Mary Jane (like the Raimi films). Gwen is played beautifully by 'it girl' Emma Stone (the object of Jim Carrey's obsession). The movie, despite treading on some old ground, is thoroughly entertaining and powerfully well made. <br/><br/>This story begins with Peter as a young boy (Max Charles) being left in the care of his Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field) by his parents (Campbell Scott and Embeth Davidtz), who disappear without ever being heard from again. Peter grows up to be a somewhat awkward teen (Garfield, who's way too old to play a teen) but is much cooler than Parker probably should be; he rides a skateboard and actually flirts (successfully) with his high school crush Gwen Stacy (Stone). One day he finds his father's old briefcase which leads him to seek out his father's old associate, a scientist by the name of Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans). Gwen actually works at Oscorp with Connors, which is where Parker stumbles into a lab experimenting on genetically modified spiders and is bit by one. He of course develops spider like powers and when his Uncle is killed makes it his mission to fight crime and get revenge. In this film he must deal with Dr. Connors' alter ego, the genetically mutated monster 'The Lizard' (which is the first time the classic Spider-Man villain has graced the silver screen), as well as the police, lead by Gwen's father Captain Stacy (Denis Leary).<br/><br/>The movie does go over a lot of the same plot points as the original Sam Raimi hit but it delves a little more deeper in to them. I thought the first two 'SPIDER-MAN' films had a great amount of emotional drama and character development (which is why they're two of my favorite films) but this installment manages to outdo them. It really gets in to the character of Peter Parker, on a relatable level to almost every high school nerd (present or past) and Garfield plays him amazingly. I thought Maguire was about as good a Spider-Man as they could have casted but somehow Garfield manages to outdo him, mostly with passion for the role (he says he cried the first time he put on the costume). Stone is a little cuter and more adorable than Kirsten Dunst, I wouldn't say she's a better actress but it's definitely easier to fall for her character than Mary Jane's (due to Stone's likability). Sheen and Field are classic like always and Ifans makes a memorable insane villain. The acting is definitely a little better in this film but the script is also smarter and more complex and Webb's direction is impressively fitting. I wouldn't say he's as good a director as Sam Raimi but it's nice to see a different take on the series. Besides all the material that's already been done there's definitely enough new stuff to make the film interesting and thrilling. I'd say it's a better reboot film than 'BATMAN BEGINS' even, it's no 'THE DARK KNIGHT' but it is better than Nolan's original Batman film. If you're a fan of the series or the character (and Spider-Man is my favorite superhero) you're sure to be thrilled.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhcS7Q-CkYE"
"ashecatlin","9","7","8","12 July 2019"," Damn near perfect
","This gets a lot of stick for being an unnecessary reboot and that would be the case if it wasn't so damn good.<br/><br/>There is a lot going for this movie, everyone in the cast bounces off each other perfectly. The dynamic between Gwen and Pete was on point, it even brought the feels that I don't usually get. You can tell that they had good chemistry from the point they were introduced to each other, same goes for Pete and Captain Stacey wow. The dynamic was very interested, they actually had good reason to include him instead of shoehorning him into the story. I also love Martin Sheen, I actually forgot he was Martin Sheen and was just immersed by his performance of Uncle Ben. Massive props to Rhys Ifans, not only can he act but he can emote perfectly you can tell what he is thinking with his even having to say anything that was bloody good casting!<br/><br/>I'd say that this is the best looking Spider-Man movie, yes that's included the recent Far From Home. For a start this isn't crammed with CGI, yes that is how the Lizard is done but the suit was actually made and looks great. That POV shot of him in the costume first is just amazing, the fight between him and the lizard was epic."
"krissaddy","10","23","33","3 July 2012"," Thoroughly entertaining, but still the second best....
","I had the opportunity of watching this movie on the second day of its release on this Saturday. Nearly 4 days before the actual US release.<br/><br/>Firstly lets leave the whole, ""Oh! its a reboot and not a sequel"" thing outside the door. Its something the industrial analysts must be bothered about. As an audience it does not matter to me. I just want a movie to be entertaining and this movie is really better than the first Spiderman movie. This movie is getting unfair treatment as its a reboot. This movie should be judged by its own merit and not by comparisons. <br/><br/>I consider myself blessed and entertained.... This may not be one of the jump-the-gun fast paced superhero flicks, it takes it time to establish the characters. Even the character development is done is a beautiful and entertaining way. I though this was much needed as people were already used to Spider man story and the mentality needed to change and realize that ""Its not the same deal anymore"". That was necessary and it was done perfectly. If you have seen 500 Days of Summer, you know that Marc Webb is good at directing romantic scenes, he has used this skill to his advantage and he has done a great job of showing the romance between Gwen Stacy and Peter Parker... <br/><br/>When it comes to performances, Andrew Garfield gets full points for being the best spider man in town... Not only does he look like spider man from the comics, his character was bratty and more vibrant than the ""Toby Maguire spidy"" which I really liked. Andrew is a good actor. I have always liked him since I first saw Boy A, thankfully he didn't fade into the void, Emma Watson playing Gwen Stacy the love interest of Spiderman really hit the bulls-eye. She looks gorgeous and lovable and she fits the role like a glove. The chemistry between the two is one of the high points of the movie... They look amazing together. Its a pity that Uncle Ben had to die in this movie, Martin Sheen fit the bill. The others did their job well. Its a better acted movie than all the first three Spidy movies. The second half of the movie is action packed with some tangible human spirit imbibed into it. There is one particular scene towards the end when Spidy is gravely hurt and the whole city comes to his rescue. It reminded me of brilliant ""train scene"" in Spider man 2, which is also my top spidy moment ever. Lizard as the villain was not as menacing as the previous bad guys in the Spider man Series, but a lot of the story is open for continuity and more villains are sure to follow. Also Lizard was not actually supposed to be menacing as he is still a good man gone bad due to a lab experiment gone wrong. <br/><br/>Finally I would have to point out that this movie is made in 3D and they took advantage of our Superhero's maneuverability to a great extent. Some of the first person shots are breathtaking and feels like you are there with Spidy all the way. <br/><br/>I would say this is my second favorite Spider man Movie after Spider Man 2. Its a slow movie no doubt but establishes the characters properly once it gets going it gets more entertaining. I am more than sure that the sequel will ""Go for it!"" from the start. A must watch movie for all Spider man fans. Truly ""Amazing""! Marc Webb Good job!"
"jkb851","8","26","38","12 August 2013"," My generations quintessential teenager life story, that is the iconic Spiderman
","Many years ago, Stan Lee crafted a story with, perhaps the worlds most beloved superhero. Spiderman is the story of Peter Parkers life. It's the quintessential story capturing all essences of humanity, loss and life. A must for anyone human being to empathise with. The story of a teenager, not extremely social (who really), smart, bullied, has to suffer loss of family (his uncle) and is to be how you want to.<br/><br/>This interpretation of that beloved story is brilliant! The direction is brilliant, soundtrack is great in my opinion and Andrew Garfield makes a fantastic Peter Parker, and his performance is well complimented with all the other likable cast.<br/><br/>Even with it's drawbacks, the movie is great fun! :)"
"samuellop10","9","26","38","27 July 2012"," Refreshing, entertaining, and engaging all throughout!
","First, the thing that most impressed me about The Amazing Spider-man was its storytelling. If you think about it, it is actually pretty simple, but I thought that it was very effective nonetheless. The characters and sequence of events including the action sequences as well as emotional ones were what made up most of it. <br/><br/>Second, the characters had more than enough depth and most of them were not your typical stereotypes. Andrew Garfield made for one interesting Peter Parker/Spider-man. He was great at bringing him out. He made for one weird Spider-man which was something refreshing. Awkward all around, yet decisive, agile, and funny. Unknowingly helping the villain, then obtaining his powers, and a little time later trying to stop him; all the while experiencing and dealing with human emotions. From the comments I have read, this is the Spider-man from the comic books. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy was refreshing to see as well. I liked that this time around the love interest got more involved in helping the hero stop the villain. It made the story more layered and interesting. She was appealing and charming. The chemistry between them, by the way, was great. Probably the best chemistry I have seen between a hero and his love interest. Dr. Connors made for a great villain. Evil, but at the same time being able to show and keep his human side. The rest of the actors, Denis Leary as Captain Stacy, Sally Field as aunt May, and Martin Sheen as uncle Ben did awesome jobs as well. Even though they did not get as much screen time, they were great supporting actors who made the film more interesting and entertaining. <br/><br/>Third, if you were expecting for the film to surpass the previous one, you will most-likely, at least, be satisfied. Like 99.9% most-likely. The Spider-man character was different, but without a doubt better. The love interest, Gwen Stacy this time, was definitely better also. In one phrase, she totally kicks MJ's butt, at least in the movies. I would not know about it in the comic books. The villain, Dr. Connors a.k.a. The Lizard, did not surpass the Green Goblin in his evilness, but it made for a more complicated and exciting plot and challenge for Spider-man. Other things like the visuals, directing, and special effects, especially thanks to the 3D, were better as well this time around. Story-wise, this time it was more complicated and layered, but executed with simplicity, which only helped the film in making it more engaging and entertaining. So years ago when Peter Parker was only a child, his parents went away and left him in the care of his aunt May and uncle Ben. A briefcase which Peter's dad left behind is discovered. It includes sensitive information about a biological project involving splicing reptile DNA and its properties with human one, which works to regenerate the human body; Dr. Connors is mentioned within it. Later Peter discovers that Gwen is working with Dr. Connors in his lab, and he also finds out that Dr. Connors is still trying to solve part of the project to finalize it. Then Peter sees that the solution is among the papers in the briefcase, and he shares the solution with Dr. Connors. Unfortunately Dr. Connors uses it on himself without enough research and trails, bringing side effects to himself such as super-strength, physical deformation, and a distorted state of mind. It is a temporal thing, working only as long as the regenerative effects last, but, after experiencing the strength and its power, he can not let it go, and convinces himself that this this is the perfect state for humans. So he starts this by trying to make all of the city like him. After Peter sees him and what he is capable of, he takes responsibility of it, thinking that he should because he helped to solve the project, and thus helped turn Dr. Connors into The Lizard. During the same time Gwen and Peter become closer, more than just friends. And she also becomes closely involved in trying to stop The Lizard from transforming all of the city. While this is happening Peter has also to deal trying to hide his secret from his aunt and uncle, and escaping from the police who have branded him a criminal, especially Gwen's dad, Captain Stacy. <br/><br/>The film seemed a little slow at times, and when it was done it felt like a short movie, which is totally inaccurate as the film runs a little over two hours. For me this just means that the film was so good it kept me engaged all throughout it, so I did not think about the time. <br/><br/>If you analyze it, It might not be the most packed and intense action superhero movie out there, however, not having the most intense in those things does not necessarily make it boring or bad. When there is no action to make it intense, the film is still very entertaining and interesting. Plus, for me characters and story lines are more important. The reason is that when there is no intense action on screen is when the story and characters develop. So when the action does happen it is made more intense not because it is actually intense, but because you are more engrossed in the story and because you care more about the characters due to those times in the film when there is no action. And this is exactly what The Amazing Spider- man does."
"famu97","8","26","38","10 July 2012"," Perfect Blend of story/plot, good acting, & fight scenes w/Bad Guy
","Man that's an excellent movie. The acting is so much better than the original Spiderman movies with Tobey Maguire. The new Peter Parker is 10 x's a better actor than Tobey Maguire. I enjoyed the Avengers movie but the Amazing Spiderman's plot works much better to me and the story-line just seems to pulls you along effortlessly and keeps you intrigued and interested at the same time. It's the great blend of story/plot, good acting, and action-adventure and fight scenes with the bad guy. As far as comic book movies go, this is one of the better ones. I think it's most definitely better than the last two Spiderman movies and probably better than the first one but not by too much.<br/><br/>It is worth the price of admission to watch this movie and it would be a great movie to take your kids since their isn't anything crazy happening in this movie."

My 9 year old also came out thinking this is the best spider-man film yet, trumping the Sam Raimi ones, which while excellent didn't have the same amount of 'soul' for me. <br/><br/>My best friend and his wife didn't want to watch this due to the negativity surrounding it, which is a real shame as I think they have missed out on a real gem. <br/><br/>A 9 from me, the average of mine and my son's rating. :)<br/><br/>P.S.

"corneliussenespen","6","36","55","19 October 2012"," One of the best adaptations.
","Having realized I'm a sucker for all these comic book adaptations, of course I had to see this one as well. I never did like the earlier Spiderman movies, being the main role or the supporting ones, I'm not sure; but they still stand among the movies I'm not eager to watch again. But this one, on the contrary, was actually quite entertaining. Not was it only packed with really great CGI, but it had a great flow built up on both action, drama, romance and humor.<br/><br/>At least for me this is what makes a good movie. I never once thought ""Oh, my goodness that was lame"" (which I often actually do), instead I was rather surprised I was laughing out loud in more than one of the scenes.<br/><br/>All the actors did a MARVELous job, meaning all the jokes, the depth of the drama, and the sincerity of both the romance and the action stood solid throughout the movie. Speaking of the actors: the casting was brilliant. All of the main actors (and I guess most of the supporting ones) was perfect for their roles, and must have made the script it self proud."
"smallasianman","6","245","431","19 June 2012"," Webb Not Strong Enough
","The Amazing Spider-Man begins with Peter Parker in high school. Though an amateur photographer, Peter's main interest is science - and he bluffs his way into an audience with his deceased father's ex-partner Dr Curt Connors. After impressing Connors with his knowledge of cross- species genetics, Peter enters a classified area and is bitten by a mutated spider. As his powers and secret identity develop, so too does his relationship with Connors protégé, and Parker's classmate, Gwen Stacey. But when the desperate Connors attempts to fight his personal weaknesses using the same untested method, he undergoes a more disastrous transformation into ""The Lizard"", a creature with a twisted view of how best to 'cure' humanity.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man's origin story is undoubtedly an improvement on Raimi's Spider-Man, a decade prior. The characterisation is a lot more realistic, which makes it easier for the audience to feel Parker's teenage pain, awkwardness and ultimate escapism when he dons the guise of Spider-Man. Emma Stone's Gwen Stacey is also a welcome replacement for Mary-Jane, who's sole purpose in Raimi's films was either to moan or scream. Stacey by contrast, is an intelligent character in her own right, who doesn't shy away from getting her hands dirty when Spider- Man's in trouble. Rhys Ifans portrayal of Curt Connors has the same Jekyllian vulnerability seen in Mark Ruffallo's Bruce Banner earlier this year, although his motives are distorted somewhat as the film progresses.<br/><br/>However, such interesting character development unfortunately does not hold together perfectly with the action. Of course, Spider-Man is foremost a movie that has to entertain; yet the cocky web-slinging CGI hero seems too unlike Garfield's brooding Peter Parker. The quality of the special effects is largely inconsistent, with POV scenes of Spider- Man diving around the city impressing greatly, whilst his actual battles with The Lizard are considerably less ambitious. The weighty retelling of Parker's familiar back-story also means that during the dénouement several large plot points, which could have expanded the action, are left undeveloped – and so the ending is a little too simple and unsatisfactory.<br/><br/>Webb has successfully addressed the new demand for superhero movies to be deeper and more human; yet he is not a director adept at providing big-budget action to an audience in the same way as Joss Whedon or Christopher Nolan. The Amazing Spider-Man is therefore the sum of two films, a satisfactory coming-of-age movie and an unchallenging action film. Unfortunately, Webb is not strong enough to convincingly hold the two together."

","I know people spidey fans will disagree with what I am about to say but i think that the original spider man trilogy is like avatar in the sense that they are good movies but are completely over rated. they don't have anything on other superhero films such as say The Dark Knight trilogy, The reason why I preferred the new one was because it was less corny and more satisfying than the originals. The only part I was disappointed with was the fact that peter parkers school bully became his friend at the end, because I was glad to see how they made peters bully was sorry for beating him up when it came to a life and death matter but when he became his friend it was taken to far and felt to corny. other than that it was defiantly worth seeing."

It is a 'realistic', contemporary and a grounded approach onto the Character by the Director Marc Webb, yet staying faithful to its source materials( combo of The Amazing and The Ultimate Story lines). Of course, there are a couple of plot holes, but I am sure they'll be explained in the upcoming Sequel. I Must say that Andrew Garfield brought justice to the role of Spider-Man. An absolutely amazing and a highly gripping movie. I highly refer it to any True Spider-Man Fan, as the people who have never read the comics might call it a 'rehash' of the First Spiderman movie, but actually, this movie stayed fairly true to the comics from the beginning to the end. <br/><br/>9/10 stars from Me !

The inclusion of Dr. Curt Connors/The Lizard was long overdue and was played adequately by Rhys Ifans, Martin Sheen and Sally Field were great as Uncle Ben and Aunt May as was Dennis Leary's Captain Stacy.<br/><br/>In short, a solid cast, great story and wonderful effects inject new blood into an already great blockbuster franchise."

"thinker1691","8","28","42","19 November 2012"," "" Your abilities are not only a power, they are a responsibility ""
","This movie "" The Amazing Spiderman, "" has been way over-due. Ever since it's initial creation by Stan Lee (who makes his usual Cameo appearance), audiences have been hungrily awaiting this new addition. This time, Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) confronts a new and incredibly powerful super villain called, 'The Lizard'. Self created by a one armed scientist, named ( Rhys Ifans ) or Dr. Curt Connors, Spiderman unknowingly gives the fantastic formula to a desperate man who has been trying to invent a way for a human to re-generate a missing limb, without realizing the unfortunate side effects. From the beginning, the film has a dark, foreboding and sinister aspect, which pervades through the entire story. Indeed, this sequel returns to it's early history in that the audience is introduced to Parker's lost parents, as well as his present guardians superbly played by Martin Sheen (Who adds a bit of Panache to the movie and Sally Field. Furthermore, Parker is given a new girlfriend called Gwen Stacy and her father seriously played by Denis Leary. The movie itself is incredible, what with all new high flying action sequences, aerial effects and numerous exciting scenes. Although a bit heavy in using mostly nighttime exteriors, it does lend credence to Parker's equally somber state of mind. Over all, the film is grimly superior to earlier chapters and is therefore easily crafted to enthrall us. As a result, the cast and crew, have intentionally created a Classic in the process. Easily recommended to all. ****"
"billygoat1071","9","309","558","29 June 2012"," A Credible World
","For some people, it's questionable for Spider-Man to get a reboot. The first film of Sam Raimi's version was just a decade ago and some considered it as a cult classic. Though, one might complain for not being too faithful to the comic books. The first film rushes a lot to the story. Like, Mary Jane was already the love interest and Peter Parker immediately left High School. This edition tries to be a lot more faithful to the comic book. The result is great. The film works better in the drama. The pacing may be too quick in some parts but it's still fun and heartwarming as it suppose to be.<br/><br/>If you've already seen the 2002 version of Spider-Man then definitely you won't find a lot of thing here new. The only things that are new here is Peter Parker's father and the new ways how Spidey's powers work. Unlike the original Spider-Man stories, the use of his powers is not as simple as it looks. Here, he needs a device to shoot a web perfectly. He accidentally sticks at objects. He always cause a lot of damage. But it looks credible. What's more credible is when he wasn't quite a professional swinger at his first fights.<br/><br/>In some parts, it paces way too quickly and sometimes it feels rushed. This happens in the third act and the montages when Peter was developing his costume. The rest is pretty fine, but the quickness of the pacing of those parts is still noticeable. There are also parts that feels forced like Dr. Conners becoming evil because he became the Lizard. Aside from those, the film is good in drama. It has plenty of genuine emotion and heart. Even in the action scenes. One thing that never fails is the message of being a hero. It's not always about fighting crimes and saving the day. It's all about the hero's character.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield is indeed the best choice to play Peter Parker. He's a talented actor and he made Peter Parker a realistic character. Emma Stone is also great to her role. She made her character more than just a love interest. In other filmmaking, fans might miss Danny Elfman's music but James Horner's score is effective to the scenes. The action is fun enough and the CGI is works well enough. It has plenty of POVs to make it look exciting in both 2D and 3D.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man is almost the best Spider-Man movie. It has an incredible hero and an incredible villain living in a world that is close to reality. He is not yet professional to his own powers. He is a teenager who needs to be responsible. The drama is more effective in this film than the recent trilogy. Although I complain too much about the pacing, the depth of the story makes you think that awesome set pieces and perfect filmmaking doesn't quite matter. Because it's a superhero film that cares more than just action. The action scenes are great but the mind blowing effect here is the heart and the man behind the mask."
"colm-hearne365","9","29","44","3 September 2012"," The Amazing Spider-Man is truly amazing!
","Like a lot of people, I didn't like how they were starting the Spider- Man movies from the beginning again but when I heard that it would be more true to the comics, I really began to look forward to it and it really lived up to my expectations with its cast, script, action and directing. But I still enjoy the original Spider-Man trilogy, except Spider-Man 3 which disappointed many fans. But I can admit even the first two movies got cheesy at times, particularly the acting and directing. And I've even heard that some people didn't like the trilogy for how campy they were or how untrue to the comics they were.<br/><br/>But I mean I thought Tobey Maguire was too weak and didn't really fit the character of Peter Parker/Spider-Man and he acted too much like a geek. Kirsten Dunst was a good choice for Mary Jane but as the movies went on she became annoying and selfish, especially in the third one and I didn't like how she acted so helpless.<br/><br/>But I really think, like most people, that Andrew Garfield is amazing as Spider-Man/Peter Parker because he fits the character better and more importantly he's a better actor. And I love how he acted more of a wiseguy, which Spider-Man is supposed to be. And Emma Stone was an even better lead lady as Gwen Stacy because she actually helped out. And Rhys Ifans did very well and maybe even kind of intimidating as Dr. Connors/The Lizard. The battle scenes and special effects are amazing with The Lizard and Spider-Man were really exciting and had me at the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>Some of the thing that makes this movie better than the 2002 one, is that it has more to do with Peter's parents, who were never mentioned in the trilogy. And we actually get to see Uncle Ben get shot. And there more funny parts as well. The Stan Lee cameo was the funniest. And of course, the story of is more true to the comics as well. <br/><br/>I know some people found The Amazing Spider-Man disappointing or they prefer the original trilogy but I think people should be giving this movie more credit even though some parts were kind of similar to the Spider-Man of 2002. But I mean it's like the Spider-Man version of Batman Begins, in fact it probably should be on IMDb's Top 250 if The Avengers and The Dark Knight Rises. I mean it's much gritter, funnier, and more mature and more realistic than the trilogy.<br/><br/>Not to mention it's one of the most anticipated and best movies of 2012. I see a bright future for our fellow wall-crawler and hopefully he'll get to be in The Avengers."

"cherold","8","26","39","15 December 2012"," A much more promising start than the last Spider-Man
","2002's Spider-Man was an awful movie, mainly due to an incompetent script. It was followed by the decent Spider-Man 2 but returned to form with another bad one, Spider-Man 3. <br/><br/>That series was not the right way to do Spider-Man; this movie is the right way. While the 2002 film felt like it had been written by a committee who were neither familiar with the original material nor reading one another's work, this movie appears to have been written by people who repeatedly asked the question no one ever asked during the first series: ""does this make sense?""<br/><br/>For the most part, Amazing Spider-Man does make sense, with a fairly convincing origin story (except for a lack of explanation as to why what happened to Peter couldn't be used to create millions of Spider-Mans). The movie takes its time as Peter transitions from dweeb to super hero, then it gets into a super-villain story that also makes sense, and (again unlike the earlier film) is exciting and well paced.<br/><br/>The surprising thing about this movie is how serious Peter is. The tradition of the series is a wise-cracking good guy, but while Spidey does get some witty lines, the movie is better represented by the way Peter removes his mask in one scene to calm a child; it's more about the Spider-Man with a deep compassion and a need to make the world better than the Spider-Man who likes to swing through the air and beat up mutant creatures. I would have liked more wise cracking, but I appreciate the approach.<br/><br/>Far better than the overrated The Avengers, this is a superhero movie done right. It is not the most memorable movie, and it doesn't have anything as notable as the famous upside-down kiss from the 2002 film, but it is very solid. And while in the week since I saw it most of the details have faded away, that's much better than that 2002 film, which created so many bad memories that I can still, all these years later, reel off a list of all the movie's problems.<br/><br/>Watch this."

"jamieradford","8","30","46","27 December 2012"," Not quite amazing, but very entertaining
","I must admit I wasn't expecting much from The Amazing Spiderman. I knew the special effects would be great, but I had my doubts whether Marc Webb would be able to add anything new and interesting to the Spiderman franchise, particularly since it has only been a few years since the Sam Raimi version was in theaters.<br/><br/>Well he did, and he didn't.<br/><br/>The casting of Andrew Garfield as Spiderman/Peter Parker was a great choice. Gone is the klutzy and nerdy Peter Parker played by Toby Maguire in the Sam Raimi version. In his place is a normal kid (although very intelligent), who while not being the most popular student at his school is not the class dork either.<br/><br/>This version of Spiderman also concentrates more on what happened to Peter's parents, and the effect that has had on him. The discovery by Peter of his father's suitcase and the ensuing investigation, is what leads him to becoming Spiderman. This investigation into his parents' disappearance will apparently be one of the common threads that will tie in future installments of Webb's Spiderman.<br/><br/>Gone also was The Daily Bugle, J Jonah Jameson and Mary Jane Watson, and although they will all return in The Amazing Spiderman 2, due out in 2014, I did miss the rantings of JJJ, portrayed so wonderfully well by J. K. Simmons in the previous version.<br/><br/>Marc Webb has instead used Gwen Stacey as Peter's love interest in his adaptation, played very service-ably by Emma Stone, and to be honest the chemistry between Stone and Garfield is much better than that between Toby Maguire and Kirsten Dunst, who played Spiderman and MJW respectively in the Sam Raimi films.<br/><br/>Denis Leary who is always good joins the cast as Gwenn's father – police Captain Stacey, and as is becoming a trend in super hero movies, big name actors are playing the parts of the hero's parents, or in this case uncle and aunt, with Sally Field and Martin Sheen taking on the roles of Aunt May and Uncle Ben. Both, as usual give very polished performances.<br/><br/>The excellent Rhys Ifans plays the one armed Dr Curt Conners, who used to work with Peter's father at Oscorp until he disappeared, and since then has been struggling to complete their work on cross species genetics on his own; unable to discover the final equation that will allow it to go forward.<br/><br/>Peter supplies Conners with the equation, and following pressure from his boss at Oscorp tests the formula on himself. Of course it has unintentional side effects, and as well as repairing his lost arm, turns him into a giant lizard who then wreaks havoc throughout New York; as well as trying to turn everyone else in the city into creatures like himself.<br/><br/>And the battle between Spiderman and the Lizard begins. As expected the special effects are great, and although I am not usually a fan of 3D, I highly recommend seeing The Amazing Spiderman in that format if possible, as the scenes of him swinging through New York are (no pun intended) amazing.<br/><br/>Marc Webb has done a fine job. There are holes in the script and story, but they are not that noticeable, and it can get a bit clichéd at times, but these things are to be expected in a big budget film such as this; however they can also be forgiven.<br/><br/>All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed The Amazing Spiderman, and am looking forward to the next installment of Marc Webb's version, which at this stage will see Jamie Foxx playing the villain Electro and is due out in 2014.<br/><br/>7.5 out of 10"

"Tehmeh","8","32","50","5 August 2013"," There's a lot of love in this.
","When I heard The Amazing Spider-Man is on the works, my first thought was ""why?"". After all, it hadn't been that long since Raimi's trilogy, and apart from the last one they weren't bad.<br/><br/>Was this needed? Probably not. Which is funny, because it's still very, very good. I just watched it for the 2nd time on blu-ray and there's so much good in this film.<br/><br/>The casting is excellent. Andrew Garfield is not just a good actor, he's far better Peter Parker/Spider-Man than I would've thought. He nails it. I really was surprised by it. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy is equally good. I love it, that for once, Peter's love interest isn't a useless, idiotic damsel in distress with some trivial occupational/emotional problems nobody cares about. For once there's a female counterpart who isn't just an idiot, but neither a forced, overly strong woman with a bitchy character trying to portray some cynical girl power fantasy. No. Gwen Stacy is smart, funny and naturally likable character. Which can also be said of Uncle Ben and Aunt May (Martin Sheen and Sally Field). Warm, good characters, and the dialogue is usually good and/or well delivered. For once, I'm happy that characters aren't a) stupid or b) repulsive. It's clear that with this reboot, Marc Webb not only wanted to tell the origin story again, but he wanted to do it right. Although basic aspects are the same as in previous trilogy, there are differences here and there. <br/><br/>I complimented the dialogue. I'll also compliment the pacing. Sometimes corners are cut a little short, and the character of Connors/Lizard could've used a little more character development, but the movie just rolls forward in a satisfying manner. We do not need more forced ""Peter hiding his identity""-based tension, and I'm thrilled how it's handled in this movie. That's how I felt, I felt I wasn't forced to care about things I don't really care, especially in a reboot. The action looks wonderful and I do like the suit - and of course I like the fact that Spider-Man's web doesn't come from his body anymore.<br/><br/>As I said, some corners are cut short and of course there are some stupidities. For me, these are all forgivable. Webb's crew is serious about this character and the movie. There is a lot of love put into this film. It shows, it really does. I'm saying this even if I thought the main villain wasn't handled the way I liked. The overall quality is that strong. Some genuine moments, like when Sally Field delivers an explosion of emotion without a single spoken word in the end, have such an impact that it's easy to forgive plenty.<br/><br/>Raimi's Spider-Man 2 is still the best one, but I enjoyed this almost to the same extent. It can be dumb and sometimes doesn't respect the intelligence of its audience, but it's simply an enjoyable ride nevertheless. Too bad the sequel was horrible. Let's just pretend that it didn't happen."

","When it was announced that a Spidey reboot was in the works, most people responded in the same way (namely, by groaning and emphasizing their contempt for Hollywood and it's lack of originality). Likewise, I thought it completely unnecessary to start from scratch, as Sam Raimi and company had crafted an admirable trilogy (the third installment being a take-it-or-leave it experience). With The Dark Knight Rises on the horizon and The Avengers having ruled the first half of the summer movie season, it seemed as if Marc Webb had accepted a fool's errand in attempting to spin a tale that, by all accounts, didn't need to be retold.<br/><br/>Lo and behold The Amazing Spider-Man, an origins tale that's a much darker, more brooding take than its 2002 counterpart. This time around, Peter Parker is played by Andrew Garfield. Unlike Mr. Maguire, this Parker has a tangible chip on his shoulder. He's a moody teen who vividly recalls the day his parents dropped him off at Aunt May and Uncle Ben's so his scientific genius father could sort out a mysterious mess at Oscorp, only to never return. Peter has inherited his father's knack for figuring out how things work—albeit in a more mechanical sense —and, though introverted, is clearly a clever kid in his own right. As new insights about his dad's work come to light, Parker finds himself in the labs of the fabled biogenetics lab that his old man helped build. It's then that he is—wait for it!—bitten by a mutated spider.<br/><br/>As you can see, the basic layout of The Amazing Spider-Man is very similar to what transpires in Raimi's feature. One key difference, however, is the decision to focus on Peter's father. This helps motivate Peter to embark on a quest to discover ""who he is,"" which ultimately leads him to the realization that his dad's intentions were noble. Another significant difference here is the tone; Webb and Garfield remove the slapstick comedy that made the original (the 2002 original, that is) a colorful, light-hearted affair. In its place is a decidedly more drab depiction of the Big Apple and its inhabitants, and— for my money, at least—a more compelling vision of how Parker comes into his own as the web-slinging hero of yore.<br/><br/>So, even though there are plenty of familiar elements, the movie feels like a more mature take on Spidey that causal moviegoers and more ardent web-heads can both admire and appreciate."
"jeddjong","8","332","623","26 June 2012"," The untold story? Not quite, but a well-told story? Definitely.
","After Spider-Man 3 became something of a critical and commercial letdown and plans for a sequel fell through, the folks at Marvel Entertainment and Columbia Pictures developed a case of itchy reboot button syndrome and immediately put The Amazing Spider-Man into production to swing in and save the franchise. Many fans rolled their collective eyes and the web was abuzz with fiery opinions. Early looks and promotional materials seemed generally underwhelming, and the film quickly became buried by bigger releases such as The Avengers, The Dark Knight Rises and Prometheus. However, this spider has become something of a dark horse and has somehow risen to greet detractors with a shot of webbing to the face.<br/><br/>In spite of the poor first impressions, one would be hard-pressed not to admit that The Amazing Spider-Man is actually a competently-made, enjoyable flick. The approach that the aptly-named director Marc Webb of (500) Days of Summer fame took brings to mind last year's surprise hit Marvel flick X-Men: First Class, in that in combines the youthful appeal of teen drama with relatively large-scale super heroics and action sequences. This film does not repeat the mistakes of Spider-Man 3 – instead, we have character development and interaction and clear and easy-to-follow plot progression. <br/><br/>Spider-Man has always been a hero all readers could relate to, with his transition from outcast to hero and his various personal, real-world struggles. Andrew Garfield, sexy nerd incarnate, is an ace casting choice. The actor has said that playing Spider-Man has been his dream since he was a young boy and the role went to the right guy. Garfield has an effortless, genuine charm and his slightly lanky proportions do seem very reminiscent of the Peter Parker of the comics, particularly the Ultimate version. For all the strengths of Tobey Maguire's interpretation of the character, Garfield's somehow rings more true. Whether he's being a smart-mouthed do-gooder, a teen sorting out his issues with his well-meaning aunt and uncle or a young lover unsure of how to go about a relationship with his dream gal, Garfield is in great form.<br/><br/>Speaking of his dream gal, Emma Stone does a similarly good job of playing Gwen Stacy. Many were confused after Stone was cast and then announced as playing a different character from Kirsten Dunst's. Gwen did pop in Spider-Man 3 played by Bryce Dallas-Howard, and is touted as Parker's first love. In an interview, Stone states that ""Mary Jane fell in love with Spider-Man, but Gwen Stacy fell in love with Peter Parker"". Gwen is smart, kind and funny, surely what every guy looks for in a girl, and her role in the story is just the right size. Sure enough, the chemistry between Stone and Garfield is among the strongest of on screen couples in recent memory and it's no surprise that the couple continued their romance off the set.<br/><br/>One has to feel bad for Dylan Baker who portrayed Dr Curt Connors in Spider-Man 2 and 3 but never got the chance to transform into the Lizard after the cancellation of a fourth entry in Raimi's series. Rhys Ifans fills those shoes, and he marshals a tragic figure who hopes to better society and to fix his own perceived physical flaw. This definitely will push the excellent actor further into public consciousness, and he does a decent job. However, Connors' split-second snap from rational scientist to raving mad supervillain does seem a tad rushed and the design of the Lizard, as has been stated before, is pretty goofy. Also, the relationship between Connors and Parker, while given some attention here, could have benefited from a little mo re.<br/><br/>The rest of the supporting cast is good too. Martin Sheen is easy to buy as the earnest, down-to-earth uncle and father figure who serves as an upstanding role model to his nephew, and so is Sally Field as his concerned, protective wife May. Casting these veteran film industry stalwarts was certainly a good move, especially since this retelling doesn't particularly focus on the two but does convey their involvement in Peter's life. Denis Leary is also well-cast as the Inspector Javert-type Captain Stacy, who could have been an over-the-top, ""squash Spider-Man dead!"" figure. Instead, Leary makes him a stern but well-meaning authority figure and gives him a good dynamic with his daughter and Peter. His resemblance to Willem Dafoe, aka Green Goblin from the first Spider-Man film, is a little distracting though.<br/><br/>In terms of aesthetics, the movie looks sleek and dramatic – director Webb uses his ample experience shooting music videos in the right way. While it could have been something like the horrid Catwoman movie, there is instead clever use of lighting and composition and the action sequences are kinetic yet coherently-shot. This reviewer isn't a giant fan of the costume, produced by the people at Cirque du Soleil (really) and the afore-mentioned facial features of the Lizard. The large amounts of digital effects supplied mostly by Sony Pictures Imageworks (also responsible for last year's Green Lantern film) are also a cut or so below expectations for a big-budget superhero movie, but these don't significantly hurt the end result.<br/><br/>The film brings up the issue of Peter's parents but never fully addresses it, with a slightly ham-fisted mid-credits sequel hook hinting at what is to come. The Amazing Spider-Man has been marketed as ""the untold story"", which is rather bold given that it's only been ten years since Sam Raimi's Spider-Man and five years since Spider-Man 3. Still, it defies expectations and is thoroughly entertaining. Untold story? Not quite, but well-told story? Definitely."

","I guess whether or not we like a super-hero movie depends on what we are looking for in it. I want them to inspire me to always strive to be the best version of myself. I want them to unapologetically show heroes being heroes, without caring if that makes them 'cheesy', protecting and defending more than they attack, constantly learning from life and from others, overcoming personal struggles and losses, using their brain more than their brawn etc. I especially love any story where the protagonist is smart and a fellow nerd. This movie does it all for me.<br/><br/>Garfield might be too good looking to pass off as a bullied teenager, but he made up for that with his acting. He portrayed perfectly the awkwardness that bullies would hone in as a weakness, the need for validation that comes from this and from losing his parents that led him to give the formula away so callously to please Dr Connors, the rebelliousness and teenage angst etc. I also liked the tragic arc of Dr Connors and how his path to the dark side was paved with good intentions. I also liked all the side characters and Gwen. The humour was also on point, as was the music.<br/><br/>More importantly, I like and admire the Peter Parker in this movie.

","I know some of the reviews of this movie so far have been hit and miss, but I personally thought this was an excellent film.<br/><br/>I saw one of the pre-release screenings and went in without great expectation as I loved the first Tobey Maguire movie and didn't know what another re-boot could really bring to the character.<br/><br/>Firstly the casting is spot on. Andrew Garfield completely embodies the character. I thought Tobey Maguire did a job but Garfield puts him to shame in this movie. Emma Stone was absolutely fantastic as Gwen Stacey Other reviews have asked if this supposed to be Spiderman movie or Twilight, and yes I agree that the film concentrated a lot of energy on the character development and the relationships.I do not see that as a bad thing. Daredevil was not the best movie I have ever seen by any stretch of the imagination, but it made me feel an emotional connection to the characters in a way that many other superhero movies do not. The Amazing Spiderman takes that to the next level.<br/><br/>If you are just looking for blockbusting action and fight scenes from start to finish then no, this movie will probably not deliver for you. However if, as a fan of comic books, you are just as interested in the lives and the motivation of both the heroes and the villains and seeing them have to deal with the same emotional issues that you do, no comic book movie has done it better.<br/><br/>Go and see this movie! If you haven't seen a superhero film before because you think it isn't your thing, see this one! It brings something new! Not for everyone I guess, but I loved it."
"ford_guy20042000","9","166","317","3 July 2012"," Infinitely better than the previous outings! It's why we have reboots!
","There is no comparison really.<br/><br/>This movie when compared to the previous Spiderman movies far outshines the old Tobey Maquire movies.<br/><br/>Where to begin.<br/><br/>The acting...they used real actors. When Spidey gets the crap kicked out of him, you feel it. You see blood, you see wounds and bruises. Not the kind that Tobey got where 2 seconds later he was all better. It felt more real. Andrew Garfield is a Superior actor over Tobey. Sally Field, Martin Sheen, and Emma Stone completely surpassed their previous incarnations, however I felt that the Aunt May character and Gwen Stacy character were a bit underused.<br/><br/>The truly wonderful thing about the movie is, the lame humor of the past is gone. There isn't a Russian landlord chasing Peter for rent. And Peter doesn't feel like a whiny, little girl like Tobey portrayed him. For instance in those movies, in all three he screamed like a girl when hit.<br/><br/>The story was solid, but not strong. They had it in the right direction, but I think they needed to build on a few things. I didn't buy the main plot of the Lizard. OK..whatever but I was thinking...really? The story was still good enough to be called good and by far the best of the Spidey movies.<br/><br/>Fight scenes, Spidey web slinging through the air, and the CGI all great. No complaints there.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Peter and Gwen, they have what Tobey and Kirsten Dunst did not have. They need to seriously expand on that in the next movie. The man is what drives the hero. They need to get the balance right, and they need to develop his relationships a bit more.<br/><br/>One of my main gripes of the old movies was that in every one of them the other characters insisted on calling Peter by both his first and last name, all the time. Peter Parker this and Peter Parker that. It was ridiculous and nobody talks like that. Sadly they did carry that into this movie as well. Although without quite the hokiness of the others.<br/><br/>They need to keep a sense of realism. Don't get silly with it. Make dreams come true and not just transfer the dream to screen. I want to believe that its possible that a man with spider powers can fight a giant lizard man on a tall skyscraper. Which they did pretty well in this one.<br/><br/>It is absolutely and completely worth your time to go see."
"Loving_Silence","9","128","242","17 July 2012"," Exceeded my expectations!
","The Amazing Spider-Man is one of the best movies of 2012, so far. Great chemistry between the 2 actors, fantastic visual effects, memorable action scenes and a a new level of emotional depth, not seen in a Spider-Man movie. The movie constantly delivers on character development and thrilling action sequences. My low expectations were obliterated, what a surprise! Aside from the 3D animation looking fantastic and the film having a dark, complex feel to it that makes it feel more grown up, the primary reason worth watching is Andrew Garfield. <br/><br/>Andrew Garfield was terrific as Spider-Man, he not only looks like Peter Parker, but he embodies the character. Something only a few actors are able to do. Emma Stone is, as always very charming and effective in her role as Gwen Stacy. The chemistry between them is so well done, and performed. The scenes between them truly elevate the film, as a whole. Uncle Ben, played by the veteran actor Martin Sheen. Sheen brings the intrinsic qualities of family love and togetherness to the movie. Rhys Ifans is great as Dr. Connors, although I felt he was a bit underused. Everyone works so well together, the cast is by far the best out of all the Spidey movies, yet. <br/><br/>In many ways it represents an improvement over the Raimi films, particularly the misbegotten third installment, especially in its emphasis on the adolescent nature of its protagonist. Though Garfield is 28, he makes a credible 17-year-old - although Maguire was a year younger when he first pulled on the tights a decade ago, his Parker seemed conspicuously adult. The action scenes and the visual effects are totally exhilarating, believable and totally engrossing. Even though this reboot may be unnecessary, now I can't wait until The Amazing Spider-man 2. <br/><br/>I sort of hate comparing this to the original trilogy because it is trying to be its own thing, but you can't escape the fact that it's such a recent reboot. However the movie stands on its own, as great reboot and a pleasure to watch! ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" has everything you could ask from a summer movie. Action, romance, imagination and smart writing. <br/><br/>9/10"
"disgruntledjigglypuff","6","148","295","22 July 2012"," Predictability, uninteresting action sequences, and an awful soundtrack keep this film from being on par or even setting its self apart from the previous decade's Spiderman.
","First off, this is only my opinion, but really my biggest issue with this film was that it was just kinda boring. About 30 minutes in, I already knew fundamentally everything significant that would transpire in the film. Now that in itself might be a given some might argue, however at that point in the movie, I assumed I would still enjoy it as I expected some spectacular action. Had I been impressed with the fight scenes and jumping around being Spiderman I don't think I would have cared as much about the boring story because it would be redeemed in another aspect. <br/><br/>However, the action and special effects in the film were also...kinda...boring. In fact the most spectacular visual moment in the entire film where Spiderman jumps of the top of the tower antenna, and it falls with him as he saves himself was already shown to us in the trailer. I won't go into the fight sequences but for me there was just never really a moment that made my heart race. <br/><br/>Lastly the soundtrack was terrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrible, feeling very out of place in many parts, most notably the fight between the Lizard and Spiderman in the High School. I would normally assume in a scene like that, which is Spiderman and the Lizard's first real physical confrontation, for the music to be more menacing, however it opts for a very happy and victorious theme music. Considering Spiderman doesn't exactly whoop the Lizard there, it's a little out of place. There is however a memorable humorous scene in that altercation.<br/><br/>So...this is just kinda boring and not very exiting, as far as movies like this, I personally enjoyed more ""The A Team"",""Red"",""The Avengers"",""Thor"", the first two Spidermans, (Spiderman 3 was terrrrrrible)."
"StonedMagician","8","3","3","27 July 2019"," Very Good: 8.0
","Reboots/remakes are very controversial (let alone common) in Hollywood these days. Some of them have been welcomed (Star Trek, Casino Royale), and others not (Let Me In). The Amazing Spider Man, a reboot of the franchise begun by Sam Raimi's 2002 film, is one of the latter. Many critics seem predisposed to disregard this film, given the extremely positive response the original received. A similar thing happened when Let Me In first premiered: do we really need this movie, when the original was both great and relatively recent? The answer, of course, is no. But the fact remains that it exists, so critics should leave their grudges behind and concentrate on the film itself. Sam Raimi's version made light work of Peter Parker's transformation. Sure, the general concepts were in place; he gets bitten by a mutant spider, develops superhuman powers (though he cannot generate the webs himself in this version), and sees Uncle Ben get gunned down. And really, that was about it. Marc Webb, known for his well-handled rom-com 500 Days of Summer, imbues Spidey's origins with considerable depth and humanity. When Parker discovers his uncle's killer sports a tattoo, he pins any crook he can find to the wall to check if they're the right one. The chief of police points out that Spider Man doesn't seem to have any agenda, and is nothing more than a vigilante. After this, Peter seemingly decides that he can do far more than simply take vengeance, and decides to take on the real menace, The Lizard. Of Sam Raimi's trilogy, the best villain was Doc Ock, from Spider Man 2. As a character, he was fascinating, and brilliantly acted by Alfred Molina. The Lizard, whose human form is portrayed by Rhys Ifans, is little more than a miniaturized Godzilla with a plan. While Ifans plays his part quite well, The Lizard is simply not as charismatic or terrifying as Ock was. Like DOc Ock, however, The Lizard (AKA Curt Connors) is a sympathetic villain, with (initially) benign intentions that are completely understandable, and enough to pity him by the end of the film. Peter's love interest is Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), a smart, pretty, resourceful young woman who also happens to be the daughter of the police chief. She and Parker (Andrew Garfield) share excellent chemistry in their interactions, which director Webb exploits to its fullest potential. Their romance seems many times more genuine than that between Parker and Mary Jane from Raimi's trilogy. Parker himself is just as likeable, and far more unsure of himself. In this version, he stutters sometimes, and seems like the type of socially awkward nerd stereotype that everyone seems know someone like. It makes him easier to relate to, and thus easier to accept as a character, adding immeasurably to the film's human side. The other side of the film, of course, is the CGI-driven action. Sam Raimi, employed his signature style to his action, meaning that everything was complete chaos. Entertaining to be sure, but not always easy to follow. Webb anchors everything firmly in the realm of possibility (or at least as close as it can get), and there are no crazy gadgets flying through the air this time. Now, it's only Spider Man, the cops, and The Lizard. It all feels much more efficient and streamlined as a result, and becomes all the more thrilling because of it. Overall, I would recommend the reboot over the original, but only just. Sam Raimi may not have handled the dialogue and story as well, but is much more confident and fluid in the action space. When the inevitable sequel comes around, Webb might be able to take more risks with the web-sliging and baddy-wrangling, but until then, this is a very good film that no Spidey fan, casual or otherwise, should pass up."

It may seem that I am biased due to the fact that I admire him, but that is not it at all. My personal opinion is that Andrew did a lovely job as his role of Peter Parker and Spider-Man. Even though he is in his 30s, he has such a youthful appearance that he was easily accepted as a high school student (and I learned that he looks simply endearing in glasses!). I thought that the addition of the skateboard he carried everywhere was especially unique and brilliant. Perhaps I'm not judgemental enough, but I saw nothing wrong with this excellent movie."

","A decade ago, Tobey Maguire brought everyone's friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man to the big screen in Sam Raimi's blockbuster film, that spawned two sequels and won a legion of loyal fans across the globe...including me! For it was Raimi's 'Spider-Man' that first introduced me to Peter Parker and his world, and for that I will always be grateful to the film...but, there's simply no denying the fact that Marc Webb's 'The Amazing Spider-Man' has FAR surpassed the webhead's original cinematic incarnation!<br/><br/>I think the best comparison one can offer for this film is Christopher Nolan's now-legendary Batman reboot, 'Batman Begins'. Much like how 'Begins' reinvented the Dark Knight for a new generation by focusing on a more grounded, character-driven arc for Bruce Wayne...'Amazing Spider- Man' does the same for Peter Parker. This is a Spider-Man one almost feels CAN exist in the real world...a Peter Parker who, while technically still a 'nerd', is no milksop and far from a goody-two- shoes.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield unquestionably deserves the bulk of the credit for the success of this film. He highlights the duality of Peter Parker and Spider-Man as Maguire never did-'Spider-Man' is not just Peter in a mask...Spider-Man is Peter freed from all the restraints of his identity, all the consequences of his actions. The mask of Spider-Man, to Peter, represents the anonymity similarly offered by Internet chat- rooms and forums; a point Garfield has raised in interviews, and which is is reflected throughout the film. His Peter doesn't become a superhero overnight...rather, his is a journey that encompasses the whole narrative of the film until, by the end, we finally see him become the heroic legend we all know and love. Perhaps the most striking difference, at least on a superficial level, between Garfield's Spider- Man and his predecessor, is the fact that this is a Spidey who's liberal with the wise-cracks. He is a hormonal, sometimes annoying, 17 year old and he sure acts like one!<br/><br/>Emma Stone and Rhys Ifans deliver solid performances as Gwen Stacy and Dr. Curt Connors respectively. Stone's Gwen Stacy is certainly superior to Kirsten Dundt's Mary Jane Watson from the previous series-she's not just a love interest, but an integral part of the plot, along with her father, Captain George Stacy (Dennis Leary). Ifans plays Connors as a well-intentioned visionary gone astray, literally, as the reptilian monster known as the 'Lizard'...a powerful performance that easily rivals those of William Dafoe as Green Goblin or Alfred Molina as Dr. Octopus from the old series.<br/><br/>Beyond the excellent portrayals though, the movie's true strength is derived from an excellent script and some brilliant direction on the part of Marc Webb. While quiet a few liberties have been taken with the source material, Webb manages to stay pretty close to the spirit of Stan Lee's original story. The 'Ultimate Spider-Man' series has also clearly been a major influence, both stylistically and conceptually. While the film is a complete story in itself, there are a few plot threads left hanging...mysteries waiting to be resolved in the inevitable future installments. For now though, Spidey fans all over the world can enjoy this wonderful love-letter to Stan Lee and Steve Dikto's 50 year old creation!"

Slowly its invisible web tangles you around and before you know it, you're bound and powerless. You get immersed to the story, to the emotions of the scene. You can't help but to feel what Peter Parker is feeling. His pain, his anger, his joy, his anguish. And you want him to win over the villain. You're relieved when he overcomes obstacles. Then at the end of the movie you enthusiastically clap your hands together to applaud the great performance that you just saw. That's how I felt. I was reluctant to see it at first. The trailers didn't impress me. I've seen previous movies with Tobey Maguire and thought that they're pretty well made. Though I'm not a fan, the fact that they cast a different person to play the role of spider-man this time around was both confusing and appalling to me. Had the ticket not been free, I wouldn't have gone to see it. I came to the theater with no expectation other than that I'd be disappointed. But this movie turned me into a believer. This is the best spider-man movie. Andrew Garfield is Peter Parker. He even sounds like Peter Parker from the cartoon show. His performance was so great it's infectious. He deserves an Oscar notch for this role. Why not? Why can't a movie be entertaining and Oscar worthy at the same time? I'm sure this movie has flaws when you dissect it. And I'm sure it disappoints a lot of spider-man fans in some ways. But sometimes you just have to sit back, relax and enjoy the ride. What a great ride it was for me. 10 out of 10.<br/><br/>PS.

Marc Webb you are good at directing love stories but you lack a lot in Action oriented movies like Spider-Man.<br/><br/>I have a lot of questions after seeing the movie.<br/><br/>1)Why there is no proper details shown for the disappearance of Peter parker's parents? <br/><br/>2)Why the movie looks so dark always and almost all the scenes were shot in night? Is Spidey afraid of daylight Mark Webb?<br/><br/>3)I didn't see any one writing about the Spider-Man Suit, How did they miss it? The suit looks so bad and it doesn't fit good for andrew garfield. It looks kind of cheap and the design looks awkward. The Sam Raimi version of spiderman had a really awesome suit and looked believable. What made you change the Suit Webb? <br/><br/>4)The changes that occur to peter after the spider bite was not shown as enjoyable as Sam Raimi's version in this movie. <br/><br/>5)The huge disappointment is the Lizard.Its kind of laughable when the lizard speaks. The CG is not good. <br/><br/>6)The3D effect was below average and it is good at some places. <br/><br/>7)The cast is good and I really liked Andrew Garfield as peter parker but not as Spider-Man. All the other characters were good in acting.<br/><br/>8)Why Garfield is always taking his mask off. The great thing about the Spider-Man character is the mask and its annoying to see Garfield taking off his mask quite often. <br/><br/>9)Sam Raimi is good in Action as well as in Emotion scenes but here Mark Webb falls down. There is no good action scenes in the first half and the most likable scene is the fight with the lizard and the last Spider-Man web swing scene. It was really good in 3D. <br/><br/>10)This movie doesn't give the satisfaction that Sam Raimi's trilogy gave and this looks kind of waste. Why they go for the decision to make a reboot? they could have done Spider-Man 4. <br/><br/>11)It is really boring and all the scenes remind Sam Raimi's first Spider-Man movie. <br/><br/>12)Huge disappointment and it doesn't look like a super hero movie after it ends. Can see this movie only once for 3D effects. <br/><br/>13)I am sure that Columbia and Marvel will be thinking of getting Sam Raimi back or any other good director. But Mark webb has also done a good job in directing this huge movie in this critical situation. But he has missed a lot in satisfying Spidey fans. Sorry Webb better luck next time. <br/><br/>14) Music is so bad and at some places it is good. Where is the background score in this movie and i can barely remember any music. The music in Sam Raimi's Trilogy is fantastic but this one sucks.<br/><br/>15)Hope the sequel will be a great one with some good CG, new and powerful Villain, good Spider Suit, good story and with some really good action sequences.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading."

","In 2002 Sam Raimi created the first of his soon to be ""Spider-Man"" trilogy with ""Spider-Man"". Apart from ""X-Men' there hadn't really been a large superhero film since the classic ""Superman"" films from the late 70's, early 80's. 2004 came and Raimi built upon the solid foundations of his initial creation with a near perfect, smart film made for all audiences, even those who had no love for superhero films known as ""Spider-Man 2"". Years later he would go on to make ""Spider-Man 3"", a heavily flawed but still somewhat enjoyable experience. Now 5 years on from the last incarnation of the web slinger we are presented with director Marc Webb's (Who also directed the fantastic ""500 Days of Summer"") perception of the masked crusader in ""The Amazing Spider-Man"".<br/><br/>Starting from the ground up we are re-introduced to Spider-Man with a central performance from Andrew Garfield playing Peter Parker, the high school student who receives extraordinary gifts reminiscent of a spider through a bite of a genetically engineered arachnid. Alongside having to understand his newfound powers he gains a love interest with fellow student Gwen Stacey (Emma Stone) and discovering the mysterious disappearance of his parents as a child with the help of one-armed scientist Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) who worked alongside his dad. However Connors is trying to work on a cure for his arm through the DNA of lizards and ends up becoming a monstrosity known as The Lizard in the process. Now it's up to Spider-Man to prevent The Lizard from tearing apart the city.<br/><br/>Marc Webb has taken up this huge task of re-booting the series and has managed to craft a solid piece of summer entertainment, but not without it's flaws. However on the positive side he creates a brilliantly paced blockbuster with the first hour building on the characters and the second hour bringing high-octane action in a constant rhythm without becoming stale. He also manages to capture the character of Spider-Man fantastically bringing the humorous one-liners that he quips from the comic books and adds it to his film without ever over doing it. Along side his great action, pacing and realization of Spider-Man it's backed with a thumping score which breaks into moments of greatness as it reaches different tones, a heavy standout being the horror track that backs a lot of The Lizard scenes. Along with some great direction from Webb showing one or two scenes of true horror making him an interesting choice from a film in that genre.<br/><br/>Its not just Webb's directing that stands out, Garfield creates his own version of Spider-Man and not only captures it but embodies it. It's a role he was born to play and it's evident that he's enjoying every scene he's in playing this character, alongside playing Parker. Being a surprising addition to the cast is Martin Sheen as Uncle Ben who brings a more heartfelt and lovable interpretation to the role that the other films were never able to capture. Ifans is a great choice for Connors as well and dominates the scenes he's in with his strong presence being felt. It's just a shame this is lost when he becomes The Lizard and the CGI creation becomes a cheesy mess with no real threat or character as the computer generate scenes play out. The most disappointing of all however is the character of Gwen Stacey. As strong as Stones performance is the character is not. She feels more like a plot device at times than a genuine love interest for Spider-Man and since their relationship grows so fast it's hard to really grab anything from what you're being given.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with the film however is the script, which Webb manages to keep on top, but not without it's flaws. At times it comes an inconsistent mess, for example in one scene Parker would touch an object which would suddenly stick to his hand and then the next scene he would be able to grab objects with ease, but then after this would go back to the prior problem. There's also some forced narrative choices as well, especially the scene in which Parker comes up with the idea for his suit which felt completely un-natural and a jolt out of the story. Alongside some forced plot ideas were certain plot strands that were left un- resolved, a main one involving Uncle Ben that reaches a crescendo and then never ties it's self up. The whole script feels unfinished and flips between a positive storytelling experience to a completely unpolished one.<br/><br/>However despite these flaws Webb manages to keep the film afloat with some great characters, exciting action and an enjoyable time overall. Audiences should not soon forget though how great Sam Raimi captured Spider-Man in his direction though and the chemistry of the cast, each having their own story arcs. It'll be interesting to see where Webb takes his creation, as there's a lot here to like, just a weak script and some un-polished characters stop it from being the greatness it could have been. With films such as ""The Avengers"" and ""The Dark Knight Rises"" being the heavy weight superhero films to storm multiplexes it's hard to see ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" finding a heavy footing. But it's still worth checking out and will provide an entertaining two hours for audiences. There's still some web left in this spider after all."
"xavier-901-692784","3","92","188","4 July 2012"," OK, folks start your timers
","I didn't expect much and though I was surprised in some regards I was highly disappointed in others. I'll first say that I don't mind reboots if they add more to the story, but seriously, over half the film dedicated to how PP becomes Spidey, really? Overall I think the acting, directing, and cinematography were all well done. I blame the screen play on this one being bad, and for those that claim it sticks more to Comic than Sam Raimi's versions I can only ask ""what are you smoking?"" Yes, PP is bitten by a spider and No, there aren't glands that he makes webs with. But that is about as close to the Comic as it really gets. If one were to compare Webb's vision to Raimi's as to which one is closer to the comic, I think fans would pick Raimi's, though I have my misgivings about his vision as well. <br/><br/>It was nice seeing Sally Fields in the film, and though I felt she may have appeared to young for the role, she came across as I expected the character to. Denis Leary and Emma Stone make a nice Father/Daughter combination, Andrew Garfield makes a believable replacement for Tobey Maguire, and Martin Sheen made a nice Uncle Ben.<br/><br/>If I wasn't so bored with the rehash of Spidey's beginnings this film could have really been something to watch, as it is, save your money or go watch the Avengers. But if you really want to see it, wait about an hour after it starts before checking it out, trust me you won't miss anything we haven't already seen."
"JeffTheBadger","7","68","136","26 June 2012"," ""The good effort but not amazing spiderman""
","To start off I want to say I enjoyed this movie but even as I type that I do question exactly how much.<br/><br/>People have talked about the CGI not being up to scratch and parts of the 3D being blurry but I don't think that was the problem. The action was great, the characters were good but it seemed to be one ""amazing"" set piece scene after another with very little connecting them. I often found myself wondering what happened to get from point A to C, B seems to happen off screen for a large portion of the film.<br/><br/>I know the words ""gritty"" and ""dark"" seem to crop up every time someone talks about a good superhero film but I don't think that needs to be the case, I like superhero films to be larger than life – that's kind of the point! For the inevitable comparison with the Sam Raimi spiderman film, I would say it is more gritty, a little darker, slightly less fun and a lot less coherent.<br/><br/>An overall enjoyable watch but not sure ""amazing"" should have been in the title."
"interquam","2","106","221","29 June 2012"," Romeo and Juliet: Spiderman version
","Emma stone and Andrew Garfield spend a lot of time in each others breath.<br/><br/>An ensemble cast that is superior to other films with a pathetic story and average cinematography. A very good script with good actors and failing plot.<br/><br/>Mr Sam Raimi should have made this movie keeping the actors same including the screen-play.<br/><br/>Fairly good direction but i don't want to pay for seeing school-kids lick and salivate in each others mouths.<br/><br/>Maybe if they would have taken Sharlto Copley instead of Rhys Ifans i would have added another 3 stars.<br/><br/>Its a romantic movie gyrating around the emotions of school kids peter parker and Gwen Stacy .......everything else takes a backseat. I was bugged and so i went to take a leak during their kiss.<br/><br/>Technically the movie is flawed. The spiderweb is not produced by his own body i reckon, but a device he built that produces the web. <br/><br/>Another thing CGI is crap. You don't expect it to get overlooked with cheap multi-core chips and GPU's. Sub-standard quality-less animations.<br/><br/>Oh! the bad guy-- a giant lizard that can easily be squashed by a freight train or truck........Duh.<br/><br/>Much better than Prometheus because actors are very good.<br/><br/>I would applaud Andrew, martin,Chris Zylka, the whole cast and the screenplay guys for making this film OK.....the story and romance just makes me crap in my pants.<br/><br/>Too much melodrama and emotion.<br/><br/>Spiderman 3 can be renamed: The Amazing spider-man."
"claudio_carvalho","6","77","157","10 November 2012"," The Fast-Paced Reinvention of a Hero
","The trilogy of the Spider-Man by Sam Raimi is very faithful to the comic book's hero from my childhood. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is not a bad movie, but is a fast-paced reinvention of the hero and therefore I was a little disappointed with the story.<br/><br/>Peter Parker is no longer the outcast nerd that is bullied by everyone at high-school and needs to work to support his beloved Aunt May. He dates Gwen and immediately discloses his identity to her. After discovering that he has superpowers, he immediately jumps from the top of a building in a reckless attitude. He does not also grieve the loss of his Uncle Ben. There are many other differences regarding the original Spider-Man.<br/><br/>The best that this film offers are the top-notch special effects that are very impressive. The story is only reasonable and I prefer Sam Raimi's movies. My vote is six.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""O Espetacular Homem-Aranha"" (""The Spectacular Spider- Man"")"
"projectxclan","6","65","131","4 July 2012"," Meh at best.
","This reboot had a different feel then the other spiderman movies. The reason being is that this reboot felt more directed towards adults. This is not to say its not appropriate for younger viewers because its perfectly fine for most youngsters. This spiderman has very little scenes that grab at children rather more of a straight action film with no comedy. Spiderman was much closer to the original hero in this film and i can and did really appreciate that. I found that spiderman 4 would have probably done just as well as The Amazing Spiderman. The movie seemed to drag on much longer then needed with a very slow start. I think the only real thing that would appeal to people is that spiderman is not played by Tobey Maguire which in itself is worth at least a watch."
"moviexclusive","8","57","114","25 June 2012"," 'Amazing' isn't too much a superlative to describe this perfect blend of drama and action that offers both physical and emotional thrills
","Ten years might seem too soon to reboot a franchise, but after the bloated and lacklustre 'Spiderman 3', going back to basics isn't that bad an idea after all. That's exactly what 'The Amazing Spiderman' does, booting out previous franchise stalwarts Sam Raimi, Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and James Franco for up-and-coming director Marc Webb (with only the indie feature '500 Days of Summer' under his belt) and similarly on-the-up stars Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone. It's a bold move all right, but in this instance, one that pays off handsomely in the form of an enormously entertaining blockbuster piece of entertainment that we dare say surpasses the original.<br/><br/>To be sure, this isn't quite 'the untold story' that the pre-publicity machine sold it as. Rather, screenwriters James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves (with story credit to Vanderbilt) re-assemble the key elements of Peter Parker's origin story for a fresh new take on the familiar. So once again, Peter is the nerdy and socially awkward teenager who lives with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May, who one day gets bitten by a genetically modified spider and develops superhuman powers, who uses his powers for play until his Uncle Ben gets killed, and then is thrust into a quest for justice to hunt down the killer that ultimately leads him to recognise the responsibility which comes with possessing such powers.<br/><br/>Like we said, this is no mere rehash, and both Webb and his team of writers find opportunities at every turn to expand and adjust the little details that make a difference. Parker's father for instance plays a much more central role to the narrative, and the crucial wrestling episode between Parker and opponent Bonesaw McGraw in Sam Raimi's original is reduced with a wink to a brief moment that inspires his Spidey mask. More significantly, Webb tones down the comic-book feel of Raimi's original and goes the way of recent superhero movies by injecting a stronger dose of drama into the material.<br/><br/>Though Parker's abandonment issues have always featured in the 'Spiderman' films, Webb's spin on it is by far the most emotionally poignant, drawing an intimate link with Parker's identity crisis that forms the backbone of the story. Indeed, that's also how the film's villain, Dr Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans), has been sketched. Both hero and adversary are characters isolated in their own way- two sides of the same coin if you may- not so different from the dynamic between Batman and the Joker in Nolan's 'The Dark Knight'.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, fans can rest easy that Webb doesn't take his movie down a similarly dark and gloomy path- instead, there is much cheer and spark in the romance between Parker and classmate Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), who proves to be a much more interesting character than Mary-Jane Watson ever was in three films. That's undoubtedly a result of the chemistry between reel-turned-real life sweethearts Garfield and Stone, but a key difference here is that Stacy is no longer just the sweet girl-next-door but a smart and sassy individual perfectly capable of being Parker's intellectual equal. Their romance has the zing of Webb's earlier 'Summer', and more than justifies why the commercials director was chosen over so many others to take the helm of this movie.<br/><br/>Webb also has much fun with Parker's discovery of his newfound superhuman capabilities before the film takes a more decidedly serious tone- and a subway scene where the lanky teenager easily overpowers five other burly men in the same carriage (while ripping the clothes off another lady passenger) is neatly choreographed and adroitly staged. Ditto another where he hijacks a car-jacking thief in action (briefly seen in the trailers), which also marks the start of a tongue-in-cheek move he makes whenever some villain refuses to shut up or confess. <br/><br/>In between the intricate webs of romance, comedy and drama, Webb weaves in another layer of action that perfectly complements the earlier elements. The first major setpiece on the Williamsburg Bridge sets the tone for the rest to follow- eschewing all-out spectacle for more emotionally-driven thrills- culminating in a harrowing rescue of a young boy from a burning car hanging off the side of the bridge that proves to be unexpectedly moving. Likewise the climactic sequence set atop a New York skyscraper (similarity to 'The Avengers' aside) has more emotional beats than you would expect- in particular relating to Spiderman's status as a masked vigilante- and ends on a surprisingly sombre note that brings the human dimensions of the tale to a fully satisfying finish.<br/><br/>A huge reason why Webb's drama-centric approach works is the excellent casting. There's no other way to describe it than to say that Garfield is brilliant as Parker/ Spiderman. He nails the tongue-in-cheek one- liners, and navigates the character beats between tortured teenager and born-again superhero with admirable ease. We've said this before, but we'd mention it again- his scenes with Stone sparkle with verve. And not unlike Raimi's original, his scenes with supporting leads Martin Sheen and Sally Field provide some of the most heartwarming moments in the movie. To compare Garfield's performance with that of Maguire's is inconsequential really, and it suffices to say that Garfield brings a different, but no less unique, personality to the iconic character.<br/><br/>Indeed, the same can be said of the film as a whole, reassembling the familiar elements of Spiderman's origin story into a refreshing blend of action and emotion. Working off the template of Raimi's original and inspired by recent character-driven superhero movies, Webb delivers an emotionally thrilling and adrenaline-pumping blockbuster that counts amongst one of the best Marvel page-to-screen adaptations. And unlike post-conversion efforts, the decision to shoot in 3D ensures that the POV shots of Spiderman swinging down Fifth Avenue or battling the Lizard atop the Oscorp skyscraper are positively vertiginous, adding an additional dimension of excitement especially when viewed in IMAX."

","It dragged on and I couldn't wait for it to end. I wasted $17. It's a very cliché movie. I would've rather have seen some cheesy Disney movie. I think Spiderman is overexpose and so are most of the other comic character movies coming out. I was dragged into seeing this movie by my friend. I would've rather seen Magic Mike or something more entertaining than this recycled material. I think Hollywood is running out of ideas. I wish I could get my $17 back. That would be nice. Also, I think Emma Stone was a bad casting move. I didn't like the hideous boots she wore throughout the movie. I just didn't enjoy it. Save your money and go see Ted the Movie....."
"sidv8489","10","49","98","24 June 2012"," Does total justice to the marvel comics storyline... Lot better than the earlier movie version....
","For the first time in life I had the privilege of watching a movie before its release and I must say that I was pretty ""Amazed"". Those people who are mentioning that this movie has shades of twilight , they have certainly not read the original storyline of the comics. The romance of Peter and Gwen Stacy was needed because it certainly is going to be very useful in its sequels. The climax fight between spidey and lizard is really a money's worth. I had really not expected much after I came to know that this movie was directed by a person who has just directed one movie and several music videos. If you are the one who had same thoughts then you are truly in for a surprise. Marc Webb has done an excellent work in doing justice to the comic book character of Peter Parker, unlike Sam Raimi. The blend of emotions and action is what makes this movie a great one. Comic book fans will surely understand the reason for Gwen Stacy's romance with Parker. The action scenes are just too great. At times you can feel that you are actually in Spidey's shoes. Andrew Garfield does a fantastic job and just fits in well with the shy , nerdy character of Peter like that in comics , unlike Tobey whom i always found unfit for the role of Spiderman.. From the storyline one might get a hint that Spidey may join the Avengers team next time. But now that's for Marvel to decide. All in All, this is a must watch for everyone (esp. those who are ardent fans of The Amazing Spiderman comic books)"
"liior","3","51","103","7 July 2012"," I cannot express my disappointment.
","I love superhero movies, they capture our intangible desires, and at times take us to a different world. However, with this horrible remake, I only begged for the movie to end faster. The first 45 minutes of the movie was by far the worst set up I have ever seen; I was falling asleep. The dialogue was BEYOND cheesy, and the performances were mediocre. It felt like the original plan was to make a romance flick and add spiderman as a bonus. The movie is a reboot of the franchise, but why oh why are the events almost identical to the original spiderman! My biggest disappointment, by far, was the lack of epic action scenes, they were all quick and boring. The parallels were weak and super corny: (not a spoiler) there was a scene where Peter forgets to bring eggs home, some time later he brings the eggs and it becomes a magical moment in cinema. Also, the lizard...was extremely unrealistic, almost to the point of laughter. Character development was poor and left me hanging. The plot points were childish, cliché and meaningless. I'm sure some of you have seen the 4 minute trailer they released? That's as good as it gets. The trailer literally had every action scene and included all the interesting shots. It's like I was watching a 2 hour long version of the trailer, what a fail. There was nothing amazing about the amazing spiderman, I defiantly would not recommend wasting your money on it. Instead, just keep rewatching the 4 minute trailer! Much more entertaining!"
"babettekittie","5","63","130","5 July 2012"," Disappointing all around
","It was a decent film but now worth full price admission on opening day. The story was lacking and I was actually bored a lot of the time. It had plenty of comedy to break the boredom but it shouldn't have had to. <br/><br/>The graphics were great but couldn't save it.<br/><br/>The acting was sub-par compared to other recent Marvel films. The guy playing Spidey has a HUGE head and it was actually distracting. There was one part involving the cops that REALLY made me hate the movie (No this is NOT a spoiler)- as the lizard went about his rampage in the city the cops focus on catching Spider-Man which is like...Really?! Lizard attacking city but worry about a vigilante whose trying to help. Great. Awesome. <br/><br/>This is NOT the Spidey I like and I now I would never buy this on DVD. <br/><br/>Only redeeming part was Stan Lee's cameo, which was hilarious!"

","What a disappointment... Squeezed between the awesomeness of The Avengers & the anticipation of The Dark Knight Rises, The Amazing Spiderman looked to be bringing us a grittier, more character driven take on our hero with Mark Webb (500 Days of Summer) in the directors chair, and Andrew Garfield & Emma Stone in tow. Unfortunately we instead have to suffer through nearly 2 & a half hours of pouting & gesturing from Garfield (It's like he's imitating Edward from Twilight I swear...) & a whole bunch of action scenes that are nothing you haven't seen done better before (& in better movies). And why does everyone seem to know Peter Parker is Spiderman? Isn't his identity meant to be secret?!? Spidey seems to spend more time in this film with his mask off, than he does with his mask on. I'm sure given his last name Webb thought he was born to make this film, but seriously, I preferred Spiderman 3... & that's really saying something! Stay home, pull that copy of Spiderman 2 off your shelf, and save your money for Batman in a few weeks. You'll be glad you did."

Peter Parker's dad created radioactive spiders???? Uhh Bullshit 2. Since when could Spiderman skateboard? 3.

"samarth-sri","6","44","89","18 July 2012"," Not so amazing spiderman
","Even though many reviewers are calling this as improvement over Spiderman 1 but I think otherwise. First of the franchise would have done better to make a sequel instead of rebooting everything - with new actors. Since spiderman 3 did not live upto expectations, people started criticizing both Toby & Kirsten. I think they did a pretty good job (even part 3 was not awfully bad). But rebooting doesn't make sense. That too, only after 10yrs. They should have waited another 25-30 yrs for that. <br/><br/>Also they should have taken some lessons from the way X-men & Batman franchises have gone. Batman (1989) was possibly the only good movie in batman series and there was plenty of scope for improvement. That's what they did, starting with Batman Begins, Dark Knight & D K Rises (pretty sure it's going to be bigger than Amazing Spiderman, possibly overtake even Avengers). Stronger plot, better acting, better direction, dialogues, action sequences, CGI effects etc. They took it to a whole new level. In case of X-men, they started pretty well with X-men 1,2 but had couple of blunders in between. But they corrected it X-men first class. My first X-men movie was X-men FC which was very likable that I watched all the other ones too. But the need for a prequel of X-men was there. Since Charles Xavier and Magneto had worked together as shown in earlier movies. Spiderman 1 already had almost everything (may be a bit rushed though but so is Amazing SM). If there was anything needed, it was a sequel or a completely new plot not a reboot. At the end of the movie, I felt like it was a nice movie BUT WAS THERE ANY NEED FOR IT ?<br/><br/>PS - Some improvements are definitely there but there are some let downs as well, the movie has many scenes rushed into it. BUT I'll prefer Spiderman (2002) over ASM."
"Balzer13","2","69","147","4 July 2012"," Boring movie made by exec committee
","When I saw the trailer I thought it looked like a C grade movie - ya know not too amazing but not terrible. Then I read the reviews which painted it more of a B grade due to the good acting etc. Just saw it last night and I'd say it's closer to D grade. Other than some real chemistry by the two leads and nice nuanced moments, the film was clearly developed and created by Sony executives rather than the writers or the previously very talented director. Marc Webb's 500 Days of Summer was the Amazing movie on his resume, not this horribly realized and surprisingly boring film. Nothing in it worked: not the set pieces where the action itself was very choppy and confusing and worst of all, not engaging or thrilling. My guess is that Sony needed a hit desperately, felt they had the secret to a successful movie learned from the other 3 Spiderman's, and felt they could push around the writers and the action-inexperienced director and what came out was this very poorly realized film on every level. On the one hand I want it to do well because I think the director is very talented and I want him to have enough success to show us how amazing he can really be on future movies, on the other hand, I'm hoping it under performs and forces all would be controlling movie executives to let good writers and directors do their best work and make good movie instead of subjecting us to a Frankenstein's monster of a film like The Amazing Spiderman."

","Yet another disappointing superhero ""blockbuster"". I don't think this film can quite work out what it wanted to be. At times there were elements of a darker more serious tone which worked well. But then these moments were spoiled with the usual fast camera editing style of the action scenes which at some points you could not work out what was going on (though I suppose if your of the Call of Duty & Transformers generation this will be appealing to you). Absolutely nothing new or interesting in the terms of plot , the same old good guy who accidentally turns himself bad and ends in a CGI city fight like almost all these Superhero action films endings. Convenient and predictable scenes (the crane scene at the end is just laughable). Good points - I like the new Spiderman, he really captures the ""Smart Ass"" style Spiderman well and is a lot better than the Emo-Spiderman the other one was."

","It seems Hollywood is more interested in the special affects rather than the story line. Granted this is a fantasy movie however trying to make certain aspects of the film realistic creates more interest for the viewer.<br/><br/>With that said this film provides more plot holes and ridiculous reactions by the cast mixing it up with great special affects, like that's somehow supposed to balance everything out. So here is my top 10 fails of this film: <br/><br/>10: Even though New York's finest has almost every possible weaponry and air transport available, somehow getting Spiderman to Oscorp to face the beast is top priority.<br/><br/>9. The Chief of police gets to Oscorp to help Spiderman defeat the beast. You heard me ONLY the Chief, not some 200 SWAT and policeman able to repel from helicopters or if anything shoot from the helicopters with missiles, machine guns, etc. No lets only take the Chief there and give him only a shotgun. Yea that's believable.....<br/><br/>8. Being a Dad I can tell you if I walked into a room of my 17 year old daughter and finding a boy that I had no idea was there, didn't even know him or for that matter looked as though he sold drugs, I can tell you I would be livid not passive and calm like old Chief there! <br/><br/>7.Speaking of yet ANOTHER scene of parents being completely brainless in this film, how many moms out there wouldn't mind walking in on their 17 year old daughter sucking face with her boyfriend while his hands get to the point of going below the neck line? The makers of this film thought nothing of it. Another failed parenting moment by the producers of this crap film! <br/><br/>6. After dinner with the Gwen's parents ol' Pete makes an exit off the 20 story Apt roof. Plot hole here is why its never mentioned by the parents as to how Peter left since he never went out their front door that they happened to be by. <br/><br/>5. How did Gwen get around in record speed time? For all I know she flew there. Yea doesn't make sense but in this film apparently when it comes to logic it doesn't have to.<br/><br/>4. Yet ANOTHER failed parenting spoiler! There is a monster loose possibly creating a catastrophic bio weapon set to detonate over the city yet the 17 year old Gwen is able to freely run around New York while Mom and Dad blindly fail to make her first priority trying to find her and get her home. Really?!?!?!? <br/><br/>3. Peter Parkers Parents: The whole climax of the previews it seemed was about the history of his folks. The movie wastes time only to conclude them to dying in a airplane crash and helping with the design of the proposed cure Oscorp was working on. This could of been marked down to a simple ten minute explanation and not the 45 min bore fest the movie gave.<br/><br/>2. The Lizard affects was a HUGE let down! Nuff said! <br/><br/>1. I'm watching this film lead to believe EVERYTHING the two leads are doing is remotely possible? Keep in mind people they are only SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD?!?!?!? I guess when you have brainless parents in a script, no structure or rules to live by, an endless supply of funds to provide the items they need, kids can do anything."
"Wscott3322","4","37","75","4 July 2012"," Short Review
","The main actor for SM was much better than Toby. They girlfriend was a lot better looking than Kirston Durnst. But the fact of the matter was that the script was terrible. There were a few bit and pieces of action but the main story was a love story or no story. I would recommend you go see the Avengers again or wait for Batman. Or just rent it. I almost fell asleep. I have most likely seen 90% of every movie ever made and am a huge fan of superhero films. Saw the Avengers 3x in one week. This film is a total yawner. The main villain is just hard to believe and was poorly cast. Special effects were OK, sound was OK. I was forced due to times to see it in 3D which I hate. But the 3D was actually decent for this film."

","Being an ardent fan of Spiderman series I awaited eagerly for this movie and I was totally disappointed with the Story .<br/><br/>The Story was heavily Modified from Scratch. First They have changed the story on lot places and even Spidey's Character . I would not mind the story but the real spider-man was a real nerd and did not just google around for things! he understood neo-genics very well and did not just steal his fathers formula and write it down for Dr. Curt Conners.<br/><br/>Secondly Spidey doesnot go around revealing secrets of his pals to some Cops who don't even trust him. Dr. Curt conners was a great person who at least in Human form wished to retain a normal life.<br/><br/>Third the Action sequences were utter crap compared to the previous Movies. Spidey gets shot multiple times I mean Where the hell was his Spider sense in such situations .<br/><br/>Finally It would have been great if they had focused on how he built that Web shooting device of his and how his suit was supposed to be a excellent armor.<br/><br/>I hated a lot of things like the Stupid Romance scenes that ate up most of the time that could be used for good action sequences !"

","Movie was not bad but was expecting something different than the last time. The only thing changed was the story, that would not be appreciated by comic lover round the world. Spider man has somehow become more of a Romeo than a super hero. The super hero movies are now being produced to entertain a wide range of people, which is why I feel they have lost their intensity. The way these movies are coming out day is not far when middle aged mothers would be watching these with their little daughters. The creators these days have somehow become very sensitive and are now coming up with crying heroes. I hope the new batman movie would be better than The Amazing Spider Man.<br/><br/>Please someone ask these creators to grow some balls and come up with movies like Predator, Terminator, Rambo, Matrix etc. Rather than remaking the same set of movies again and again ask them to come up with some original ideas, and not such amazing ideas."
"dp-17275","7","4","5","26 February 2019"," It ain't bad
","It's a good movie, I recommend it. It really does nothing new with the Spider-man character but its a fun watch. Andrew Garfield fits into the role of Spider-man perfectly, but struggles to become Peter Parker; since Andrew Garfield does not have that same boyish charm Tobey Maguire had, he is not a nerd and you never believe it. The villain is pretty good, very over the top, but in the first 40 minutes he's interesting and unique, until he isn't. The villain is the lizard and seeing him fighting Spider-man is fun. The music is acceptable, it gives Spider-man a nice theme you can hum and the movie is quite inspiring. The end fight is very fun to watch and if you invest in the characters enough, you can feel some emotion in the end. Gwen Stacy is an excellent character and has great chemistry with Peter Parker. The origin story is kinda fascinating until you realize it's a more dumb downed version of the Raimi origin story. Uncle Ben literally says 'with great power comes great responsibility' but he couldn't say that exactly because then people would accuse it of being too similar, instead he says ""Your father had a philosophy, that if you could do good things for other people, you would've had a moral obligation to do those things. that's whats at stake, not choice....Responsibility' such a dumb downed speech. Excellent special effects and sometimes does feel like an attempt to 'Dark knight' Spider-man but regardless of that it's a very fun movie and I highly recommend watching it but don't try to compare it with the original because then it won't be fun."
"divncom","5","38","79","4 July 2012"," Workman like, mild thrills - uneven direction; overall lacking in purpose.
","Why did we need a Spiderman reboot when there are so many other ideas that could have been brought to life with the same budget, cast and direction?<br/><br/>The singular answer is that the studio sees this and every other huge budget comic book extravaganza as an investment. A huge one. When you're monkeying around with an investment on this scale, you're conservative: You make just enough semi-relevant changes to justify the films existence. <br/><br/>That just doesn't cut it though for such an iconic character. You must either accept or reject the notion that, in the end, all you will be receiving with this title is a slightly different take on the same old story. Don't walk into the theater expecting reinvention of the wheel.<br/><br/>If you can completely embrace the notion that you will be force fed the same formulaic origins story from start to finish with pin point precision in playing identical emotional notes to its forbearer - you won't be severely disappointed. There just isn't a rational reason to have to lower your expectation, though. <br/><br/>The primary reason I find this Spiderman unacceptable isn't that the character is boring. It isn't that the actors are bad - they aren't. Garfield is a particularly good Spiderman; better than Maguire. <br/><br/>The main reason this film is unacceptable is that the bar has moved drastically. Hardcore comic book fans are packing the theaters with higher expectations than ever; the genre has evolved so to speak. With titles like X-Men first Class, The Avengers and The Dark Knight films in the same universe - this Spidey simply doesn't have the same impact as the ten years old predecessor. <br/><br/>In this new, evolved universe fans are more savvy. We now expect the thrill rating to ratchet up higher; the contours to be more dynamic. We expect to see ensembles; teams and entire casts of superhero's working together in the same universe ... the Marvel movie universe. We expect a degree of suspense. This film has no suspense- of course not; not when we've seen it already before it begins. <br/><br/>What we have here is something that might have been great 10 years ago. It's not great now; it's profoundly average in the context of the other comic book films surrounding it. <br/><br/>If it's at all legally possible, I would sincerely hope that Spiderman exist (in a clearly defined and visible way) within the Marvel Universe that has so rapidly expanded ... leaving the web slinger in his own niche only makes him that much more insignificant. <br/><br/>My hope is that somehow Spidey can be incorporated into the Marvel Universe in much the same way the Avengers worked; or in much the same way X-Men first class worked. Adding some comic book buddies will take some of the weight off of Garfield's shoulders ... he's a good Spiderman but I don't feel he can carry the load alone. <br/><br/>Until then, it's the same old story - and your friendly neighborhood Spiderman is awfully lonely relying on the same old schtick."
"namashi_1","6","34","70","29 June 2012"," Watch It for Andrew Garfield's Winning Performance!
","'The Amazing Spider Man' lacks the excitement in comparison to the legendary the trilogy directed by Sam Raimi. But if you look at it as a new story all together, it offers some interesting moments. But, for me, this film works primarily for one reason: Andrew Garfield's Winning Performance as Peter Parker / Spider-Man! <br/><br/>'The Amazing Spider-Man' Synopsis: Peter Parker finds a clue that might help him understand why his parents disappeared when he was young. His path puts him on a collision course with Dr. Curt Connors, his father's former partner.<br/><br/>'The Amazing Spider Man' is fabulously shot & grandly made. But, I personally felt, that, the Screenplay wasn't up-to the mark. To give its due rightfully, there are some very interesting sequences & the action set-pieces are excellent, but overall, the desired impact, seems a bit missing. <br/><br/>Screenplay by James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent & Steve Kloves has merits, but it could've been stronger nonetheless. Marc Webb's Direction is stylish. Cinematography is perfect. Editing is vast. Graphics are outstanding. Action set-pieces, as mentioned, are excellent.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Andrew Garfield is up for top honors. The actor is fantastic as Peter Parker / Spider-Man! Its a performance that deserves immense praise. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy, does a good job. Rhys Ifans as Dr. Curt Connors / The Lizard, plays the menace easily. Martin Sheen as Ben Parker & Sally Field as May Parker are impressive, as always. Denis Leary as Captain George Stacy, is in command after a long time. Irrfan Khan as Dr. Rajit Ratha, deserved more footage. <br/><br/>On the whole, 'The Amazing Spider Man' isn't Amazing, but stunning to look at nevertheless."
"cdaddy","1","60","132","3 July 2012"," Not a good movie
","This movie is as bad as the previews. The direction was bad, the acting was bad there was major plot holes. I had no interest in really any of the characters. The action was boring also. There was zero chemistry between spiderman and Emma Stone. I almost walked out about midway but I wanted to give it a chance. The lizard man looked really lame also. One thing I hate when I am watching a movie is the characters motivation, why is he/she doing this or that? I should not be asking myself ""why is this character doing that"". I am also really sick and tired of nearly 30 year old actors playing 16 year olds! Spoiler alert!! I though Spiderman was in college, he is playing a high school kid? I loved some of the actors in this movie but I did not like them in this. The action was bad, I kept thinking to myself, isn't this the same thing we saw in the other spiderman movies? I thought the choice for spiderman was really bad. He did not do a good job. I really didn't like this movie."
"samuraispiders","4","63","140","21 June 2012"," Twilight Spiderman, Are you team Spiderman or team Parker?
","I apologize ahead of time if there is bad spelling or grammar. This  being my first review for IMDb, I wanted it to be a positive one and I  was waiting for The Amazing Spider-man to do it. I must admit I had  high expectations for this movie. Setting myself for High expectation  is not a great thing to do, because it could never live up to my  expectations. I knew I would be let down a little. I had no idea that  my expectation would be crushed. First thing I should start off with.  If you are expecting a Spider-man story, don't. Expect a Peter Parker  love story with some great action. I have read spider-man stories for  years and I loved the connection that Gwen Stacey and Spider-man had  together. What I do not like is twihard, romance novel like eye candy  up on the screen. When sitting in the movie, I had to deal with the  girls talking about how hot they thought Peter Parker was. My immediate  thought was ""Peter is me, a nerd, sense when has any girl found me  attractive?"" I realized that he was the epitome of what tweens found  attractive. He may be playing a nerd but he certainly does not look  like one. Then I experienced something that I hope no spider-man fan  should ever go through. when Peter took of his clothes, My EARS FELT  LIKE THEY WHERE GOING TO SPLIT OPEN! Because the girls in the theater  screamed so loud for peter having no shirt on. I should have sold my  ticket on ebay. There was redeeming factors for this movie, like I said  before there is some great action and an amazing cast to pull it off.  The relationship between Peter, Dr.Connors and the friction between  Captain Stacy was great. The origin story of Peter seemed more  plausible then Sam's Spider-man (More realistic?) But what made this  crushingly unwatchable, for me, was the way the romance was written,  then seeing it play out. This coming from a guy who love some well  written romance movies (like The Notebook). What I am trying to say is. Headline for this movie should be. Spider-man, a love story.  Maybe I am over reacting. I did see it with a bunch of screaming girls.  If you are going to see this movie. Whether you think it will be good  or not, see it a good two weeks after the release to avoid the large  Twilight crowd."
"Jamesx57","5","24","48","6 July 2012"," Wait for netflix.
","I did not care for this movie much at all.<br/><br/>I loved the parts where it differed from the previous ones but... man there's a lot I caught when I saw it twice.<br/><br/>Spoilers:<br/><br/>1) When he washed out through the sewers under water and then he gasped and breathed heavily/rapidly outside of it- all through his soaking wet mask with no trouble....<br/><br/>There is no reason he should have left the mask on.. and I find it absurd that they didn't consider wet cloth over your face is a legit form of torture.<br/><br/>2) He never tells Guinn that the doctor is the giant lizard.. and then they talk casually about how he's responsible for giving up the equation that helped turn her boss into it. What. There needed to be reaction from her to it.<br/><br/>3) The humor they tried to force a few time (like the car burglar scene) is just not funny. Lines like those need facial expressions to deliver and even then... Well, that's certainly a point for debate.<br/><br/>4) The crane scene towards the end when he misses the first one then literally out of nowhere a new one is there to pull him up. I mean seriously, there was a huge overview of the street half a second before that shows well in front of the first crane that the heli spotlights. There was NO crane before it and no cables in the shot as it panned down when he fell.... =\<br/><br/>5) Also in that crane scene- what the heck? 5.1 - Crane people don't work in the middle of the night. 5.2 - Nobody (let alone 5 or 6 people) would rush into work (in under 5 min) because a fellow crane operator has a friend who's kid was saved by spider-man. ...during a city evacuation. 5.3 - One tiny back and forth in an argument is just not enough for that amount of seemingly sudden support for spider-man. If there was an obvious feeling of public support throughout the movie, the crane scene should have been longer with people getting texts and running up to help... with or without the hardhats they still had on in the middle of the night...<br/><br/>6) Guinn calls him spider-man when she whispers to him long before the bridge scene when he has to stop and think of a name for himself when the dad of the saved kid asked. (I am not talking about the scene she calls him ""bug boy"" later in the movie)<br/><br/>7) Why was there no funeral for Uncle Ben? Why didn't Guinn go to that funeral and make Peter ""missing"" her dad's funeral be even more sad?<br/><br/>8) What is with all the cgi lizards in New York? One tiny scene would have made that awesome and understandable. Just show the Dr looking at a ton of them in the lab and maybe even show him bringing them to the sewer. But nope.. The Dr didn't do that and he's not explicitly responsible for them. The first lizard is one the Dr sees in the sewer which makes him have the idea to set up base there. They didn't even show any in the lab either."
"alexdelliott","6","27","55","10 July 2012"," it was a nice surprise when it actually turned out to be good
","STORY Well the story is fairly obvious, guy gets bitten by spider....guy becomes Spider-Man. It has been seen. However, its the other subplots and character developments which make this film actually (in my opinion) better than the 2002 film. I felt more attached to the characters like Uncle Ben for example. I won't go into details as I don't give spoilers but it was more emotional, and characters were much more relatable. The only real flaws I thought were the villain who's scenes felt a little rushed and the film didn't dwell on his character enough, and also the fact that Peter just wasn't nerdy enough, although that may be down to casting. 3/5<br/><br/>EXECUTION Firstly, I really enjoyed the directing, and with the 3D it did actually look pretty impressive. The camera work was smooth and really made each scene stand out especially the ones that actually showed Spider-Man. The acting was good all round, I think Martin Sheen stole some of the scenes he was in and Rhys Ifans played the part of Dr Connors really well, although he probably was't seen enough as I would have liked. Andrew Garfield is a good actor but I'm just not sure he's right for this role, Spider-Man is meant to be the repressed but sarcastic science geek and that just wasn't carried out well. This is just nit picking though, the film was executed very well in my opinion. 4/5<br/><br/>CONCLUSION After being dragged to this film by some mates, it was a nice surprise when it actually turned out to be good. It was slightly more gritty and emotional than the 2002 film whilst staying true to its roots. I'd recommend a watch as its probably worth seeing. At the very least I think people will be glad they saw it. 3/5 + 4/5 = 7/10"
"jayme-elsea","1","47","103","9 July 2012"," Just really bad
","This is not spider-man this is more like a spoof. I have never felt so bored watching a movie. I actually hated peter parker in this movie and spider-man is a joke. Many scenes show his skills and how strong he is but when he is in a real fight he gets toss around like a rag doll. He even gets shot later in the movie where was his spider sense? A very weak movie its nothing like what spider-man should be. Very little action and a lot of nonsense drama that can be confusing at times. The spidey suit in this movie looks horrible and it made the whole movie that much cheesier. They even show peter making the mask and he uses sunglass lenses in the mask. How is he suppose to see at night looking through sunglasses? Maybe thats why is kept getting beat up through out the movie he couldn't see. All in all a big waste of time."
"psionchronicles","5","23","46","30 July 2012"," You'll Frown! You'll Cry! You'll Kiss 10 Bucks Goodbye!
","Rating this movie comes down to a value judgment. If you are an aficionado of the silver age comic books, it may leave you wanting. Significant liberties were taken with the characters and their story lines to create a Spider-Man that today's kids may relate to more, as well as to improve the believability overall. Is Andrew Garfield the Peter Parker we grew up with? Hardly. But he's a Peter Parker that makes sense in 2012. The original Peter Parker was better played by Toby Maguire--straight-edge to the point of sickening, always worrying about his Aunt May getting upset. This Peter Parker, like a typical teen, wants as little to do with ""'rent"" figures as possible. Gwen Stacy has been updated as well; her demeanor is more like that of a 30-year-old than a teen in the beginning, then she deteriorates into a love object straight out of any teen exploitation television series. Martin Sheen and Sally Field are good choices for their roles, but again, you need to be ready for major storyline alterations. It is as if the writer and director went out of their ways to change things for the sake of changing them.<br/><br/>My chief complaint about the movie is the CGI. CGI is like makeup on a woman: it should only be used by someone who knows what they are doing, and usually less is more. As many years as Hollywood has been using it, very little progress has been made in making organic things look realistic; the technology so far lends itself much better to machinery and starships than to living things. The Lizard looks like a setback to the original Shrek animation--clumsy and cartoonish. Even the Geico gecko is more convincing. Hopefully in my lifetime, they will perfect the movement techniques to the point where most CGI looks real and not like a FPS game.<br/><br/>To be fair, if they were going to reboot a franchise, they couldn't just repackage old ideas. The movie is watchable, regardless of your background. But a sequel to it probably wouldn't be. I shudder to think what this crew would do to the Green Goblin."

Andrew Garfield is low-key my favourite Spiderman, and although his second film isn't worth the paper the script was printed on, his first outing was amazing.

"AloneInTheMorgue","1","42","92","6 July 2012"," With this poor movie launched, a new era of exploitation from Hollywood begins
","I voted this movie 1 out of 10 for Two reasons: <br/><br/>1. In my book, The Amazing Spider Man severely ruined the beloved Spider Man experience that I had when I watched the previous Spider Man films. The Absence of memorable Characters like Mary Jane Watson, J. Jonah Jameson and others sabotaged the Spider Man experience that we witnessed in the former Spider Man films. In addition, as put by many critics before me, this ""Amazing"" Spider Man is weak, he's far from being amazing. He's not a super hero, he's amateur. Furthermore, this lizard villain is absolutely preposterous - what kind of a villain wants civilians to be as strong and as progressive as he is? Even more ridiculous is the lizard's views on his ""draconian"" plot, which he sees as a noble cause for humanity. Other flaws that I can point out are how easily Peter Parker managed to prevail security systems in order to investigate the labs where his father had worked, and where Parker got bitten by the mutant spider; and Parker's childish relationship with Gwen Stacy. In conclusion - The Amazing Spider Man lacks a well-thought plot and this is what you get - a weak, poor Twilight film costumed in Spidey's red and blue suit that is not deserved to be worn by this version of Peter Parker. <br/><br/>2. The Amazing Spider Man premiered solely Five years after Spider Man 3 was launched. Top executives in Hollywood didn't even bother to wait at least Ten years to renew the Spider Man movie series. Do we really want to live in a world where Hollywood renews movie series merely Five years after they end? The Amazing Spider Man, which is not on par with the original Spider Man series, might be the beginning of a new destructive phenomenon whose worst implication might be the hampering and decomposition of creativity in Hollywood films, a unique creativity that we witnessed in many films, among them the original Spider Man series, for that matter. This worst case scenario might occur due to the exposure and success that The Amazing Spider Man achieves worldwide. Given these ground breaking profits that The Amazing Spider Man gains, it's only reasonable to assume that Hollywood executives will prefer renewing a film franchise rather than risking potential profits with shooting a new revolutionary film or continuing an existing film series. <br/><br/>Like the movie industry didn't suffer enough of utter lack in creativity. Hollywood most certainly looks green around the gills nowadays."

","Let me start off by saying that I loved the original in 2002 and i had so many doubts going into this movie, I honestly thought it was going to be awful but I am so happy I have been proved wrong!! I own almost all of the spider-man comics and have read them all. I am so pleased with the web shooters, in 2002 they took them away and thats like taking superman's cape away. Organic webbing didn't take place in the comics until around I believe 2004. The casting was excellent, I've never been a fan of Emma Stone but she played Gwen Stacy perfect and Andrew Garfield was born to play Peter Parker, he was excellent. Rhys Ifans did a great job portraying Dr. Connors and Aunt May and Uncle Ben were casted great to. The 3D was pretty good and I was surprised how good the CGI for the Lizard was. It does get a little romantic at some points and that disappointed a few but it wasn't overdone. The action scenes were phenomenal. Marc Webb did a great job with this movie and I am looking forward to what he has in store next. STAY FOR THE POST CREDIT SCENE!! IT REVEALS THE NEXT VILLAIN!

","The Amazing Spider-Man is one of the greatest superhero movies ever made, and is bring the story of Peter Parker to a whole new, and exciting level that will keep you deeply interested.<br/><br/>One of the best things about this movie, which makes it such a successful superhero movie is how closely it follows the comics. For example, the most obvious is that Gwen Stacy is the love interest, instead of Mary Jane Watson. And Peter actually has to be smart enough to build his own webbing, instead of them being handed to him by the radioactive spider.<br/><br/>Which leads me into the fact that the movie nailed the character of Peter Parker, a.k.a. Spider-Man. He's not a social outcast like the original trilogy, but he's a sarcastic, socially awkward, genius which makes him much more entertaining then the original movie. It's believable that a girl could fall for Peter, unlike in the original where it seems absurd that Mary Jane would stoop herself so low. Andrew Garfield is born to be Spider-Man!<br/><br/>In fact, every single cast member did their job and exceeded all possible extensions. You care about almost every single character, no matter how much screen time they get.<br/><br/>ALMOST every single character, the exception being May Parker. But the attention she was given in the original trilogy goes to Ben Parker. But with more character development in the sequel, Aunt May could become just as endearing as she was in the original.<br/><br/>The fight scenes were superb, with Stan Lee having his most hilarious cameo in a Marvel movie yet! The use of webbing and acrobatics keeps people entertained from the second a fight sequence begins. They far exceed the quality of the original trilogy.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was much better then the original trilogy, and I have high hopes for the sequel. I HIGHLY recommend this movie."

","**** Spoilers****** I found the movie mediocre at best. The story line was poor and the way Peter Parker was explaining his secret was not how it was in the comics or the previous versions. I know this is the first of the many new Spider - Man Movies but the way they concluded it made it felt as they just wanted to end the movie. The sudden mode changes from the villain or the missing dialog with his uncle that made him become a super hero made the movie a mess. The only part I did like was that the villain didn't die and he only went to jail as in previous Spider - Man movies they always died in someway. I would suggest the writers to make a more solid plot instead of having so much circumstantial event that made story. You can still go an watch it but don't get your hopes up."

","The key to spidey is that's a super hero for kid. Raimi had understood this and his movies were indeed great. Here, it's not more the case and our friendly neighborhood becomes a silly costumed crusader. <br/><br/>I really don't understand why the production wanted a such aggressive spiderman: Discovreing his power, peter punches commuters in the subway. His drive to be spidey is to punch endlessly thugs to see their wrists! Finally, when he does Spidey, it's only at night except for a fight in his high school or in an intelligent mirror effect for his 1st appearance. As peter, he shouts to his uncle, his aunt and the father of his girlfriend! His casting reminds me of Christensen in star wars prequels because this Garfield has the same darkside about him.<br/><br/>The rest is also pathetic: The Mays are horrible as well in characters or in casting. Lizard might be okay but his ties with Peter is unbelievable. The Stacys are OK but killing Captain is useless: what's the point to develop a character and a tension if it's not meant to last. And if Emma Stone is a good surprise here, it's just because Dunst was always boring and uninspired. <br/><br/>To resume, the first hour dragged horribly, the second makes you angry and it's only the final moment that you will find a decent Spidey but it's not enough and too late. Frankly, the only amazing thing in this movie may be Spidey's web because it's true that the new effects is bluffing.<br/><br/>In other words, with Raimi and Maguire movies, i was eager to buy the DVD while i won't even bother to download this one on the web!"
"teixcal-imdb","4","25","53","11 July 2012"," Overall disappointing
","Fans of Spider-man comics will still be waiting for an adaptation that truly reflects the mood of the comic-book after leaving the theatre from watching ""The Amazing Spider-man"". As an adaptation the film makes a very good composition of Peter Parker as an high-school student but fails completely in the Peter Parker as an ""adoptive son"" of his uncles. The relationship between Peter Parker and May Parker is incredibly misrepresented. As an adaptation, too much liberties are taken with other traits of the Spider-man character.<br/><br/>But, and as a film on its own, leaving aside the supposed adaptation status, The Amazing Spider-man is very unbalanced movie. Peter Parker is never a character one can really relate to. It is too schematic and lacks profundity. Also we never quite understand how other characters like Gwen Stacy and his own aunt May can be so sympathetic towards Peter Parker because his behaviour to keep is secret identity a secret come off as a real jerk. So all the sympathy towards Peter Parker is never believable. Is like people just decided that Parker is OK and nothing he does can change that. C'mon people, get real. The ""origins"" scene, when Parker acquires its spider-powers is also a very unbelievable one. It misses one thing to make it believable: the uniqueness. The way it was enacted, it sounds like anybody can acquire does powers if they found themselves in the position Peter is in, there is no circumstance that let it be a once-in-lifetime occasion and no repeatable to anyone once it happens to Peter Parker. And that kind of finishes everything for a super-hero film. It just doesn't work to think that any time tomorrow or the next day some other guy walks into a room and comes out another spider-man. The film is also very lengthy without any particular reason. It seems that scenes where just included to play with special effects and 3D. Since the special effects are really not particularly awesome it works against the film. The attempt to introduce a larger plot to be continued in sequels revolving around Peter Parker's parents also does not work because frankly the viewer never has anything in the plot that makes one care for Parker's parents. Overall the Amazing Spider-man is a disappointing film. It is not terrible. It is not good. Is ""watchable"" but leaves no impression whatsoever."
"The_Celluloid_Sage","7","2","2","6 April 2020"," Much better than baby face Maguire
","With a director called Webb, how could this not be amazing? Exactly, this is streets ahead of Raimi's offerings (despite personally being a huge Sam Raimi fan) but they really were too mushy and casual for my liking. Sony's new reboot of Marvel's Spider-Man hits all the right notes in my opinion, especially in the casting department. Maguire was just too...well, too wet for my liking. I have nothing against the guy so whether it was direction or script I'm not sure (or he just isn't an actor suited for that role). Garfield on the other hand nails the portrayal of Peter Parker as far as I am concerned with his geeky, cocky and youthful portrayal of everyone's favourite web-slinger.<br/><br/>The film opens to Peter (Garfield) shouting for his father in his fathers study. Drawers are open, papers thrown around and the room is in a state of general disarray. Peter's parents are hurriedly running around before leaving the house with him. They take Peter to his Uncle Ben's (Sheen) and Aunt May's (Field) house where he tries to eavesdrop on the conversation they have. Peter's parents then leave him there as they leave. We then quickly fast forward to the present day and to a teenage Peter along with all of his teenage problems and issues. During a clean out of the basement with his uncle Ben, Peter comes across a leather briefcase that belonged to his father leading to Peter to start investigating their disappearance all those years ago.<br/><br/>Ok so let us start with the major talking points regarding this film. Was it completely unnecessary and unneeded? Very likely so yes. Does that make it a pointless film? One could argue that yes it does (and I hate remakes, reboots, re-imaginings and re-whatever else) and this would fall into that category. Do I hold the same view with this film as say something like Tarantino ripping off every great foreign film he has ever seen? No I don't. Why? Well maybe I am a hypocrite and also maybe I don't really see superhero films or franchises like this being the same as a classic one-off film. Hell, this franchise has been done to death over the years, and yes I include the awesomely, terribly bad short-lived TV series too. Was five years long enough to wait to reboot the character again? I guess your mileage will vary depending on your personal opinion of the previous three films.<br/><br/>My personal opinion of the three preceding films wasn't great if I'm being honest. I'm sure many will hold them in high regard as the first decent Spider-Man films to have come along. I didn't for various reasons, including those I stated above. Was it also right or wrong for Sony to re-use many scenes or make them similar? Another debatable point indeed but they did and so it is what it is. The only thing there, is did they manage to improve on those instances. I for one think they did. Was the former trying to be a more mature Spider-Man rather than this version? I think they were aiming for that, but Maguire and Dunstan (in my opinion) ruined any chances of that along with the script they had to work with. Is this iteration perhaps aimed at a more younger audience? I would say so yes and I think it works, while this one also has its darker moments.<br/><br/>So what does this new reboot version have going for it? Well for one, and this is a big one, Garfield is head and shoulders better than Maguire in pretty much every aspect for me. His looks, his physique (and let's all remember folks and remove the rose-tinted from the Raimi films, Spidey was never big, never overly muscular or imposing in any way). Garfield was perfectly cast, acts the character wonderfully and is brilliant with his cockiness and the old Spidey sarcasm. My biggest issues with the Raimi films though is, Spidey wasn't really Spidey at all. Maybe I am biased with this one but I also feel the interaction between Peter and Gwen (Stone) is infinitely better, but then maybe I just prefer Emma to Kirsten.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast are equally as good, Ifans, Sheen and Leary all shine, though it is a shame (personally) that sheen did not have more screen time, but the time he does fill he fills big. Sally Field really doesn't have a lot to do in this one and is somewhat wasted for someone with her credentials, but like the others she does add a star quality and a 'name' to the cast. Ifans as Dr. Curt Connors is excellent and hams it up wonderfully as The Lizard. Likewise, Leary is near faultless as Gwen's father and Captain of the force. Other supporting characters are well cast and all play their parts well enough.<br/><br/>Another plus I have for this film is that it takes much longer for Peter to become Spider-Man. We get a lot more back-story regarding Peter and what happened with his parents than we ever did in the previous trilogy. I feel this is to the betterment of this new reboot and works well with our new antsy Parker. We learn more about Peter and thus connect with him better. The second huge plus for me is the web shooters. what was Raimi thinking in all seriousness? Back to how it should be, Peter showing his genius and intellect by designing his wrist worn web shooters. How they always have been, how they always should be. Spider-Man is just physically enhanced due to the spider toxins. He is not Brundle spider.<br/><br/>It really is a shame that Marvel did not keep Garfield on in the role of Parker/Spider-Man as I feel he really brought something to the suit. Overall though this is a funnier, less nerdy, more intricate telling of Spider-Man and his origins with a much more human and believable Peter Parker. if you have seen the Raimi trilogy and not caught this yet, just keep an open mind and enjoy a visually good looking film which is based in more physical reality. If you have not seen any of them, I personally really would just stick with this. Sorry Sam.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Sage's Rating: 7/10"
"friendkj","8","2","2","5 February 2020"," An entertaining film
","People viewed Spider-Man 3 as a bad sequel to the Spider-Man film franchise. While there was to be a Spider-Man 4, it was cancelled and what we got out of it was The Amazing Spider-Man. This time Peter Parker/Spider-Man is played by Andrew Garfield. For the most part, Andrew Garfield is a pretty good actor and is better than Tobey McGuire at times. The one downside to this film is that it's story resembles that of the 2002 Spider-Man film. We have an origins story with a little bit more background on Peter Parker. I think know more about the person is actually a nice touch. For example, Captain America: The First Avenger is a near perfect film. Only because we did not know a whole lot about Steve Rogers. We see a different type of Peter who is maybe not the nerdy, smart teenager like in the Tobey McGuire films, but rather a cocky, but likeable nonetheless kind of teenager. Which I just so happen to like. The acting overall is pretty good but nothing spectacular. The action scenes are done well, but maybe not on par with the other Marvel films that were around at the time. (Do remember that the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man films are not part of the MCU). With all of this being said, The Amazing Spider-Man is an entertaining film. But what this film fails in doing is offering something new. What do not get anything really new in this film. If you want a good alternative to the Tobey McGuire Spider-Man films, The Amazing Spider-Man and possibly it's sequel might be your film to watch."

","It wasn't very clear to me why would anyone make new Spider-man trilogy just five years after the previous one ended (quite poorly), but as I decided to see all Marvel flicks... I read IMDb reviews and cross myself. Tastes differ, that's a fact, but to rate this movie from one to three out of ten is nothing but spite. There is no way that anyone seriously thinks that this film is unwatchable crap, except of course if they look on the whole superhero genre that way, in which case it would be fairer not to evaluate it at all.<br/><br/>""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a reboot of the Spider-man franchise with a slightly different approach than Raimi's. The story is basically the same, but a bunch of details is changed. In some respects, this version is more faithful to the comic book, and in every respect I liked it better. The most obvious and critical difference is the characterization of Peter Parker, who, unlike the pathetic weenie from Raimi's version, is now a rebellious teenager with whom it is easier to identify. Also, Garfield is much more likable than Maguire, though he does not exactly fit the role of a nerd. The film has a great pace and balance of drama, action, and humor just to my liking. A little laughter, a little sitting on the edge of a chair, and two hours flew by. The only advantage of Raimi's version, very subjective though, is that, to me, Kirsten Dunst is much more attractive than Emma Stone, and the chemistry between her and Tobey is stronger than between Emma and Garfield.<br/><br/>8,5/10"

","Just to make this clear for some, this was the second spider man live action film i saw other than spider man 3 which i both watched years ago and this fil has always struck meas really being underappreciated and i am not necessarily saying that this film is perfect but it doe a lot right. for starters, andrew garfield really gives a charismatic and funny performance as the title character and the rest of the cast, particularly emma stone and rhys ifans all do well in their roles, creating characters who are both relatable and sympathetic. i know some of you would say i have bad taste but hear me out. i do like the sam raimi films although they are not my favorite marvel series. i would agree with many that the film does take several plot points from the first spider man but that was inevitable given that this is a origin story. however, this film has a pretty good if slightly uneven storyline, particularly with some storylines left underdeveloped such as the catching of uncle ben's killer although i thought this was a smart move to leave things open to interpretation and dr connors also could have used more scenes and this is from watching the deleted scenes on dvd, some of which could have added more to the film. the storyline of peters parents disappearing is also one which i enjoyed as it helped differentiate this film from its predecessors but was not given enough focus and the sequel did not really sort this out in a good way either. when i mean i rank this superior to the sam raimi trilogy, it is because when i watch the films now, they seem oo humorous, campy and cringe-worthy for me and while i do enjoy humor in films, i have always enjoyed films that are more serious in tone which this film does quite well although it is certainly not a batman begins. finally, i would also like to mention james horner's musical score which is both emotionally stirring and adreline fuelling and is excellent in portraying the emotions surrounding each scene. visual effects are also pretty stunning too. overall, if i had to ta rak this film, i would call it my favorite spiderman film and the best superhero film of 2012 although chronicle is a close second alongside dark knight rises. it is a shame though that the sequel could not match up to this one"

"DICK STEEL","10","26","57","29 June 2012"," A Nutshell Review: The Amazing Spider-Man
","I would never have thought Garfield as the right person for the job. But I'm glad that he had proved me wrong, just as how Marc Webb had unequivocally stated that we haven't seen nothing yet with what Garfield can do with the role. He morphed into Peter Parker the shy lad, like hand in glove, and then transformed into the heroic Spider-Man sans mask, straddling and struggling with his dual identities just as how any scrawny teenager would if to be blessed (or cursed) with new found abilities, highlighting awkwardness and the building of confidence to perfection. Webb knew exactly what he was looking for in a leading man and allowed plenty of emotional engagement and attachment to Garfield's Peter, with Garfield proving him right, and now carries the superhero mantle with aplomb, nailing it as an unlikely hero.<br/><br/>Then there's Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy, equally important as the romantic fodder for Peter Parker, and this update had given us a leading lady character who has beauty and brains combined, together with a degree of spunk that Mary Jane Watson in the previous three films had lacked, with the latter falling prey in each and every installment that it was getting pretty tired. Stone has proved to carry an entire film on her own, and here shares incredible chemistry opposite Garfield to make them that cute couple in school who have to battle the pangs of first love, and not only having to deal with that strong emotion, but loss as well. While that Maguire-Dunst upside down tongue gymnastics is something hard to beat, Garfield-Stone do have their little romantic stunt that adds a degree of fun that each of Raimi's version lacked. Which is a good thing especially when trying to sway over the nay- sayers.<br/><br/>I suppose almost everyone out there will know what to expect already from an origin movie, and James Vanderbilt's story kicks off into high gear from the get go, weaving and setting a new stage and universe in which this version of Spider-Man will thrive under, with Oscorp being that scientific conglomerate headed by an unseen, but constantly mentioned Norman Osborn, and having the mythos deeply involving the corporation, opening doors to possibilities that any subsequent film can cover, especially with that end credits scene. It also picked up from the Batman Begins template in a number of areas, but I'm not complaining because it's all good to successfully reboot the franchise, adapting elements from its comic book source which serve as canon, but giving it a different angle that maintains the spirit of things and events, even key ones like Uncle Ben's demise that truly shaped the destiny of the wall-crawler.<br/><br/>As always with the Spider-Man mythos, Peter Parker deals more with loss, and loses more than he's won, and having that retained in the film made it venture down a darker road, and being more vulnerable. And going back to basics never hurt, with one single villain in Dr Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) as the Lizard, even if an army of Lizards were hinted at from merchandise, and keeping/hinting at others who may appear in subsequent movies. The villain-hero set up was reminiscent of the second Raimi film with Peter Parker and Dr Octopus sharing a connection before the latter went bonkers, and provided yet again another battle on the emotional front. The Lizard may be lesser known, but is a powerful foe that audiences may have already been primed for from Raimi's films if they were to do a little research on the recurring Connors character then.<br/><br/>Action wise, Webb had gotten excellent material from the comics and clearly dipped into them for inspiration, with Spidey's iconic poses and movement all making it into the film, coming off as poetry in motion. This was something that the earlier Spider-Man films had paled in comparison, with action sequences all being more kinetic in treatment, utilizing a whole slew of Spider-abilities. And the mechanical web shooters weren't all that bad, since again it went back to basics to showcase Parker's intellect, if only for a short while during a montage as does showing off his sewing skills. Webbing plays a big role in being the arsenal of choice, and the variation shown in this film is staggering, with the previous films never even coming close to how this Spider-Man excelled in fighting with them. And with those webshooters, you'll be itching for moments when the web fluid would run out, or to have something happen to them like how the Stan Lee (probably the best cameo appearances of all Marvel films here) devised in his stories, just to provide additional challenge.<br/><br/>Marc Webb had shown not only Sam Raimi can make a good Spider-Man summer blockbuster, and I'm pretty sure Webb's version can stand up to and probably excel from the predecessors."
"MrLabcat","Null","20","42","28 June 2012"," Not so amazing after all.
","So Spider-Man got a reboot after the great job that Sam Raimi had done for the previous three movies. This was due to a myriad of factors, including studio interference, and Raimi not being happy with the process. But how does Marc Webb (good name for a Spidey director, by the way) hold up against the guy who made the excellent and campy Evil Dead movies? Not too well.<br/><br/>Honestly, the whole film is laden with this annoying sheen that really makes it difficult to enjoy. Whereas Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films emphasized the self-aware and campy nature of the comic book character, Webb directs in a fairly annoying CW-like style. The 3D cameras simply do not film in a high quality that you might expect out of a 200 million dollar blockbuster. It's literally the equivalent of a semi well-shot TV show. The CGI for the Lizard is like something you would see on Supernatural, and the acting is actually quite a bit worse than that.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield tries, he really does, but he can't measure up to Tobey's brilliantly understated performance. Emma Stone is just kind of there, but has no real point. When made the focus, Stone can really shine, but here she plays second fiddle and simply fades into the background. The only solid performance in the film is Rhys Ifans as Dr. Connors; the man can act, and although most of his most popular roles are comedic, this shows that he can do a solid dramatic job as well. Too bad his role is criminally underused, and doesn't approach anywhere near the amount of screen time that a villain should be given.<br/><br/>The thing that really brings the movie down is the terrible writing and directing. The writing takes so many steps to copy the original Spider-Man, yet also tries to do its own thing, leaving the film a huge jumbled mess. It's obvious that some craft was put into this film, but unfortunately not enough to make it a worthwhile viewing."

And those are one of the best action features I have ever seen among all the action movies. I believe it's much more better than the previous Spider-man movies, plus the IMAX 3D form,this is a must-see spider-man, no matter if you are not the fun of Spider-man. Last but not least, it is a fresh and amazing start for the new series of Spider-man, I am looking forward to the next one!"
"donxavier","4","15","30","11 July 2012"," The A-meh-zing Spiderman
","First, let me just say that I liked the Raimi trilogy...yes, even Spiderman 3 was fairly good. Did it have some problems, oh yes, but mostly enjoyable.<br/><br/>Anyway, when it was announced that Spidey was getting a reboot I, like many other people, thought why? Why is it necessary to throw out everything just because you're changing lead actors and director. Could've just stuck with the Peter and MJ relationship but with different actors and kept the current film continuity. Sure it would've raised some eyebrows but there would've been far less uproar than a complete retelling of the story.<br/><br/>Where was I? Oh yes, this new Spiderman movie. While it's not terrible, it's FAR from great. It just has not heart to it, no drive. Everything in this story is so by-the-numbers that you can see every plot turn a mile away. That would be fine, even somewhat forgivable, if this movie was fun but that's not the case.<br/><br/>Nearly every actor in this film seems miscast. From the generic guy playing Flash to Sally Field, right up to Andrew Garfield as the man in tights himself. No one seems to have a real handle on the character they're playing so they resort to archtypes. Emma Stone, as a prime example, slips into the same well worn shoes of the character she seems to play, with minor variations, in every movie: sardonic girl who wears her inner girl power on her sleeve. A little of that goes a long way.<br/><br/>The effects in this movie were mildly disappointing for a big summer blockbuster especially Spiderman's web swinging and the Lizard. One of the ""improvements"" for this reboot has been the use of as much live action web swinging for Spiderman as possible, to make it look more life like. They must have realized early on that this was not the way to go because most of Spidey's web swinging is done at night, which I'm assuming is to hide the ridiculousness of a man swinging around in a harness.<br/><br/>Then there is the Lizard. What a visual train wreck of a villain he is. With all the money that Sony sank into this ""reboot"" there wasn't enough to hire a better CGI effects team? The Lizard looks like he's straight from one of the Syfy Channel's ""Dinocrock vs Jurassic Lizard"" B grade films. OK, maybe not THAT bad but certainly not at the level one would expect from a film like this.<br/><br/>This is getting long so I'm going to sum up my remaining criticisms of this film: 1) Everyone in New York knows that Peter Parker is Spiderman!!! I lost count of how many times he gave himself away, either by taking off his mask or displaying his superhuman abilities while in his street clothes.<br/><br/>2) Guess when you're a parent of a future superhero, or the girl he likes, your life is pretty much over. Peter's parents vanish, Uncle Ben dies, Gwen's father dies...good lord! You're next May Parker.<br/><br/>3) Sally Field and Martin Sheen were not believable as a couple. If it wasn't for the fact that they're named Uncle Ben and May Parker, I never would've believed they were married.<br/><br/>Whew, there I've said my piece...now I'm going home. G'dnight!!"
"shafaqathussain","5","17","35","12 July 2012"," The not so Amazing Spider-Man
","So here we have it, merely a decade later, Sony's reboot of the Spider-Man franchise. Many critics alike questioned whether this new take on the web- slinger would justify a re-boot.. After watching the trailers, I did not have high expectations for this. However, I was prepared to be proved wrong. Sadly, my low expectations were met.<br/><br/>First of all, the movie tried too hard to add Nolan's Batman vibe- dark & serious.  This works against the film. Most of the action took place during night time, which is pretty distracting. The director needs to realize that Spiderman is NOT Batman. Raimi's version was bright and colourful and had a perfect tone and feel.<br/><br/>As far as the cast is concerned, Emma Stone did a stellar job. She delivered a strong, heartfelt performance. The main lead, Andrew Garfield, was good in some scenes but corny in other scenes. Martin Sheen was decent in the role of Uncle Ben- more on this later. Rhys Ifans is a fine actor- but here I felt his role and metamorphosis into the Lizard echoed the role of Willem Dafoe as The Green Goblin, i.e, talking to himself & the split personality. Overall, The Lizard is a OK villain, nothing special.<br/><br/>The story here is weak. There is something missing- I can't pinpoint what. Uncle Ben's death (one of the most pivotal moments in the Spider-Man story) is swept aside very quickly- Peter Parker virtually forgets his uncle was murdered and there is not any mention of the events thereafter. Aunt May hardly has a role- apart from waiting every night for Peter to turn up with a bruised face. She is virtually non- existent. There is not enough character development- it all seems too rushed. <br/><br/>I was skeptical about the web-shooters. But this aspect highlights Peter's geeky intelligence well- something that was missing from Raimi's version. The transformation into Spider-Man is an improvement over Raimi's version- though, the writers could have at least spent more time on how he got hold of the costume, i.e, Batman Begins. However, I struggle to comprehend how it was possible for Peter to become a science whiz all of a sudden, simply by reading a few scrap notes and a book? <br/><br/>Compared to Raimi's version, the wow factor from when Spidey is swinging around town is not there- could this be because of the mostly night time shots? But as expected, the CGI has improved. The action scenes were thin- in fact, the train sequence from Spider-Man 2 was more exhilarating than all of the action scenes put together here. The special effects good. But overall, I feel this was a missed opportunity. The sequel needs to step up big time."
"blandiefam","4","17","35","5 July 2012"," Spiderman Sputtered, Man!
","I paid good money to see this and I was truly disappointed. The acting was superb and the cinematography was better than the Raimi version, but the buck stops there! Sam was a better story teller and you felt you didn't need to know much about the character before watching the movie. This new version lacks the plausibility of the whole story. It seems the director, Webb, wanted to make the unreal more realistic and bring him into our world not realizing that movie goers want to be transported into the world of the fantasy and get a break from ours. Garfield played a brooding web-slinger who was more concerned about finding himself than the killer of his Uncle. I know this movie stayed true to many parts of the comic book, but the character development was lacking and was only compensated by the brilliant actors playing the key roles. Spidey Sense was nowhere in this, his ability to heal quickly, and his reporter angles were also omitted. Another thing that bothered me was the fact that all of New York knew he was Spiderman. All except for Aunt May. I must say that no matter how old Sally Field gets she is still too sexy to play Aunt May. The wrestling angle and the slaying of Uncle Ben were too rushed in my opinion. Lizard seemed too powerful to be foiled by the weaker watered down version of Spiderman. Maybe Mr. Webb believed he was more qualified than anyone else because of his name. Even the explanation of how he got bitten was never properly explored. Garfield has a James Dean like quality in his acting and you felt as if you were more comfortable watching PP outside of the costume because Spiderman's identity was never truly developed. I would recommend watching the first two Raimi Spiderman movies than this watered down hapless version. The ending left you dissatisfied as if you were given a Whopper without any meat."

"ad701","10","13","26","29 July 2012"," Swinging With Style
","When Tobey Maguire finished filming for Spider-Man 3 back in July 2006, he probably sat back on his laurels and smiled, safe in the knowledge that his immediate future in the world of superhero films was safe. So imagine his shock when Marvel Studios announced at the start of 2010 that, as opposed to continuing the series where they had left off, they were preparing to reboot the entire franchise.<br/><br/>And reboot it they have. Their latest effort, The Amazing Spider-Man, manages to be everything its predecessors weren't. It's effortlessly funny, brilliantly scripted, commendably acted, and much, much closer to the comics. Andrew Garfield is fantastic as the lead, mixing cheeky teen and pressured adult with ease. You can drop right into his world, allowing a real sense that the citizen-saving hero is often just as vulnerable and scared as those he's trying to rescue.<br/><br/>The biggest difference between the revamp and the originals lies in the plot. Whilst the 2002 adaptation swaps introductory depth for high- octane action, this version revels in the specifics. The first hour is completely taken up with a detailed look at exactly how this scruffy, skateboarding orphan becomes the string-spinning neighbourhood hero we all know and love. Written down it looks long-winded and dull, but director Marc Webb (clearly fate has a sense of humour) manages to pull it off to perfection, building believable relationships gradually and dotting the script with tension and secrets. <br/><br/>The scene when we find out something has happened to Peter is a particular highlight. Peter is repeatedly forced to object and apologise as his new powers manifest themselves in increasingly awkward and amusing ways. After accidentally beating up an entire subway carriage without any effort at all, Peter flees, and the action truly begins.<br/><br/>The rest of the film is much more like the original. Whilst the villain is different (Rhys Ifans as Dr. Kurt Connors, AKA the Lizard) the concept is the same; our new hero learns to hone his skills and uses them to defend New York. A fracas with a back-alley gang makes Peter realise he needs a mask to disguise himself, and after initially going with a plain red wrestler's guise he eventually settles on that ever-so- familiar blue and red spandex suit. Fully suited and booted, he learns of an evil plot to destroy the whole of New York and, despite making enemies of the entire NYPD, goes off on a desperate bid to stop cliché becoming reality.<br/><br/>Any action missing from the first hour is well and truly made up for here. Fight sequence after fight sequence sees Spidey win, then lose, then win, then lose again. Aided by Parker's notably adept love interest Gwen Stacey (Emma Stone proving she can do action just as well as comedy), he weaves his way in and out of schools, laboratories, offices and sewers in pursuit of the impressively realistic Lizard. Such is the intensity of the action that at times the viewer genuinely needs to sit back and take a breath, especially if said viewer is watching in 3D, here used to take full advantage of the long, swinging street shots so familiar to Spider-Man films.<br/><br/>Though you might not be able to detect it, I honestly did love the original trilogy. But it really is blown clean out of the water by the new set-up. From the tense family scenes with Peter's Aunt and Uncle to the explosions and falling skyscrapers, the film is a credit to 2012's Superhero Summer. The only real problem I can find is that it's 2 years until the sequel. Anyone would think Marvel had lots of other projects to be working on..."
"MBunge","6","13","26","10 July 2012"," Not bad, but not better than what Raimi's Spider-Man 4 would probably have been.
","To preface this review, I thought Sam Raimi's Spider-Man was a really entertaining film that managed to overcome some pretty big mistakes. Spider-Man II is one of the best super-hero movies ever. Spider-Man III was a mess that still had a few redeeming features. The Amazing Spider-Man? Well, it was fun with some really strong elements and there was nothing as garishly wrong with it as the Green Goblin's costume and Macy Gray's appearance in Spider-Man or Topher Grace's botched Venom in Spider-Man III. As someone who grew up reading the comics, I'll credit director Mark Webb with getting right a lot of the little things Raimi did not. But while I think this is ultimately a good flick and worth seeing, it's also one of the most fundamentally problematic movies I've ever watched.<br/><br/>To start with, this is a retelling of Spider-Man's origin, something we saw only a decade previously with Raimi. As much as they change the details (and we'll get into that in a second) and give this story a very different tone, however, it's telling us stuff with which we're already quite familiar. A good chunk of this film, as nicely done as it is, has an unavoidably superfluous quality. At the more sluggish points of the plot, you can't help but feel like you'd rather be watching Spider-Man IV instead of a reboot of the first movie.<br/><br/>Secondly, this thing largely butchers the classic Spider-Man origin. Paradoxically, I suspect most viewers won't mind that much because the more traditional (at least in that respect) Raimi take is fresh in their memories. But if this had been the first Spider-movie ever made, comic book fanboys would be lighting themselves on fire in protest. It's not even about them not saying ""With great power, comes great responsibility"". It's that Peter Parker's lesson in responsibility isn't something he learns from the death of his beloved Uncle Ben. It's something he learns during a dinner table conversation with some guy he's never met before. If that's how it had worked in Amazing Fantasy #15, I'm not sure things would have worked out quite so well for Marvel Comics.<br/><br/>Thirdly, while the romance between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy clicks thanks to the chemistry of Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, the relationship itself is kind of a poorly told joke. While Garfield and Stone are frequently great together on screen, the story underneath them is forced and manufactured. Whereas Raimi provided reasons for Peter and Mary Jane Watson to fall in love, this movie throws Peter and Gwen together because that's what the script says. It also helped that the character of Mary Jane had a life independent of Peter Parker in the first two films. Here, Gwen is Peter's inevitable girlfriend/plot device and not much else. And by the end, The Amazing Spider-Man has truly bollixed up the classic Peter/Gwen dynamic from the comics.<br/><br/>Boy, it reads like I'm not much of a fan of this motion picture, doesn't it? The truth is, there's many things about it I like immensely. This is the best ever representation of the change in Peter's personality when he puts on the mask and is liberated of his self-imposed awkwardness and insecurity. Spider-Man is finally the wise-cracking motormouth from the comics. And while Tobey McGuire gave Peter Parker a nerdy, dweebish quality, Garfield actually makes him look and sound like a socially inept teenager. Emma Stone is just great and proves a talented comic actress can fill up a shallowly written role. The fight scenes may not be quite on par with the Doc Ock throwdowns from Spider-Man II, but they're damn sweet in their own right. Sally Field and Martin Sheen are also quite good as Aunt May and Uncle Ben, though they have to share the supporting spotlight with Denis Leary as Gwen's police captain father. Rhys Ifans does a fine job a Curt Connors and the mystery subplot of what happened to Peter's parents is well woven throughout the movie. And, of courseweb-shooters, baby!!<br/><br/>Let me repeat, The Amazing Spider-Man is a good film and worth watching. It'll certainly get the bad taste out of your mouth from Spider-Man III. It also looks and sounds far more like Nolan's Batman movies than a piece of Marvel cinema, though it does continue the tradition of Spidey's mask coming off at every opportunity. But is it more than just another summer super-hero blockbuster? Not really."

","Nothing But a Remake - NBAR! Maybe it was just me, but since the First Spider Man was still modern; still relevant, on the heels of Toby Macguire and Cliff Robertson, WHY did we have to make the same ol thing over again? What: To see if there was an upside down kiss? C'mon! I expected more. The spoilers are...wait! Only everything you saw in the last one! That's all. The kid gets bit on the back by a spider, albeit digital one; Kid meets girl - falls for girl; Uncle gets shot dead; etc., etc. Couldn't they come up with some creative ideas, enough to write a new flippin' story? Like after several Batman movies, we were treated and rewarded with ""Batman Begins""! as a great example. This spider movie version, because of the disappointment of watching the same old plot lines, makes this nothing but a quick spin, with a few new faces and a few changes with story and villain -- this ends up being nothing but a 'cash cow' for the production executives and all y'all have fallen right into their trap.

"diongram","3","15","31","17 July 2012"," Spiderman... not so amazing after all.
","I recently decided to watch ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" hoping to see a decent adventure now in summer and expecting an even better point of view than the previous movies of Raimi. Well, Spiderman... was not so amazing after all.<br/><br/>At first, I will start with a reference at the cast. I didn't know Andrew Garfield (Spiderman) to be honest, and I was unsure about his acting skills. My instinct was right after all. His playing was more like a teenager getting excited to be a mutant hero and the sense of reality was nowhere to be found. It was like he wanted it and it happened. No convincing about his feelings in his act. The rest of the cast apart from Martin Sheen, of course, and a surprisingly good Emma Stone, as the romance person in the movie, was not something special.<br/><br/>About the script and directing now. i didn't like it. OK, standard special effects we see in every movie like this, some mildly impressing scenes etc. But, the story WAS MISSING. A lot of loose ends, in fact we learned few things about Peter Parker. The director was more eager to show as how cool was Spiderman that he forgot to show us how he became Spiderman. And here it is Garfield's fault too. He wasn't convincing in his emotions, it was like a super-wow phase it happened to him and he enjoyed it rather than a drastic change in his body and mind and the consequences. My thought is Maguire was better. And the script and cast of the first Spiderman movie, which we can compare with, is better.<br/><br/>To sum up, the movie was way below the expectations. A lot of plot gaps, unconvincing acting (mainly from the protagonist) and very limited action are the main points which indicate that you should see the movie only as a last minute choice in the drought of the summer (as I did)."
"invaderJim","2","15","31","13 July 2012"," Not Even A Movie
","It has truly come to the point where movies are no longer movies, only tools for making money. The ""Amazing"" Spider-Man is a perfect example. Leaving aside the problems in adapting the characters and stories for a transition in medium from comics to film, the movie simply doesn't work as anything but a marketing campaign. The makers of the film are clearly depending upon the viewing population's willingness to go see the sequel (already in progress), if not multiple sequels, in order to see a real story unfold. Any story that the movie does present is developed through abrupt and sloppy plot transitions, and so much is packed into the available 135 minutes that even a lifelong comic fan will leave the theater wondering who the characters were. The swinging effects were amazing, but of course, if you add money somewhere you must subtract it from somewhere else, and the effects for the Lizard were mediocre at best. My advice is to save this movie for Bad Blockbuster night on the couch, once it hits the redbox."

"aaronjbong","9","18","39","3 July 2012"," An Amazing Reboot; Even Better than the Original
","Who doesn't know Spider-Man, especially when a trilogy of films based on the superhero started a little over ten years ago? All three films have been tremendous successes and have become movie phenomenons. Sadly, the third film was a mess, filled with too many villains and disastrous subplots. So to make things easier, they went for the 'reboot' route with Marc Webb replacing Sam Raimi, Andrew Garfield taking over Tobey Maguire, and Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy replacing Kirsten Dunst's MJ. Luckily, they did a great job of it.<br/><br/>The story of Peter Parker's origins in ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is not necessarily the ""Untold Story"" as the advertisements say but rather a revamped version. It goes back to basics, taking the key plot points of the original ""Spider-Man"" film and putting it all together with a few more details and finishing touches. Peter Parker, an orphan living with Uncle Ben and Aunt May, is in high school. He's nerdy and sort of unsociable. He has a hobby in photography although his true passion lies in Science. In an attempt to discover his father's secret life, and of course due to curiosity and stubbornness, he gets bitten by a modified spider and gains his superpowers. His superpowers however don't include being able to shoot webs out of his hands as now he uses mechanical devices to shoot out the webs.<br/><br/>Those who watched the 2002 original blockbuster may feel over-familiar with the first hour of the film as it stays very similar with it. Even Uncle Ben's death is present here, albeit killed by a different person. However, I must say that the origin story is done perfectly and more enjoyable than the one provided in the first film. It's more detailed and his parents, especially his father, is more involved here. It's also surprisingly more touching, and more emotional.<br/><br/>Here, the villain is someone who hasn't appeared in any of the previous films. It's no other than the Lizard. Apparently the Lizard is the result of an experiment done by Dr. Curt Connors, who is the working partner of Peter's dad, Richard Parker. Both of them have been working on cross-species genetics planning to cure others. Unfortunately, Richard died in a plane crash along with his wife resulting in Peter becoming an orphan. Connors has also lost his right arm in an incident and has been observing the regenerative abilities of reptiles (particularly the lizard) in an attempt to grow his right arm back. With the help of Peter Parker, he successfully creates the serum and it worked. However, it does just more than that, the serum completely changes him and turns him into a monster named The Lizard, now equipped with superhuman strength and abilities.<br/><br/>Gwen Stacy's is Spider-Man's main love interest here. Unlike MJ, she is also interested in Science, not someone into singing or anything like that. In fact, she is like the assistant of Dr. Connors and works in Oscorp. Even though she loves Peter Parker and knows of his secret identity, her father is apparently Captain George Stacy and Captain in the Police Department and has issued an arrest warrant for Spider-Man. So much trouble. This creates a stronger romance for the film and is definitely another triumph over the original Spider-Man.<br/><br/>""The Amazing Spider-Man"" offers very powerful performances by the actors. Andrew Garfield gave a great performance as the newly revamped Spider-Man. However, I thought that he would be unsuitable as he would look like someone you don't want to mess with and hardly a nerd. But that all changed when I saw this film. He successfully gave Peter the teenage personality needed and was stunning. Emma Stone also gave a great performance as Gwen Stacy and the chemistry between the two leads were convincing. Rhys Ifans gave a cruel and menacing portrayal of Dr. Curt Connors and also did a great job.<br/><br/>The reboot also had impressive 3D effects and one of the few films that uses the 3D wisely. The sets more realistic and envelops you into the action. Talking about action, the battles here are also very exciting and creates high levels of suspense. However, I thought that some of the action sequences are less creative than others and therefore not consistent. The battle in the bridge was satisfying whereas the battle in the school was less creative although it incorporated a very humorous scene. <br/><br/>Just when you thought Spider-Man was becoming ""Batman Begins"" and descending into darkness, it instead became an action film filled with lots of humor too. There are many comedic scenes that make the film fun and not too depressing. The most humorous scene was actually the one with the signature Stan Lee cameo, the creator himself. This is by far the best Stan cameo I've ever seen and was very hilarious.<br/><br/>""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is amazing indeed. It has great acting, impressive 3D effects, and a detailed familiar plot. The two things that downed this film was probably that familiar feeling of the plot which makes it less intriguing (especially when the original film just came out a little over ten years ago), and the less creative battles in the movie. However, the former can be repaired by the more detailed additional plot points and polishes to the origin story. Otherwise, I enjoyed the film immensely. It had a great villain, fun comedic moments, exciting action sequences, and a strong love subplot. I would say that this reboot is probably better than the original, far better than the third, and on par with the second. And watch for that one scene after the credits start rolling. <br/><br/>Rating: 9/10<br/><br/>Final Verdict: ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" offers viewers an excellent reboot to one of the greatest Marvel franchises ever, thanks to Andrew Garfield's excellent performance, and director Marc Webb who has polished the origin story and crafted an action-packed, emotional, and funny superhero film."

"pantparty","9","40","100","19 June 2012"," The amazing spiderman is ""AMAZING""
","Firstly I found the last 3 spiderman movies boring and fully expected this one to be much of the same. How wrong could I have been the cast do a great job of bringing the characters to life, I see so many films where I just don't care about the main characters and in some case if they all died it would make the film a hell of a lot more interesting. But here you become really involved in there lives and I think this is because of the humour which is great and just adds to the likability of each character. The effects are awesome and even the lizard looks good which I wasn't expecting. Normally CGI characters look average at best (I don't like CGI at all) like the hulk in the various adaptations but here it works. From the trailer I thought some of the 1st person shots of spiderman swinging through the streets were gimmicky but again I was wrong Marc Webb does an excellent job and picks some amazing shots to showcase spiderman in action. I personally enjoyed this more than the avengers and for the first time ever i'am looking forward to a spiderman sequel. I'm sold on this reboot and all involved and I'd say if your a fan you'll love it and if your not you will be its a fun cinema experience and well worth the price of admission, it really is amazing!!!"

","There is nothing much special about this movie. For those who haven't watch the first spider-man movie you MIGHT enjoy this movie however if you've watched the first one you can figure out the story line yourself. The plot is slightly different from the first one but you can guess your way towards the plot. Starting of the movie is slightly slow to introduce the characters. <br/><br/>Towards the middle to the end you might find it slightly exciting as spider-man battles the lizard and stuff. Overall I wouldn't recommend spending your money on this movie for those who have watched the first spider-man movie."
"meldivs","10","11","22","16 July 2012"," Truly AMAZING
","This was truly a great movie, each character was developed perfectly that it did not lag in the storyline at all. Andrew Garfield was the perfect role for Spider-man and now I can't see anybody doing better in that role. Although the Sam Raimi films were good, the reboot was so much better. I watched it 3 times, and all the details were so carefully perfected that it was not just the amazing swinging scenes or special effects that wowed me, but the little things as well. The Chemistry between Peter(Andrew) and Gwen(Emma) was so realistic, and was so believable. Andrew Garfield nailed it in the role of Peter Parker. He gives teenagers something to relate to, just a normal skinny guy, who finds the hero in himself that is Spider-man. The themes of this movie are so inspirational and great, the theme of the misunderstanding of the spider, the life and problems of a regular teenager, and the will of Good vs Evil. Definitely owning this on Blu-ray, and I don't even care that some of the scenes shown in the trailer were deleted, as everything about this movie turned out to be AMAZING. Definitely looking forward to the sequels in what will be a wonderful trilogy."

","Okay..I know the movie has a new franchise and whatnot, I've read enough on it, but let's be honest here: Andrew Garfield IS NOT Spiderman. In fact, no one but Tobey Maguire is truly Spiderman. The way the hero is portrayed in the new version is nothing but awful compared to the amazing work of Tobey on the first three movies. I am not diminishing Garfield as an actor at all, in fact, I do like him, but it sickens me to see that they have chosen someone other than Tobey to play our beloved Spidey. Also, let's not ignore the fact that Kirsten Dunst is MJ, and not even Emma Stone can do a better job at it than Kirsten. I can't wrap my head around that fact. Now, lets talk about the movie itself...the fight scenes are like 5 seconds long, and although the graphics are pretty decent, the content itself leaves you wanting more. Or in my case, it made me wonder why anyone would ever spend money on that movie. The whole thing is more about him being ""the cool nerd"" who gets the girl rather than the struggles he encounters along the way, which is what the first three movies with Tobey are about. Lastly, allow me to ask you this: can you imagine Lord of the Rings without Elijah Wood being Frodo? I don't think so. Can we imagine anyone else being Harry Potter but Daniel Radcliff himself? Absolutely not. What about Wolverine (X-Men) not being played by Hugh Jackman? How weird would that be? Yeah...nothing else I can say about the subject."

"Wuchakk","7","3","4","7 July 2017"," Not as good as the film it reboots, but still a solid Spider-Man film
","Released in 2012 and directed by Marc Webb, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" stars Andrew Garfield as geeky teen Peter Parker, who is bit by a radioactive spider and acquires spider-like powers. Emma Stone plays his girlfriend, Gwen Stacy, while Denis Leary plays her father, the captain of the NYPD. Rhys Ifans plays the one-armed Dr. Curt Connors, who develops a dubious serum which morphs him into a human Lizard. Sally Field and Martin Sheen appear as Aunt May & Uncle Ben whereas Irrfan Khan is on hand as Connor's suspicious superior.<br/><br/>While this is a solid Spider-Man film with an effective cast it can't hold a candle to the film it reboots, 2002's ""Spider-Man,"" which was still fresh in the mind in 2012 (and still is). Compare the Spider-Man costumes, for instance, particularly the masks; there's no contest. The story is basically the same except that (1.) Gwen Stacy is the girlfriend instead of Mary Jane, (2.) the Lizard is the villain instead of the Green Goblin, (3.) Spider-Man uses artificial web-shooters rather than intrinsic ones, and (4.) Captain Stacy basically replaces J. Jonah Jameson.<br/><br/>The movie run 142 minutes and was shot in New York City and Los Angeles (or points nearby).<br/><br/>GRADE: B"
"ThatDoesntMatter","Null","12","25","11 July 2012"," Started well, then went downhill to boring city
","I never watch trailers.<br/><br/>I love Spider-Man 1 & 2, but I was open to a new take on it. Why not, that was art is about.<br/><br/>I liked Andy Garfield in the Social Network, I liked his acting in Never Let Me Go and The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus.<br/><br/>Okay, so I'm ready to be entertained, in 3D no less.<br/><br/>I really liked the beginning of the film, it was well-made, well-scripted, well-paced, well-acted.<br/><br/>Although little Peter reminded me of little Bruce, the story was different enough because his parents left him without an explanation.<br/><br/>What I found surprising was that it was incredibly parallel to Spider- Man 2002 in many regards - I didn't mind that, but it made it very predictable...I had thought they would go down a different road, but no...this is really a re-boot, Spider-Man Begins Again (while soon Batman Ends...;-))<br/><br/>I liked the high tech lab (not how he got in there, lol!), I liked the subway scene, that was funny.<br/><br/>Gwen is into nerds, okay, whatever...<br/><br/>I think the film began to lose me when Spidey had 'fun' with the car thief. I did not find that funny at all, his anger, supposedly rooting in his uncle's death (and that's me surmising it, it does not get explained...) is unbelievable.<br/><br/>Then comes the action part, character time over.<br/><br/>Unconvincing villain, bad CGI lizard, all very uninteresting.<br/><br/>At the end, when I was hungry and bored and just wanted it to end, they go back to a bit of character plot, but I didn't care, I was not involved anymore.<br/><br/>It seems so many things were just there to get taken up in sequels...<br/><br/>Didn't he want to know what happened to his parents? He got sidetracked so easily.<br/><br/>I thought maybe they'd explain how he can control when his fingers are sticky and when they aren't (and how are they sticky through his suit??) Why does a wound in his leg affect his abilities? Are his powers affected by the antidote? Oh nevermind, I don't really care...<br/><br/>Imo, the scriptwriter, director and the editor did not create an entertaining whole, the music was strange at times or just annoying at others.<br/><br/>What I DID like was the acting in the first part (the believable awkward teenager) and all the classic Spidey poses - loved those! Apart from that, 3D did not add a lot, the flying sequences, while elaborate, did not create a feeling of elation nor were they integrated well enough into the story.<br/><br/>So now what I feel like is watching Spider-Man again :-).<br/><br/>I was ready for a ride, but just got a bit of good drama at the beginning and a lot of boring action after that. I think I'd rather watch Transformers again...;-)<br/><br/>7 stars is actually a bit too high, as I was not entertained throughout, but what the heck, they don't do 6.5...<br/><br/>Just my two cents."
"Chalice_Of_Evil","9","12","25","1 July 2012"," You found the film's weakness! It's people complaining about a reboot!...
","There's just no pleasing some people. This movie is everything the Raimi films were not...and that's a *good* thing. This is a Spider-Man film for those who, like me, never got the big deal over the original films (which I thought were sub-par at best). No more cheesy/tongue in cheek/eye-roll worthy moments - hurrah! Gone are the irritating narration, the costumes that look like they could've been bought at a toy shop, and the villains foolishly killing themselves. <br/><br/>I'd only previously seen Andrew Garfield in The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus and Doctor Who, so this was the first time I got to really see what he is capable of as an actor. His last name may conjure images of an orange cartoon cat, but his acting speaks for itself. I was very impressed with his ability to capture every emotion/aspect of Peter Parker and create a fully fleshed out character. He manages to be both geeky and heroic whilst also deeply flawed but NEVER descending into groan-worthy angst. Easily likable, quippy (but not in a douchey way), brilliant, cocky, guilt-ridden just to name a few aspects, he nails it all. The over-confidence is there, but not so much so that you want to see him receive a beat down. Garfield is equally matched by Emma Stone (taking over from Bryce Dallas Howard in the role of Gwen Stacy). No, that's not a blonde Mary Jane, it's Peter's 'first love'. I never had a problem with Bryce's Gwen, she seemed perfectly nice, but this one is a fully realised character and not added just as an afterthought. Gwen is smart, endearing, more than capable, NOT simply a damsel in distress, and is the perfect match for Peter. Stone brings an instant likability to her (sadly nonexistent in Kirsten Dunst's MJ character from the three previous films). This is a love interest where one can actually understand what Peter sees in her, and you *want* her to survive. Not merely a love interest, she's intelligent, useful, resourceful, never unnecessarily bitchy but not a doormat either. With these two actors, their portrayals of their characters and their sizzling chemistry, we're already leaps and bounds ahead of the first 3 movies.<br/><br/>Where previous villains failed, this time we get one who's not a cartoon. Rhys Ifans is actually really good as Dr. Curt Connors. We spend a good deal of time with him before he becomes The Lizard. There's no blaming his actions on robotic arms, no laughable Halloween masks, no cringe-worthy lines/moments like the previous bad guys had. This is a villain who has real human issues going on, you can understand his actions, and the relationship he develops with Peter adds to this/is given the right amount of time to develop. Best of all? He doesn't stupidly off himself, he lives! And even speaks up for Peter, trying to protect him from the 'Man in the Shadows' (Michael Massee, making a memorable impression & promising bad things to come). Also set up is the mysterious back-story of Peter's missing parents. This adds a layer of intrigue, on top of what Peter already deals with when his uncle dies. Martin Sheen and Sally Field play an Uncle Ben and Aunt May who are far less irritating than the older versions. Ben doesn't simply exist to deliver his 'responsibility' line and die. The necessary time is given to these characters to see to it they're well-rounded and carry weight when the death occurs. Thankfully, there's no wrestler crap involved (though Peter does get the idea for his mask from a poster) and it's not just some dude who picks the name Spider-Man. There's no final words between Peter and Ben this time around, but his death has maximum impact. Their fight prior to it was not a stupid one. Everything is just so much more 'real' in this film. It might be a heightened reality, but it feels much more believable than the prior films.<br/><br/>Even smaller characters like Gwen's father, Capt. Stacy, or Flash Thompson are developed beyond cardboard cutouts. Denis Leary is not the stupid cop who you end up hating for his grudge against Spider-Man. He becomes a needed ally/significant part of foiling Connors. Likewise, Flash starts off a simple bully but winds up a friend to Peter. Also a relief is that when Spider-Man rescues civilians? They're the non-annoying variety. They don't lamely attack/stand up to the villain. I actually buy them helping Spider-Man out here. And the times we see him without a mask, it is purposeful (especially impressed with how he managed to take on a bunch of guys, keeping his unmasked face hidden the whole time). It's also a relief we don't have to put up with any angst crap between Peter and Gwen, on account of his secret, as he reveals it to her himself in THIS film. Given her final smile, she doesn't hold a grudge like MJ.<br/><br/>With all the characters given respect, it goes without saying that the film also handles the spectacle with equal measure. No more badly CGI'd swinging between buildings. Here, you'll believe a man really can do those death-defying swings. The action is brutal, as are the consequences Peter suffers. There's a true sense of danger. But it's not all gloom, he's the wise-cracking web-slinger so many people had originally wanted. The humour is not of the juvenile kind that plagued the other films. It's well-placed here, smart and actually funny. Appropriate director Marc Webb ensures there's not a dull moment in the film, even during its 'slower' parts. It keeps you transfixed. I'm happy to report there's no singing, dancing or groan-worthy moments of any kind that I could see. There'll be those who hate this movie simply because it's a new version, but for the rest of us...this is the proper beginning for Spider-Man. This is a film that manages to live up to its title. I'm definitely looking forward to a sequel."
"Prashast_Singh","10","4","6","2 June 2018"," Both amazing and spectacular!
","I loved the SPIDER-MAN trilogy starring Tobey Maguire a lot. At first, I didn't understand why he was no longer in this movie, but after catching it just a few weeks ago on DVD, I can say that this a very cool SPIDER-MAN movie. The title is apt. The film is replete with cool action, vibrant VFX, a great execution, and of course, loads of entertainment.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield plays a very cool Peter Parker, much different from the one played by Tobey. But I never compared them both because it's clearly visible that both actors have portrayed different ages of SPIDER-MAN and shine in their respective parts. Andrew however also shows the hilarious side of his web -shooting alter ego very well. Emma Stone has a great chemistry with him, and acts well for the most part. Rhys Ifans is impressive as both Connors as well as the Lizard. It was a very pleasant surprise to see Irrfan Khan in the film, and he played his brief yet significant part with utmost sincerity. Martin Sheen did a good job as Uncle Ben, while Sally Field too portrayed Aunt May with an emotional flair. Denis Leary is impressive, while Stan Lee too has a funny cameo in the film.<br/><br/>Coming to the technical department, it's hands down a very impressive film. The entire visual effects which make Lizard are marvellous. The best visual effects in the film, however, are in the climax. The action is simply outstanding. Every action sequence is impressive, and the final action block which also has added emotional and inspirational depth, is highly impressive and entertaining. The film has a lot of funny as well as emotional moments. Undoubtedly, there are some similar points as in SPIDER-MAN, but Marc Webb's direction makes this reboot, an all new and all different experience as a whole."

I wouldn't be surprised if they actually fell in love off set. Marc Webb did a truly unbelievable job. He captured all the wonderful aspects of the story, characters, plot, dialog, and action.

"Ryan_MYeah","8","10","20","23 October 2012"," Not as amazing as implied by the title, but still pretty thrilling and pleasantly romantic.
","Most would probably look to Chris Nolan's intense and morally complex The Dark Knight as the pinnacle of the superhero genre (which it arguably is), but if you ask me, the Spiderman films from quirky director Sam Raimi were what validated the genre in the first place. With an expert mix of sincere emotion, stylistic action, and just the right amount of Raimi's trademark goofiness, Spiderman and its superior sequel saw the genre at its most entertaining. After the disastrously disappointing Spiderman 3, it seemed like an odd move for Sony to reboot the series so quickly. But what the newly released The Amazing Spiderman may lack in the same creativity, it makes up for with heart and scale.<br/><br/>Peter Parker is your not quite average high school kid. He struggles with bullies at school, his feelings for Gwen Stacy, and trying to figure out the secrets of his deceased father, a former scientist at Oscorp who worked with Dr. Curt Connors, a man trying to invent a serum that would restore the amputated limbs of many people, including his own arm. Searching for answers, he is bitten by a genetic spider that gives him superhuman abilities, and through a series of events that take place, Spiderman, as we now know him, is born... again. But it isn't long after Peter takes up his job as the masked webslinger that complications arise, becoming sought after by the NYPD as a vigilante, and facing off with Connors, whose serum has transformed him into the hideous Lizard.<br/><br/>Look, it's hard not to compare this to Raimi's first Spiderman film, especially when it revisits a lot of the same plot points, but it still provides its own uniqueness on the hero. Fun, funny, and superbly realized, The Amazing Spiderman also drags occasionally, and leaves several loose ends that may frustrate some viewers, or maybe just leave them scratching their heads. Action is also surprisingly spread out in light doses, but thankfully so in how it lets the story flow so smoothly. Marc Webb, director of the sleeper hit (500) Days of Summer, wouldn't appear to be the obvious choice for this movie, but you really begin to understand why he was chosen as the movie moves along.<br/><br/>At the core of this movie is the irresistible love story between Peter and Gwen, delicately played by Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone. This movie was what apparently led to the two stars becoming a real life couple, and it's easy to see why, because they share chemistry that makes the love feel genuine. The acting is uniformly good, from Garfield and Stone especially. The supporting performances from Rhys Ifans, Denis Leary, and Martin Sheen are excellent, although I can't help but wish they'd have given Leary and his character George Stacy, Gwen's father and a captain of the NYPD, more on screen time.<br/><br/>Technically, the film is excellent. The editing, though occasionally sluggish, is still carefully handled by Alan Bell and Pietro Scalia. The effects supervised by Jerome Chen are pretty stellar, and Shannon Mills and Addison Teague provide creative and robust sound effects. Prepare to be blown away by composer James Horner, who gives us his greatest musical score since that of Titanic, a thematically rich and proudly old fashioned throwback complete with a heroic, and memorable main theme. It truly is spectacular, barely surpassing Danny Elfman's music for Raimi's movies in the process.<br/><br/>In short, though it's really not something I'm encouraging anyone to look too deeply into, did we really need this movie so soon after the originals? Maybe we didn't, but for what it is, you can't fault it for not quite living up to high expectations when it still is pretty entertaining. Not as amazing as the title may imply, but close enough.<br/><br/>**** / *****"

Previously I thought Ghost Rider 2 was worst film this year now its Amazing Lame Spider Man. This really happens when you hire a director whose only film is a low budget Romance film. This movie just made me sick, how can you even fool audience by giving a Romance film packaged as an action film. Whatever 3D was used was decent but, climax with Lizard was not anything special. CGI looks very fake and cheesy. The effects in this film are only comparable to first Spider-Man, second and third was way beyond this league. I don't know who was the master mind to green light this script. Because this will not attract the core Spidey fans, but if the studio wanted to attract the Twilight audience they might be successful.

","A critic once wrote that it is impossible to fathom anyone else portraying Spiderman other than Tobey Macguire. He'd willingly take back his words now. Garfield's Spiderman remarkably stands out in the instinctive humor which he displays, the sort of humor conspicuous by its absence in Tobey's Spiderman. The latter I admit was great in the first two movies but he didn't quite display any sarcastic behaviorism which we comic lovers really adore him for. The chemistry between Garfield and Stone is also great and becomes more watchable considering that they are real life lovers too. Gwen Stacy is quite different and a refreshing change from Mary Jane of the previous movies. MJ was more of the usual damsel in distress who had to be there so as to keep Spidey in business. This time around Gwen might be another character vulnérable, but having a more headstrong personality and is a mainstay in the film. The film explores much of Peter's life before he actually dons the role of the web crawler for which he is destined. This ploy of a gradual build up to the more exciting stuff in the latter half of the movie made for a great viewing. Also the 3D must have been the best amongst all movies I have seen since Avatar. I'd say ""Amazing"" just about fits the bill for this one."

","Watching The Amazing Spider-man was like sleepwalking into a multiplex screen and waking up jolted in your seat. You won't remember how you time traveled 10 years backwards, to watch Spider-man swing across his not-so-friendly-neighbourhood in his old red and blue spandex outfit.<br/><br/>You'll feel like you are reliving those two and half hours of your life once again, but only this time it gets excruciatingly painful to watch it entirely. <br/><br/>The original Spider-man was adapted to the screen so well that the new writers seem to have seamlessly traced the story with a carbon paper for the 2012 audience.<br/><br/>Peter Parker can't get laid in high school. A Spider humps Parker. Uncle Ben dies preaching about responsibility. The Villain is a madcap scientist. Lather, rinse, repeat. Nothing changes in the reboot except for the cast and crew.<br/><br/>The story has so many loose ends that you could tie them into a long plait. The makers think it is OK to allow Irfan Khan missing from the movie after a brief cameo. And the Mr. Osborne, who Irfan constantly keeps referring to, is a ghost character. Peter Parker's parents are a new addition to the story, but nobody bothers searching for them after they go missing years ago.<br/><br/>The amount of Batman references are too obvious not to notice. If Jim Gordon had a daughter, then Spider-man doesn't live too faraway from Gotham City. The city police chief's daughter is Spidey's new love interest. They join forces to defeat the villain. The villain - a giant green lizard - chooses Osborne tower to spread his airborne virus which is pretty much similar to Batman Begins ending. <br/><br/>Watching it 3D had its advantages like getting to actually feel what it would be like to jump off rooftops from dizzying heights. The first- person camera view of Spider-man in action is a decent addition to the reboot. However, The Amazing Spider-man manages to fail on all three levels when compared to its predecessors."

","Sam Raimi's 2002-2007 Trilogy was fantastic - He totally captured the essence of Spider-Man. But Marvel Comics themselves constantly re-tell the stories, and sometimes re-invent their superheroes, so also do Filmmakers who are telling, and in this care, re-telling these stories.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi was not called on to do the re-telling, this time it went to newbie Marc Webb. How did he do? Not as well as Raimi did with his first two installments. But swell enough, to keep us interested. Is this an unnecessary re-telling? That's a big ""Nope.""<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield is the new Peter Parker. He is less of a wimp than Tobey Maguire's version: Less of a wimp. But more of a geek. He's better at science than Maguire was. He Skateboards. He even stands up to Flash Thompson, stupidly, but he shows a measure of bravery, which Tobey lacked. He is also taller than Tobey Maguire.<br/><br/>This new kid has it built in. he is intelligent, Maguire not so much. He's sharp, Maguire often did not know what was transpiring under his steamy glasses. He is not shy like Maguire was, where Maguire stood with thumb up it, Andrew Garfield acts. This is not to say I am not endeared to Tobey Maguire's version. But this new kid has his own way of doing it.<br/><br/>We also delve into a subject that was not looked into very much in the Spidey Comics I had read-What happened to Parker's Parents, who they were, what did they do, and how Parker ended up with Uncle Ben and Aunt Mae? Campbell Scott is Richard Parker, a scientist working for Oscorp, and Embeth Davidtz is Mary Parker, Peter's doting mom. As a kid, Peter Parker was played by Max Charles. Sally Field is Aunt Mae and Uncle Ben is Martin Sheen: THIS I liked very much.<br/><br/>Richard and Mary Parker are frightened by something. Their house has been burglarized. Richard has some secret papers in a hidden drawer: Peter sees this, he remembers. He remembers his father's leather attaché, and the papers inside. But the Parkers are frightened, They drop Peter off at Uncle Ben's and are never seen again.<br/><br/>Next Scene, Peter Parker is in High School, photographer for the school paper, geek, but respected. Has the gall to call Flash Thompson by his real first name, which he is rewarded with by a butt kicking. Enter Gwen Stacy aka Emma Stone. Perfect. She knows how to deal with Flash.<br/><br/>A leak in the basement draws Peter's attention to his dad's Attache Case. There is a photo of Richard Parker with ""some guy"" (Rhys Ifans) - Uncle Ben tells Peter later that this is Dr. Curt Conners, who was a friend of the Parkers.<br/><br/>These family ties are tightly woven threads of the story. Peter Parker is very much Richard Parker's son. But he does enjoy a close relationship with his Aunt and Uncle.<br/><br/>Peter finds the compartment in the attaché case that holds papers with the symbol ""øø"" and some scientific formula. Looking up Conners on the computer, he sees that an internship program has just started, so he goes to Oscorp and sneaks in. On an escalator, he sees a representation of the shadowy image of Norm Osborn.<br/><br/>As it happens, Gwen Stacy is the head intern, but she lets Parker stay. He gets Conner's attention by knowing the answer to a question he asks the interns. But then he bumps in to a man named Rajit Ratha (Irrfan Khan) and sees that ""øø"" symbol on a paper he drops. He follows Ratha and finds a room with the same symbols, spiders fall on him from a machine.<br/><br/>Gwen Stacy finally kicks him out and this is when he is bitten.<br/><br/>From this point in the film, it matches some of the events from Raimi's version - He plays around with his new abilities and in standing up to Flash Thompson, gets into trouble, causing Uncle Ben to be called to Mid-Town Science (The school where Parker went), and phase one of the Uncle Ben ""responsibility"" lecture.<br/><br/>After school he goes to see Dr Conners and tells Conners who he is, giving him the formula which he did not know that his father was keeping from Conners and the rest of Oscorp.<br/><br/>Missing is the whole ""Wrestling Match for Money"" angle but the story with Uncle Ben is pretty much the same, he is killed by a petty thug, causing Parker to go out vigilante-style. Unlike Maguire, he cannot shoot webs from his fingers, he uses webbing he gets from Oscorp to make the Web- Shooters. Eventually he makes the costume and then goes out hunting some more - THIS is where Andrew Garfield is very good as Spider-Man, he is VERY good with the Spidey-Cracks. ""Hey! I'm Swingin'' Here!""<br/><br/>Denis Leary is Captain Stacy, Gwen's dad, who Parker has several confrontations with as both Parker and Spidey: This is an excellent character, especially when Parker starts showing interest in Gwen.<br/><br/>Most of this film shows the results of Peter giving the formula to Conners, who uses it to mutate into ""The Lizard"" and how parker as Spider-Man corrects that mistake with Gwen's help, and the ultimate cost. The problem with this film is mostly the Digital Lizard, which although done well, is just too difficult to believe. But Spidey's fights with the creature are a good blend of practical filming and CGI. The Raimi films have too much Digital Spider-Man, most of the Spidey in this one, are really Garfield or whoever is in the costume doing stunts.<br/><br/>I liked this more than I expected to, and I was very pleased with the chemistry between ""Parker"" and ""Gwen"" and the way Parker/Spidey admits to Gwen that ""The Lizard"" was his responsibility. The ""Power/Responsibility"" connection was not preached out at us, is was worked into the story on a gut level."
"godsmainmanjk","3","9","18","14 July 2012"," I just think the movie sucks.
","Over all i think the entire movie was a waste. I'm glad it isn't making that much money and I'm happy i didn't waste any of my money to go see it in theaters. Also I'm not sad if that meant i missed out on some of the great "" CGI quality"" it had to offer in many of its scenes.<br/><br/>I didn't like the new Aunt and uncle, I thought the originals were better in almost every way. They looked more the part. Seemed wiser when need be, and also seemed better written and acted by both parties. Especially the scene of Uncle Ben's death. In the older version he acted like a genuine old man and tried to talk to his killer and convince him he was doing wrong. Which really stood with me and his character. In this movie how ever he just spit some quick lines here and there about being responsible then what does he do? decides to wrestle, by hand mind you, a younger store robber with a gun. Really? Which also happens to be the exact store parker walks out of moments later? In the older version his uncle was waiting for him at an understood location for a reason. It made sense.<br/><br/>There were a lot of coincidences with this movie that i didn't like at all. Especially the romance aspect. Really why would a cute girl go for this peter Parker as a hipster? and she is all over him desperately too which is very hard to understand. At least in the older version she fell in love with spider man first while she thought peter was a good man. then later realized he was spider man which makes it more understandable that as a really hot and popular girl she would like peter parker. the loser nerd. It made much less sense that this girl would be so needy for parker right off the bat as he offers nothing. He isn't even smart. The only scientific thing he does in the whole movie is copy his fathers work and tries to pawn it off as his own to Dr conner which totally screws everything up and makes this movie the waste that it is.<br/><br/>Also the scene after spider man is wounded on his chest and goes to see the girl is just way over the top cheesy. He barely knows the girl now he wants her to bandage him up and while she is in the process of wiping his blood from his chest he thinks that is the perfect time to make out and what appears to be more until she stops him and starts another ""supposedly emotional"" scene relating him to her father. I mean give me a break already with the corny. What was with his gay head roll in that scene as well? then whisking her off into the night for no reason at all? supposed to be romantic again? Its not like he just saved you from a bunch of thugs then hung upside down in the rain and gave you a peak at his real identity with a half exposed face kiss. Seriously? When compared it's like the original makes you think ""spectacular"". while this one leaves you with ""meh, it looks pretty?""<br/><br/>Again so many faults to this movie to even list but i'm sure others have graciously done so. I just wanted to point out some personal faults i thought the movie had and REALLY REALLY REALLY claim that the older spider man with Toby as peter was much much better. Now as for the second and third spider man movies before this one....yea...lets just not get into those."
"bluesman-20","10","12","26","9 August 2012"," Spider-man's secret origin retold.
","The Amazing Spider-Man is very clearly a labour of love. The movie carries with it the same air that the early Stan lee Steve ditko stories did. Spider-Man is a tragic hero. His story has been told and retold. Sam Raimi's Spider-Man felt like a labour of love and it was. But James Webb's seems like it's attribute and a labour of love. He's not in awe of spider-man as Raimi is. Webb writes the movie like a updated version of the character as he was written in the 60's. Peter Parker is a sad sack. He's a nerd and yet he's a smart ass He knows what's right and what's wrong. He makes mistakes and yet he's not afraid to stand up for what's right.<br/><br/>Webb's story is familiar and different and remarkably fresh.<br/><br/>Peter Parker's parent's are scared of something and leave Peter with his aunt May and Uncle Ben. when the Parker's die in a plane crash Peter is raised by his aunt and uncle. but he has questions. when Peter becomes 16 he finds a briefcase belonging to his dad. inside he finds papers relating to his dad's research into genetic splicing. His father's old partner Curtis Connors is still alive and working for Oscorp. His uncle figures out something is wrong. Peter tries to keep this away from them. When he goes to Oscorp to meet Connors he meets his classmate Gwen Stacy. Gwen is a intern at Oscorp and she arranges a meeting with Connors. the meeting with Connors leaves more questions then answers. When Peter goes into a secured room with genetic spliced spiders he is bitten. Peter changes and develops spider like powers he decides to use the powers to show off. this has tragic consequences when Peter lets a criminal go. Peter's Uncle sees the man fleeing and tries to stop him only to be shot. When his uncle dies Peter realizes what his uncle had been trying to tell him all along. with great power comes great responsibility. He creates the uniform and the persona of spider-man and goes out looking for the man who shot his uncle.<br/><br/>Peter protects the people of the city as best as he can. during all this he gives Connors his father's research and Connors completes his research. Connors uses it to regrow his lost arm only something goes wrong and he becomes the lizard. Peter's budding romance with Gwen takes a strange turn when her father police captain George Stacy decides to arrest the vigilante known as spider-man. meanwhile the lizard launches a attack against mankind which forces captain Stacy and spider-man into a partnership to stop him.<br/><br/>The action is crisp and fast. the acting is spot on. the Dark Knight Rises was the better movie of the two. but this one has enough heart to hold it's own against Batman and the Avengers."
"cwilliamjay","5","12","26","12 July 2012"," new spider-man film drops the ball
","I'm a comic book lover My favorite has always been spider-man. I went in knowing they were tinkering with the story line and I accepted that and sill watched with an open mind. Tinkering with the story is not the problem. The problem is presenting spider-man as a mere costumed clad guy that sticks to walls. watching this new spider-man was a throwback to the old 70's live action series. The pacing of the film played like the first Hulk film from Ang Lee trying to make a long over complicated story line. spider-man without the action and cgi is like watching star wars without the effects. I don't think you can go the Nolon route with spider-man."
"Mr_McSuave","8","13","29","4 July 2012"," A massive improvement on the original trilogy
","Many have complained about the premature reboot of the Spiderman franchise after the failure of Spiderman 3, but I believe that it was much needed, and a great success. Andrew Garfield trumps Toby McGuire in every way, Emma Stone trumps Kirsten Dunst, and the films takes a, thankfully, darker tone. Spiderman's suit looks very different to past films and comics, but it is fantastic. Spiderman's webbing no longer sprouts from his wrists, but is manufactured by Peter like in the comics. The villain of the film is my favourite in the Spiderman universe, and I have long awaited his appearance in one of the films. This movie looks fantastic in 3D, and it is the only film I have seen that I felt glad that it was in 3D (and yes, I have seen Avatar). Andrew Garfield, in my opinion, is the perfect choice to play Peter Parker, and those who chose him should definitely receive an award for their brilliance. He is not remotely similar to what Peter is seen as in the comics, but I think the the comics would be better off with Andrew Garfield starring. At the heart of it, The Amazing Spiderman also has a well told love story between Peter and Gwen Stacy, which I believe is better than Twilight will ever have. The main reason I am happy about this reboot is that it assures me that future sequels will be done in a similar tone and, if this is so, I will go to see every one of them."

"DameFlux","Null","20","49","10 July 2012"," Why ?!
","Andrew Garfield is a terrific actor. Martin Sheen is a superb actor. Sally Field is a mind shatteringly brilliant actor. Marc Webb, well he sure does an OK remake of what was a brilliant film. I cant knock him doing a remake 10 years after , or can I . Feel like you have been here before but someone is tweaking details to avoid looking exactly like the original. This is in no way close to what the original film in originality though and if you went back in time and stopped them making the original this would de-evolve into a boneless mess because of what Sony did . Sony wanted to reboot ala Batman for the profit and nothing else. There are no great lines for Andrew, Martin or Sally. They seem lost in this hopeless reboot! Yes , yes I know it didn't ""suck"" but it not ""sucking "" doesn't excuse that it was pointless and derivative. With all the places they could have gone in maturing Parker and family , the characters that developed and challenged the world. What about Spider Man vs the republican party, anything but to waste all of our time with another reboot . Marc is not Christopher Nolan here, he could be but Sony cheated him! Thats right they took a good director and stole a perfect opportunity by forcing him to reboot! I look forward to his freedom from the cheap money changers trying to cash in."
"midnight_demon2502","2","21","52","9 July 2012"," Crap Fest
","First, this movie should have never been made. It was horrid. About 1/4 way through the movie I started realizing I was watching a mixture of the original made for TV movie Spider-man and the 1st Toby McGuire Spider-man. This movie was NOT darker or grittier regardless of what the teens are saying. this movie wouldn't know depth or complexity if it were a combination of War & Peace, Bethoven's 5th and the contemplations of Socrates multiplied by Freud's mother and factored by the theory of relativity and then divided by quantum mechanics.<br/><br/>Second, The whole Uncle Ben dying scene was crappy. It was a lame half butt attempt at re-capturing the effect Raimi's had in the McGuire Spider-man. They even ripped off a line from Raimi as the thief ran away and only change done word. Not my problem became Not my policy. Real creative.<br/><br/>Third, the chemistry between Stone and Garfield sucked. The two of them dating in real life does NOT translate well on screen and as an added bonus Stone does not translate well as a blonde. It just doesn't work for her. The romance is rushed over 3 scenes and goes that fast from non existent and seemingly Flash's girl to all of a sudden in love with Peter.<br/><br/>Fourth, The lizard was horrible in graphic depiction. Why did we go back to early 90's effects for this? Why bother to show the start of henchmen only to never revisit them at all or even use them?<br/><br/>Fifth, Garfield suck as Spider-man, he does mildly OK as Peter Parker. They even hammed up the New York behind Spidey scene by having him swing down the street using cranes that lined up just for that purpose. It was lame, shoddy camera work and poor execution. It came across goofy.<br/><br/>Sixth, the suit sucked, the concept of the web was stolen from the original TV Spider-man, the spider s ymbol stolen from Marvel's depiction of Miguel O'hara as sSidey of the future and in this movie was actually done worse by combining the past and the future elements. Peter Parker was a science geek not an electronics guru. (not to mention I hate the entire concept of web technology on his wrists. Spidey need smore web than those thing scan ever produce.)<br/><br/>Seventh, what nerd uses Bing for a search engine? That wasn't even mildly believable.<br/><br/>Eighth, the development of the character was crap. He comes off as cocky and arrogant and thoughtless. This wasn't a hero, this was a punk.<br/><br/>Ninth, Harry. Nuff said.<br/><br/>Tenth. If you make a sequel to this piece of filth I sincerely hope it tanks. This film was utterly craptastic."

"eminemgangsta1994","10","8","16","30 December 2012"," Definitely AMAZING.
","This movie was Amazing!! Betther than the first three in my humble opinion. Some people don't think so because of the origin story being told more than once. Well I think that Marc Webb did a great job telling the story once again because he didn't have to go in depth all that much because we all know what is going to happen. The actions sequences were amazing and better than the previous trilogy. The fight scene in the school was the best fight scene. I though it was the best because it showed how agile Spider-Man really is like in the comics. Andrew Garfield is a way better Spider-Man than Tobey Macguire because he brings Spider-Man's humor which was rarely shown in the previous trilogy.<br/><br/>This deserves an easy 10/10"
"sweetboyy_99","8","8","16","27 November 2012"," Huge improvement over the first three movies!
","First of all, when i heard they were doing a reboot, my thoughts were mixed. It could be one of those huge Hollywood flops, or it could be an improvement to the three movies. It took me some time to get used to the fact, and today i just went for it and watched it.<br/><br/>Many of my friends were critical against this movie, saying it would never work. However, being a huge fan of the spider-man comics AND the three first movies, i loved this reboot! It was a perfect start for a reboot i would say, and i hope we will be seeing more of Andrew Garfield as Spiderman in the future. <br/><br/>This movie was more well-thought of than the other three movies starring Toby Maguire as Spiderman. And i got completely sucked into it. I could not get my eyes off screen. And the CGI was beautifully made, it was very detailed and you can notice that the CGI was not left out.<br/><br/>I won't tell you much about this movie, you have to go see it yourself, then judge it by yourself. My thoughts were that this was an excellent improvement over the old Spider-Man movies. Of course, that's just my own opinion. But i say that it's worth the time and money to watch. <br/><br/>I have to say that there are some let downs in this movie that were in the first three movies though. I won't go into detail, watch it yourself and you will see what i mean.<br/><br/>And i love that they skipped Mary Jane and went for Gwen instead. Ugh, i don't know why, but i hate MJ. <br/><br/>Anyhow, my point is that this is a huge improvement and is a movie that you definitely should not miss, it's a really good movie.<br/><br/>There are some flaws in this movie, but yet i have not seen a movie that does not have any flaws. But i enjoyed it, i really got sucked in to the story and the way they told the characters stories. It was an amazing experience for me seeing the Spider Man series finally getting on good feet. Again, this is just MY OPINION, and i suggest you to watch it yourself and judge it. For me, it's an clear 8 out of 10!"
"kavz-420-370577","5","8","16","12 July 2012"," Are you serious Marc Webb?
","Lets keep this short and very simple, just like this movie. I grew up being a fan of Superhero movies, so The Avengers and The Dark Knight movies have lived up to it's expectations, but seriously, this movie is just made for the money. First of all, spoiler alert, and this must be said to the people who care about movies like this. The Spiderman in this movie, isn't even half a spider. He's got the skills, the strength but Marc Webb are you kidding me the Spiderman has to have an artificial web slinging device, WHAT ARE YOU THINKING! The reason we watch these movies is A)to escape reality B) to find a bit of realism in this alternate dimension and C) Certainly Not to make Spiderman run around in his unitard with his mask off half the movie, where everybody knows who he is except for his Aunt! How on Earth is that even plausible even being in an alternate world that is still Earth! Or did you make Aunt May senile so she is oblivious to the fact that her Grandson is Spiderman who runs around with his mask off half the movie? This is ridiculous these people have taken away the secret identity concept as most superhero movies adhere to, almost the essence of movies like this. I mean it's almost like Marc Webb tried his best to be creative and just jumped off the bridge without a clue what lies beneath him. Just a shot in the dark huh? $400 million and still going, goes to show what CGI, an overzealous giant crocodile and some back flips can do huh! If you're a fan, don't even try watching this movie, you'd want to punch Marc Webb in the face, I mean seriously, personally, I feel that even Stan Lee would be disappointed. But who care's all for the money right?"
"scoup","5","8","16","10 July 2012"," Very disappointing...
","I'm not sure how anyone rated this movie over a 7. Maybe someone who who hasn't seen another Spiderman movie or a teenager could think it's great, but rest assured it is NOT.<br/><br/>Green Lantern was bad and I gave it a 6, but I'm giving this a 5 because it's a reboot and did not need to be done. There are plenty of good writers so there is no excuse for the poor script.<br/><br/>Spiderman was boring and unoriginal. My mind wondered throughout the movie due to lack of empathy for the characters and plodding pace. I was more interested in my own thoughts of imagining how Christopher Nolan would have done the reboot and how much better it would have been - what a pity.<br/><br/>Here are my gripes: Costume was bad (at least Green Lantern had a cool suit); <br/><br/>subway scene was dumb - Parker immediately gets powers with no real bodily effects and putting a cold beer bottle with weight on his forehead doesn't awaken him, but a DROP of beer jolts him to the subway roof - laughable, cue my eye-roll - and where was the Spidey sense????;<br/><br/>Uncle Ben's death was not as emotionally affective as it should have been. Aunt May just seemed off - 2002 Aunt May all the way; <br/><br/>Dr. Connors was mishandled and boring - i do not buy that his motivation for trying the serum is the threat of being fired; he lost his arm and wants to be whole; <br/><br/>Denis Leary - underutilized and needed more screen time; bad move killing him off because he was the one person I would have liked to see in a sequel; <br/><br/>Mask - why is he always taking his mask off??? This seems out of character and reckless. Any retard knows to keep your identity a secret - and Parker is a genius, right? He can build web slingers and solve the formula problem that dozens of scientists have been working on, but he can't make a mask to keep on his face?; <br/><br/>Bridge rescue - clichéd and no dramatic tension (glad to see Jim Halsey and was thankful for the distraction of remembering how much I liked The Hitcher. Five minutes of that movie had more drama and tension than the entire Spiderman movie); <br/><br/>Crane scene - contrived, forced and just ridiculous; <br/><br/>love story - not even remotely developed; Parker does not go to the funeral when her dad dies??? The man who let him go??? No way. They did not look like teenagers - too old; <br/><br/>$10 minimum spend to take a penny - pathetic script writing which should have been cut; <br/><br/>Hype about movie being darker and Parker wittier - epic fail. They should have gotten a script doctor from Iron Man to give it look.<br/><br/>Spider Bite - his father's research work is the basis for the genetically mutated spiders, but Parker does internet search for information????????? Not look at his father's work??? Because when I look for cutting edge research information on secretive work worth millions of dollars which gives me superhuman powers, I go right to the internet...and ignore the work that cost my father his life;<br/><br/>Music - atrocious. You know it's bad when you you are actually thinking about it - normally music should be seamless in the movie and on all too rare occasions does the viewer encounter beautiful scores. I had to look it up and James Horner who won awards for Titanic and Avatar is listed. I guess you can't win them all, mediocrity would have been a step up; <br/><br/>CGI - ehhh; CGI Hulk in Avengers was good, nothing stood out here; <br/><br/>Gwen in closet - spray can of fire to scare off mutant lizard with regenerative powers and superhuman strength??? <br/><br/>Conclusion: Disappointing movie that should have been better from a reviewer who is not a fan boy of Raimi. Examples of movies that did it better are Batman, Iron Man and Hulk (Norton, but there is room for improvement here). Clearly there will be a sequel because the studio is making a lot of money - they need to regroup and produce something better.<br/><br/>I am anxiously awaiting the Hulk reboot with Ruffalo and hope it is better than The Amazing Spiderman."
"Chris_Pandolfi","7","8","16","3 July 2012"," It's the Interpretation That Counts, Not the Story
","""The Amazing Spider-Man"" will inevitably be compared to and perhaps even attacked by die-hard adherents of Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man"" trilogy, most prominently the original 2002 film. True enough, this reboot directed by Marc Webb is pretty much telling the exact same story: A high school science geek with no parents is bitten by a genetically enhanced spider, is slightly mutated in the process, and ultimately becomes a masked vigilante that shoots webs from his wrists and swings over and around the skyscrapers of New York City. My fear is that audiences will be so wrapped up in noticing the similarities that they will fail to see all the ways in which this version is different. Yes, there are the technical details – plot, character, setting, casting, etc. – but it has more to do with atmosphere and style than anything else.<br/><br/>Raimi's approach was much more escapist, loading the story with action, special effects, and a great deal of humor. There was nothing particularly heavy about it; it was made with the sole intention of being entertaining, and so it was. By contrast, Webb's approach is more introspective and symbolic. The plot is a bit less straightforward, the tone is a little darker, the characters are easier to invest in emotionally, the humor is subtler, and there's less action choreography to gawk at helplessly. Having said all that, never once does Webb lose sight of the fact that his movie is based on a comic book. The slick special effects, the over-the-top fight sequences, the preposterous plot, the now-mandatory cameo appearance by Stan Lee, and even its presentation in 3D ensure that a fun time will be had by all.<br/><br/>What really surprised me is that this film is a triumph of casting. Andrew Garfield takes the reins from Tobey Maguire in the role of Peter Parker, who's once again a high school kid and whose genesis into Spider-Man is reexamined. I initially didn't think I would be convinced, given the fact that Garfield is in his late twenties. How wrong I was. Apart from the fact that he still believably looks seventeen years old, he accurately evokes youthful thoughts and behaviors, like riding a skateboard, occasionally being defiant of authority, and making rash decisions without completely thinking them through. Flashback sequences reveal that Parker's parents were forced to go into hiding after his father's office was unsuccessfully ransacked for an elusive research folder; raised by his Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field), part of the plot involves Parker accessing his father's research files in the hopes of understanding the reason for his disappearance.<br/><br/>Parker's classmate and love interest has changed from Mary Jane Watson to Gwen Stacy. She's played by Emma Stone, who somehow has gotten more magnetic with each new role she accepts. Gwen learns fairly early on that Parker is the masked vigilante Spider-Man, who has taken to the streets on a dangerous quest to find the man who murdered Uncle Ben in cold blood; she finds herself torn between Parker and her father, George Stacy (Denis Leary), a perpetually suspicious NYPD Captain who's out to arrest Spider-Man, believing him to be more of a menace than a hero. Like Parker, Gwen has a passion for science and currently serves as an intern for a one-armed scientist named Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans), who's being pressured by his superior (Irrfan Khan) to devise a cure for the unseen but apparently dying head of his corporation.<br/><br/>As it so happens, Connors once worked with Parker's father, their research involving genetic splicing and the regeneration of limbs. It was all, according to Connors, in the name of putting an end to weakness, of allowing humanity a chance to improve. But then he uses himself as a guinea pig for a serum containing reptile DNA; although he does successfully grow a new right arm, he also mutates into a gigantic lizard creature and develops a superiority complex. Humanity, he eventually reasons, cannot be improved and should therefore be eliminated – or, in true comic book fashion, genetically transformed. It's up to Parker to convince Captain Stacy that his target should be Dr. Connors and not Spider-Man. In the meantime, Parker and Gwen must stop Connors before it's too late.<br/><br/>As well-crafted as all the scenes were, three in particular stand out as the film's best. One is an action sequence in which Parker, dressed as Spider-Man, has to save a child from a car dangling perilously off a bridge. Another is a quieter moment in which we see the redemption of the school bully, Flash Thompson (Chris Zylka). The last is an incredibly sweet moment between Parker, Aunt May, one that involves a carton of eggs. Are these scenes consistent with the original comic book? How about with Sam Raimi's 2002 film? To be perfectly honest, I believe a debate over which version is ""better"" is utterly pointless. I think of ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" as I would a fairy tale; it's not about the originality of the story so much as the differences in technique and interpretation.<br/><br/>-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)"

","The Amazing Spiderman doesn't quite live up to be an amazing reboot of the franchise! But its a good one time watch, and probably lovable for those who got fed up with the Sam raimi - toby maguire Spiderman trilogy.. To be fair, The Amazing Spiderman might be close to the plots in comics, Ha! but then the rebooted comics version isn't a good reason to reboot an already successful movie series. Dejavu when you get to see too many scenes so identical to the 2002 film, understandably all grown from the same roots, hmm and like many, i strongly believe the reboot version was a bit early to be made..<br/><br/>Some better things, however, worth mentioning : the pretty Emma stone who is much better than Kirsten Dunst ( don't give a darn whether its Gwen or Mary Jane, they are meant to be Spiderman's Lady love anyways). A strong villain in Dr.Lizard, thanks to good CGI (poor characterization and casting though) and finally Music composed By James Horner. Andrew Garfield is cute - a good leap from ""The Social Network"" - but isn't quite the lovable Peter Parker we know.<br/><br/>The script, the dialogues and the closing lines were all lacking the firepower and the emotional vibrancy, just to make a comparison, the voice-over of Tobey's Spiderman(With great power comes great responsibility. This is my gift, my curse. Who am I? I'm Spider-man.) still gives me the flare, which sadly is a huge miss with the rebooted movie. Memories afresh how I got crazy with Spider-Man(2002) during my schooldays!! hmm, The Amazing Spider-Man never comes close. 6/10"

","OK for those who haven't seen this movie- please go and see it! it's really really good and for those who follow comic closely, you'll be impressed to see SPIDERMAN as he's meant to be and in no way a fag as it was portrayed in last franchise.<br/><br/>Having said that, I have just one question- WHERE THE HELL DID THE EMOTIONAL CONTENT GO??!!! out of all the superhero's, Spiderman series has the highest emotional quotient. which means his parents disappearance, and then how he's close to his uncle and aunt who are super nice to him, and how much he loves them and all that jazz. In this movie, there is not one scene which shows the bond between him and his uncle/aunt. in fact, at a certain point it seemed they'd be like ""you're grown up get the duck out"" ha ha not one moment you feel the connection between them. they argue without sorting the issues. this is the only and a very major issue with this movie<br/><br/>The first one had shown spider-man a fag, but he still had a very special bond with his uncle/aunt which made you feel how sad he was when his uncle died and how he then changes/transforms. <br/><br/>I cant believe they overlooked this aspect. <br/><br/>Also, some problems here and there- like how he develops his powers, seems like he understood it at once, and wasn't really excited about new gained powers. More like- ""i knew this was coming, and i'm mentally prepared for it""<br/><br/>Also, was that villain a good guy or bad? what was his motive behind everything that he was doing-another weak point.<br/><br/>had they fixed these holes in plot, it would have been the best comic movie of the year (SO FAR, DKR awaited)<br/><br/>Problem was in the script and direction was weak. performances, good as expected"

","It seems that we live in the era of useless remakes...<br/><br/>And these remakes are a clear demonstration of the total lack of creativity and originality that has been plagued major (more expensive) cinematographic endeavors. They cannot come up with any interesting characters and stories, and to play safe they insist on remaking (poorly by the way)film after film.<br/><br/>Why another Spiderman? Aren't there tons of superheroes that are as or more interesting than Spiderman? Why the same old story where uncles, friend, etc. die? <br/><br/>These guys are clearly betting (and winning) on the dumbing-down of the average movie-goer.

"griffolyon12","10","9","19","3 July 2012"," I feel the ol' Parker luck!
","We all know the story, teenager is bit by a scientifically altered spider, gets spider powers and becomes Spider-Man, what we didn't know was his past before he became the Spider-Man. To compare The Amazing Spider-Man to the original Sam Raimi Spider-Man, is like comparing apples to oranges. One is more character centric, where as the other is more light-hearted and melodramatic in the comic book style. The Amazing Spider-Man is a wonderful movie because it does not feel like a retread of the Sam Raimi original. Director Marc Webb and the rest of his crew have manufactured a Spider-Man movie that does not try to compete with what has been done before, but rather focuses on lesser known aspects of the character Peter Parker and makes the film a character piece rather than a large scale mosaic.<br/><br/>It's evident when we are not treated to a shot of the New York City skyline till nearly ten minutes into the movie, that this Spider-Man isn't looking to impress with scope or scale. Rather the first thing we see is the tale of how Peter Parker's parents left him as a child with Uncle Ben and Aunt May, to never return for him. This is the greatest and most unique aspect of the film. The Amazing Spider-Man is up there with some of the great comic book story arcs, because it delves deeper into Peter's past than perhaps even some of the comics have done. Actor Andrew Garfield portrays Peter as a kid with a chip on his shoulder, having been abandoned by his own father he looks for fatherly connections with everyone from Uncle Ben to Dr. Curtis Connors, all the way to his girlfriend's dad, Captain Stacy. Garfield is the heart- and-soul of this movie, and he portrays Peter as an outcast rather than as a geek with no friends, and it works. He understands the character, perhaps even more so than Tobey Maguire did.<br/><br/>While the story does retread some of the origin aspects from the Sam Raimi movie, the movie is constantly replaying them so differently, it never really crosses the mind that they are portraying some of the same events. The strength to this lies in the great screenplay from James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sergeant, and Harry Potter-alum Steve Kloves. The screenplay ties up Spidey's origin with Peter trying to uncover the mystery of his dad's old briefcase, which leads him to discover the source of his webbing, and his powers, but it also gives the movie a different through line than any other Spider-Man movie. <br/><br/>We see Peter get bit by the spider, we see him discover his powers, we even see the unfortunate tragedy that leads him to donning tights, but what we see is a more realistic approach to how these things play out. The Raimi film is more operatic, focusing on the emotion of the moments, rather this film focuses more on how these moments work as transitioning points in the maturation of Peter Parker and coming to accept his parents' disappearance. Everything flows and transpires with an action-reaction style. Peter does something, which causes this to happen, or this happens affecting Peter, and this keeps the story always focused on him.<br/><br/>As cheesy as it sound, The Amazing Spider-Man is amazing. The fight scenes between Spidey and his bad guy the Lizard are top notch, with some exceptional CG-camera work that creates the sense of being a fly on the wall zooming and flipping over the fight as Spidey zips around. Emma Stone is likable as love interest Gwen Stacy, and Martin Sheen is a terrific Uncle Ben, with that exceptionally lovable twinkle in his eye. Not to mention the film is well directed, joining the ranks of other Indie-Blockbusters over the past decade (Blockbusters with an Independent film aesthetic because they were made by an Indie director, this case Marc Webb). There are many directorial signatures in Webb's work that can be seen in both his first film, (500) Days of Summer, and this one. In particular the music video-like montage when Peter is messing around with his powers and skateboarding, it harks back to Webb's video roots and the multiple montage, music video-like sequences in (500) Days of Summer. To cap it off, the musical score from James Horner is heroic and beautiful at all of the right moments, being a worthy successor to the brilliant Danny Elfman music from the original movies.<br/><br/>I loved this movie, it was fun, heroic, deep, and emotional. There are so many great scenes, one of my personal favorites being when Spider-Man saves a child from a burning car hanging off a bridge, or the finale when an injured Spidey gets aid from New Yorkers themselves. These scenes just symbolize what is so special about the character of Spider- Man. He has wit, but he's also got a huge heart and will almost always try to do the right thing, even if it nearly kills him in the process. The old Parker luck is with this one.<br/><br/>I give The Amazing Spider-Man a 10 out of 10!"
"edisondsa-365-568793","1","23","60","5 July 2012"," Worst Film OF 2012 so far and one of the worst in this decade !!!
","First Twilight now this !!!!This is the worst adaptation of spider man i have seen yet . It is the worst movie i have seen this year. It is an insult to spider man and his fans .... What awful acting by Andrew Garfield, Emma stone and the other actors as well. Spider man (2002) was 100000 times better than this . Really lousy directing i have seen bad Hindi movies this year but this one beats all i don't know who made Mark Webb a director. I will surely nominate this one for a Razzie . I really hope it wins worst picture and bags most of the Razzie awards.The story is so slow and boring animation is poor as well.I urge people to please stay away from this one even if you have nothing else to watch."
"btorun-368-612496","3","10","22","16 July 2012"," Awful
","I gave to this movie three stars for three great men in this movie: John Schwartzman, Martin Sheen and Dennis Leary. Schwartzman did a brilliant job. The camera work really fulfills the needs of an action movie. Martin Sheen and Dennis Leary are both great actors and also great in this movie.<br/><br/>But sadly even great actors are given shitty lines in this movie. Andrew Garfield was OK but not better than Tobey Maguire. Emma Stone was also mediocre. Sally Field(Aunt May) and Rhys Ifans(Dr. Curt Connors) were terrible. You can't have a great action movie without a great villain. He was poorly characterized. We don't know anything about him except he wants to turn the world into a reptilian fantasy.<br/><br/>Directing and music were also bad. James Horner is a shitty composer. Why didn't they work with Danny Elfman again. Marc Webb has done a bad job in terms of storytelling and character development. I think he should go back to directing comedies.<br/><br/>Here comes the worst part: Script. Story was silly. I understand that when you make reboots you change the original storyline. But it was so terrible that it pisses you off. Some of the really stupid and annoying facts about the movie: -J.J. Jameson does not appear in the movie. -Peter decides to wear spiderman mask after he is inspired by a poster he accidentally sees after a thug fight. -Peter for a while looks for his uncles killer, then he stops looking for the killer. -Some swat guys are turned into reptile but we are not shown if they cause problems. -The movie redefines the laws of physics. Peter slowly closes the door but surprisingly he shatters the glass in the door. The ball he throws breaks the goalpost but supernaturally the ball doesn't go pop. These are lamely designed scenes to visualize his uncontrolled power.<br/><br/>This is a silly movie. Don't pay for it. Rewatch old spidey trilogy. They are far better."
"filmcritic3","10","10","22","3 July 2012"," The epitome of excellence in film entertainment
","Famous writers, and some not so famous, will look at their works and immediately begin to rework and rewrite them. It is in their nature. Something can always be refined, always made more concise. Editors share a similar foible. This is the case with the latest incarnation of comic book fav, Spider-Man. THE AMAZING SPIDER MAN is a much better telling of the web head's tale; a tighter script, a more eristic tale, and a more involved and inspired cast. THE AMAZING SPIDER MAN is two and a half hours in length, but as I watched the advanced press screening, I was totally unaware of the passage of time; certainly an indication of a well-made film. This version of Spidey is definitely worth the price of admission and repeated viewings. It is one you will be able to watch numerous times and still cull entertainment from; a definite addition to your home video collection. As such, it wins the coveted Fist of Fiore Award for 2012, exemplifying excellence in film entertainment.<br/><br/>Sometimes what is new is old again. Most of the superhero reboots return to a truer, if grizzlier version of the original comic tale. THE AMAZING SPIDER MAN returns Peter Parker to high school, rather than college. Encountering Professor Cur Connors is therefore a bit of a story bend. The connection between Peter's parents and Sgt. Nick Fury's S.H.I.E.L.D. organization is hinted at, opening doors for Spidey to cameo or co-star with either the X-Men or, more likely, The Avengers. Peter/Spidey is played by Andrew Garfield. He offers a passionate, modern approach to the character, but, again, this is his first outing. Tobey McGuire was solid in his first appearance as the Web-head, too. It wasn't until the sequels his contempt for the part was demonstrated. <br/><br/>Emma Stone, sporting a coiffure of blonde tresses, is Gwen Stacey, Peter's first true love. Emma is more than another glitz of glamour on the Silver Screen. She also displays amazing acting prowess and a precocious understanding of the camera lens. In THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN, she is a scene stealer.<br/><br/>Also in the cast are Rhys Ifans as Dr. Connors and Denis Leary as Captain George Stacey. Ifans is adequate in the role but his relationship with Peter is stilted; not from the acting, but rather a lull in the script. The original tales tell of a deep friendship between Connors and Peter, but Screenwriter James Vanderbilt doesn't reveal the rudiments of the friendship, save for an intellectual appreciation on the introductory level. Leary, on the other hand, is reduced to an extended cameo part. He is able, however, to portray Captain Stacey as a knowingly perceptive policeman and loving father. Finally, there is the Hitchcockian cameo by Stan Lee as the high school librarian, played in a collision montage for laughs.<br/><br/>THE AMAZING SPIDER MAN has a few drawbacks. One major issue is the appearance of The Lizard. In the comics, The Lizard had large protruding jaws jammed with razor sharp teeth. In this incantation, there are no jaws, just a distorted scaly face. It's not as menacing. This version of The Lizard is also cleaver and calculating. I seem to remember when Connors transformed into The Lizard, he became savage and rather mindless. (If my memory is faulty, I'm sure the comic book fans will forward emails to point out the error of my aging recollections.) The rest of The Lizard is excellently done by Production Designer J. Michael Riva. It somewhat compensates for the lack of jaws.<br/><br/>The other issue is one that plagues most superheroes. It's the egotistic desire of the lead actors to rip off the mask. In the last trilogy, Tobey McGuire made it a requirement. He was delusional enough to think his fans wanted to see him and not the superhero in full costume. Garfield is taking the same approach. Every major character in this story knows Parker is Spidey by the film's end. It makes the entire concept of a secret identity rather moot. The only sequence where the mask removal is viable and in character is when Spidey saves Jack, the little boy on the bridge. <br/><br/>KEY SCENES TO LOOK FOR: 1. ON THE ROOFTOP WITH GWEN AFTER DINNER 2. THE SCHOOL BATTLE WITH LIZARD 3. FIRST ENCOUNTER ON THE BRIDGE 4. THE IMAX WEB TRAVELLING SCENES 5. THE JACKIE CHAN STYLE SUBWAY FIASCO<br/><br/>I had the opportunity to see THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN in 3d IMAX. It's definitely worth it. The sequences of Spidey swinging through Manhattan are quite entertaining and effectively shot. Cinematographer John Schwartzman utilizes camera angles exceptionally well to compensate for any flaws in CGI. And, I would be remiss if I didn't mention the Armstrong family. For years I have made it a point to highlight when Vic Armstrong is involved with a film. The iconic 1980's stuntman is now passing the torch as the entire Armstrong family is engaged in fight sequencing and stunts for this film. Daddy Vic serves as second unit director.<br/><br/>THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN has a conclusion, but leaves so many doors open Columbia Studios can really take this saga in any number of directions. There is the now obligatory added scene after the credits, so be sure to stay to the very end. All told, though, THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN is a most noble reboot of the franchise, a great movie, and, at the risk of angering comic fanboys everywhere, a lot better than THE AVENGERS.<br/><br/>THE RATING FOR THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN = A<br/><br/>-30-<br/><br/>Fiore Mastracci is host and producer of the award-winning Outtakes, soon to celebrate 500 shows.

Two thumbs up for me, it was a wild ride 8-) Always love Emma Stone, although not as a blonde so much but she was a cute match for the movie. I had the opportunity to see Garfield in a movie called Never Let Me Go. So I knew that he would handle a part like this with ease.

So I must say Well Done!"
"jschroeck92","10","7","14","25 July 2012"," Better than the first series, by a landslide
","First off, when the first Spider-man movie came out back in 2002, I wasn't all that excited. I was a huge spider-man fan, and I loved the comics and the 1994 TV series, but the first movie didn't seem all that great to me. Toby McGuire didn't seem to make that great of a Peter Parker. I never could get used to him being Spider-man. Also, that series of movies didn't go along with the original comics very well. I wasn't very pleased.<br/><br/>As soon as I saw this new Spider-man movie coming out I thought, ""Well lets see if they can get this new series started off right."" The previews and trailers definitely got me a lot more interested than the trailers of the first series. I saw that Andrew Garfield was playing Peter Parker and I got more excited because he seemed to fit the part a lot better than McGuire ever did.<br/><br/>Well, I didn't see the movie in 3D in theaters. I decided to see it at the drive in with my family instead. I still saw the movie though. The action scenes were intense and very exciting. There were also plenty of scenes where a little bit of humor was necessary. One thing about this movie compared to the others is that it seemed to flow very well. It had a well organized plot, the director knew what he wanted, and he made it happen. There were a couple scenes that seemed a little bit rushed like the one fighting scene against the Lizard on the bridge and when Peter revealed that he was Spider-man to Gwen Stacy. Though they were rushed, they needed to get done and they were done well for being rushed.<br/><br/>I also like Emma Stone's role as Gwen Stacy a lot. Gwen was Peter Parker's first girlfriend in the comics and this movie did great fitting her in. Her father the police Captain (Denis Leary) did a great job, its just that in the original comics he doesn't die until a later battle. Sorry for that one spoiler but it is true.<br/><br/>This movie was very exciting, a lot better than expected, and I came out of there thinking, ""I wouldn't mind seeing that movie again."" My dad was even pleased. He doesn't like a whole lot of movies also. Every single movie he does like is a great movie and just about every movie he doesn't like did terrible in theaters. I rate this movie with 10 stars and I highly recommend that if you are doubting this movie to stop and just see it. You won't be disappointed."
"ross_kewl","7","7","14","7 July 2012"," Not as good as the original
","So here it is again folks, but this time, its not just Spiderman, its an AMAZING Spiderman. For someone who thought the original Spiderman was amazing, this movie surely would leave a lasting imprint in my mind that would deem this movie truly the most amazing Spiderman film yet. Wrong. Although this movie wasn't terrible, it wasn't astounding either.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with your typical nerd who gets picked on by the school bully. Sounds similar nay? Through one way or another Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) finds himself infiltrating a million-dollar bio medical research facility and gets bitten by a spider and starts to exhibit spider-like qualities. <br/><br/>To the positives, Andrew Garfield did a tremendous job and I think it would a close contest between him and Tobey Maguire. His smart-ass appeal was entertaining without being too silly. I preferred Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) to Mary-Jane basically because she actually helped save the world instead of being the Damsel in distress. Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) also deserves a mention as the characters death really had a profound effect on Spidey so the acting in this movie is top-notch.<br/><br/>The area in which this movie could have been improved was the plot, and I find with a lot of movies lately, that the writing for the plot has let down some great acting. Prometheus (2012) is a perfect example. <br/><br/>""Peter Parker finds a clue that might help him understand why his parents disappeared when he was young. His path puts him on a collision course with Dr. Curt Connors, his father's former partner."" Summary from the IMDb, Spiderman page. The mystery that was presented at the beginning of the movie is never even solved. Why did his parents abandon their only son? It never occurred to me that Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) was trying to hunt down Peter Parker's elusive parents. <br/><br/>I never really understood the Connors' motivations. At first he was researching cross-species mutation is a bid to repair his amputated forearm. Then it changes because he thinks human kinds is weak and we should all be turned into monstrous lizards. <br/><br/>The fight scenes were a bit unbelievable and silly. I was watching this with my friend and we both take chemistry and we laughed when dinosaur Connors grabbed two coloured solutions, mixed them together to create a HE grenade. Liquid Nitrogen on the top of a skyscraper? Really? I concede that Lizards are able to grow back their tails, BUT NOT ENTIRE F***ING LIMBS!!! Salamanders, which are amphibians can regrow limbs but no reptile that has been identified possesses the ability to regrow limbs. <br/><br/>I guess also Peter got bored of pursuing his Uncle's killer and decided to become a superhero instead. The crane guy and his cranes was commendable but cringeful and didn't really have the effect that it intended to have. My final ramble is about Parker defending Spiderman's actions at the awkward girlfriend dinner table scene. The way it appeared to me that Parker was only chasing criminals to find the man who killed his uncle, not a public service. And when he did find criminals he wasn't exactly dropping them off in front of the police station, he was having a great time shooting webs into their crotches.<br/><br/>Overall, I think the movie attempted to fit too much in the time frame. There were many ideas that were forgotten during the movie and at points got a bit silly for me to tolerate. This movie isn't terrible and is definitely above 6 stars but doesn't deserve as 8 or higher."
"wildandcrazguy1","10","7","14","3 July 2012"," Off to a much better start than the previous trilogy
","First of all, I was one of the people who did not think it was necessary to do a Spiderman movie reboot, but after seeing ""The Amazing Spiderman"" I am very glad they did. Andrew Garfield played a much better Peter Parker/Spiderman than Tobey Maguire ever did. He actually looks more like high-school student as well. I also enjoyed the Peter Parker/Gwen Stacy storyline more than the Peter Parker/Mary Jane Watson storyline. The villain of Dr Curt Connors/The Lizard was fantastic. All the characters seemed to be easier to relate to than in the previous movies. It gives you more of a realistic look at how a real high school student would react if given superhuman spidey powers. The roles of Uncle Ben and Aunt May didn't seem to be as major in ""The Amazing Spiderman"" than in the previous trilogy, but I liked that because it didn't take away from the film or drag on the scenes with them in it. On the whole, I prefer ""Spiderman 2"" to ""The Amazing Spiderman"" or maybe I just need to re-watch them both, but if ""The Amazing Spiderman"" is an example of where this trilogy is headed, I am very excited for it."
"sannyxd","10","7","14","3 July 2012"," The 'Amazing' Spiderman and nothing less!
","This movie was a very special movie for me, because I grew up on the character Spiderman. I was very emotionally tied to the film and I held back tears at the end from how good it actually was. <br/><br/>This movie does a great job of establishing the many things that create Peter Parker as a whole without making it too cheesy. They incorporated Peter's passion of photography, his desire for vengeance of Uncle Ben's death, his love for Aunt May, his crush on Gwen Stacey, his loser status in school. One of the best things about the film was that even though it was a Superhero movie there was real emotional attachment and each character had their own story. This movie did, by far, the best job out of all of the superhero movies to create an actual story where the protagonist wasn't someone you just idolized but someone that you understood. Then you add the classic action element and love subplot and you get this amazing movie. I will be one of the first to admit that I was not that excited when they said they were rebooting the series but after watching this movie I can tell you that it was one of the best movies of the year and if you have not seen it yet, whether you like Spiderman or not, you need to go out of your way to watch it!"

A Dinosaur story'', ''Balto'' etc he was the perfect choice as the composer and it brings me nostalgia.<br/><br/>And this is why The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) is a Marvel Master- Piece and the Tobey fan-boys cry babies won't change that <br/><br/>Unfortunately, The Amazing Spider-man Franchise died without making a third as in the ends of the first film we will never know the secret about the mysterious guy who appeared and disappeared in Dr Curt Connors cell, it was a very interesting franchise and I didn't think The sequel was a bad movie, I enjoyed Tom Holland as Spider- man in Civil war and I can't wait to see Homecoming."

","Watching this after ""Dark Knight Rises"" is like moving from Saudi Arabia to Monaco.<br/><br/>One is the vision of one man through close, very close collaborators. It takes chances, risks darkness. It has motion and noise, but as part of the world we happen upon.<br/><br/>This is the product of a production committee. No one wants to do anything that matters; the goal is to have a the tastiest candy on the block. It takes no chances. It has noise and motion not because of the world we visit, but because the channel we see that world through imposes it on us. The colors are primary. The grunge, where it appears seems to be decals applied to smooth unshadowed surfaces. It has nothing that cannot be found on any other committee- populated shelf.<br/><br/>There are two things I noted. They both kill all the fathers. But Batman peppers the world with adult sex of a few different kinds. The way this is woven (the sex and the fathers) is how we encounter the weave in real lives: confusingly entangled. Sure, the Catgirl suit and its corset registered in one familiar way, but the manner of the girl was hardly the conventional model (waif or seductress).<br/><br/>On the other hand, Stan Lee's girl was about as sexless as possible. The fatherlessness in this case drives the superhero's soul into a different type of emptiness than Bruce Wayne's condition does, one more monastic. I believe that the world of viewers may be equally divided on which is the more superficial.<br/><br/>The other thing concerns a criticism I have noted in many previous Marvel films, but especially the Raimi projects. They just don't understand how to use the third dimension. The first three were lost opportunities to spatially thrill. Now, well after some exciting techniques have appeared in big films, they finally capitulate and use state of the art dimensional flight. I believe the problem was the the original comics did not understand this either all Marvel worlds are flat, and fidelity to the comic vision was paramount.<br/><br/>But here they do what everyone else is. And that is the problem. They parceled action scenes out to different effects houses and bought every motion technique on the shelf. So we get a hodgepodge of space, depending on who the production crew was for each segment. I saw this in IMAX 3d. The whiplash was extreme, not from the spatial effects — many of which were fine. But from the shifts in how the space was constructed.<br/><br/>Like eating ice cream and tasting steak, then coconut, then tar.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."
"reemachitalia2003","9","12","28","3 July 2012"," The most relatable spider-man
","When I stepped inside the cinema hall, i was apprehensive, if this series would really live up to the Toby Maguire trilogy as Andrew Garfield is not only different but also a weird choice for the role but the moment, the film started, you completely forget the previous one.<br/><br/>Even though you know the plot quite well, the slight modification in it works in favor of the film than against it. This one makes spider-man more believable with an interplay of several emotions like breaking down, arrogance, anger etc. Andrew Garfield is absolutely spot on as the new spider-man and delivers one scene after the other with so much finesse that it leaves you stunned and probably you may end up reaching a conclusion like me that he's certainly better. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy is perfect and their chemistry has the right amount of reluctance, awkwardness but yet it touches your heart. The 3D effects are terrific in the parts when spider-man is swinging in the Manhattan skies.<br/><br/>If your looking for more action and 3D effects then you may not like this movie but if you can accept a spider-man with his weaknesses but yet a zeal to protect his nation and ground in reality with an eerie relatability, this one is meant for you. I'd say go and catch it."

Her role, Gwen Stacy, has not gone null with just being emotionally attached to Peter but helping him in a crucial moment. The CGI could've been better. But its good to watch Peter swinging, in 3D.

","Only 5 years after the last episode of the outstanding first trilogy , it was a strange decision from Marvel in the first place to launch a reboot of Spiderman.<br/><br/>But the marketing surrounding the film lead you to think they knew what they were doing : A darker, more realistic Spidey and a new take on the origin of the hero seemed attractive enough.<br/><br/>Yet, strangely, the movie is less dark and far less realistic than the original and the story of the origin is confusing and uninteresting at best.<br/><br/>The major problem is that every aspect of this film (the acting, the characters, the love story, the villain, even the opening credits and the cliffhanger...) is too generic and flat to raise any interest.<br/><br/>Even Andrew Garfield's strange acting, that fit so good in other movies, was so forced here that I felt embarrassed in many scenes.<br/><br/>The plot is sometimes very confusing and often completely illogical.<br/><br/>There were a few interesting ideas but they are too briefly or poorly exploited.<br/><br/>If you are, like me, a fan of the Sam Raimi's trilogy, do yourself a favor and crush this unnecessary spider.<br/><br/>It is just another triumph of marketing over substance."
"Vins_gurl18","6","8","17","5 July 2012"," Not bad....but *something* was ""missing""
","*****WARNING!! This review Contains SPOILERS!!*****<br/><br/>I just saw ""The Amazing Spiderman and boy oh boy....where do I begin? <br/><br/>Honestly....I have some mixed feelings about this movie. <br/><br/>First off the Pros: 1)I like how the movie tried to be a little original and slightly different from the Sam Raimi Spiderman films. 2)The cast was fairly solid. The acting was pretty good actually. I didn't detect any ""weakest links"" in the acting dept. 3)Andy Garfield was pretty decent as Peter Parker and as Spiderman. 4)I liked Emma Stone. She and Andrew had some pretty good on-screen chemistry too! <br/><br/>Now for the cons: 1) I think the biggest let-down about this movie is the fact that this movie didn't really have any ""heart"" to it. Honestly, after watching the movie, I actually felt the urge to go back and watch Sam Raimi/Tobey Macguire's Spider-man films again. 2)There was barely any character development for certain characters. The villain especially I felt was sorely UNDER developed. They could have done a better job. What were his TRUE motives? It felt like he turned completely overnight. 3) The musical score SUCKED!! (Another BIG let-down) Like....big time! Almost to the point where it seemed out of place in some scenes. Danny Elfman did a MUCH better job w/the musical score for Spiderman 1 & 2 imo. It was memorable, exciting, and got you hyped for the movie. The music in this film however felt REALLY out of place. 4) Plot holes galore! I liked the premise about trying to show more hints about what happened to Peter's parents, but half-way through the film, they kind of like drop the subject, and you never really find out WHAT happened to his parents. Smh.... 5)No JJ Jameson?? No Daily Bugle?? 6)I didn't really feel a connection to Spiderman at ALL. Say what you will about Tobey, but I felt more of an emotional connection with HIS character than with Garfield's character. For some reason I just wasn't buying his character. idk.... I didn't really care if he lived or died sad to say. Maybe he was just TOO smart alecky...idk... 7) I didn't sense a real internal struggle with Peter regarding his desire to get revenge and his need to do what was right. 8)Peter practically let all of NYC see his face outside of the spidey mask, and told Gwen who he was on a first date. Not cool at all! Where's the mystery? The guessing?? Ugh! This irked me to no end. <br/><br/>9)The movie just wasn't all that enjoyable. It was funny and entertaining in many parts, sure...but it just didn't have any SOUL. I can't explain it! Something was missing and Idk what. With the previous Spiderman franchise, I really felt ENGROSSED in the story and in the movie. This newer version felt like the storyline/plot was a bit rushed and all over the place. I didn't feel excited about this film at ALL for some reason. It was NOT the same feeling I got anytime I watched the Raimi Spider-Man films. Sure, those older Spidey films may have been somewhat cheesy on some level, but they were still filled with EXCITEMENT! <br/><br/>Not only that, but during this film I found myself comparing it to the older Spider-Man films the entire time. Usually when a new movie franchise is REALLY good, you pretty much forget the old previous franchise. Like for example, with Nolan's new Batman Franchise. When I first saw ""Batman Begins"", I was like...Michael Keaton who?? Val Kilmer WHO? George Clooney who?? <br/><br/>Bottom Line: Overall, if you're a big fan of the Spiderman films, then you might actually ENJOY this film a lot. If you're NOT really a fan of the spidey comics, OR if you really enjoyed Sam Raimi's Spiderman films (esp. 1 & 2) then this film might feel like it's ""lacking"" something. It's probably rentable for you."
"bubkis10","10","8","17","3 July 2012"," Amazing Reboot
","(No spoilers in this review!!) ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" was fantastic and well written. I enjoyed it much more than the past 3 films for a couple reasons. 1. This new series is much grittier and more realistic than the past series. I love Andrew Garfield as both Spider-Man and Peter Parker. He is much more of a kid- like character like Peter should be. I also enjoyed how they brought back the classic web shooters and how they adapted them. Now a lot of people are giving this movie bad rating because they say they have seen this movie before in the past series. There are certain principals that you have to go by to make it a spider-man film. For instance, Peter has to get bit by a spider. Uncle Ben has to die. Without those it wouldn't be a Spider-Man flick. This origin is, i would say, more fun and relatable. I'm looking forward to more Spider-Man films in this series."

"Thekeybaldemasterrises","5","9","20","3 July 2012"," These IMDb reviewers don't know what they are talking about!
","OK, let me start off with the other people, they clearly are not comic book fans, and don't pay attention to the news, what people are not realizing is not everything we expected to see is revealed in this movie, it's gonna play out later in the series. Alright on to the movie, now I myself was concerned that this movie wasn't going to live up to my expectations, I was wrong. Marc Webb and his crew did an amazing job making a great story told again in a way that actually works, Not to mention they hired a great and talented cast for the movie, Andrew Garfield mostly. He really pulls off that nerdy look of Peter Parker that just didn't look that great on Tobey Maguire. Now I wasn't a big fan of Kirsten Dunst, I never was. Emma stone was a lovable character, and I can really see the chemistry between her and Garfield that looks realistic. Now Rhys Ifans was an interesting character, and his acting was very well done for the lizard. Now this was my only issue for the movie, the lizard was entertaining, but he wasn't as enjoyable as the green goblin William Defoe played in Sam Rami's series. And in shorter words everyone did great being their characters. Now as far as the FX go, they were spectacular, the CG used for the Lizard was impressive too, they are only a few action sequences in the movie, but I didn't care! Peter's character was entertaining all the way through, what some people don't realize about Spidey is he's just a kid, and that life wasn't all Pilates from the city when he began his job as the web slinger; what I see in great comic book movies like this and batman Begins is the realism, cops just don't trust masked vigilantes immediately that's all part of the realism, that's why they prove themselves heroes later in their stories. So above all 10/10, the movie is great, ignore these crazy IMDb reviews and just enjoy the ride!"
"cookiemonstergonebad","10","9","20","1 July 2012"," Fantastic, a must-watch
","I personally think that this film was really good.<br/><br/>It might seem over exaggerated that I'm giving a 10/10, but this contained everything I wanted and it was definitely worth the wait. The love story behind it worked perfectly with the actual spider-man story, and there were some really touching moments which fitted with both the love story and the action.<br/><br/>There was tension, action, suspense, drama etc.<br/><br/>This film is a must-watch, especially for all superhero lovers! But this film was definitely very different from the old spider-man trilogy. But it's still a massive recommendation. *Please note that I might be slightly biased, but I still believe it's a must-watch."

","This film is about a young man who gained superpowers while trying to find out why his father disappeared years ago.<br/><br/>""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is what a blockbuster should be. The pace is fast, and there is not a moment of dullness. There is plenty of action scenes, and most of the scenes have amazing special effects. Even in 2D, I was astounded by the level of detail of the Spiderman swinging through skyscrapers in New York. There are comedic scenes that got the whole house laughing, and there are also spine chilling scenes involving heights. I like the emotional subplot very much too. The emotional connections between Peter and Gwen, and also between Gwen's father and Peter are well portrayed, that the film is moving me to the point of tears. I think ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is called so for a reason, and I enjoyed it so much."

","Let me start off by saying i will not spoil the film for you by going into great detail. This movie has been criticized, for what, i don't know this is truly a masterpiece. The movie stays true to the comics with Gwen Stacey being peters first love and not Mary Jane! Also his web slingers are introduced because in the comics spidey couldn't create webbing the movie shows peters struggles and build up to become a better person and a great hero just like in the comics. He is also comical and arrogant just like the comics so why hate just because its true to the comic doesn't make it bad the acting is great and Garfield played a better spider-man than Toby. The action is great and not overly hyped and the story is true and believable...well more believable than Toby's spider-man movies. All around this is a great movie and one of the best super hero adaptations of all time."

"ferguson-6","7","6","12","7 July 2012"," One Guy in a Unitard
","Greetings again from the darkness. The big debate seems to be whether it is too soon for the Spider-Man franchise to be re-booted. It was just 10 years ago when Tobey Maguire first appeared as Spidey and a mere 5 years ago when director Sam Raimi delivered the last leg in his trilogy. Obviously the reason to re-boot starts with ""doll"" and ends with ""ars"". It is more interesting to decide if this is an improvement over the previous series.<br/><br/>We must first look at Spider-man himself. Played here by Andrew Garfield, we get a more thoughtful Peter Parker and a more athletic Spidey version than we had with Maguire. As usual, my pet peeve is that Garfield is a 28 year old man cast as an 18 year old high school science nerd. Looking past that, Garfield manages to pull off the stunts without looking too much like a real super hero. So that's a plus. Luckily for him, his scenes with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) work because Ms. Stone is such a super talent. She makes everything she is in, just a little bit better.<br/><br/>Next we look at the villain. Rhys Ifans plays scientist Dr Curt Connors, who transforms into Lizard in the quest to regenerate growth of his lost right arm. He was once partners with Peter's dad in their research into reptilian genetics. While Doc Ock (Alfred Molina) from Spider-Man 2 is still my favorite villain in the series, it's clear that Lizard is certainly capable of frightening the younger viewers, so parents beware. It should also be noted that Dr Curt Connors was played by Dylan Baker in the Sam Raimi trilogy.<br/><br/>Lastly, we look at the story. This take is much more personal and provides detail to the backstory of Peter Parker. We learn how (but not exactly why) he lost his parents (Campbell Scott and Embeth Davidtz) and see how he came to be raised by Aunt May (Sally Field) and Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen). We see how he and Gwen Stacy come together and learn that she is every bit his equal intellectually, if not a notch above. Casting Dennis Leary as Gwen's Police Chief dad works as Leary and Garfield exchange barbs at the table. Peter is still a photographer, but this time for the school instead of The Daily Bugle ... whose logo makes an appearance on TV.<br/><br/>Director Marc Webb was somehow selected for this despite his only feature film being (500) Days of Summer ... not exactly a film known for its CGI. Admittedly, the CGI used here is less rush and cluttered than in previous Spidey films and many of the stunts look to be real stunts instead of the fake stuff. The closing credit cookie clearly sets up the sequel, though I can only guess that the shadowy figure is Norman Osborn. That's still up for debate."
"saish746","4","6","12","6 July 2012"," Re-imaging Spidey - The Amazing Spider-man
","The houseful theaters prove that Spiderman's franchise is way bigger than its movies. It does matter who is the new amazing Spiderman, as long as there is more of Spidey than lame Peter Parker. This is fourth sequel which has more of dark Spider-man and his journey finding himself (unknowingly). The first half of movie is a wasted effort to let us know again how Mr Parker was bitten by a spider in a lab and from a timid school boy he turned into a street fighter and designed a costume to finally become a super hero Spider-man. This was so boring journey to re-visit more humanly spidey , even the web shooters were artificial and Webb didn't draw the hero muscular, taking his vice from Ultimate Spider-man. Webb even made the villain little human and comparing Dr. Curt Connors / The Lizard with Godzilla will a similar mistake to that of comparing an ant to an elephant.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield was honest as a cute next door school boy however less convincing as a superhero and this time there were no great powers hence no great responsibility. but focused on secrets: the ones we keep... and the ones that are kept from us. A secret formula to grow limbs and mutants. We had so many mutant before and it was also surprising to know that the antidote was made before the poison. The movie lacks charisma of a superhero marvel. Neither the Hero nor the Antagonist was big enough to carry the sequel. We have seen everything before.The promise of turning this one a 3D was another failure. You might see less of graphical heights and more of acting prowess of Garfield. While Sam Raimi was more into super sets and better action, Webb drilled down to emotional aspect of a super-hero. Beware Kids may not like this !!! Mary-Jane Watson was replaced by old timer and more punk smart Gwen Stacy. This too blonde actress was a weak link and Emma Stone had some mixed performance. Rhys Ifans was quite convincing than other casts in the movie. Irrfan had better screen presence than Anil Kapoor in Mission -impossible but he never bragged about it and always confessed it as a smaller role. However he might need to put more expression and eyes while delivering in English. Marc Webb is saved by the franchise'........ 2/5"

","As far as genesis movies go, this one is fantastic. Furthermore, it completely trumps Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man. I'll admit I was skeptical of Andrew Garfield's ability to carry an iconic role like this one, but he did so beautifully. He was the right amount of dorky, funny, and serious, while giving a new feel to the Peter Parker character. I also loved the fact that Emma Stone was in this movie, and as Gwen Stacy at that. She always provides solid acting and natural charm.<br/><br/>The writers and directors did a good job of providing a lot of true-to- the-story components in the film. It is tough to do a revamp of a film within a decade and have the guts to actually retell the story from scratch, but this movie did just that. Overall, there was an appropriate balance of plot, romance, and action, as well as a seamless flow from beginning to end. Lastly, I was thoroughly entertained with Spider-Man's new fighting style. His movements were much sharper and present than in the past, but graceful and fluid when they needed to be. As a serious movie-goer and longtime comic book fanatic, this movie got it right."

","Totally boring. I was yawning like crazy and growing restless throughout the movie, even during the action sequences.<br/><br/>The whole movie is shot so tastelessly, even the action sequences, which there are hardly any of, seem boring. There are a total of perhaps 10 minutes of meaningful action in the movie, even during which the CGI seems jaded and something out of 2001. <br/><br/>Everything seems forced and fake, from the beatings peter parker receives in the beginning, the ridiculous murder of Peter's uncle (the guy shot him 'coz he was running away after stealing beer from a grocery store - very believable !) <br/><br/>The guy playing peter parker can't act to save his life and it's just pathetic watching him embarrass himself on screen.<br/><br/>If I was pushed against the wall though, I'd say emma stone is the only positive thing in the movie, not by virtue of her acting, which is fairly pedestrian, by virtue of her looks. She looked pretty at times.<br/><br/>I knew this was a mistake going in, since this was so obviously a brain-dead attempt to fool audiences into purchasing something they have no use for. I regret my decision to watch this movie. 0 originality, not 1 scene stands out, nothing remains with me 2 hours after watching this movie.

It was so awesome that I gave a standing ovation to the movie.First of all,talking about Andrew Garfield. This is the version of Spidey that we have seen in the comics,and Garfield had portrayed it with utter brilliance. I mean, he was living, not acting.And the great Lizard, of course. This would be the most wicked portrayal of any Spidey villain in movies after Doc Ock and Electro. I liked the new design. And I forgot to mention,I love the new Spidey outfit!Talking about VFX,I thought that swinging scenes were actually shot,it felt so real that we feel the dynamics of the two characters(Spidey and Lizard),especially the scene where we are introduced to the web slinger, where we feel like we are swinging across the streets of New York along with him.And the story was also great.I liked the action scenes, because they were in appropriate places. Even though the running time is shorter compared to previous installments,I loved it so much. This would be the darkest portrayal of the web slinger ever done in celluloid!"

","This movie arrived in the mail; my wife had chosen it from Blockbuster. I had not been aware there was a new one, so when I saw it I thought it might be a blu-ray of the Tobey Maguire movie, which we own.<br/><br/>I realized right away it was a fresh production; but I kept seeing the new and remembering the Tobey Maguire versions. So, here he falls for Gwen Stacy instead of Mary-Jane Watson; Gwen's father, Captain Stacy of NYPD instead of Mr. Osborn of Oscorp.<br/><br/>In a character-by-character match the new is simply the old retouched; but this is certainly its own movie. I guess the biggest thing to me is surprise that, if Marvel is doing another thing with Spider-Man, they did not use Tobey Maguire. Then again, he may be too old to be believed.<br/><br/>I wanted to express something on humor. I believe Stan Lee's cameo was planned in a way to make clear we do see him, with a very soothing music in his completely enclosed head-set, which makes the character completely oblivious to the violent and noisy play behind him, like when the man in True Lies finishes cleaning a room, exits and closes the door, and then Schwarzenegger's aircraft errantly breaks into the spotless room and makes a mess of things. It's a terrific moment, which I am certain was a cause of great laughter in more than just my viewing."

","Although this latest reboot of the Spider-Man franchise fails to hit the high notes that Raimi's Spider-man 2 did, and despite it falling significantly short of the Dark Knight trilogy, The Amazing Spider-Man is a promising new entry in the series. What remains most promising is the cast. Sheen does an excellent job as Ben Parker, as does Emma Stone as Gwen Stacey. Although Garfield does manages to evoke his status as a class above other teenage actors, he doesn't come off feeling quite as strong in the role of Peter Parker, although he does a better job then most would be able to. Unfortunately, this movies shortcomings are its rushed and sloppy editing, poor pacing and uninteresting villain. The Lizard is poorly rendered in CGI and his motives are never truly touched upon. Characters, including Oscorps Mr. Ratha's seem to come and go at random, and the lack of polish makes it feeling like a rushed process in the editing room. However, the effects are solid and breathtaking at times, the humour and acting is perfect, and you'll come out charmed by Marc Webb's distinctive take on The Amazing Spider-Man. The parts where Gwen and Peter interact are electric and feel similar to Webb's other movie, 500 Days of Summer. Overall I can highly recommend you go check out The Amazing Spider-Man and judge Marvel's latest reboot for yourself."

","I'm not saying that for a movie to be good it has to follow the source material (in this case the comic books) to the letter. I think it's quite alright to change some plot elements to make a bit different. Thats OK!<br/><br/>In my opinion, what is NOT OK, is to change who the main character IS. And that's exactly what's been done. The main characteristics of Peter Parkers persona is responsibility. I didn't see much of that here. Instead he was shown as skateboarding little sadistic jerk who could't wait to take off his mask for everyone who was interested. The scene on the balcony with Gwen when he shoots her in the ass with his web made me want to get up and leave the theater. Revealing he is Spiderman, for his personal gratification, or whatever you want to call it, is the last thing he would ever do. If you haven't understood that you should not be doing a movie about Spiderman at all. Call it something else.<br/><br/>A cornerstone also in Spiderman is how close to one and other Ben, Peter, and May are. None of that is shown. They just seem to irritate each other and bicker. The scene where Ben gets killed fits this perfectly - Peter hardly seems to care. A total miss.<br/><br/>If this movie had stayed true to the basic elements of Spiderman I would have given it a 5 because of some fun action scenes. But because this was a total misinterpretation of character (both Spiderman and Peter Parker) I'd give it a 0 if I could.<br/><br/>In the future, whoever was involved in forming this movie, do everyone a favor and stay away from the Spiderman franchise and don't ruin the Spiderman character more than you already have."
"karan-virgo92","5","7","15","18 July 2012"," This Should be The Amazing Walk to Remember!
","This is my first review on IMDb and it makes sense if I start writing with a Franchise that I have been so personally attached with since my childhood. Spiderman! I have read the comics, seen the cartoon on Television and even watched Sam Raimi's version of the films. Undoubtedly, Marc Webb's version of the franchise is different from earlier version seen before. Here, the nerdy Peter Parker has a camera in his hand which makes him popular in school. He has balls to take on Flash on his own when he bullies a kid. Is this really Peter Parker?? Such a character change is unacceptable for ardent followers of the franchise coz' over the years we have learnt to understand Peter Parker as one of us : a scared nerd with no balls to tackle our bullies. Even as Spiderman, Andrew Garfield character fails as the audience is left to wonder why would spiderman go around showing himself to kids, his GF and the cop whose sole aim in life is to arrest him. Too trusting, eh? The scene where he asks a kid to wear a mask that would give him strength is silly and outright farfetcted, to say the least. Even as we are sucked into this story of spiderman, we are bitterly disappointed by the utterly insipid romance of the protagonists which certainly takes most of the screen space. This is not a thriller but a romantic movie. The Amazing Walk to remember. But the biggest disappointment is The Lizard who is confused whether he wants to attack the city or kill spiderman. He starts with former, goes on to do the latter w/o completing the former, then again goes back to former w/o completing the latter. Plus there seems no motive for him to attack spiderman in school. Spiderman survives and yet he goes on to spread the virus. What's the reason for the attack? Seriously Webb could have done a better job with this with little more background check on the franchise."

","I've always wanted to see a Spiderman film without sinking too much into the plot.Enjoyable merely as a superhero fan. Spiderman plays on the strengths of its predecessors and does a tough job covering up the weaknesses. It's clear to see that Marvel stretched its fingernails in saving their precious spider. Four films later you don't expect anyone to still ask Spiderman who he is, unless that person comes from another planet they don't belong in the story.<br/><br/>The amount of flying and experimenting that Peter does makes it seem as if this is the first ever Spiderman film. It's a weak point the film doesn't address; why does the story go back in time without moving forward at all? Will this be the case with all future releases or is this the last one? I like continuation in franchises and I didn't get it here, not enough to make me regret missing previous releases."

","I don't have any childhood attachment to Spiderman like most other people do. I was more a Superman person. When the Sam Raimi version of ""Spiderman"" came out, it was a fresh take and felt it was ""what a Superhero movie should be"". It was not all bluster, and Tobey Maguire had an alluring charm. On the other hand, there was always the moment where everyone could tell we were no longer watching live action, and essentially switched over to watching a Spiderman cartoon. It didn't hurt the quality of the film, I knew from Sam Raimi and composer Danny Elfman's soundtrack work that it was in good hands. That was until Spiderman 3 (see my review). <br/><br/>Spiderman 3 did for me what ""Batman & Robin"" did for that franchise. Wisely, the studio put Batman back on the shelf in 1997. The origin story for the Batman franchise was presented in the first film in 1989, SIXTEEN YEARS before the complete reboot and retelling of the origin story in 2005. Here, Sony (watch for Sony product placement in TASM), within just 5 years, is rebooting and is shoving the same familiar origin story last seen just 10 years ago. 16 years is almost a generation between reboots. 10 years for Spiderman is too soon. I have been watching 'modern' superhero movies for the last 12 years (starting with the first ""X-Men""), and there have been some truly great inspirational releases over that time. But there are so many superhero movies out there, and they all have the same clichés now. It is the same generic formula over and over: <br/><br/>1. Innocent Boy 'A' wants to date Innocent Daughter 'B' of Successful Father 'C'. 2. 'A' finds secret power. 3. 'A's father 'D' dies, causing 'A' mental anguish. 4. Scientist 'X' becomes Designated Super Villain 'Y'. 5. 'A' becomes superhero 'Z', both loved and hated. 6. 'Z' Threatens 'B', causes panic in Gothametropolis. 7. 'A' is in mental tug-of-war whether to fight crime or marry 'B'.<br/><br/>And so on.. However in this unnecessary Spiderman reboot, the generic formula is worse<br/><br/>'D' is also 'X' while 'C' hates 'A' and 'B' knows about 'Z'. <br/><br/>I am becoming burned out on the traditional super hero films. No, this reboot is not ""Batman Begins"" just because they put in the Hans Zimmer WWWHHHHOMMMPPP music stings and busy strings in the soundtrack. Maybe they thought this would feel more authentic by adding a lot of old furniture in the movie. They also tried to add authenticity by casting genuine Academy-caliber actors as the aunt (Sally Field) and uncle (Martin Sheen). But as the movie began telling the origin story again, wasting too much time setting up sequel bait, I began to groan almost right away. Andrew Garfield is the new Tobey Maguire, and yes he is a likable boy/man (he looks like a college student going to a high school). His character is not quite the same Peter Parker. Now he is jumpy and has better agility before his transformation. Garfield's charisma wins you over, thankfully, because having to sit through the same story plot points was starting to give me restless leg syndrome. <br/><br/>I have been a veteran movie-goer for over 40 years, and I just can't get into cliché teenage romance stories these days. At least the original Spiderman set Peter in college, and a far more interesting life. Scenes of skateboarding and high school socializing are meant to connect with the young crowd, but they feel clunky and cliché nonetheless. I know this is a big 220 million dollar film, so I was impatient for the movie to get to the big action scenes. The movie finally gets you there, and the effects are clearly better than the original ""Spiderman"" for the most part, but that is to be expected over the course of 10 years. They are well done and are exciting, but are relatively straightforward. The villain for this film is a lizardman, who looks menacing enough, but is not a Super Villain by any stretch of the imagination. Any member of the audience who saw ""The Avengers"" earlier in the summer will get a sense of deja-vu, as the Stark tower appears, almost identical, in this film as the centerpiece of the big final action scene. There is a desperate attempt to incorporate a number of skycranes as part of the big finale that makes no sense whatsoever, and provides very little payoff anyway. <br/><br/>I was waiting over two hours for this? Yet another fight on top of yet another skyscraper? Been there, done that, way too many times. I will still recommend the film for the action scenes and the ability of Garfield to carry the film. But it is not as good as Raimi's interpretation , especially ""Spiderman 2""."

Andrew Garfield brings Peter Parker to life and brings quite a new depth to the character that I didn't even know could be reached. The acting was fantastic and the film, overall, has me falling in love with Spider Man all over again. I have come to realize that the reviews I have read on IMDb from other users must have been written to make the movie look bad because most of the reviews were as far from the truth as possible, and I am a pretty harsh critic, especially with the ""gems"" Hollywood shells out to us today.

","When the spider-man reboot was announced I felt that it was for better only.First part of previous series was very good but than it was all south from there.As in most the cases in sequels,origin is always(mostly) exciting.Isn't it ?<br/><br/>First of all after watching the movie I was very excited,happy,satisfied,may because exciting second half.So, I'll step back and try to review it.To start with the story was not something to write about it was all done and seen before,but the subtle things like romance and parker's struggle were beautifully shown.And same can be said about swinging and jumping over the city,which are by the way high points of the movie.I am not a big fan of 3D as the colors and picture looks dull but those scenes should be seen in 3d.Also lighter moments are funny and bring smiles <br/><br/>Acting is very good.Both the leads have done justice to the characters.Now what i didn't like or say less liked was the transition of peter parker to spider man was sort of rushed up.Its that part makes the First parts so good.Also the CG model of the lizard does not look good.When You see HULK,Na'vi, and then Lizard,it just not up to that.This might be minor thing to most people but not for me as i work in similar industry.<br/><br/>Now as the title suggest,the amazing spider-man is a great superhero movie when you compare with other superhero movies or even with the original trilogy.I am not a big follower of comic book so i can't say anything from the front,but i loved the movie and will highly recommend and to my surprise,in 3D."

Emma stone doesn't seems to be the genuine choice for the movie as she was looking quite aged to be a school girl and yes till the end of the movie ( leaving behind some of the scenes ) she didn't perfected for the image of a glamorous young school going innocent girl with whom ""Peter Parker"" fall in love. Plot of the movie is good and much more scientific as of how spider-man actually got his powers.<br/><br/>The movie actually begins with the clue which is attached to Peter's Father secrets and gradually they are revealed leading to Villainous character of Dr. Curt Connors. spider-man is much more realistic than of Heroic in the movie.

"cooljishi","8","7","15","29 June 2012"," The way it connects with the viewers makes it the BEST SPIDER-MAN MOVIE EVER MADE!
","For a concept that is familiar to everyone, they surely had to do what has not been done previously: Character-buildup. And that's where it scores so well. <br/><br/>The brilliant action sequences, speedy screenplay and intelligent direction makes it look so grand that I can easily tag this as THE BEST SPIDER-MAN MOVIE EVER MADE. <br/><br/>Andrew Garfield doesn't step into Tobey's shoes; he creates his own universe that makes Tobey forgettable. This spidey is swift , looks more intelligent and is equally vulnerable. A lot has been put to make this click, and you will never ever want to compare Tobey with him. Even if someone with you tries to do it, you would shut them off by saying, ""don't bring that up shh! Lemme watch this treat"" . <br/><br/>The high point of this movie was the way it connects to the viewers. The sense of cooperation that is displayed by the citizens of NY City in the end, is what a super-hero movie should be about. They are simply not the onlookers, but when our spidey needed them the most, they contribute their efforts to help him(won't act as a spoiler, so I will shut it here) . The background score makes the final 20 minutes of the movie a superb experience. <br/><br/>One forgivable low point would be the sheer need of keeping some aspects of the plot under shadows: Irrfan is definitely having some secrets as he keeps bossing around our Dr. Curt who is in the Cross Genetic research. I am hoping that he is coming back as the-- decide for yourself! And do sit through the first few minutes of the end credits. <br/><br/>Overall: This movie surely calls for a multiple viewing in theaters, with convincing action and scintillating CGI, The Amazing Spider-man is an amazing form of entertainment!"

The old costume in the other films looked way better than this one, in this one it looks cheep, skinny and weak. From start to finish it was horrible, too long and boring. The worse part was there wasn't enough/ did not deliver enough action. I bet you Tobey McGuire and the whole cast of the original spider-man is somewhere laughing at how this film was so awful. It tried to be like the first film of spider-man but failed. If you asked me, I would tell you to avoid this film and just wait until it comes to DVD. Final rating 1/10. Just bad, lets admit it."
"universaltruth","5","8","18","5 July 2012"," Universal Truth - NO Spoilers!
","In the words of Arthur Fonzarelli (aka The Fonz), ""bull... makes the world go round"". This latest installment of Spidey and the critics' and the public's reaction are all testament to how true that is. Perfect proof that corporations are greedy (why a remake? why now and why so poorly done?), critics are stupid (really Roger Ebert? because the origin story takes up an hour of screen time it is somehow ""better""? you are crazy!) and the public will believe hype and has a very short term memory (really, this one has more humor or the action scenes were better than the first installments? No way in Heck!). This is a entertaining movie...I'll give it that. The origin story has a few nice new pieces to it. The bad guy is somewhat interesting. The actress playing Gwen is outstanding. Yes, all true. But while the Toby McGuire installments may not have been perfect, they had great drama, great buildup of origin story in 1st installment, the depth of the characters and the inner-turmoil they all felt was very real, and they did it while making you feel it was all believable. After watching this at no time did I ever have an emotional attachment to Spidey, I never worried that he wouldn't survive the fight scenes, and poor Sally Field and Martin Sheen just over act themselves out of such a small role. All this is testament to how well done those Toby McGuire movies were (admittedly the 3rd movie was very poor on many levels but it still had humor and depth of characters). This version is more Nickelodeon or MTV after school special. Interesting enough to watch but they scaled down the good stuff to focus on high-school romance and drama and the whole concept suffers. If you find yourself enjoying this, don't be fooled by our society's epidemic of short attention span an lack of memory for important things from the past...go back and revisit Spiderman 1 and 2 and see what a REAL comic book superhero movie could be."
"rachitgarg0208","7","8","18","1 July 2012"," Amazing Spiderman- Not so amazing
","This review contains some spoilers.<br/><br/>The most anticipated movie of summer just behind ""The Dark Knight Rises"" amazes but in patches. Spider-Man is back and this time he is cuter, smarter and meaner. The biggest challenge for the makers was to bring out a movie which was different from the old Spider-man and I guess they failed.<br/><br/>The whole movie you feel you have been here. They start with Peter's parents leaving him to his uncle and aunt and never coming back. The poor kid grows into a very bright student, a boy who loves photography, is good at heart and got some beating by fellow mate. He turns into Spidey enjoys his skills, watches his uncle die because of him, fights a monster to save the city, and then sacrifice his love.<br/><br/>Peter Parker gets clue about his father work and he tries to track his former partner a biochemical scientist, a man who has lost his right arm and from years is trying to find the formula for regeneration of cells.<br/><br/>His encounter was Spider was more dramatic and satisfying. And what transpired was enjoyable. The kid flexes his muscles, enjoys his skate rides, beats people by mistake in train, humiliate his college mate. And he gets the girl.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield is a good successor of Tobey, he does justice to his character and Emma Stone definitely scores bigger than Kirsten. The web Peter casts in the movie to swing and attack is artificial. He made a device and attach to his wrists to get it going. That was on thing in movie I guess that was unexpected, the other one was how easily his identity has been disclosed to his girlfriend Gwen.<br/><br/>The normal routine starts as Peter handles his father's algorithm to his former partner just to watch him turn into a monster. Finally the movie begins.<br/><br/>The last hour of movie gives you everything you came from. Most of it you have seen in trailers though. 3D has made this movie enjoyable in the last half. The Spiderman looks amazing in 3D as he swings from building to building in NYC. And like every time he saves the city from the havoc of monster.<br/><br/>And in the Spiderman tricks they have used his web to great use. He uses his both hands webs and sticks it to something and turns them into Slingshot various times, the fall of Oscorp building in 3D was awesome.<br/><br/>The movie scores big in visual graphics, but scores poor in storyline. The cop father of the girl is a wasted character until he made Spiderman promise not to date his girl. Irfaan khan is not used at all, maybe we can see him in the next installment as we know it will come from the credits at the end. The bad guy is not much intimidating. The whole movie was termed to be Spiderman looking for his parent's clue and he came no close. They have saved it for the next part or who knows for the 3rd part.<br/><br/>Go and enjoy a nice ride in 3D, but you won't come back with any new memories of spider man."

","The Amazing Spiderman Saw this movie this evening and honestly after reading few reviews on IMDb - I went in with no high hopes. But Marc Webb proved me wrong! His last movie '500 Days of Summer' was a classic movie and he played his charm again with The Amazing Spiderman.<br/><br/>The movie followed the storyline of Spiderman Comics closely and had no fillers like Sam Raimi's version. Andrew Garfield portrayed spiderman in a perfect manner and his acting was amazing! Graphics were the BEST in its category and were zillion times better than that of franchise's previous attempts. The story line is more deeper and would reveal a lot more secrets of Peter Parker's life in coming movies.<br/><br/>I hate it when people compare it with Batman - Of course Bruce Wayne is a grown up man with responsibilities while Peter Parker is just a teenage guy with amazing super powers who also deals with responsibilities. So its obvious he will tackle with his teenage problems unlike Batman. But seriously need to stop comparing and enjoy both the movies.<br/><br/>This flick is 8/10 but I'm rating it 10 because many people are hating on this without even seeing it for once.<br/><br/>Must Watch"
"dannymcdandy","9","8","18","28 June 2012"," The Amazing Spider-Man - Truly Amazing
","When I heard there was a reboot of Spider-Man, I sort of rolled my eyes and thought, ""Great, another money-maker."" But after watching The Amazing Spider-Man, I can really see the relevance of it and why it's okay. I will start by saying that this movie was simply fantastic.<br/><br/>Sure, you've got your expected scenes of Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) bitten by a spider, getting powers and all that, but it's how they delve into the character and his backstory that really makes this film shine. <br/><br/>This movie really focuses the attention on Peter's desire to be with his parents, and his curiosity as to why they aren't around. Peter has to deal with so many issues colliding into him at once that it seems a bit overbearing for him.     It's inevitable that people are going to compare The Amazing Spider-man to Sam Raimi's Spider-Man from 2002. I will say that this one is just darker and takes on a much more serious tone. <br/><br/>The acting in this movie is superb. You couldn't have cast a better Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen). He makes his character so real and relatable. Andrew Garfield too was witty and his emotions felt genuine. You could really see the pain in his face when certain events took place. <br/><br/>There are a few things about this movie that are subtle, but really make the movie better than any of the others. I like that throughout the movie, Peter Parker looks like he got the crap beaten out of him when he's finished patrolling or going after bad guys. He has black eyes and bruises almost the entire movie and that makes it a lot more realistic. Also, his costume stays ripped and torn, because, well, he didn't have time to fix it. Go figure!<br/><br/>I also really liked how Parker used his webbing in the story. It's so smart. He wasn't just using them to swing from one place to another, but to actually try to figure out things, like where the lizard was hiding. It's hard to explain without giving away too much, but it was a nice touch.  It was refreshing for Spider-Man to have a different love interest and Emma Stone did very well at portraying Gwen Stacy.<br/><br/>Now, the reason I see the relevance of a reboot is this: In the past Spider-Man movies, there were no smart phones, Facebook, and few people used the Internet like they do today. I read about this in another article and I completely agree. We live in a much different world than we did even 5 years ago. Smartphones didn't even exist when we started Sam Raimi's Spider-Man. It really changes how things are done today and it was nice to see all of this in action.<br/><br/>There's also a very touching scene that really shows that the common man too can be a hero. When you watch the movie, just remember crane operators.    This was a great movie experience and I would recommend it to anyone.<br/><br/>The McDandy Rating: A MUST SEE<br/><br/>For more reviews, visit: http://mcdandyreviews.blogspot.com"

","I'm not sure what everyone else was watching but for me the new Spiderman movie was a painful experience, reminded me of the Superman remake 'Superman Returns'. To start with the acting and script was very poor and the movie was over two hours long. This movie gives you a weak feeble Spiderman whose only real ability is climbing and jumping. The story gives you the beginning of Spiderman, how peter is bitten and changes to the superhero. Only thing is, Andrew Garfield is such a weasel, physically he is not very convincing as Spiderman and this is comparing to Toby Maguire. Andrew Garfield looks like a child dressed in a very poor Spiderman costume. For me this movie single handily killed the Spiderman legend which I grew up with as a child. The villain which is a giant lizard is a joke. Reese Ifan's acting is terrible. My advice is stay away from this one, it's all hype by the critics and the truth will come out in a few weeks. Please please don't make anymore Spiderman movies."

","The other movies are OK. They stick to the original storyline and the acting was fine - it involved quite a few of my favourite actors. But for me, the movies lacked the engagement I had with the comics as a kid when Spiderman was my favourite superhero. Therefore I got bored to the point that I didn't even bother watching the third film. I am pleased to report that for me this is the Spiderman from the comics come to life on the big screen. Andrew Garfield plays the geeky, hopeless, clumsy hero who even though he has amazing powers, is still a nerd at heart. I did prefer Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin but I do love Rhys Ifans who does a great job. The storyline he is attached to is modern and relevant. Martin Sheen is always a pleasure to watch and I shed real tears when he inevitably dies. I had been put off by the last movies but this was much better than I expected. The only thing that puts me off is that Garfield looks so much like tennis player Andy Murray it's weird to see him smile..."

","The Amazing Spiderman – CATCH IT (A-) The anticipation for Spiderman movie was building from the time when Sam Raimi and Tobey MaGuire walked out of the franchise because of their creative differences with Sony. After that Sony decide to make a more Gothic and true to its origin Spiderman after huge critical and box office success of The Dark Night rises. Eventually Marc Jacobs, Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone joint the reboot. The comparison between the original and reboot Spiderman movies is obvious. Marc Webb did try to make Spiderman as dark as he could have done and Andrew Garfield is defiantly is very talented. He did an impressive job as Peter Parker bringing the emotions which we rarely seen in comic book movie heroes even though he lacked the innocence of Tobey MaGuire's Peter Parker. Emma Stone is nice as always even with her blonde locks. Sally Fields, Martin Sheen, Rhys Ifans and Chris Zylka did a fine job. Though I have to say that Indian actor Irfan Khan was completely wasted and we never get to see for whom he was working and even though in deleted DVD scenes we see Lizard killing him in the tunnels but still no answer for the person he was working for. Finally, after watching the Amazing-Spiderman , I think the first Spider-Man movie was better as it had naive peter, cool organic webbing (even-though I understand the logic behind mechanical webbing) it was natural and animalistic or should d I say Insect-listic of him. The Amazing-Spider man was smart, witty and mouthy from start so when he got powers it was like Cherry on the Cake. The first one has better Villain the Green Goblin as it was rooted within the friendship of young Harry none-the-less Lizard was very real and graphics were spot-on but his logic to destroy and make everyone a Lizard was weird. Kirsten Dunst and Emma Stone both played different comic-book characters so comparison is not fair and since both Peter's had good chemistry with their girls. And now let's talk about ending there is no doubt Spider-Man's ending was Great from accidentally Green Goblin and leaving him his home and Harry walking in on him to saving Mary Jane and Kids at the same time to leaving Mary Jane for ever at funeral and from Mary Jane finding out he is spider-man with the Kiss. Everything was in big Spectacular way. So I did love The Amazing Spider-Man but the winner is Spider-Man Indeed!"

","**Spoilers contained**<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man (2012)<br/><br/>Starring: Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone and Rhys Ifans<br/><br/>Synopsis: High school outcast Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) desperately trying to find out the secrets to his parents disappearance from when he was a young boy. After finding his dad's briefcase and searching for his father's former partner Dr Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) at Oscorp. Secrets will be revealed which will ultimately shape Peter's destiny to become Spider-Man. <br/><br/>Review: Marc Webb directs the reboot of the Spider-Man story in which Andrew Garfield brings to the screen a more realistic Peter Parker than what we have seen before. I once heard that the reboot will be more in keeping to the comics and the cartoons of the 1990's and 2000's Spider- Man, I believe that was succeeded as we now get a real world application for Spider-Man rather than the comic book movies of the Sam Raimi trilogy. We see Peter struggle with situation's, with people and in dealing with his new found super-powers, Andrew brings a character that I believe will age better than the previous movies, which already seem like they're a decade old. One problem I had was why he feels the need to keep taking off the mask; a fun drinking game would be a shot every time he does. <br/><br/>Emma Stone brings the love interest to the screen as Gwen Stacey, daughter of the police chief, intellectually gifted student and intern at Oscorp. Rhys Ifans playing Dr Curt Connors, biologist who's working on gene splicing to create a better human race, accidentally turning himself into a giant Lizard that sets out to turn the whole of New York and then the world into humanoid Lizards. During the movie a problem kept occurring with the Lizard, he is a villain with a diabolical plan however and in the comics Curt is a family man who's lost inside the Lizard, I don't feel the movie portrays the Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde side of the character clearly. <br/><br/>With more grounding to this movie, making it feel like the beginning of a trilogy where we'll see a more confident Spider-Man and a lot more truths about what happened to his parents still to come. During the origins of Spider-Man I've seen a lot of complaints online about there being no wrestling sequence and believe it was done well originally and the valiantly side of Peter trying to track down is uncle's killer was a lot more believable of a teenager with an attitude and new found super- human strength. This is Spider-Man to how I know him, Tobey Maguire made a family fun comic-book movie and Andrew Garfield's is more Super-hero movie making the differences, easier to relate to characters and a lot darker than before.<br/><br/>Watch this if you liked: Spider-Man Trilogy, (500) Days of Summer, Batman Begins <br/><br/>Verdict: With a little less of the love story, we'd have had Amazing Spider-Man, we got a very good start to Spider-Man film, looking forward to how the sequels, where hopefully we'll see the Amazing Spider-Man."

","I think that this movie is very well done, well scripted and well played by the actors. <br/><br/>Many say that this movie is much worse then the other spider-man movies but i honestly this this one is better. The other spider-man movies are good, but i still missed the spider-man that i read in comic books when i was younger, the fun side of spider-man. <br/><br/>The spider-man that i like is the sarcastic one, that is joking around, and i found that in this movie more then i did in the others. Sure, the other movies had their moments but i think spider-man was played much more to my liking in this movie.<br/><br/>Brilliant movie, i have already watched it a couple of times and i love it."

","some great acting and Garfield nails the Ditko posing of the original comics, don't have a problem with him being too skinny either. Scenes in the sewers nicely echoed the original comic version of this movie, the Lizard is a formidable foe. HOWEVER the back story sucks. Now Flash becomes a misguided good guy, Gwen Stacy is a science nerd, there is no JJ Jameson instead we have the insipid police character. Parker can't wait to show off who he is to all and sundry, and plot rip offs from the Rami movie abound. And for crying out loud Stan Lee can't get enough of himself even now, someone shoot the guy please, with a gun. Most of the Spidey stuff was fine but all other factors in Peter Parkers life were trashed. Surely this rewriting of the characters life/plot is a DC move. There are other reviews of this that I agree with but as to the massive plot holes thru out this film the biggest must be the end where the 'cure' is dispersed over the city and yet has no affect on SPIDERMAN, double duh. The Rami movie is far better and truer to the original comics, Garfield need to step away from this project before it taints his very promising career."

"TheSloppy","4","5","10","22 July 2012"," Not so 'Amazing' Spider-Man
","In this 'Amazing Spider-Man'there the hype is not as much as it should be to watch this movie. I personally enjoyed it, but it clearly let a lot of people down. Comparing this movie back to the original and the other 2 spider-mans it does not compare at all. In this spider-man everything is so rushed for a quiet long film. Peter Parker is not as nerdy playing character as he should be compared to the other Spider- Man, his played smart but more as a good-looking person which does not really suit the role as much. <br/><br/>In all honesty, the movie did get a little exciting but some part were just so boring. I liked the villain Doctor Lizard and he had a good role in the 'Amazing Spider-Man'. <br/><br/>The outfit of Spider-Man is super cool, and the graphics is obviously better then the original. But the concern that the original is 10 years older then this one and the other had more excitement to it is frustrating.<br/><br/>*spoiler alert* <br/><br/>The way that Peter Parker tells his girlfriend 'Gwen' that he is spider- man is very frustrating and extremely rushed and no twist was given in the movie. I know that it should be a big thrill when Spider-Man tells his girlfriend that his spider-man, but there isn't. The way the the villain finds out that he is spider-man as well is very annoying a baby could of done that.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is yet my least favorite of the Spider-Man movies and it is not so amazing, I rather recommend it to children more then adults. I give this a 4."

"nickmesafilms","6","5","10","17 July 2012"," The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) - The Untold Story!
","Directed by Marc Webb, and released to immediate box office success, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a reboot of the original Spider-Man trilogy from director Sam Raimi, that's also the first in a new and re-imagined version of the series! I have been looking forward to check out this movie ever since the news came out. But even though I was entertained by the majority of it all, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is my first big disappointment of the year, but it sure is a guilty pleasure. This movie follows the exact story about a boy in high school, Peter Parker, whose been abandoned by his parents, lives with his aunt and uncle, and can't fit in with his surroundings. Until he gets bit by a radioactive spider, gets impossible powers, something tragic happens in his life, and now becomes Spider-Man. It's the basic idea, yet retold in quite an unnecessary way. That's just my main problem with this movie, now that I've seen this film, it's finally clear to me that a reboot of the Amazing Spider-Man just wasn't a bright idea. I know that some reboots like to change some material, to not make it too similar to the original story. But this movie definitely takes the cake, making major changes to a story that doesn't need to be re-told. Also, this movie totally falls into a mother-load of plot holes. The movie tries to focus on Peter trying to find out what happened to his parents, and live through the tragedy involving his uncle, but the movie quickly takes that away, and instead focuses on Spider-Man saving the city from the Lizard. This movie had no clue which way it wanted to follow! But, did I mention that it was kind of long, and at the same time, kind of slow? Yeah, that's what I thought! But, good news, there were a few positives that helped save this movie. The casting is completely brilliant, all delivering such wonderful and memorable performances. Andrew Garfield really saves this movie, recreating the role of Peter Parker a.k.a. Spider-Man. If it wasn't for his performance, this movie would have fallen to the ground. In every scene, he delivers a great charm to the performance, and makes the audience support him throughout. Emma Stone is also great playing Parker's love-life Gwen Stacy, whom also shares a believable and glowing chemistry between her and Garfield. I bought the romance in this movie, and these two guys were cute together. Although not really interesting as the Lizard, Rhys Ifans still delivers a great performance as Dr. Curtis Connors. Denis Leary plays Capt. George Stacy, Gwen's cop father hunting down the masked hero, and Uncle Ben & Aunt May are portrayed masterfully by Martin Sheen and Sally Field, respectively. The effects are astounding, the music is haunting, and the action scenes just help save this movie by delivering what I came for, fun popcorn entertainment. But overall, there's nothing really special about this movie. Some scenes kind of feel misplaced, there are tons of giant plot holes, and changing this story wasn't that smart. Nothing is terrible about this movie, because I still came to this movie and got what I wanted. I just wish that this movie could have been a lot better, and I was really expecting more from this giant motion picture. Not a terrible film overall, but ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a fun spectacle, but it's barely quite not the right choice to be rebooted. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"", in my review, ""exciting fun, but sadly unnecessary""."
"occupantroom6277","6","5","10","11 July 2012"," Spider-man? Yes. Amazing? Not so much.
","I feel like I'm being a little harsh, giving this movie a mere 6/10. If I could do such a thing, I'd actually give it more like a... 6.4. <br/><br/>I saw a 3D viewing of this film (my first ever 3D!) with a friend of mine who is more of a respective Spidey geek than I am. My apologies, I'm more of a Batman kind of gal. It doesn't surprise me that she gushed praises for this movie as we left the theater. I half-heartedly concurred, though I felt somewhat unsatisfied. <br/><br/>I'll begin with saying that Andrew Garfield was an excellent choice for Peter Parker/Spider-man. The role of Peter did his talents and nerdy demeanor justice. I wasn't very surprised; Andrew Garfield had already impressed me with his performance in The Social Network. I was expecting this kind of contentment with his Peter Parker. This character version of Spider-man, however, fell a little short for me. Garfield's physique is much more true to everyone's vision of Spider-man than that of Tobey Maguire. But, yeah, that's basically it. I found myself liking Maguire's Spider-man more. I feel like Spider-man is a friendly figure, thus ""Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-man"". (That line, unfortunately never made an appearance in this movie. Sad face.) This vision of this Spider-man is a little too dark and far too two-dimensional to flatter Andrew Garfield's skills as an actor. <br/><br/>For me, personally, the villain makes the movie, especially in the ""Comic Book Adaptations"" genre. The Lizard was an unfortunate failure. Also, the significant lack of confrontation between The Lizard and Spider-man was stressful. I don't know... I guess I can only say that, despite best efforts, The Lizard was a flat character. Nothing he did surprised me. I wasn't scared of him. And although this menacing creature was the spawn of a brilliant scientist, The Lizard didn't come across as a particularly smart villain. However, I thought it was very clever Dr. Connors became The Lizard because of his missing arm. <br/><br/>I'd also like to file a complaint about Emma Stone. Why was she even there? Her character in it of itself wasn't very prominent (save for the cliché ""love story"" aspect of the movie) and she did NOTHING to heighten Gwen Stacy's role in the plot. I feel like you could've used any actress to replace Stone and it would've meant nothing. <br/><br/>And it all comes down to this: the plot. The story. The meat of the movie. And if I had to choose one adjective to describe the plot of this movie: meh. If I could choose a second word, it would probably be: typical. <br/><br/>I mean, honestly. <br/><br/>I appreciated all of the modern twists about the creation of Spider-man. Cross species genetics! Whoa! This movie has a scientific one-up over the 2002 version. The acrobatics of the fight scenes were spectacular! This Spider-man is a very graceful fighter, and I enjoyed that. <br/><br/>But everything else fell short! A lot of the scenes felt rushed. Too rushed. The kind of rushed that left us hanging with a desire for a little more. Some scenes felt flat-out unfinished. And most of these scenes were important emotional scenes. The whole mystery about Peter's parents never really came to fruition. And the relationship Peter shared with the The Lizard, that he ""created him"", was vague and cheesy. Too often, I found myself whispering ""of course"" when we discovered something critical or a major plot element unfolded. Not to mention, The Lizard's entire ultimatum (releasing mutant-lizard creating gas over the city) felt like a huge knockoff on Batman Begins. I have a problem with that, mostly because, in the theater, I felt like I'd already seen the movie. What a waste of 11 bucks. <br/><br/>What I really enjoyed about the 2002 Spider-man was that the entire movie had a heavy comic-book feel to it. It was fun, stylish, with its own scruffy charm. This version was much sleeker, more modern, and much darker. Not that it was lacking style at all, but this is not what I expect from a SPIDER-MAN movie. Spider-man, to me, should not be the city's personal freak-vigilante/heretic. That's just wrong. Not only did the characters perceive Spider-man that way (especially the cops), but they were right! This Spider-man didn't seem to be saving the people to me. Each time a cop or another character said something slanderous about Spider-man, I didn't cringe with wrongfulness of the statement. I didn't feel justified in defending Spider-man. I did back in 2002. <br/><br/>I honestly expected a lot more out of this reboot. I gave it a 6 because, well, it was entertaining enough and a little better than average. There was nothing new or fresh about it, nothing mind-blowing or terribly exciting. By all means, see it for yourself. I may or may not watch it again."
"minamizaki","9","5","10","8 July 2012"," A great beginning to the untold story
","Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker is excellent, he's funny, smart ass and still has a bit of teenage angst. He handled the more emotional scenes very well. <br/><br/>Uncle Ben's death was handled so much better in this series, the moral was too spoon-fed in the last series.<br/><br/>The fighting is very good too, less swinging around between skyscrapers and more close combat. <br/><br/>the movie takes its time to tell the story, some may find there's too little action before the final showdown. But there're lots of comic moments in between and they're good!:)<br/><br/>the villain isn't very interesting, but this isn't batman, the villain doesn't have much a character development arc, so no surprise."
"RainDogJr","10","5","10","7 July 2012"," This year's ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes""; I mean, what a great reboot!
","There's a moment in THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN that is basically the quintessential romantic one involving a superhero: Spidey is about to take his girlfriend (Gwen Stacy) out for a little ride, to show her how New York City looks from the sky. I guess you know what I mean. And when the moment came I thought something like this: if director Marc Webb (who's only other film is the hit 500 DAYS OF SUMMER, which I have yet to watch) wants to take a few minutes for a sort of clichéd romantic scene, well, that's just fine with me since until this point he has given me nothing but a great piece of entertainment. Eventually we don't even get to see pretty much nothing of that romantic kind of scene! So basically I was ready to criticize the film and at the same time forgive its flaws, but in the end that was just unnecessary. Yes, there's really nothing to complaint about this movie; (for instance) I did feel its last act could have been bigger and more exciting but then again, I'm here to forgive the minor flaws. <br/><br/>It's actually a very similar case to what we had last year with RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES – a very fine and fun reboot -visually great, with fresh ideas- that keeps you with a big smile (and that leaves you too with it since you just know really nice things will come in the future). <br/><br/>During this past week I got to see a newspaper article of THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN with the title ""The Unnecessary Spider-Man"". And yesterday when my girlfriend and I were about to watch the film, she asked me that if it was going to show the Spider-Man story from its very beginning again (and she ended loving it, by the way). Judging from yesterday's attendance at the cinema I went (it was a 6 p.m. showing in the opening day, to be exact), many people don't want to rush in order to see the ""same ol' story"" that a decade ago hit the big screen; yes, the attendance was quite low and boy did people missed a whole lot of fun and, of course, the great Lizard! <br/><br/>To finish, I'll write some few more thoughts that do nothing other than recommend you checking ""Amazing Spider-Man"" as soon as possible <br/><br/>1) You MUST go for the 3D version of it. And yes, I know that pretty much every film has offered a very disappointing use of this format so that's why I'm so glad to report that this looks simply amazing - I think the only other recent time I loved the 3D thing was in THE ADVENTURES OF TINTIN. <br/><br/>2) Arguably a perfect example of a film with forgettable 3D material is THE AVENGERS. And ""Amazing Spider-Man"" is MUCH BETTER than that other big Marvel movie of the year! <br/><br/>3) The first time we get to see Spider-Man, with the actual mask and everything, doing some work has to be one of my favorite scenes in any superhero movie. His attitude is fantastically fun; Andrew Garfield fits the role perfectly, I must say. <br/><br/>4) Not my opinion but a fact: this has the best Stan Lee cameo ever; what a piece of scene actually, fun and imaginative (and a bit violent too!).<br/><br/>*Watched it on 06 July, 2012"
"pokethecactus","10","5","10","7 July 2012"," Amazing!
","Prepare to be amazed? Well I certainly was! This was an awesome re-boot of the movie franchise and I was very impressed. I have been a Spider-Fan for years now, and was highly anticipating Spidey's new release. Andrew Garfield does a better job than Tobey Maguire, simply because Garfield looks more like Peter does in the original comics, it was also lovely to see Gwen Stacey introduced in the beginning, like she should have been in the 'Tobey' Trilogy. Beautiful plot line, nice level of sarcastic humor, brilliant CG and stunts, awesome costume re-design, hilarious cameo by Stan Lee, simply amazing! I loved the film! Well done Marvel! <3"
"Jimmy-Durkin","3","5","10","6 July 2012"," Incredibly boring and cringe worthy
","There are MANY times in the film I had my head in my hands, I couldn't bear to watch certain scenes of the film due to immense cheesiness. Whenever spider-man would of been swinging through the city or attacking the Lizard he would shout horrible cheesy things like 'INCOMING!!' & 'I'm starting to enjoy this!!'. Sure if you're a kid watching this it wouldn't bother you but as a film fan I could help but cringe. Another time I couldn't bear to watch was when Spider-Man was clinging onto the Lizards tail, as he was getting struck against the wall, left to right to left to right. He would say as he impacted the walls 'don't....make....me...hurt you!!'. I'm sorry but stuff like that just makes my skin crawl. The entire crane scene I found to be utterly ridiculous. Why oh why would all the crane drivers not only be on the same street, but all risk their lives during an evacuation to move their cranes into a position with no idea why they are doing so. <br/><br/>Another problem I found out to be would be when Gwen Stacy's father was on his death bed, he made Peter promise to leave Gwen alone. He keeps his promise for a while (and it's a miracle he did, how could you turn down Emma Stone!?!?) but after completely shunning her on his porch and blanking her in the school corridor. He has a complete change on heart, for no apparent reason. I know it's not a MAJOR flaw and every film can be nit picked at but c'mon Pete.<br/><br/>Other than the above mentioned cringe worthy moments I found the film to be a little boring. I can't remember any more than 2 serious action scenes in the film. <br/><br/>I don't think it was a good idea to let the lizard speak either, just seemed a little stupid really.<br/><br/>Okay, I've blasted the film so now it's time for the pro's (pro). The acting from Garfield and Stone was strong. Although I liked Toby Maguire I thought Andrew Garfield was a very good choice. Emma is good as well but can't help but feel she's better in a less serious role.<br/><br/>Overall I felt the film just to be dulcid, I couldn't bring myself to ever watch it again and come on let's be serious, there is no way at all this film deserves a 10/10 from anyone."
"garethok","2","5","10","6 July 2012"," A film made by someone who might have 'heard' of spiderman...
","OK, now this is a 'reboot' that hasn't had the same success as the Hulk reboot (different companies I know). I lacks any kind of 'vim' or 'vigour' and is annoyingly heavy on the teen angst seen in recent movies. There are none of the witty Parker jokes, insults or sarcasm. In fact There is nothing of Peter Parker in the character portrayed in this film. The casting choices were awful, Aunt May was all wrong, Uncle Ben was (lets face it) a bit doddery and poor on the advice. Rhys Iffans was wasted, truly wasted in this pieced - and the Voldemort 'I've got your nose' Lizard was visually hilarious - not scary.<br/><br/>I saw the film about 10 minutes ago, in 3D (Why in3D I don't know there was virtually NO 3D in it at all). I'm completely underwhelmed, he swings wrong, he talks wrong, he's also pretty poor in a fight really.<br/><br/>Overall (oddly) the only thing I liked in the entire film was Gwen - the role was played very well, good acting and characterisation. <br/><br/>So less spider man - and more 'Static' if you've ever heard of the character. It's not as 'good' as the Toby Maguire version (and thats not fantastic). I hope it improves in the next one, and that Osbournes Green Goblin is well played.... I don't hold out much hope.<br/><br/>If this film does well, then I know it will have hit its target audience - teenagers. Its true, Spiderman is the only superhero you have to leave behind - he's like peter pan, and never grows up. Only in this case - he thrives on films like Twilight."
"amahlanand","6","5","10","6 July 2012"," Spider Man for Teens
","While Tobey Maguire was your 'friendly, neighbourhood Spider-Man', Andrew Garfield is more like your 'hip, juvenile, generation Y' Spider-Man. The kind of superhero unafraid of calling on his mobile phone in a busy New York street corner and the kind of superhero who lies on a self-made web playing video games whilst waiting for his foes to appear. Despite this slightly novel approach, 'The Amazing Spider Man' is just a rehash of Sam Raimi's original 'Spider Man', much of the plot is either similar, identical or along the same lines with a tweak here and there making more than half the film somewhat of an unnecessary recap of sorts. <br/><br/>It was certainly pleasing to have a script addressing the reasoning behind a burning question, why does Peter Parker live with his aunt and uncle? But even this combined with Peter Parker/Spider Man's other traumas in the film don't give us a good enough definition of Spider-Man as a symbol, the motivation behind Peter Parker's graduation from angry vengeance to selfless nobility. <br/><br/>One noteworthy change was the magnificent camera work which puts you up close and personal with Spider-Man through the first-person shots and dynamic angles employed. At times, it felt like a virtual rollarcoaster ride but it was definitely the closest most people will get to knowing what it's like to be the famous web-slinger. <br/><br/>Garfield knew his deal portraying Peter Parker as more of a typical 21st century confused, directionless adolescent but one who seems to be more noticed than what you would expect. He may not have been the less appealing, geeky Peter Parker as earlier personified by Tobey Maguire but where Maguire trumps Garfield was in turning a genuine nobody into somebody whilst maintaining that anonymity. <br/><br/>Garfield's Parker was already garnering the affections of a pretty girl and was operating far from what you would call incognito, a guy quite willing to divulge his secret to a perfect stranger. The contrast between the person and his alter ego defines a superhero and Garfield couldn't really highlight that contrast as effectively. You could connect with him, but unlike his 'The Social Network' performance, he lacked even a slight bit of maturity. The script further failed to deal with social implications transforming him into a public icon. Ultimately, a superhero is naught without public opinion and interest. <br/><br/>Emma Stone fortunately wasn't the constant damsel in distress like Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane but Gwen Stacy's relationship with Peter Parker furthered the sentiment that the film seemed to become too teen conducive. Not that the teen appeal is a completely bad thing, but the lack of maturity in the characters can occasionally be weak in conviction. <br/><br/>I must express my disappointment in the villainous Lizard however as a character which could not invoke as much terror on screen as its terrific design could to viewers. Rhys Ifans was curiously very similar in his character progression as Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin in Raimi's 'Spider Man'. Although Curt Connors was well played, he made you feel as if you'd seen it all before. <br/><br/>Although I still enjoyed it, I think the enjoyment stemmed more from my unwavering appreciation of the comic book character. Nonetheless, with this relatively immature yet respectably enjoyable origin story done and dusted, I anticipate a more complete sequel which can surpass this. More originality may well be a dominant reason."

","Why the heck they had reinvented the story (like how Parker became Spidey, how uncle Ben died). First one hour of the movie was a rerun of incidents already shown in 1-3 series. The story is full of loose ends (who owns the Oscorp manufacturing company, what happens to the Indian guy, was waiting till the end to know what happened to Parker's parents and still no clue). The effects were also better in the first three series. Liked only two things about the movie - Andrew & Emma's pairing and the very last flight of Spidey. It was definitely an emotion-packed (and repeats-packed) movie but I guess I was expecting a super fast superhero stuff. Where the world is moving on to 4G, this movie was speeding in 1G itself."

I tried to swing from a pole and climb a wall after seeing this movie. That's how much I liked it. <br/><br/>The only concern of many reviewers is that it has been made before and we are made to sit through the similar scenes in this movie too. For them, I tell you this. The first movie was made 10 years and I believe that's enough time to give a remake. This move has as much heart as the first movie had and I love the action scenes in this one.<br/><br/>You have to love Garfield's acting and Emma Stone's cuteness. They look very cute together. The spider suite fit him very well too. Overall, I am waiting for The Amazing Spider-man 2!"

","this is how a spider man movie should be made. :) much better then the old ones. this had more story, (and they didn't see it as 1 film, but that the story goes on) and better effects, and better actors and actresses. wonderful chemistry between them. and they made spider man closer to how he is in the comics. he has HUMOR :D I was sad that in the old 3 movies everyone was funny but spider man. and that seemed wrong. don't get me wrong. the old ones were good. the third one needed to be 2 movies or take away venom, to make it work. but good Idea, to bad they failed in it. <br/><br/>this movie was epic, and they didn't rush him to be spider man and do everything right. first time he had no idea how he did what he did. and the first 3 times or so that he climbed a wall he seemed surprised. :p and he made his own web shooters. 2 small things that was a lite sad that they missed (witch might have been a deleted scene or just that they missed it and will do it in the sequel) but he didn't make his own web, and he never reloaded, of course he never used his web long enough so he had to reload is a possibility, but still. the web shooters did a lot for the movie. in the final battle when lizard broke them, you could feel that if he fell of the building or was thrown off, he would fall to his death. made it more exciting. and the dramatic moments where PERFECT. you could really feel the pain and sadness. <br/><br/>oh and the suit actually looked home made :p like it should. sure I was a little skeptic on the look of the suit, but, unlike the old suit, this looked like it could have been made by a 17 or 18 year old kid. not like it was bought, witch the one in the old movies looked like. and he ALWAYS lost his mask, in this they were more discrete. except for 1 scene in the school. but my friend who saw it with me didn't mind. and lizard was cool :p even though I thought that I wouldn't like the flat face take on him. even though he was like that in the first comics with lizard. and I know a lot of the lizard was at LEAST partly cgi. but both me and my friend felt that sometimes it looked like a guy in make up. like one scene with his leg and the close ups of his upper body. when he was not fighting. just a thought. <br/><br/>and to the skeptics I only say. go see it. give it an honest chance. I did that to batman, sure I thought batman was terrible. but I gave it an honest chance and thought that it would be better then it turned out to be. <br/><br/>so maybe you will like spider man, maybe you won't. I tried while being skeptic and loved it. so who knows :p <br/><br/>at the very least it was good acting and story. (even if, like some people I have talked to, didn't like the lizard and such, but they still thought it was a good movie)<br/><br/>//alex"
"mynameisrobbanks","10","6","13","6 August 2012"," The Amazing Spider-Man lives up to it's name.
","So, it's been 10 years since the first Spider-Man film directed by Sam Raimi, a very good trilogy but it could've been much better. I wanted a perfect Spider-Man. Well, I don't have to look any further. The funny named director Marc ""Webb"" (wonder how long it took to find him..) brings me the on-screen live action Spider-Man I always wanted. The plot follows Peter Parker, a 17 year old who has a terrible life, he gets bullied every day at school, and his parents left him with his Aunt and Uncle at the young age of 4. While finding a clue to his parents disappearance, he finds a picture of his father next to a man named Dr. Connors, a one armed scientist. Peter then goes to Oscorp to find him and in the meantime he gets bitten by a radioactive Spider that gives him Spider powers. After he is responsible for the killing of his Uncle, he avengers him and dawns a new Spider suit and becomes Spider-Man, while fighting Dr. Connors who has turned into a giant Lizard, and running from a cop who happens to be his girlfriend Gwen's father. So let's jump into the subjects. Acting The Acting is perfect. Andrew Garfield is the best Spidey yet, showing off the reliatable, smart, funny Peter Parker. Emma Stone is sexy and lovable as Gwen being a smart, funny character. Rhys Ifans also delivers a great performance as The Lizard along with Dennis Leary as Captain Stacy. Sally Fields is a great Aunt May. And Martin Sheen is also spot on as Uncle Ben. He looks just like him. Acting: 5/5 Now for the Imagery. The Imagery & sets are very realistic and fit the mood Imagery: 5/5 now for the music. The music is great for the most part, but dozen't always fit and not as good as Danny Elfman's score. Music: 4/5 Overall Verdict: The first three? Not Spider-Man. This Movie? If you look up Spider-Man in the dictionary, the poster of this film should be next to the defining. Andrew Garfield is the perfect Spider-Man. Emma Stone is sexy and lovable as Gwen, it did everything you want a comic book movie to be. They did a great job making it different from the original movies. One last thing. Sam Raimi, watch this movie and get a notepad. My new favorite comic book film."

","I saw this on the first day (July 3rd) and was really surprised. I thought it would be hard to top the other first three Spider-Man films. I also thought Spiderman's new look was better. Andrew Garfield was actually really good. I didn't expect his performance to be that good. The movie was also very funny at some points. It was a little more realistic than the others because he didn't actually have web shooting from his arms. He had little devices that he strapped to his arms that shot web. The Lizard looked very realistic. I read that the actor for Dr. Curt Conners/Lizard had to wear a piece of cardboard over his face. I don't how they made it so real, though. Anyway, I really enjoyed this more than I thought I would, and I can't wait for the Blu-ray release! AWESOME FILM"
"rachou_1994","5","6","13","7 July 2012"," The worst yet
","I was so exited for this new spiderman, but i was really disappointed with 3 things. <br/><br/>The special effects were not bad, but not great. The effects don't compare to the ones in Harry Potter or transformers. <br/><br/>The story wasn't convincing and seemed like a joke sometimes. At one point, i felt like i was watching a Step Up movie! Its like i just watched more of a chick flick than a spiderman movie...<br/><br/>I felt like they were a lot of awkward moments in the film. Sometimes because the acting was bad, because the story was bad or because it was too cheesy. They said a LOT of cheesy things because hitting someone or before saving a life and i personally hate that.<br/><br/>Sorry for my bad English, i'm french"

","Firstly I have to say I just got back from seeing The Amazing Spider-Man<br/><br/>I'm happy to report I really did enjoy the film and totally give full credit to Andrew Garfield for his performance as Peter Parker/Spider- man.<br/><br/>I was worried when I saw the first trailer, I thought it would be ruined and a waste of a film, but I'm glad to be wrong.<br/><br/>My only issue is I would have thought Spider-man would have natural swinging ability (Instead of custom built ones)<br/><br/>Overall I thought it was very very good, perhaps not everyone's idea for an Amazing Spider-Man movie but its realistic (to a point) the effects work well, the fight scenes are not over or under done and the cast and their performances were excellent <br/><br/>Hope they all reunite for another Spidey and keep the franchise alive"
"rjbreslin","9","6","13","3 July 2012"," An adults return to his childhood.
","The Amazing Spider-man I had the pleasure of seeing this almost a month prior to its official release and I recall loving it but I felt the score was lacking. After reading some of the critics reviews I began to wonder if I rated this too highly and whether I was seeing this movie through rose tinted glasses. So I went again today for its first day of official release and settled in to a sold out screening which was impressive as the cinema was showing both 2D (my choice) and 3D at once.<br/><br/>I was correct in my initial assessment. I love this movie. It transported me back to when I was seven and my introduction to The Amazing Spider-man. When Raimi brought Spider-man to the big screen I was so relieved and excited to eventually see my hero once and for all. Superman fans had had their superhero transported to the big screen almost 20 years previous, Batman 13 years previous. Would I ever get to see him? CGI was only really taking off in the early noughties. It was a revelation to see him. But although I loved Raimi's movie it did not touch me in the same way this movie has. Spider-man 2 was superior to Raimi's first outing and I rank it in my top three comic book adaptations. But again it simply did not have the emotional impact Webb's rendition of the character has.<br/><br/>He has explored the human relationship and condition beyond any previous comic-book movie has dared to explore. There are some seriously tender moments in the movie, yet in many ways those moments have been let down by a lackluster score.<br/><br/>Some people will rightly question the rebooting of a franchise so soon after Spider-man 3. Yet if Raimi had dealt with the tragic story arc of Gwen Stacy we would not have had this reboot. The Gwen Stacy arc is critical in the formation of the character of Peter Parker and Spider-man. This movie has laid the foundation for that arc. I will bet there won't be a dry eye in the house when this epic story is concluded.<br/><br/>Thank you Marc Webb for reminding me why I love Spider-man."
"asimpletruth1","10","6","13","3 July 2012"," Better than the Avengers (in my opinion)! Exceeded my expectations!
","Honestly, spiderman is not one of my favorite superheroes, but after seeing this movie, I really hope they make a sequel soon. From the previews, I felt like this spiderman movie would be the best yet, and it certainly was! It exceeded my expectations! The casting was spot on. The casting choices for female roles in these superhero movies have been very disappointing to me, but I felt like Emma Stone was a great choice --- a breath of fresh air. Andrew Garfield really made Peter Parker shine! I've never heard of this guy until I saw this movie. He was a brilliant choice. I felt like I could really connect with the character and Andrew gave the character a lot of depth. This movie is worth watching many times over, and I'm definitely putting it on my list of favorite superhero movies. I only hope the new Batman movie can live up to this movie, and I've been a Batman fan since I was probably 6 or 7 years old. The Amazing Spiderman tops all of the movies made with Tobey Maguire. Sorry Tobey! Marvel's making better choices in my opinion. The Hulk in the Avengers was the best so far, and Andrew Garfield in the Amazing Spiderman, is the best spiderman. I recommend this movie for the whole family."
"andyvashi","10","7","16","26 October 2012"," Amazing
","This movie is one of the best superhero reboots of all time. The director nailed it in terms of emotional depth, entertainment, humor and action. Some people expect unrealistic things, and they should know that this is the 1st movie in a new trilogy, and should not be compared to the Sam Raimi films. They were good no doubt, but this movie was even BETTER. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, the tone, the pace, the lighting, cgi, action, and character development was specially taken care of. If you loved Toby Maguire as Spiderman, you'll find Andrew Garfield to be even better. Emma Stone is also wonderful as Gwen Stacy, and MUCH better than Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane. Check this movie out with an open mind, and you'll for sure come out amazed. The most 'amazing' part of the movie, is that the human touch was added to the characters, and you could actually be believe that a Spiderman like that could exist in our world. Truly awesome movie, and cant wait for the sequel!"
"lancelong777","3","7","16","7 July 2012"," You have to be kidding me
","Explain to me why my favorite actress was placed in this movie and then allowed herself to act like a fifty year old woman? Shame on the director for picking that actor to play spiderman as he was just an irritating waste of visual disturbance. The movie was slow, didn't develop any new plot lines and for the most part, was the exact same movie as the first spiderman with some of the names changed. It is time to pull the plug on this franchise as I will not waste another moment or a dime of my money watching a hack play spiderman and watching a great actress like Emma, play a hack. By the way, my 8 year old son could have directed this movie as well if not better than it was directed. The story lacked belief, which is really sad since we all suspend our disbelief to watch this crap."

The feel-good mush of the last three films is gone, and the action is duly sexed up to suit 3D basics. It's a dynamic new way to see Spidey on screen, and as he gets better -- both at his job and at realizing just what his job is -- this new Spider-Man soars.

A girlfriend can help, not only screaming, whining and waiting for a hero boyfriend to save. In this movie, Gwen helps him a lot. It also shows us that hero is not perfect and being amazing in very first time when they get their power, they still need to learn to be amazing. <br/><br/>I also love how the character, personality of Peter improves time by time. <br/><br/>The most special thing I love in this movie is evil character (the Dr.Connors) still have a good side of human in his personality. It shows people always have good and bad side in their own heart, as long as you know how to control it.<br/><br/>This movie still has some fun parts to make watchers are relaxing, not too stressful.<br/><br/>A movie always has many different reviews, love or not love it is depended on your thinking but for me, it's totally a great movie.

After that he realizing his amazing power to swing through the street with his spider web. Those scenes are perfectly made us so exciting with the cool 3D effects. Then the most lovable moments between Our heroine Gwen Stacy and Our Hero Peter Parker.<br/><br/>The street stunt scenes are pictured in 3D effects and we get statue-d with our breath until spider-man lands on a safe position.

"Meven_Stoffat","4","7","16","28 June 2012"," I'm speechless...
","I'll admit I was a tad skeptical about the movie. Not in a bad way, but I was unsure if the series really needed a reboot. Sure the third movie sucked, but to have seen a follow-up to it would have been a good idea. However, after seeing an advance screening of this movie in IMAX 3D tonight, I Rescind all my doubts.<br/><br/>No, really. This movie is spectacular. Everything about it was just... Awesome. In fact, if anything, the Raimi movies don't really interest me anymore, no matter how much I loved SM2. I know that's a bold statement to make, but seriously, this film fixes everything wrong with the Raimi movies, and is definitely more than just an apology for Spider Man 3.<br/><br/>For one, it all starts with the tone. From the opening scene where Peter gets ready for a game of Hide and Seek, there's shades of Nolan's Batman movies in it. Throughout the movie there is an air of neo-noir, in a similar fashion to ""Drive""- even the score hints to a bit of a film noir feel. It suits the film because if anything this is an origin story before a superhero movie. The dark and gritty tone still stays consistent throughout, even in the action scenes.<br/><br/>The story might not be totally original but it all comes down to how they handle it, and they sure handle it well. How Peter finds the clues to an unfinished experiment in Uncle Ben's flooded basement, and how he manages to piece the algorithm together with Curtis Connors. They do a good job of balancing out the origin story and the action, I dare say! And the chemistry between Gwen and Peter was very believable too. They didn't devote too much time to the love story, which is always a good thing. The contrast between Peter and Curtis is fantastic as well, and if anything is one of the better hero/villain chemistry works in recent years.<br/><br/>As for the action scenes? INCREDIBLE. I must say, I love how they kept them grounded and realistic,saving the epic sweep until the big finale. They scrapped the campy and over the top feel of the original movies and give us rough and brutal fights, just how we want it. Garfield handles the action well and you can tell he did a lot of his own stunts too. The fight scenes between Spider Man and Lizard were fantastic, especially the grand finale in the Oscorp tower at the end!<br/><br/>And the acting. I must say the acting was fantastic. Garfield KNOCKED IT OUT OF THE PARK, here. MacGuire was too much of a metrosexual pansy for me to take him seriously. Garfield is a total nerd, and as a result, he gets the role right. He even looks nerdy, and it helps as well. The way he manages to hold back his British accent is extraordinary as well, and his humorous kick he adds to the character works too. Emma Stone is fantastic as Gwen Stacy and adds real depth to the character, in an almost unexpected way. Her and Peter Parker's chemistry works on every level. Ifans is a great villain, and he manages to add an air of sympathy to the villain, making his transformation into the Lizard very tragic and poignant. And Leary... Well, what can we say? Brilliant and funny as usual, he even ad libs a few lines, and you'll know which lines those are (""do I look like the mayor of Tokyo?!"").<br/><br/>In short, Webb, Stone, Garfield and Ifans have knocked one out of the park. An absolutely stellar effort thanks to great talent and I can assure you that I  will be seeing the movie again. And I can also assure you that this is a must see, with tons of action, intrigue, humour and dark tone as well. Do not miss it!"

To be honest i think most of the critics are still hung up in the old trilogy, but to be fair i didn't get to excited when i heard they were making a new series of the Spider Man. So as you might notice its 2017 when i enter this review. But i thought a boring Tuesday wouldn't get destroyed if this movie was as bad as most of the reviews i read pre-hand. <br/><br/>So the shocker! I loved it! <br/><br/>For me the cast, the story and the atmosphere this movie gave me was pure awesome. Off course i loved the first movie but this is for me a new and improved one that didn't just copy the same story as many other remakes does. This was a new and more exciting movie. It gave me a more tougher, darker side of Spider-Man vs the original Spider Man movie. And i must say Andrew Garfield really impressed me as an actor and gave Spider Man a more complete role instead of being a nerdy boy with bad humor. <br/><br/>So if you wonder if you should see this or not, at least give it a chance.

"TheSeaLion","3","3","5","14 March 2014"," What a letdown
","Spider-Man is arguably the most well known superhero from Marvel comics and, let alone one of the most well known superheroes in general. In 2002, director Sam Raimi released his film about the superhero to general acclaim. In 2004, ""Spider-Man 2"" was released, once again receiving much praise and being called better than the original. When ""Spider-Man 3"" was released in 2007, the film received mixed reviews at best and ended the trilogy on a low note. Five years later, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" was released as a reboot of the superhero's origin story, this time directed by Marc Webb and, like the first two films of the Raimi trilogy, received high appraise.<br/><br/>The plot of this film is a lot like the plot of the first Raimi movie. Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is bitten by a spider and gets spider- like powers from it. After Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) is killed by a thief (Leif Gantvoort), Peter decides to use his powers to fight crime, though it takes a little more time to get to that point in this film than in the Raimi film. As a superhero origin story, it is nothing too special, but it works. The problem is that all of the trailers for this movie promised it being the untold story, which we never see. It is set up right at the beginning of the film and then forgotten about.<br/><br/>The biggest problem that weighs the film down comes from none other than our main protagonist Peter Parker. I have not seen Andrew Garfield in anything else, but I have a feeling he is a good actor who is simply in the wrong role. His performance of Peter Parker is frankly boring, but the worst parts about the character come not from his portrayal, but how he is written. In this film, Peter Parker is a hundred different things rolled into one character who is barley consistent and ends up coming off as unlikable most of the time. I would even say that this is the worst superhero ever put in a movie. Sure, George Clooney in ""Batman & Robin"" was bad, but his character was at the very least consistent.<br/><br/>The other characters in the film are also bland, uninteresting cardboard cutouts with the exception of Captain Stacey (Denis Leary) and, only because of his actor, Dr. Kurt Connors (Rhys Ifans). This movie has a lot of talented actors and actresses in it, but the characters are so poorly written and with the editing taking out important moments involving them that these characters are as ridiculous and cliché as the Lizard's plan. With the poor writing comes the poor chemistry between Peter and Gwen Stacey (Emma Stone), whose relationship exists mainly because Spider-Man needs a love interest. I will say the relationship between Peter (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) from the Raimi ""Spider-Man"" was not all that interesting, but it actually did something with the characters and was not just to give Peter a romantic interest.<br/><br/>When it comes to superhero movies, this one also has one of the most ridiculous endings. In other superhero films that take themselves less seriously and realize they are goofy and corny an ending like this would work, but ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" shows itself off as a serious and realistic superhero movie like the Christopher Nolan ""Batman"" movies. With the Nolan movies, the serious take on the story worked, but here, it does not. The villain is a giant lizard and his evil plan is to turn the rest of the city into lizards using a device that Oscorp created. Spider-Man saves the day with the help of a bunch of construction workers turning their cranes so he can easily swing over to Oscorp tower. <br/><br/>""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a film that promises the audience a lot of things which never pay off. It is not the untold story, and the serious approach makes all of the goofy things stand out as major problems for the film. Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker is one of the worst superheroes to ever appear on screen, and this is the worst Marvel movie I have ever seen. Boring, cardboard cutouts of characters, a story that takes itself too seriously, a comical, clichéd ending, and by just not keeping its promises, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is, in simplest terms, a letdown of a movie."
"rparham","7","3","5","23 December 2012"," A decent series reboot
","It was only ten years ago that Spider-Man, the first cinematic adaptation of one of Marvel's crown jewel characters, was released to generally strong critical notices and boffo box-office. After two additional entries, the 2nd being another hit, the 3rd dropping a bit in quality, Sony Pictures and original helmer Sam Raimi couldn't see eye to eye on future entries, so Raimi walked away, and Sony elected to follow in the footsteps of James Bond and Batman and ""reboot"" the franchise only five years since the last entry. This would prove to be a controversial choice with many (I have at least one friend who said he had no interest in seeing the reboot), but I was willing to give this new entry the benefit of the doubt. In general, I can say I was glad I did. The new entry, titled The Amazing Spider-Man, is a fairly strong film for the most part. Sporting a good turn in the lead by Andrew Garfield and an expanded focus on the relationship between Peter and his first girlfriend, Gwen Stacy, The Amazing Spider-Man manages to vindicate itself from those who might doubt it.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man does re-hash the origin story that most are probably familiar with at this point, albeit with some new twists on the material. In this incarnation, Peter Parker is left with his Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field) under mysterious circumstances by his parents in the middle of the night in the opening scenes of the film. When the narrative jumps forward to the present, Peter is a gawky outsider, imagined as both a science nerd but also a bit of a teenage rebel, riding a skateboard and slightly flaunting authority. When he discovers a briefcase of his father's in the basement, Peter begins asking questions about his father's work, which leads him to Oscorp, the company his father worked for. There, he encounters Dr. Chuck Connors (Rhys Ifans), his father's former partner, and the two begin working to complete Peter's father's work. However, the research into genetic regeneration has a dark side, as it would appear that it is intended to be used by Norman Osborne, the unseen head of the company, as a tool to help save his life, and who seems to know something about the reason Peter's parents disappeared.<br/><br/>Upon his first visit to Oscorp, Peter happens into a room where testing is being performed on spiders, and one manages to bite him. The result, of course, is that the spider bite imbues him with extraordinary powers: strength, speed and a remarkable ability to scale buildings as if his hands and feet had tape bonded to them. After Uncle Ben is killed in an accidental shooting, Peter begins to use these abilities, along with a formula for advanced webbing his father developed, to search out the criminal responsible for Ben's death. Peter begins to expand his relationship with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), a classmate who is also an intern at Oscorp. He also begins to wonder about Dr. Connors, who is acting strangely and, when faced with the shutdown of his research, injects himself with the genetic formula, transforming himself into a creature that becomes known as the Lizard, and this experience sends him on a path to madness that Peter must try to stop.<br/><br/>The biggest weaknesses of The Amazing Spider-Man are, unsurprisingly, the revisiting of the same material that was brought to life 10 years ago. Most audience members are familiar with the spider bite, the moments of Peter discovering his powers, and his hunt for Ben's killer. It also doesn't help that in the years since the release of the first Spider-Man, countless other super hero film adaptations have seen the light of day and mined similar material. At this juncture, the origin story plot has really started to show both its age and its overexposure. That being said, The Amazing Spider-Man does approach most of these moments in a different vein than the prior entry. A key difference is to focus on Peter's budding relationship with Gwen Stacy, Peter's first girlfriend in the comics but a character that was relegated to cameo status in Spider-Man 3. Garfield and Stone bring a degree of chemistry and involvement to the relationship and this element of the film feels stronger than the Peter/Mary Jane pairing in the earlier films.<br/><br/>Garfield also proves a capable lead in the role of Peter. While Tobey Maguire largely focused on portraying Peter as a somewhat shy nerd, for lack of a better term, Garfield's performance enhances Peter's nervousness and captures the awkwardness of the teenage years, stammering in his dialogue at times and giving Peter a degree of uncertainty in his moments with Gwen. It isn't necessarily better than Maguire's turn, but it is sufficiently different to not feel like a rehash. Stone proves a bit more fetching and strong willed than Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane, and her realization of Gwen is certainly the stronger female presence when compared to Dunst.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man also excels on the technical front. The visual effects that bring the action sequences to life are impressive, to say the least, and the film benefits from the decade of development in technology since the first Spider-Man. The moments in which Spider-Man soars through the city and faces off against the Lizard are eye-opening, and prove viscerally involving. James Horner's music score is also a standout, providing a fairly traditional symphonic score in a day and age where so many films are moving towards a sound design influenced musical environment.<br/><br/>There is no denying that The Amazing Spider-Man arrives with quite a bit of baggage attached, and it isn't completely successful at slaying all of the downfalls of revisiting this material, but for the most part, this entry works, and proves, like 1998's The Incredible Hulk, that there is more than one decent modern interpretation of a traditional comic book hero."
"DarthVoorhees","1","15","42","22 July 2012"," A would be hero...
","'The Amazing Spider-Man' is a mess of a movie. The classic hero formula gets old really fast. 'The Amazing Spider-Man' doesn't give a damn about any of it's characters or what motivates them. It wants money and that's all there is to it. Sony thinks America's movie going public is composed of a bunch of ignoramuses who will buy anything they shove Spider-Man's name onto. Sam Raimi made a trilogy of goofy films but at their best moments they defined Spider- Man and what he wanted to be. 'The Amazing Spider-Man' is too dark and self important to work. Sony failed to understand the character and what drove him. I can imagine the writing of this script tried very hard to mimic 'The Dark Knight'. Spider-Man isn't meant to be this dark though. Here Spider-Man is more like Norman Bates than he is a superhero. 'The Amazing Spider- Man' has no idea what it is to be an adolescent trying to find their place in the world which I imagine was their intent in the rebooting of the franchise. What we get is a very flat hero who thinks he is well developed.<br/><br/>""With great power comes great responsibility""<br/><br/>Cheesy? Sure but it has a nice ring to it. Stan Lee in his own nerdy form of eloquence defined what drives every super hero. If you have the power to do good than you should. I am not a fan of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films but at least they had a character with a motivation. It's a simple and cliché motivation but with proper weight put on it, it is brilliant. Spider-Man has gone into darker themes as a comic but never has he become a self-important cry baby as he is here. There is no origin or making of a hero here. The entire film is built around Peter's parents and some terrible secret they took with them to the graves. Fine but at least take us along on a journey with Peter. The film is forced to remind us about this with star Andrew Garfield going into little angsty crybaby fits. Uncle Ben which has served as the primary motivation for Spider- Man in the past is reduced to next to nothing here. Martin Sheen is good here but Garfield and this script give nothing back to the character. His death becomes mere exposition because we are meant to think something deeper and more sinister lies beneath. I sincerely doubt Sony has taken any sort of comic book into mind in the plotting of this would be franchise. I predict that sequels will drag along without the secret being answered and they will just having Peter be depressed about it. I doubt Sony even knows what the secret is. <br/><br/>And so how does this effect the film? We have a miserable selfish hero that only cares about himself. This is the furthest opposite of all that Spider-Man was built upon. If Spider-Man ever got depressed it was because he was limited in the amount of people he could save. Spider- Man has great power here but it is self serving power. If I were Stan Lee I'd be ashamed that they did this to my character.<br/><br/>There isn't really anything positive to say about any other area of the film. It's foundations are faulty and so nothing can really be built upon them. I imagine Denis Leary, Emma Stone, and Rhys Ifans could all be cast in the same roles in an excellent Spider-Man film.Rhys Ifans is actually kind of good as Curt Conners but the Lizard CGI is about as fake as anything you would see in a 'Transformers' film and so his performance is wasted.The problem is because the origin and mythology is so distorted and unlikeable that I don't care about anyone else. It's just an ordinary summer film really which needs a good story to become extraordinary. We see the same old action we always see. Raimi was better at web swinging action sequences because he embraced the cartoonish nature of them while keeping the integrity of the character. <br/><br/>See Spider-Man 2. It's not a great film and it has it's share of goof ball moments but it has a defined hero."

","I may say its a kids movie.Good utilization of 3D and graphics Good fun and entertainment for a below 15 year old kid.Movie is worth watching for once just because it is not boring.But don't expect something great.There is nothing catchy and no situation which can be kept in mind I didn't felt any serious threats in the movie.Villain was a total waste.When fight scenes came i felt like 2 school kids putting some show like in some cartoon. Nothing to admire or no moral background. The old Spider Man movie series is always the best and old Peter Parker is the one i admire.The Peter Parker in this new movie was active agile and very athletic.But we don't expect someone who plays the role of a very responsible superhero to be an immature kid.The Truth is he couldn't create the real impact on our mind as old Peter Parker did."
"bsujan2007","Null","10","26","29 June 2012"," Raimi with Garfield = what it takes to be Amazing!
","Andrew Garfield has more charisma than Tobey Maguire. That i will say. Seriously would Raimi green-light this film, i doubt it. <br/><br/>The movie hangs by a working screenplay and acting. <br/><br/>Spiderman is supposed to be about Spiderman being Spiderman, kicking villains bad ass, swinging all over the place,<br/><br/>While i do not wish to compare this to the other blockbuster spiderman films. The Amazing Spiderman title tends to be misleading the fans of the spiderman franchise. Why wasn't anyone working on this film sensible enough to simply make it what it is ""Spiderman""<br/><br/>Amazing is definitely not the keyword here. While you may find this movie worth your bucket of popcorn. Sadly the high standards of direction set by Raimi is unreached. He was able to sell Tobey Maguire as Spiderman! And here you have Garfield as perfect Spidey, and go play hopscotch with the plot.<br/><br/>So much could be accomplished with Spiderman films. A good film you feel like watching more than once. I will watch this once in the cinema and then when it comes on TV, if and when nothing else interesting is on."

"JarradGhent","8","4","8","11 June 2014"," Jarrad Movie Review ""The Amazing Spider-Man""
","Did this movie fix all the problems with Spider-Man 3? Are we going to get a much darker take on Spider-Man? Is Andrew Garfield going to make a good Peter Parker? Will this movie be good at all? Well I watched this movie on its DVD release; the movie had a bunch of good things and Bad things. But the movie had more good things than bad things. So I will list the good and the bad of this film. Let's start with the negatives. <br/><br/>1. The Villain. The lizard is the main villain here and Doctor Kirk Connors was great in the Sam Rami Trilogy. He, here is not that great. His design was incredibly stupid. For this character to be CGI for the whole movie, it looks awkward. And I don't believe he even exist or even there. The character arc is one of my favorite comic book arcs ever. And to see this arc screwed up is disappointing. He is also very cliché at the end but I going to spoil it. But seriously it's so cliché. <br/><br/>2. The rushed production. Yes, you should know why now. If not, then. Sony wanted to keep the rights to Spider-Man. But after Spider-Man 3. They couldn't keep Sam Rami. They had until 2012 or the rights would run out and they panicked and made The Amazing Spider-Man with Marc Webb. The Movie feels a little rushed because of this. And for me it's not such an issue. But others complain about it. But I thought it was worth saying. <br/><br/>3. Peter's Mum and Dad Back Story. This is most likely to be my least favorite aspect of the movie. I really was boring and uninteresting. And really... I just don't care. I feels completely pointless. <br/><br/>4. And finally the over use of CGI. This is going to be short so let's cut to the chase. I think there was too much of it. Hmm? Let's see we have the special effects in the final battle. The web slinging spider-man and the lizard. OMG!! Think there's not enough of it.\<br/><br/>Now there are positives.<br/><br/>1. The actions were a splendor to watch ever though it might have too CGI in it. It's still pretty awesome. We get to see Spider-Man use his powers in creative ways. And it awesomely paced to.<br/><br/>2. The Romance was so cute. Now I usually hate romance in superhero movies. But this is really good. Gwen was a great and strong character. She knew what to do in a sticky problem. Emma Stone as well was born for the role. She has a great sense of humor. And character deployment. It's so good.<br/><br/>3. The wise cracking Spider-Man was so funny. Some lines had laughing quirt hard. I really love the humor for this movie. <br/><br/>4. Finally the best thing in this. Spider-Man 1, 2 and 3 felt like comic book movies. Which is fine but if your want to make a comic book come to life shouldn't you make it like a movie. The serious tone of this movie really works in this film. And whether I think it works or not is to people's personal opinions.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I give the Amazing Spider-Man a solid 8.6 out 10. This movie showed me what Spider-Man movie should be like. And don't get me wrong the originals are like comic book movies and you know it works. But I think the serious tone, comedy, romance and action just makes me feel that The Amazing Spider-Man the better film. I thank you for reading my review and if you like it you can check out some of my other reviews. So you later, ladies and Gentlemen."
"carnagemillion","10","4","8","16 March 2013"," Don't listed to the haters, they are just biased towards this Film.
","The Amazing Spider-Man is nothing short of Amazing. Right off the bat I wanna say that if you want a huge epic action packed superhero movie like the Avengers then you're gonna be disappointed, this movie is a character movie about Peter Parker becoming the web slinger and in my opinion what the original failed to do, which is the origin and character development. They really take time and develop his character and his relationship with his uncle. The portrayal of Peter Parker and Spider-Man is also great, they got the awkward and nerdy aspect of the character but with a modern touch to it, and also has the smart ass quips that Spidey had from the comics. And the chemistry and interactions, between the cast is great. The movie had a great villain, great action, great acting, great swinging, great score and great visual effects. The only flaw I can name is that the films editing and pacing is a bit off in some places but other than that it's a great movie. The people that give this movie a bad review only simply hate it because it's a reboot and are biased, and only think Spider-Man can be played by Tobey Maguire, don't listen to them."
"reb-warrior","10","4","8","12 March 2013"," It's Not The Spider-man You Think It Is. And It's Terrific!
","If you're like me, you may have heard that Spider-man was being rebooted, and that they were basically telling the origin story all over again. Well I thought, wait what, but I just saw the origin story!? The Sam Raimi version! What's the point in watching this, and decide not to watch it. Well guess what? You're making a mistake! Tho this is an origin story, with similar elements, it's very different, and something completely new. Yes, Peter Parker does become Spider-man. Yes he does grow up with his aunt and uncle. But that's about all that is the same, and even in these two cases, the ""how"" and ""why"" are different.<br/><br/>OK, you may see me make a few comparisons with the Raimi version. Sorry. But it's only because I think some people may not bother watching this because they feel they've already seen it. Just to be clear I really like the first Raimi movie, and the second, tho not as much. The third, not at all.<br/><br/>In the Raimi version I found Peter to be an absolute geek. Period. He was always feeling sorry for himself, and had no confidence whatsoever until he got his powers. He was also a complete outcast at school. So much so, that he seems depressed and almost reminds me of one of those kids that was bullied and brings a gun to school. So we're relieved when he gets his powers and we cheer for him. In this new telling we see a Peter Parker whom is geeky, yet cool and likable. Cute and funny even. He has lots of confidence, and doesn't seem like an absolute outcast. His interaction with the lead female character may be a little shy, but not over-the-top uncomfortable as in Raimi's version. This Peter also thinks fast on his feet and has a lot of witty lines combined with his body language(as Spider-man) that really emphasizes Peter's comical wit that you see in the comics and the animated TV shows.<br/><br/>Raimi's Peter was all wrapped up in Mary Jane, his tormented feelings of guilt for his uncle's death, and his uncle's message. In this version Peter is focused on finding out what happened to his parents. Something very mysterious, almost a cover-up or conspiracy took place. He's doing this before he gets his powers. We watch as he sleuths, putting together his memories, a file that belonged to his father, and uses the internet to track down information. The mystery brings hims face to face with Dr. Curt Connors aka: The Lizard. <br/><br/>The way it goes down that Peter becomes Spider-man, and his uncle's death, is very different here than in the Raimi version. Both are really good. In both, uncle Ben's death is very sad. Do I have a preference? Yes. I liked this version better. Mostly I liked the circumstances better here. In Raimi's version, sorry, but Pete seemed like a total douche-bag with the whole wrestling/money thing. I believe the wrestling version is also the comic book version, but nevertheless that's how I felt. In this version, what happened, just made more sense, even relatable, and fit more in line with Peter's personality. <br/><br/>Oh where, oh where is Mary Jane coz she always needs rescuing? She's always falling from a building or a super-villain has got her! Wow, wow, wow, what a difference with Gwen Stacey! She didn't need rescuing! I liked her right away. She's intelligent, and I loved that she began crushing on Peter BEFORE he got his powers. Without giving anything away, there is this moment where she and Peter are talking. He has a secret which concerns her. Not love stuff, OK. Something else. I'm thinking, oh no, just tell her, she really needs to know this. But guess what? She figures it out herself. As I watched I felt relieved that she wasn't walking away from Peter with the impression that he's a lousy person. She knew the truth. I really liked her and Peter together. Great chemistry with the actors.<br/><br/>One thing that really struck me in this movie was today's techy world. Peter using his cellphone for communication, messages, and pictures. Him calling his voice-mail to hear his uncle's last message a couple of times. Gulp. How many of us have loved ones that have passed, and we saved their last voice-mail message? The last thing they said to us, their voice, means so much. It's a part of our social culture now. I loved the way they used this.<br/><br/>I've always wondered about Peter's parents. I'm not an avid comic reader or anything, but every now and then I'd read one. I never read anything about them, tho it may have been written, I dunno, but the ones I've read were always Peter that grew up with his aunt and uncle, and never any explanation as to why. I found this origin story a tightly-knit, well acted, well rounded tale with a twist at the end, that leaves me looking forward to the next movie. I'm curious to see how this mystery unravels.<br/><br/>So, if you haven't watched this because you think it's the same story as the Raimi version, let me clarify, it's not the Spider-man you think it is, and it's terrific!"
"clownythebooze","3","4","8","27 February 2013"," Complete Garbage
","OK first off let me say I am an old school fan of Spider-Man and have read all the comics since I was a kid. If you are like me stay as far away from this movie as possible. I do understand that they went the way of Ultimate Spider-Man and not the original so take this with a grain of salt and just remember this is my opinion. So for starters, again with the origin story!!?? If you don't know how Peter became Spider-man by now, you must have been just born or born under a rock and in either case they already covered it in the first Spider-man movie so no need to drag that out again, even in a re-boot and since the movie was about 30-45 minutes too long they could have easily left it out. <br/><br/>I will say the CGI of Spidey swinging around was great. The lighting and music was also fine. Thats where my love ends and where the horror starts. The costume was just plain horrible, as was the casting of Andrew Garfield as Peter, is this Spider-Man or Twilight? You could swap him and Patterson out and no one would notice, hell Patterson was even considered for this role so believe me when i say to Mr.Webb I will mark your words and I didn't not ""love him as Peter Parker"" as you said I would! Emma is an OK casting choice as Gwen but would have made a perfect MJ in Spideys world. Rhys Ifans was fine as Curt Connors but sadly the Lizard looks just brutal, he looks like a cheap knock off of Killer Croc from Batman comics and thats me being very nice. Uncle Ben and Aunt May were OK, as was Captain Stacey (but maybe should have been a little older if they cared about staying true to the comics.) <br/><br/>Now for Parker jumping and sticking to the roof of the train and in school showing off, making half court, jumping above the basket, slam dunks and throwing a football hard enough to bend a goal post... do people not think ""hey there's a new super hero that can do that and all of a sudden this nerd kid can too??"" Plus throw in the fact that the lizard attacks him in his own school, so whoever cant put 2 and 2 together should join the people who are fooled by Clark Kent throwing on some glasses to fool everyone. I just don't get it but all that being said I can live with it, what I cant and what is without a doubt the biggest pet peeve in every single superhero movie is the fact that they need to show the stars face instead of the mask, its called a SECRET identity!!! but yet the main bad guy, the main cop chasing him, and a girl he knew for like what, a week? all got to know by the end!! Ridiculousness!! The story line was average at best, they start off with the mystery of Peters parents leaving and then never really bring it up again and unless they are planning to do more with it in the sequels it was very unnecessary and again could have been left out to trim this movie down. The quick relationship of Gwen and Peter was laughable and just crammed together, something they could have built up instead of all this other fodder they put in, not saying more love story is the way to go in a super hero movie but could have been used to build the characters at the very least to make it more believable. As I said the small use of Aunt May and Uncle Ben was fine,they are supporting characters and thats just what they did. The Lizards plot to turn everyone into hybrids is also OK and has been done lots in the cartoons and comics so no real problems there. <br/><br/>I really did have high hopes for this movie after the first 3 saddened me to no end but all this did was basically throw dirt on the grave. I've been waiting almost 40 years for a good Spider-Man movie and with the great characters in his world I find it hard to grasp why they cant and hope I don't have to wait another 40 to finally get my wish, I will always love the comics and one day hope someone with my love for the original characters and story lines will bring that to the screen."

"hitchcockthelegend","7","4","8","16 December 2012"," Webb's Spider-Man, Spider-Man, does what ever a Spider can
","The Amazing Spider-Man is directed by Marc Webb and collectively written by James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves. It stars Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Rhys Ifans, Denis Leary, Martin Sheen and Sally Field. Music is by James Horner and cinematography by John Schwartzman. <br/><br/>Peter Parker (Garfield) was orphaned as a boy when his parents were killed in a plane crash, raised by his Uncle Ben (Sheen) and Aunt May (Field), he is a clever lad but something of an outcast at high school. While investigating the disappearance of his parents and sporting a crush on class mate Gwen Stacy (Stone), Peter's life is tipped upside down when he is bitten by a radioactive spider that gives him abnormal powers.<br/><br/>While the Spider-Man franchise doesn't (thankfully) come packaged with the kind of bizarre mania that comes with Batman, the acolytes are a tough bunch to figure out. Sam Raimi's trilogy garnered close towards $2.5 billion worldwide, yet now, with this reboot (actually it's a reimaging) trundled off of the Sony production line, there are plenty of ""fans"" coming forward to say they never rated Raimi's films! Magurie was this, Dunst was that, Raimi missed the beat of the comic version of Spidey and etc and etc. Well I'm sorry, but I just don't remember any fall out apart from the near unanimously agreed upon over stuffing of Raimi's part 3. Perhaps I just didn't go on the right Spider-Man forums? But even then it's hard to argue with a box office take of $2.5 billion, those figures have to be made up of a good proportion of Spidey fans, surely? You would reasonably think<br/><br/>I mention it because The Amazing Spider-Man has met with reviews from each end of the scale. Those at the high end who support the ""reimaging"" seem to focus on it being close to the real Spidey universe they wanted, with great casting, better effects work and a origin story of worth. At the other end is the arguments that ""reimaging"" a film that is only ten years old is daft, especially since it actually doesn't bring the promised new direction or origin story of worth. In fact it just juggles bits of the Raimi trilogy and plays it out with other Spider-Man characters instead. While Garfield is hardly an improvement since he's way too old for high school as well! The truth is that Webb's movie falls somewhere in between both sides of the argument, and that's not just me being Switzerland and staying neutral! <br/><br/>Negatively it plays out as a compromised production and not the film that the makers initially set out to make, there are too many dangling threads and haphazard edits that leave narrative gaps. An Important character disappears off the radar, other characters are given limited time to breathe, and crucial plot points are arrived at with stupendous leaps of logic. A coda spliced into the end credits tries to entice us for the sequel, suggesting that the quick wipe over the origin ""origin"" story was deliberate, it's unlikely, and feels like an afterthought. For a film that purports to be putting its own stamp on the Spidey universe, it quite often makes you think of Raimi's films anyway. It may be The Lizard instead of Green Goblin and Gwen instead of MJ, but the emotional and psychological beats are still the same. Reboot? My arse. Oh and Horner, who I'm normally a fan of, has turned in a score that lacks vim and vigour, it aspires to be full of swirling superhero fervour to raise the goose flesh on your arms, but instead it's just goose, and not a decently cooked one at that. <br/><br/>However, on the positive side of things, low expectation really helped me to enjoy the film, and I even watched it a second time to check over some initial reactions I had. There is still a lot to enjoy here. Acting is of a high standard (Ifans' performance as Curt Connors gets better on repeat viewings), with good chemistry generated between Stone and Garfield, the effects work is (obviously) better ten years on; something which gives us a better-more acrobatic-moving Spider-Man, while the whole make-up of Parker as a geek who becomes cocky, even arrogant, really adds a kick to the first half of the movie's coming-of-age narrative bent. It's also good that with a running time of over two hours the makers have the time to expand Peter as a character, making the audience wait with expectation of his life changing date with the spider. As for the villain, it's true enough to say that The Lizard is hardly an inspiring choice, but it does fit in with the whole origin story plan that Webb and his team want to tell. Though it should be noted that those seeking wall to wall fights between Spidey and The Liz are going to go a little hungry. <br/><br/>It's big on human story and not the lazy cash in movie it could have been, and undeniably it's fun, but the holes, dangling threads and logic leaps stop it breaking out to achieve its intentions. Looking forward to the sequel, mind 7/10"
"gingus-maximus","8","4","8","13 December 2012"," Absolutely Excellent
","No idea where all the negative feedback has come from. This is a great film. Its brilliantly acted and the story flows. The characters behave believably and all in all its much more spider man than the previous. I suspect that a lot of the negative comments on here are due to a love of the previous series but for me they were never that tremendous. Spider-Man acts much more like Spider-Man should with his quips and attitude and is far more genuine than the last series. All in all its a great film I thoroughly enjoyed it and found far superior to the new Batman that everybody seemed to love so much. Would definitely recommend it to anyone."
"embedrei","3","4","8","24 October 2012"," Patience doesn't pay off - It doesn't get any better
","Spider-Man 2012 starts very lame, but that's to be expected. Origin stories of superheroes are always quite tedious. No matter how hard you try, they will remain nonsensical. Better to get over with them as quickly as possible. But here they've opted for the opposite. I wonder if anyone ever wanted to know the story of Parker's parents. I sure didn't. It looks like they are going to use this story line as the basis for the new Spidey trilogy. The ever-present ""This time it's personal."" is so annoying. It takes more than 50 minutes until we finally see the familiar costume and the real movie begins.<br/><br/>Spider-Man 2002 was superior to Spider-Man 2012 in about every way: Story, dialog, actors, CGI. Andrew Garfield is very bland and a complete miscast. The villain would be the pride of every Syfy creature feature. The ""love interest"" Gwen Stacy is just some kind of college acquaintance. The CGI is surprisingly underwhelming.<br/><br/>The only thing really amazing is the amount of bad decisions made that turned this into a 230 million dollar borefest. The real villains of this movies stay behind the screen. Choosing a TV-director for a big action movie because of his suggestive name (Webb), just to crack a corny joke - come on! <br/><br/>In a 1973 comic book Gwen Stacy dies after the Green Goblin has tossed her off a bridge. Spider-Man tries to save her with a string of web, but the sudden stop snaps her neck. This is actually consistent with real world physics. In Spider-Man 2012 he throws her out of a window himself to get her out of harm's way, breaking her fall with a string of web - and she's just fine. There was more realism in 1973's comic books than there is in today's blockbuster movies. Go figure!"
"tha_hawk","3","4","8","19 October 2012"," The amazingly unnecessary Spider-Man reboot
","Throughout this entire movie I had a very distinctive feeling I had seen something familiar just a while ago. Oh waitI did. Only five years have passed since the last Sam Raimi Spider-Man movie premiered, and I simply do not understand why this Spidey reboot was made so soon. Nevertheless we get to watch Spider-Man climb walls, fight crooks, swing in nets between buildings in a supposed to be new and amazing motion picture. The problem is that none of this amazes me because it feels like I watched it only yesterday. I haven't had the time to get the hots or to build up any anticipation for a reincarnation of Marvel's spider. Neither have I accepted the fact that I never again will see Tobey Maguire in that red and blue spandex suit. Not enough time has gone by. Not even Peter Parker initially becoming Spider-Man and his conflicted feelings and inevitable problems due to this concerns me because, like I said, it feels like I watched this the other day. Sure, the story isn't all the same as previous screen adaptations of the comic book hero. We get the background story of Peter's parents, there's a new villain on the loose etcetera, but when you get down to it that's just a different setting to an already told story.<br/><br/>I like the Sam Raimi trilogy. It has the right balance between comic book and real life and the world presented to you feels quite realistic. The movies aren't exactly literary works of art, but compared to Mark Webb's ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" they've got considerable depth. In ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" everything feels flat, like a copy, like a bad cover band that just makes you want to see the original act. Furthermore, a lot of the dialogue seems off-pace, Andrew Garfield's neurotic way of acting makes me uneasy and pretty often I'm not sure what emotions the actors (mostly Garfield and Stone) are supposed to convey. This of course leads to some confusion regarding the characters' feelings for each other as well as their intentions. If this is a case of bad directing or bad acting I'm not sure. The movie is also edited into a higher-than-necessary pace. Almost every cut could easily be two seconds longer and almost every scene could easily be two minutes longer. A high tempo doesn't per se make a movie more exciting, it could just as well have the reverse effect. <br/><br/>So, was there nothing I liked about this movie? Sure there was. I liked how things where explained and made possible by the technical and scientific skills of Peter Parker's. Things like how he makes his suit, his net-throwing gadgets and so on. It ties in nicely with who he is as a person. I liked the witty punch lines when they weren't out of pace. I also liked Stan Lee's cameo, which was unusually elaborate.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the film the background story of Peter Parker's parents takes up a lot of time. I first thought that this was an interesting approach to a new Spidey movie but soon realized that it was just an excuse to get Peter in touch with Oscorp and Curt Connors. The fate of his parents is actually irrelevant to the Peter Parker/Spider- Man character since what's really interesting about him is the conflict within himself and the seemingly impossible choices he so often has to make. The Tobey Maguire movies don't mention a single word about Peter's parents and still manage to get you so much more involved with the characters than this movie does. The filmmakers do however make hints that they intend to develop this whole parent thing further in possible sequel/sequels, so I might be proved wrong about the relevance in the end."
"lakewoodmatt67","3","4","8","18 October 2012"," Not So Amazing Spider Man
","Well, this is my very first review I'm writing here on IMDb, and unfortunately, it has to be Amazing Spider Man. OK, to cut right to the chase here: This reboot/remake/whatever you want to call it is LACKLUSTRE AND UNINSPIRED! That's the short review. Here's a bit more insight from my mind...<br/><br/>At first, when I heard that the idea was to take Spidey back to his roots and the original mannerisms and situations from the old Stan Lee/John Romita days of the early comics, I was very excited! Gwen Stacy instead of Mary Jane Watson? Hooray! Spidey cracking wise and being a perpetual smart ass, instead of being mute through all his exploits? Hooray! The Lizard being the first villain...uh,....hooray? Maybe not.<br/><br/>Right off the bat, let me tell you that YET AGAIN, comic book fans are force fed YET ANOTHER long boring drawn out Origin Story. Look, I get that there are newbie movie goers who may not have ever picked up a comic book in their life and may not have very much insight into Spider Man and all the related characters. But did we REALLY have to go through ANOTHER litany of ""Peter is a nerd outcast, likes a pretty girl, gets bit by an abnormal spider, gets powers, etc. ad infinitum, ad nausea... It's the same with every time they start a new superhero franchise. You know damned well you're not going to see the superhero in full costume and battle gear for AT LEAST a good hour in, nor are you going to see any superhero vs. supervillian battles for even longer then that, because not only do we have to baby step the audience through every facet of the hero, we also have to have extraneous back-story on the bad guy, who he is, what got him to be bad, his relationship with the superhero, which is in some way, shape or form the clichéd ""mirror image"" of what the hero has become, and so on and so on... God, I'm sick of origin stories... But I digress...<br/><br/>So, The Amazing Spider Man does try to bring to the screen what longtime Spidey fans loved in the comics, except...<br/><br/>The leads, Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, are visibly too old to even try to pass them off as teenagers. Even portraying them as college age would be pushing it.<br/><br/>The supporting cast, Dennis Leary, Martin Sheen, Sally Field, superlative actors all, are all horribly miscast in their respective roles as Capt. Stacy, Uncle Ben and Aunt May. Not one iota of these characters that we know and love is visible in any facet of their performances, not one little bit.<br/><br/>They totally bastardized the entire lesson of Spider-Man: ""With great power comes great responsibility."" For chrissakes, they don't even say that line verbatim! Sheen as Uncle Ben tries to tell Peter this, but he completely rewords the statement, and the point of the lesson, and the existence of Spider Man in the first place, is lost. If nothing else, the younger kids, who are obviously the target demographic for this film, should hear the correct version of this dialog, so they'll at least have that to take away from this film. What a shame...<br/><br/>Then there's the Lizard... You know what? When the Lizard came into the proceedings is about where I bailed on this film, and I don't think I've ever turned off a superhero movie. This was a first. So, technically, this film review is really only about three quarters complete, give or take some minutes. But based on what I watched, I came away not angry, or outraged, just bored and somewhat disappointed.<br/><br/>It's films like this that make me frightened that I'm getting too old for this superhero stuff anymore.<br/><br/>Bottom line: If you're a Marvel Comics fan, or a Spider Man fan, or any kind of superhero fan, stay away from this one. Go watch The Avengers again, at least you get your money's worth there! And, I'm out!"
"bananashake100","5","4","8","26 July 2012"," An insult to Raimi's films
","Wow. Where do I even begin? This was even worse than I expected it to be. Literally every aspect of this film was worse than the previous Spiderman movies. There was not a single redeeming quality to justify the production of this film. It was just flat out unnecessary.<br/><br/>To start out, just look at the acting. Whether it's a romantic scene, an emotional scene, or a fighting sequence, Andrew Garfield fails to put enough likability into his performance. Throughout the whole film, I was never really convinced that he had the potential to be a hero. Not only was his acting bad at times, but he really seemed to be missing that extra something that would make him stand out among the other characters. I especially felt that way in the scene where Peter finds out his uncle is dead. Sally Field's performance far outshined whatever emotion Andrew was trying to convey. In fact, her acting is the only thing that makes this movie even a little bit believable. <br/><br/>Next, there's no freaking plot! Seriously, for the first half an hour or so of the movie, there's just background information with no mention of a villain. Peter flirts with Gwen, gets in confrontations, and comes home with a bruise on his face. It's pretty ridiculous that this exact cycle happens more than once.Then, after a certain point in the film, Peter's curiosity to learn about his father's past, as well as his desire to find the guy who murdered his uncle is just abandoned. This makes the plot of the villain kind of irrelevant when it appears way later in the story, seeing as how Dr. Connors is so linked to his father's history. Nevertheless, when the villain appears in the story, so does spiderman, and he goes from being a guy in a mask searching for a murderer to a crime fighter with no real explanation. <br/><br/>Overall, this film just doesn't have half the effort as the other spiderman films did. There are so many questions left unanswered and so many parts of the story that don't make sense. There are no lessons to be learned from this, and its story line lacks anything that would make this movie likable for me."
"avalanche781","9","4","8","26 July 2012"," I'd like to call it ""The Spectacular Spider-Man"" has some flaws, but it's still a great film on it's own.
","Reboot can be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on the situation. For Batman, we received from Christopher Nolan without a doubt the greatest Super Hero trilogy ever, With Clash of the Titans, not really. But what about our Friendly Neighborhood? well with the conclusion of the 3rd film, the details of the villains and Sam Raimi stepping back from the project makes sense for Sony to reboot rather then making a fourth Installment of the Raimi trilogy.<br/><br/>Well now we have the The Amazing Spider-Man reboot finally upon us. Is it really Amazing, It's damn close to it. The thing that works about the film is bringing parts of the comic to life, one of them being Peter Parkers first love Gwen Stacy to the big screen rather then Mary Jane Watson, The actual Timeline rather then the popularity of the characters. Comparing to Christopher Nolan's Batman films which have a politics theme to it, The Amazing Spider-Man lives within the world of Biochemistry and digs more the background behind Peter Parker like never before. Peter Parker who is portrayed by ""The Social Networks"" star Andrew Garfield and ""Easy A"" star Emma Stone put their heart into the character's Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy, this is one of the strongest points of the movie, and the rest of the cast is also just as strong as the protagonists, Sally Wield actual surprised me as Aunt May, so is Dennis Leary portrayal to Captain Stacy is also an incredible achievement from this cast, and Rhys Ifans portrayal as the antagonist Dr Connors (The Lizard) which for some moments demonstrates this two personalities in one person, similar to what we seen in Norman Osborn from the Spidey film of 2002.<br/><br/>The transformation of Peter Parker to Spider Man, is also quite well filmed especially when you see him trying to control his powers, it's both interesting, intense and comical. And it's not only when he was bitten by the Radioactive spider, but also how he starts to fight crimes, his web slinging practice, the process of his costume creation which is also very well detailed.<br/><br/>Although the film was made for 3D, it does take some good advantages and some creative steps that make use for the character Spider-Man, one of my favorite moments was entering in first person view during the web slinging which collaborated with the films use of the 3D makes you feel that you were inside of the mind of Spider-Man, the problem though they're are very few moments of these which is pity because they put a creative use for the character Spider-Man in a 3D film.<br/><br/>Some of the issues of the film though concern with the film is probable the fact that it feels slow at points, that's not saying that the film is slow in action, but how the Origin of Spider-Man does take place quite a period before he starts his life as Spider-Man. also is the fact that they're are some plot points that really aren't resolved in the film but it makes you feel that it will be answered for a sequel. Besides that there are some changes that are very different from the comics and the Raimi films, however it's not really an issue at all, because It's a reboot and takes liberty to do what could be interesting points, one of them is how Peter is inspired by creating the Spider-Man mask.<br/><br/>The film even though it's quite serious and focuses the darkness of Peter Parker, it also has some enjoyable humor that is straight from the Spider-Man comics.<br/><br/>I know at this moment, people are more interested in watching The Dark Knight Rises, however The Amazing Spider-Man is still a spectacular adventure and serves as an excellent reboot, despite some flaws, Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield should be praised for what they both have done in the film, they are one of the strongest points of the film along with the solid cast, If you have a chance to watch this Spectacular film then I would highly recommend this movie. I seriously can't wait for a sequel."

","I didn't really like this version, don't get me wrong the original wasn't that good either, but this one was pretty cheesy compared to the first one, I mean c'mon..., like the part where they line up the crains so he can swing (pretty cheesy),and the unbelievable part where he picked up someone else's badge and the guy that owns the badge comes and they don't believe its him...really? in a place where they create super spiders and grow arms back they cant create a security system that surpasses someone saying ""yep im this guy"" even when the guy came they should have immediately asked for ID and then kick peter out. those are just some of the bad things, oh yea almost forgot the fake looking CGI. I wouldn't waste 13$ to go see this guys, if you really wanna see it wait for the DVD.Forgot to mention, the scenes are predictable."

"dkemathas","7","4","8","13 July 2012"," Mark Webb... Perfect name for a director to direct a Spider-Man movie!
","I am a big fan of the Raimi/Maguire trilogy, but to be honest, I think this is the best film till date. This one is more faithful to the comic books than the three other previous films and it has a more darker story. This puts more emphasis on Peter Parker's past and goes more deeply into the mystery of why his parents disappeared.<br/><br/>One example is Mary Jane Watson. She was already Peter's first love in Rami's first film, but Mary Jane was actually a good friend of Peter when he was in a relationship with Gwen Stacy. After Gwen Stacy passed away, Mary Jane showed sympathy for Peter, they both became best friends and later went into a relationship and got married.<br/><br/>Another example is the Green Goblin. Green Goblin came too early in the films. If you've read the comic books you know for sure that Gwen Stacy was taken as a hostage of Goblin and was pushed from the bridge (which might can be an inspiration for the final fight scene in Raimi's first film when the Goblin pushes Mary Jane from the bridge). Spider-Man rescues Gwen, but eventually realizes that she was already dead when Goblin pushed her down from the bridge. I can say that the only thing that was right (according to the comic books) in the final fight scene in Raimi's film was that the Goblin killed himself with the glider.<br/><br/>But back to this film. I think that Andrew Garfield was the perfect Peter Parker/Spider-Man. His innocent face, curiosity, the way he talks to annoy the bad guys makes himself to be the right choice of actor to play the role. Both Garfield and Maguire were really good actors, but Garfield was a bit better than Maguire. I especially liked this part: ''Look, if you really wanna steal a car, then don't dress like a car thief''. Then he acts like that he is afraid and falls to his knees and says ''You found my weakness, it's small knives'' and then shoots the web on the thief.<br/><br/>Emma Stone was also the perfect choice to play Gwen Stacy. Both Garfield and Stone had a very good chemistry throughout the film. Rhys Ifans and Denis Leary did a great job and gave life to their roles as Dr. Curtis Connors/The Lizard and Captain George Stacy. Martin Sheen and Sally Field were good choice of actors to play Uncle Ben and Aunt May, but I think Sheen was a better Uncle Ben, and Rosemary Harris (Raimi/Maguire trilogy) was a better Aunt May. And finally Chris Zylka who played Flash Thompson. I really missed Flash in the Raimi/Maguire trilogy. After all, I was really surprised that Zylka had a bigger role than Joe Manganiello.<br/><br/>James Horner has delivered yet another fantastic film soundtrack and has given life to every scene in the film. Mark Webb, who directed the film has done a very good job and I really hope that he comes back to direct the next films of this trilogy.<br/><br/>The film is perhaps a little too fast in some parts, but otherwise it keeps what it has promised. This film shows that Peter Parker does not have full control over his powers. He has a web shooter and must learn to shoot correctly to swing around New York City. The film is packed with action, love, comedy and excitement and I guess that all of Spider-Man fans will love this film. This is perhaps a movie with a story that has already been told, but it is well told!<br/><br/>Strongly recommended!"
"zzoaozz","6","4","8","12 July 2012"," Nowhere near as good as the last trilogy
","While not bad, this version was nowhere near as good as the Raimi take on Spiderman. Here's why, in my humble opinion. <br/><br/>1) Peter Parker is supposed to be a goody two shoes at home and a nerd at school. That's part of the legend. Tobey Macguire hit it spot on. The new Parker comes across as moody, whiny, and a little selfish. He doesn't respect his Aunt and Uncle the way he should and he is irresponsible more often than the one time he fails to do the right thing and costs his uncle his life. <br/><br/>2) Speaking of Uncle Ben, his death scene in the the new one has almost no emotional impact at all for the audience. It is just not shot well. <br/><br/>3) There is very little romantic spark between Gwen Stacey and Peter Parker. It just isn't there. In the Raimi films the emotions between Peter and Mary Jane Watson were a potent part of the story.<br/><br/>4) Batman is the one driven by obsession over his dead parents, not Spidey. He was raised in a warm loving household by parental figures who helped him get over it and grow up relatively well balanced. Leave the angsty back story and Freudian neurosis to the Bat, he is unhinged enough for both comic universes. <br/><br/>5) The visual effects were far less impressive than in the previous films. There were way too many night shots that hid the acrobatics. The reptile monster looked kind of Barnyish compared to Sandman or Doc Octopus. Even Spiderman's costume looked less impressive. <br/><br/>This film just comes up short compared to the old one."
"marzblackmann","6","4","8","11 July 2012"," Wasn't that amazing
","*This review MAY contain spoilers* OK,now that we got that out of the way(because I don't want to anger the ""gods""lol).<br/><br/>So, I saw this film over the weekend with a good friend and I must say,as a spider-man fan, I was kinda disappointed. Don't get me wrong. It's OK. I really did enjoy Garfield's interpretation of the noble Peter Parker. He got the whole geeky nerd thing down cold. I loved Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy too.She and Garfield,in my opinion,had GREAT on screen chemistry. I really wished that they could've developed that a little more in the film.The talented Sally fields(Aunt May)and the consistent Martin Sheen(Uncle Ben)were very cool and likable.Denis Leary(capt.Stacy)was I think,spot on for his character as was Ifans(doc Connors/the lizard). The cast worked with what the had script-wise.WHICH WAS THE WEAKEST LINK of the movie. I'm sorry,whomever wrote this,were they not educated in the lore that IS spider-man? Granted,they've got Spidey's wit and humor down,which I loved and wished that Raimi's version would've done more. However,I think they missed out on what makes spider-man one of the coolest creation in the comics. When uncle Ben doesn't say the immortal lines to Peter,""With Great Power,Comes great responsibility"". IT'S like WHAT IN THE HELL?!! Those words become Peter's CROSS to bare that he'd wear FOREVER around his neck.It's his MOTIVATION. The guilt that he he'd carry in his heart of knowing that if would've stopped that robber when he had the chance,his uncle still would be ALIVE today.sheesh. The visuals of the film were GREAT though. I was impressed,better than the 2002's. I did enjoy the kinda darker feel too the film,but I think that too much time was wasted with peter trying to resolve his abandonment issues with his parents.It just made the film,DRAAAAAAAG. Message to Sony execs:If you do decide to do a sequel,which mostly likely will happen, Keep Marc Webb as the director. He's good. Just PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE,a better tighter script.Don't dumb it down. Finally,show some respect for us fans. I know you have a vision,but try to keep the origins,for the most part unchanged,please?<br/><br/>OK, so, go see the film,but matinée prices. I think,though the 3D(I saw 2D)may be pretty cool with all the webslinging going on."
"reedcom","5","4","8","7 July 2012"," Made me appreciate the previous version
","While this Spider-Man reboot is certainly more enjoyable than most movies, the previous version was better. The writers went out of their way to change all the little details from the previous version, but kept much of the same major plot points the same.<br/><br/>This version's morality points, catch phrases, romance and emotional moments just weren't as well done. And there was almost no comedy. There were no major plot holes, but there were multiple small ones that bugged me. On the other hand, the acting was excellent, by all the actors, and the awkward teenager aspect was well done.<br/><br/>But on the whole I prefer the previous version."
"kgmarra","9","4","8","6 July 2012"," Fantastic and still realistic
","Men in tights still draw people in. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone star in the newest Marvel film, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"". Peter Parker (Garfield) is a nerdy, awkward teenager whose parents disappeared when he was ten years old. He now lives with his aunt (Sally Field) and uncle (Martin Sheen). When rummaging through an area of his basement, Peter finds his father's briefcase, which holds a clue that will open the door to unlimited scientific possibilities.<br/><br/>This clue leads him to Dr. Curt Connors, a scientist at Oscorp who used to work with Peter's father. Gwen Stacy (Stone), one of Peter's schoolmates, happens to work at Oscorp as well. While snooping through Connors' lab, Peter is bitten by a radioactive spider that brings him supernatural powers, which he decides to use for good. He creates a suit for himself and claims the name, Spider-Man.<br/><br/>Being that this film is another Marvel superhero film, I was expecting to see aliens or portals to other worlds. However, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" stays on a realistic level by presenting the scientific descriptions of Spider-Man's powers and the creation of The Lizard. Of course, you have to use your imagination for some aspects, but you have to remember that this was originally a comic book.<br/><br/>One of the few complaints about this movie is the fact that the first ""Spider-Man"" was released just ten years ago. Many believe that remaking the series is unnecessary. To respond to that, I say that most of the people who are watching ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" are not the people who watched the first series. I was seven years old in 2002 and I didn't know the Spider-Man series even existed.<br/><br/>""The Amazing Spider-Man"" greatly impressed me. My eyes were glued to the screen and I didn't want it to end. I give this movie a 9 out of 10."
"adama310","8","4","8","6 July 2012"," Incredible!! Can't Wait for more !!
","I'm extremely surprised that I am seeing so many awful reviews on this site and I really needed to created an account JUST so I can add my opinion to this review and hopefully be more of help.<br/><br/>PLEASE NOTE: The Original Spider-Man movie (2002) has an IMDb rating of 7.4 and Spider-Man 2 has an IMDb rating of 7.5 and Spider-Man 3 has a 6.3 ... So far The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) has a 7.8 rating ... so anyone who says the ratings are lower than the originals shame on you! So, With that said ... <br/><br/>WARNING: This MAY contain Spoilers!! You've BEEN WARNED!!... <br/><br/>First and foremost let me state that the cast and crew really did a fantastic job bringing these characters to life. Andrew Garfield is a much better Peter Parker than Toby ever was, and I realize that now. Though I did enjoy the 1st and 2nd Spider-Man movies by Sam R. I will say that after watching this current rendition and actually looking back at the originals I was actually more bored with the Originals!! Everything looked and felt dated from the fighting, to the CGI, to the stale acting... Seriously Toby made Peter Parker look like a pale, cry baby, that always got weak in the knees about MJ, and Kirsten D. was NOT a very good MJ, a lot of the acting in those movies felt flat. However THIS cast really soars and the two incredible up and coming actors Garfield and Stone really really shine and their chemistry is FAR superior to anything Peter and MJ had in the Raimi movies. <br/><br/>As for the Plot: SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING IT'S THE SAME MOVIE AS THE FIRST!??? ... This is REALLY not the case at all!!... Raimi's Spider-man took peter from 30 minutes of being in high school to the rest of the movie living in Manhattan and working for the daily bugle and attending college ... NONE OF THIS IS IN ""THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN""... This origin centers entirely with Peter living with his Aunt and Uncle and attending high school, he is a teenager, and he does not work for the Bugle. Also, though there are similar plot points (I counted anywhere between 4-5 similarities) everything was done with a twist, and even the dialogue was very different. When I expected the whole ""With great power comes great responsibility line"" I was pleasantly surprised that Uncle Ben never says that to this Peter, and says it in his own way that sounds less cheesy in my opinion and something that our own relatives would say to us while growing up and running into hard times. Even the way Uncle Ben dies is completely different (but the similarity does lie in the fact that Peter let's a thief go). And the set pieces are different as well (except for the bridge seen which IS in the original but then again like I said it plays out differently and I thought of it more as paying tribute to the original rather than trying to out shine it). <br/><br/>And there are also little nods to the comics in the way Spidey's costume: he has mechanical web-shooters which is how it was originally intended in the comics, there is even a scene that shows Spidey in the sewer drain and trying to use the webs but it fails, which hints at the fact that Spider-man's weakness is being in WATER! And the way peter gets bitten by the spider is different as well and the circumstances surrounding it is completely different (hint: it's not a field trip). Basically, when this movie wanted to be similar it did it but with a twist, and when it wanted to be different it found ways of being different and telling a new story. (Comic books do this ALL the time, there are hundreds of re-tellings in the comic book world!)<br/><br/>In addition, the villain is different, Gwen Stacey (Peter's first love NOT MJ) is here and they shine together (they react to one another like real teenagers do and I kind of got sent back to my youngin' days lol), the action is more fun and engaging (the IMAX 3D was incredible for this movie), and Spidey's smart-mouth-charm and finesse really comes out through Garfield's performance. The CGI is great too and is much more modern and fresh. I've heard complaints that the CGI is not very realistic and I was left dumbfounded at how someone could really think much of ANY CGI IS realistic!! The only quality CGI I've ever seen was in either the Lord of the Rings or Rise of the Planet of the Apes! And those movies were done by complete motion capture experts (Academy renowned too). And, comparing this movie to The Avengers is a bad call because The Avengers was an action explosion with superheroes that had their own movies and character developments before being thrown together (and by the way that CGI wasn't convincing either yet that movie is a hit anyway I digress). <br/><br/>Look the point is, this movie is incredible, it is fresh, it is NOT the same as the first spider-man movie! It is more true to the comics than that movie was. With the great attention to character development, the charm, the emotion, and the fun that is portrayed I walked out of the theater wanting more! No matter what I, nor any one else says, you owe it to yourself to watch this film and make your own judgment. <br/><br/>I really hope this review helps!!"
"darkslash7","6","4","8","5 July 2012"," Meh.
","I'm gonna spoil the ending. be careful.<br/><br/>It's a decent movie. It is somewhat hard to judge it alone, because I keep automatically comparing it to the Sam Raimi series. It doesn't follow the comics a lot, but it's understandable. They wanted to be original, so it's fine. This movie is really funny. Way funnier than the previous movies, but the action wasn't as cool. It was predictable, but hey, aren't all superhero movies?<br/><br/>Now the ending was the worst. Captain Stacy makes Peter promise not to see Gwen anymore, for her safety. It's his dying wish, so Peter agrees, and the movie kinda has a sad tone for the next few minutes, but it was well done. Then, at the very end, Peter basically says he's going to break his promise, and then they smile, and it completely ruins the drama that there was after the final fight. It's stupid. If they had waited till the sequel (I'm guessing there will be one in a few years) to show it, it would not have been so bad. <br/><br/>Another problem ( and this is really just my opinion) is that it's not as good of a storyline when there are so many people who know who he is. It's not as exciting. Plus, the movie focused too much on Peter and Gwen, instead of Spider-man. I also found it dumb and cliché that they fell in love in like three days.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a good flick, but it could have been a lot better."
"joseg3192","6","4","8","5 July 2012"," I wanted to like this movie.
","This review will definitely contain spoilers. I have been a big Spider- man fan for as long as I can remember. You can only imagine what it was like for me as a 10 year old kid to watch Spider-man on the big screen. To me the movie was perfect, and now as a 20 year old I get to watch a reboot to one of my favorite comic book heroes. <br/><br/>This reboot of the comic book hero is awfully flawed to me. Now maybe it's because I've gotten really picky with the movies that I watch these days, and maybe that ""high"" from watching the Sam Rami Spider-man has carried over all these years and hasn't allowed me to watch the movie with a truly analytic lens; but I think that the movie has no real characters, only cut out posters for human characters. Firstly, the romance between Peter and Gwen is not well developed, I felt that their romance consisted of mostly sarcastic conversations and of awkward moments. They never had a true human to human moment, like in the Sam Rami, the romance mostly consisted between Spider-man and Mary Jane but Peter was trying to build the relationship with Mary Jane. Peter was funny, but he gave her advice, he comforts her when she feels insecure, and pours his heart out for her. In the reboot, Gwen and Peter meet for what appears to be two days or something, Peter gets bitten and becomes sort of mysterious, then in a Twilight like fashion Gwen falls head over heels for him because he is dark and mysterious and all of a sudden she's at a lost of words when she speaks to him. And then Peter tells this girl, who he's just gotten to know, that he is Spider-man. <br/><br/>The other thing I want to tackle is why he becomes Spider-man. So we all know the origins, that Peter uses his powers irresponsibly which causes his uncle's death, which leads him to wise up about using his powers to stop criminals. This movie has an extra layer which is his parents death/disappearance, which has really weighed on Peter's mind throughout his life. Then his uncle dies, he's angry for a while but discovers he has spider powers and goes to look for the killer (for about 10 minutes of screen time) in a subplot that is never fully resolved. Come on, I would of thought that the death of his uncle would of had a deep psychological impact on him, that he would have nightmares, or he would be angry because he is the direct cause of his uncle's death, some sort of internal conflict, something. But no, the movie forgets that subplot or that Peter is a human being and goes into the main conflict which is the battle with the lizard. <br/><br/>The whole Peter's parents subplot is another thing not fully resolved. The post credit scene felt like a really cheap way of solving the plot by prolonging it, it's as if the director saw a rough cut and said ""I forgot about Peter's parents"" then at the last second called in Rhys Ifans to do a 2 minute scene to cover his tracks. I've never scene a post credit scene (which has become synonymous with all marvel movies) where they attempt to solve a problem that could of been solved in the movie, they're usually there just to hint at where the sequel will be heading. <br/><br/>Another thing that irritated me was how Peter discovers his powers. It's done in a montage style that feels like it belongs in a music video not in a movie. It's him sort of experimenting with his skateboard in a warehouse or dock. In the Sam Rami version, there was a real revelation to it, a little bit of tension that went with each step he took towards discovering his new found abilities. In this one, they just throw the powers at us, no suspense, nothing, just cool skateboard tricks, him dunking a basketball and comically breaking everything because he's become super strong. <br/><br/>There are a lot of mishaps in logic which I won't get into in this review, it's really small things that sort of forget how the real world works. But these four things were the biggest problems, I could go deeper but I don't want to extend this already long rant. All of that being said, my 10 and 11 year old brothers as well as my 9 and 10 year old cousins really enjoyed the movie. They couldn't stop talking about it, so did the other kids around the theaters. I explained my issues with the movie to them, but they seemed to have no real response to it. My uncle (he's in his late 20s) came along and didn't enjoy the movie and we both concluded that the movie was for kids. So as a kids movie, it succeeds, but as a movie for adults you might be mixed. Again I wanted to like this movie but it failed to deliver."
"DUKEJBM","Null","4","8","4 July 2012"," Not Bad but a VERY Average Film
","I did my best to judge this film on its own merits and NOT based on anything that has come before or how I feel it would measure up to the past trilogy. Based on what hit the screen, this is one very mediocre effort. Yes, it has its moments and the groundwork has been laid for the possibility of better things to come but this origin film is as unremarkable as it gets. It's not bad but it's just not memorable or superb in any way. I do believe the story would have been far better had they skipped the actual origin altogether. I found it strange that the first act dragged yet no one was really fleshed out or developed. What's the point then? If you're going to try and gain emotional attachment to Ben and May then have them do SOMETHING or impart some wisdom. As a fan, I find it criminal that they didn't even use the famous ""With great power comes great responsibility"" line. The villain is one dimensional and there's not one action sequence that stands out. I even hated the forced ham-fisted sequences towards the end with the construction workers and police officers. On the positive side, Garfield was good and Emma Stone was great in the lead roles. They made you care about both characters enough to save the movie. As stated, maybe they can take off from here but I doubt there's any large percentage of people that leaves the theatre after watching this one that's very impressed or that can't wait to see what's next. Interest? Maybe but there's not much to be passionate about unless the viewer is a HUGE Emma Stone or Garfield fan.<br/><br/>Having said that and watching the movie as fairly as I could. NOW I can make the comparisons and frankly, this movie falls short of all three of Raimi's efforts.<br/><br/>Yes, even Spider-Man 3 is the better all around film. I've always said that SM3 is an overcrowded film but it certainly has its moments. Besides far better action sequences, SM3 has more emotional impact and truly stand out moments. Sure, it also has ""stub your toe"" moments but the good outweighs the bad. Amazing Spider-Man has many monotone moments with a bit of heart sprinkled in. Nothing seems deep or really hits home. Even Uncle Ben's demise falls terribly flat and it's almost glossed over. SM3 swung for the fences and served up some tasty treats and some sours ones as well. This movie feels phoned in and serves up vanilla everything."
"GlobalRanger","10","4","8","3 July 2012"," A sublime superhero film with its heart in the right place!
","The new Spider-Man is truly amazing! One would ideally give the verdict in the latter half of the review, but I'd rather say it right at the beginning.<br/><br/>What a great year it is turning out to be for fans of superhero franchises! First we had 'The Avengers', now we get 'The Amazing Spider- Man' and July 20 shall see the final chapter of Chris Nolan's Batman ""rise""!<br/><br/>A reboot and prequel of sorts, it is inevitable that most of us compare Mark Webb's Spider-Man to the previous Spider-Man trilogy directed by Sam Raimi, starring Tobery Maguire and Kirsten Dunst. Is it as good as Raimi's 'Spider-Man' which came out about 10 years back in 2002? How similar, different or better is it?<br/><br/>The basic plot of Webb's reboot stays the same so don't go expecting major novelty in the first half.<br/><br/>A young Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) finds himself lonely and attracted to classmate Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). His friends bully him while as caretakers; aunt and uncle expect him to be more responsible. Amidst all this, a spider bits him, turning Peter Parker into Spider- Man, a helpful vigilante.<br/><br/>Webb however modifies Peter's character traits and makes him more interesting, intriguing, even a tad immature. He has no qualms in declaring that he is not morally obligated or responsible to make everyone happy. Unlike Maguire, Garfield is not saintly, shy, conscious or extreme nerdy before or after he dons his spidey outfit. He makes mistakes, loses his cool, exploits his super powers, speaks his heart out, prefers being aloof. He even lets Gwen know right from the beginning that he fancies her...so no 'good friends' drama there fortunately.<br/><br/>Webb also makes his love interest more appealing and less annoying. Unlike Mary Jane, Gwen is not a spineless damsel in distress. She is not an indecisive emotional fool either. She reads Peter's mind and knows what she needs to do. She even fights, risks her life to save Peter. The biggest highlight of the film is the sizzling chemistry between Garfield and Emma. The real life couple looks great together on screen too. Their love story makes you smile. Their terrace kiss is as special as the upside down kiss in Spider-Man (2002). Garfield shoots his web on Emma, pulls her towards him, grabs her in his arms and leans in for a kiss... iconic indeed.<br/><br/>As far as the bad guys are concerned, Rhys Ifans plays Dr Connors who becomes a huge dinosaur like lizard, thus a huge threat to Spider-Man. He is not entirely a villain though. Even with limited screen time, Emma Stone is very charming & impressive as Peter's love interest. Irrfan Khan has just about two scenes, but he does get noticed & is likely to return for the sequel. <br/><br/>The special effects, cinematography, stunts are mind-blowing. The very first scene where Peter starts discovering his newly found powers on a moving train is superbly shot. The action in the school fight & climax is incredible too. As for Spidey's trademark web-swinging, this has easily the BEST web-swinging sequences ever conceived, take my word for that. And if you are watching this in 3D, Imax viewing would be awesome. Even as Spider-Man shoots his web in the air, you will literally dodge to avoid being his target! The 3D is not gimmicky & is used mainly in the action sequences.<br/><br/>Last and not the least, Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man is supremely charming. With his expressive face & body language, he looks the part both as Peter Parker & Spiderman. He makes us forget that Tobey Maguire played the same character in 3 successful films before! He executes his role differently with no resemblance to Tobey. He is rebellious, vulnerable, romantic, amateur (he works on his web powers as they don't come naturally to him), practices before becoming a pro at flying and falling from skyscrapers. He even googles his unforgiving spandex outfit before zeroing in on one.<br/><br/>If you are a true Spiderman fan, you would be glad to welcome him back in the new avatar. This is the second best Spiderman film, after Spiderman 2. Its easily better than the first & third Spiderman films helmed by Sam Raimi.<br/><br/>Verdict: Simply amazing - 8.5/10!"

","Marvel Comics' heroes transfer well to the silver screen, but those who think they know Spider-Man from previous incarnations will meet a different Spider-Man/Peter Parker in Columbia Pictures' current release The Amazing Spider-Man. "" it is a completely different film that starts at the beginning of Spider-Man's journey,"" says KIDS FIRST! youth film critic Raven Devanney, age 15, in her review (below). Well, maybe not completely different, as the familiar events set the story in motion. But it is a new villain and a new love interest. And there is plenty of humor. ""In fact, this whole film is filled with comedy and action,"" says Raven.<br/><br/>KIDS FIRST! youth film critics were also there at the exciting red carpet event on Saturday. Be sure to check out the KIDS FIRST! website to share their experience on video.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man Reviewed by Raven Devanney (See her full review on video.) http://www.youtube.com/watch? v=wqKg50yEwUM<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man starring Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone definitely lives up to its title because it is truly amazing. I was expecting this film to be an add-on to the most recent Spider-Man series, but it is a completely different film that starts at the beginning of Spider-Man's journey. Of course, Peter Parker (played by Andrew Garfield) is bitten by a genetically modified spider and transforms into Spider-Man, his uncle Ben dies, and that's all the same in the past films about this spandex-sporting hero, but instead of falling for his typical love interest, MJ, Peter falls for Gwen Stacy (played by Emma Stone). And there is no Green Goblin in this film, but instead a new villain for Spider-Man to face.<br/><br/>I love this movie! The special effects are phenomenal, especially in 3- D. I love Andrew Garfield in the part of Peter Parker because he does a fantastic job portraying him and he and Emma Stone have such great chemistry, which really shows in their characters. My favorite scene is when Peter is transforming into Spider-Man, because his aunt and uncle have no idea what's wrong with him and it's so funny. In fact, this whole film is filled with comedy and action. My favorite character would have to be Gwen Stacy played by Emma Stone because I really admire her and she does a wonderful job playing this role.<br/><br/>I think something very different about this film is it seems that the target audience is just teens, whereas in past Spider-Man movies the main audience is teens and adults. Overall, I give The Amazing Spider- Man 5 out of 5 stars because it is amazing and I want to see it over and over again. I can't wait for the sequel to come out. Go catch it in a theater near you!<br/><br/>Catch Anthony Aranda's (age 10) review of The Amazing Spider-man here: http://www.youtube.com/my_videos?sq=spider-man."
"draconea2007","6","6","14","11 July 2012"," Entertaining, but not the best
","Because of all the recent super hero movies and because the last Spiderman was only a few years ago, everyone's gonna compare them with all the videos & super hero movies they've watched in the past.<br/><br/>This version excels in a couple of ways to the Spidey's of the past, but fails in too many ways to be as good as past efforts. The web slinging and references to the Marvel comic's art work was excellent, far better then any past Spiderman films, and the fight scenes in a couple of instances were better choreographed in the closer shots.<br/><br/>But, the story was not as well written as either of the first two Raimi films, the character development was rushed, the editing was almost as bad as Spiderman 3 with missing pieces that jolted the eye and made the mind wonder. In other words, the CGI was excellent but the attention to detail of the real shots were poorly thought out. Example: Peter passes the doctor a coffee with his hand over the rim and in the next shot Parker's fingers are through the handle. Sloppy camera work happened like that thruout the film.<br/><br/>All in all it was entertaining and fairly well done, yet not a classic, nothing really new here. I'm sure it'll do well, the actors were good, and I look forward to seeing them try it again in the sequels. One thing I did miss though and that was Stan Lee's cameo."
"Boba_Fett1138","6","6","14","11 July 2012"," Sorry to say but this movie left me mostly cold.
","First of all, it was of course totally unnecessary to reboot the series again already. They might as well could had simply made this movie as a ""Spider-Man 4"", that way we wouldn't had to sit to another origin story, that besides isn't getting told as a very good or interesting one.<br/><br/>And that is the foremost problem of the movie; I just couldn't really ever get into it. It didn't always had a very pleasant flow to it and things didn't always progressed and developed very natural. Things just happen and you have to take a lot of things simply for granted.<br/><br/>There were plenty of things that bothered me about its story and storytelling. I for instance never bought into the whole romance between Peter Paker and Gwen Stacy. I have no idea what made them fall in love and what made their love so powerful or unique. Like I said before, it just happens but there is never really any notable chemistry or anything about it that makes you root for their love or make you feel and believe that these two persons belong together.<br/><br/>The movie also does quite a poor job with all of the character's motivations. There is no good reason for Peter Parker to develop and put on a suit and swing through the city, trying to catch criminals. There also really wasn't a good enough reason for Dr. Curt Connors to turn into a super-villain and there was even less reason for him and Spider-Man to become enemies. With this I mean that their story lines aren't really interconnected good enough with each other and Spider-Man so easily could had decided not to get involved and not to get his life at risk, since it wasn't like he was being an established superhero in the city already, who everybody relied on. Another reason why this movie would had been simply better, had it been done as a ""Spider-Man 4"", instead of as a fresh start to the movie series again.<br/><br/>It's a shame this movie failed to make any emotional impact on me since this obviously was the approach the film-makers were going for. A more personal and dramatic Spider-Man but the movie just really didn't had the right script for that. Even the whole uncle Ben storyline totally left me cold this time and so did the relationship between Peter Parker and aunt May, which always is an important aspect about the Spider-Man franchise, in my opinion.<br/><br/>And for goodness sake, stop recycling your own music so much, James Horner!<br/><br/>It of course remains a far from bad movie but there is nothing about it that stands out or make this a memorable or unique movie within its genre. It does absolutely nothing new but it of course does still provide some entertainment. I still did wish there was some more action in it at times though. But Peter Parker doesn't really become Spider-Man until halfway through and Dr. Curt Connors becomes the Lizard even much later on in the movie. It therefore takes a while for the action to truly kick in but when it does, it's all quite and fun to watch but overall the movie remains underwhelming, in about every way imaginable.<br/><br/>Also can't say that I was very fond of the casting. Andrew Garfield never gave me either a Peter Parker or Spider-Man vibe. He feels miscast in my opinion and I definitely won't mind at all if he gets replaced with another actors for the next movie. As a matter of fact, I doubt I will even notice it, since he's so incredibly unremarkable in his role and I doubt I will recognize him on street, even now, when I have just finished watching this movie. He isn't being very likable or charismatic enough in his role.<br/><br/>It really doesn't do or bring anything fresh, original or great to the series. Weak as a reboot and very mediocre as just another modern superhero movie.<br/><br/>6/10 <br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

"aesgaard41","3","5","11","30 January 2013"," Amazing Chemistry - Lousy Superheroics
","You just can't review this movie without comparing it the to Tobey McGuire-Sam Raimi trilogy that gave birth to it. Sam Raimi already created the special effects and style that helped make Spiderman a movie character so it wasn't that hard for someone else to come in and slide on the work already done there. What I don't like about the new movie is that Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker is a young jerk. I really don't see Peter Parker stealing a security badge, sneaking into a secure scientific lab, antagonizing Flash Thompson, alienating his Uncle Ben nor mocking a car thief. If anything, Garfield's Spiderman like Christian Bale's Batman talks too much. The best part of the first movies was its believability, something that was sort of missing in the third movie and is definitely missing in this installment. (The scene with Peter discovering his superhuman strength is nothing but slapstick and looks out of place with the rest of the movie.) Now let's get to the new suit. It looks horrible!! I had a hard time accepting Tobey's Peter could create the costume he wore, and I have an even harder time accepting the new costume (much less that Garfield's Peter could even get the material!). It just looks horrible! In the dark, the red and blue colors run together and look purple. Even worse, Garfield looks horrible in it. The first bright version had a muscular body suit under it; the new version has nothing. About the only thing this movie has is better chemistry between its stars. I really had a hard time buying Kirsten Dunst as a high school kid, but Emma Stone really sparkles as Gwen Stacy and really blows the former ""Interview With a Vampire"" actress out of the water. That's basically where ""Amazing Spiderman"" (Spiderman 4?) works best. The story between Peter and Gwen takes center stage, but Rhys Ifan, possibly best known as Captain Hook from the Peter Pan prequel, works well too; his right arm is digitally removed with the same technology that removed Gary Sinise's legs in ""Forrest Gump."" The problem is the villain's story as the subplot takes up too much screen time. It was handled great in the first two movies, overdone in the third movie and extremely noticeable in this movie. It just takes too long getting into the plot. What bothers me most is the unnecessary reboot to Peter's origin. Do we really need to make Peter that much more tragic by over-emphasizing the reasons why he was left with Uncle Ben and Aunt May. I have nothing again Martin Sheen or Sally Field in the roles, in fact, they share just about the same amount of wonderful chemistry as Garfield and Stone, but there's too much exposition here to a movie where we already know who the characters are. I also can't stand the fact that the movie is a reboot; re-inventing his origin and chopping out whole chunks of it, and what's this thing about the mystery of his past? What mystery? He was left with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May. End of mystery. Bottom line: Amazing Spiderman is passable, but Sam Raimi with his familiarity to the subject already pulled it off, and we've seen it before. We've seen everything before. The only new thing is the chemistry between Garfield and Stone, but is that all it takes to make us believe this movie is superior to all the hard work Sam Raimi already did? The hard work was already done; this movie is just sliding forward on the momentum. Take this movie back in time to BEFORE Spider-Man 1 and then I'll say it outdoes the original, but then, that would make the original not so original, wouldn't it?"

","When i first heard 2 years ago that this movie is coming out, i was surprised as much i loved firs two Raimi's films i didn't like the third one in my opinion Spider-man 3 is BORING and it was sad to look at retarded Pete Parker. I was hoping for an fourth one but instead we got a reboot.<br/><br/>In my opinion first 20 minutes of this movie are batter then whole original trilogy.And main reason is because of Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield he is much batter SPIDER-MAN than its predecessor Tobey Maguire. And Emma Stone is batter than Kristien Dunst by far.<br/><br/>Three things i like about this movie are <br/><br/>1)UNTOLD STORY(Even it's not told but it will be in sequels)<br/><br/>2)CAST(ANDREW GARFIELD,EMMA STONE,MARTIN SHEEN and others)<br/><br/>3)VFX AND FIGHTS(Like Schools fight)<br/><br/>I didn't like about this movie is that its little bit like 500 days of summer so you can call this move 500 Days of Spider-man and i think that lizard character played by Rhys Ifans i missed out they didn't sowed this family and his story i hope that they'l do that in the sequel because Lizard is first Spider-man movie villain that didn't die so that's reason why i hope for him in sequels<br/><br/>Over all THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN is a brilliant masterpiece and it's one of rare movies worth watching in theater's so buy your tickets and go watch it before it's too late.Good job MARC WEBB ANDREW GARFIELD, EMMA STONE and other. 10/10!P.S Thanks for reading."
"thomas_tofft_williams","10","5","11","28 October 2012"," An excellent interpretation
","I've seen quite a few interpretations of Spiderman, which made me hesitate to watch another mainstream box office interpretation. Luckily, this one not only makes it up for the flawed plots and emotional immaturity in previous Spiderman movies, it beats any movie I have watched in the super hero comic genre at all, ""Batman begins"" included which has been my favorite title of this genre for quite some time. Only Watchmen seems to be a worthy competition, however this title sure surprised me in many ways.<br/><br/>I like to see myself as a spiritually mature person, and therefor I find it disgusting to see a movie spoiled with half-baked potatoes, like in Avatar ""You cannot fill a cup, which is already full"", one of the worst mainstream airy fairy quotes ever.<br/><br/>With that in mind, this movie will surprise you. The movie-wisdom is serious, deep and very much mature. The emotional plot also seem to follow with mature acting and realistic responses to the dramas projected during the movie spiced up with a comic relief at the right places. The feature plays with a very fine line between being a drama and an action movie, but it does it so well, that I never got bored, so obviously a thorough work of editing has been done here.<br/><br/>This makes this box office release the first of its kind to be recommended for the emotionally mature audience without compromising the playful action scenes. I am a fan of both, so I give this movie a 10 out of 10 for creating an outstanding piece of work worth watching over and over again."
"rus_ty","4","5","11","16 August 2012"," The Not So Amazing Spider Man
","As a long time fan of the Spider Man movies and comic books alike, I was eagerly awaiting to see this reboot. I had high hopes for the film as being a fan of Marc Webb's work also. I was sure that the film was in good hands. So as I sat in the cinema with my buddies waiting for the film to begin, I was expecting a reboot to show us more about Peter's parents and a better back story. <br/><br/>And boy, was I disappointed. <br/><br/>The Sam Raimi films had fantastic action, humour, heart and soul, which this film showed a great lack off. I can't even begin to explain how disappointed I was! What we get out of this movie is barely any action and A lot of romance, Parker constantly unmasking himself (I thought the whole point of Spider Mans secret identity was to, I don't know, KEEP IT A SECRET?) We had the Lizard, which had to be the most disappointing villain in super hero movie history, and the fact that it didn't follow much from the comic books at all. <br/><br/>The casting was alright enough, Emma Stone made a decent enough Gwen Stacey, and I hope that she will break into her character more in the sequels. Andrew Garfield didn't suit Spider Man at all. He didn't look nerdy like Toby Maguire did in the originals and I didn't really see him portray the character as he should have done. Plus, Peter Parker never used to skateboard, did he? No, I didn't think so. Sally Field as Aunt May didn't work at all, and Martin Sheen as Uncle Ben actually turned out okay... Even though he was in 3 scenes total... The trio of Toby, Kirsten and James made a better cast then this lot. Plus, the lack of Harry and J Jonah Jameson was defiantly missed.<br/><br/>Now, back when I mentioned that the Raimi trilogy had heart and soul, it was a shock to see that this film had very little of it. When Uncle Ben died in the 2002 movie, it was a really sad scene, because you actually cared about him, and it tugged our heart strings (or at least mine) to see Uncle Ben die. And that Peter showed genuine sadness and heart ache after Uncle Ben's death. With this, Uncle Ben is killed and it's sad for all about two minutes. Peter showed no sadness or emotion after his Uncles death, and the goodbye scene as Peter watches him die just seems awkward and the two didn't really connect all that well. <br/><br/>The Lizard however, seemed like a suitable villain to start this re- booted series of. The Lizard is an interesting character, and this movie could have handled it really well, except it didn't. The Lizard looked like a Godzilla rip off and there seemed to be no humanity in the character at all. Shouldn't it have shown a tormented Dr. Curt Conner's as he is going through these changes? And after the big fight at the end, the Lizards story is quickly wrapped up by a news report saying he was arrested. Now, in the end of every Sam Raimi Spider Man, there was humanity in each of the villains before they died/ or left. The Green Goblin showed his human side to Peter when they were both unmasked, right before his glider impaled him; Doc Ock showed that he still had goodness in him by sacrificing himself to save the city; and also, Sandman even had a moment with Peter that showed his still had goodness in him. The Lizard? Oh no, they just made him a ridiculous dinosaur for Spider Man to fight and defeat. <br/><br/>Also, why the hell did they make Gwen Stacey know Peter is Spider Man in this film? Gwen Stacey NEVER knew who Spider Man was in the comics, as she blamed Spider Man for the death of her father. With this movie they screwed all that up and made Gwen a more ballsy character than she should have been. And why were there so many spiders??? There was meant to be ONE special spider that bites Peter, not God knows how many that were shown. Plus, I'm pretty sure if you get shot in the leg you CANT keep running.<br/><br/>The only redeeming factor in this movie was Spider Man had a great sense of humour, and the web slinging scenes (beside the last one) were also well done. Not a fan of the new suit though. In summary, The Amazing Spider Man was a big disappointment. I'm still standing by the Raimi originals, and I hope that they make an improvement with The Amazing Spider Man 2."

","I loved every minute of this reboot, I was one of the few people actually glad Spider-Man was getting a reboot. I was not a big fan of the Sam Raimi movies in the first place and I can honestly say this movie surpasses all 3 of his films. <br/><br/>The film was slightly darker which made it all that much more entertaining, I couldn't get enough of the comedic scenes throughout the film and the acting was brilliant. Andrew Garfield showed what it takes to play the role of Peter Parker, to me he felt like he actually was Peter Parker, much better to Tobi Mcguire - Garfield's acting was just superb from start to finish. Not to mention the lovable Emma Stone, I couldn't get enough of her; her acting was also terrific and played the part of Gwen Stacy perfectly. <br/><br/>Overall the film was outstandingly amazing and I can't wait to see it. again"

","Okay, I've read all of the old comics. Watched all of the old movies, i liked Tobey McGuire's performance as Spidey but THIS Spiderman did something special: it made him a teenager.<br/><br/>Tobey's Spider-man was great, but he lacked that spirit that Peter had. Sure he was nerdy and acted like it but he wasn't a teenager. Anndrew Garfield is the definitive Peter Parker and Spidey. When Tobey first gets bitten by the radioactive spider, he seems to already know that he needs to be responsible and doesn't really learn anything. With Garfield he shows that even if he does have powers he is STILL a teenager and abuses his power and is trying to rid himself of the guilt and sadness of losing Uncle Ben and his parents. He's flawless, because he shows that human childish side that McGuire never had because that interpretation was a bit different and he was a little old.<br/><br/>Emma Watson as Gwen Stacy is PERFECT. She embodies her so well and the relationship she has with Peter is so sweet and beautiful and i bought it. It's not that i didn't like Mary Jane but i always preferred Gwen because she never whined and always stood by Peter even at his worst, but that's just my opinion.<br/><br/>Conner is great, he really captures how he didn't want to be the Lizard, *SPOILERS* at least at the end of the movie. <br/><br/>In short The Amazing Spider-man just pulled a Batman Begins and embodied everything that Spider-man is supposed to be, this brilliant."

"Toxicwasteland","9","5","11","4 July 2012"," Spider-Man has become a hero in his own right
","Finally, Spider-Man has become a hero in his own right. What originally set Spidey apart from the rest of the superheroes was the fact that he was different. Marc Webb did this perfectly. He made him what he was meant to be, a teenager with powers who has real life issues. It's nice to see that someone understands the concepts and feel of what the comics represented. Sam Raimi tried to mimic Superman. Sometimes I even wondered if Sam Raimi had even read the comic books at all or whether he just flipped through it so he could see the pretty pictures.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield was a perfect Peter Parker in every respect. Peter Parker was always the awkward intelligent teenager. Despite the name the film draws mainly from the Ultimate Spider-Man series and in some cases almost having almost identical dialog. Obviously, there is also a lot from the Amazing Spider-Man comic as well. The chemistry between Gwen and Peter was real unlike in previous films where it was nothing but fake. ""Oh, I'm Mary Jane. I love you cause your Spider-Man. Love me too because I'm the ugliest model around."" And for the record I don't hate any of the previous films.<br/><br/>The emotion was so powerful in this film that even the girl sitting next me was crying and a girl crying over a superhero film is unheard of. The climax to this film was incredible. He actually moves like a spider unlike in previous films. His whole ""learning to use his powers"" thing was very realistic. In Spider-Man he just knew how to use them.<br/><br/>Now let's go through the stuff that wasn't so good. Pacing was all over the place but not a big deal because it doesn't really take anything away from the film. The Lizard was slightly underused and more of a kick a round villain. ASM is way more loyal to the source material than Sam Raimi's ever was. It's like Stormsink (Youtube Reviewer) said Sam Raimi should go see this film with a notepad and take some notes because this is how you make a Spider-Man film."

","The old spider-man movie is totally concentrated on children's.This much more involved the adult audience also. The film is little bit slow,but capture speed in the second half.Andrew Garfield is perfect for this role Emma Stone looks hot. 3D effect in the movie are great. Story is much more same as of old only there are some changes.<br/><br/>With the recent Hollywood movie collections at Box Office,The Amazing Spider-Man will also get really good collection. Indeed, the same can be said of the film as a whole, reassembling the familiar elements of Spider man's origin story into a refreshing blend of action and emotion. Working off the template of Raimi's original and inspired by recent character-driven superhero movies, Webb delivers an emotionally thrilling and adrenaline-pumping blockbuster that counts amongst one of the best Marvel page-to-screen adaptations. so,thumbs UP for The Amazing Spider-Man."
"jaychou_21","7","5","11","29 June 2012"," It's like watching the first Spider-Man movie all over again, only this time with better lead actors but a less substantial storyline
","Warning: this is not a superhero movie.<br/><br/>Okay, I kid.<br/><br/>There's a modicum of truth to it though, as ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is not the superhero movie you wished it would be.<br/><br/>This is the fourth film that portrays Peter Parker and his alter-ego on the big screen and is a reboot of the Sam Raimi film series with Andrew Garfield replacing Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man.<br/><br/>Fans of the original series were dissonant upon learning of Andrew Garfield's selection as the new Spider-Man, with some saying he's too skinny, or he looks too meek, and all that blah. Well guess what? Andrew Garfield made the character his own. He delivered the goods with his acting chops and boyish charm. Sure, he did not look as good as Tobey Maguire in his spandex suit, but his physical and emotional embodiment of the protagonist was more than enough to make up for a rather so-so physique.<br/><br/>Likewise, Emma Stone used her all-American girl good looks and personality to give life to Gwen Stacy (previously played by the equally stunning Bryce Dallas Howard). Stone has the makings of a quintessential leading lady she could have given Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane a run for her money.<br/><br/>On the downside, the most palpable shortcoming of the film is its superficiality. It's entertaining, yes, but there is hardly any depth to it. The plot is a lot more predictable than expected, and the characters are not well-defined, Dr. Curt Connors in particular.<br/><br/>Given the groundwork of the first 3 films, I was sure that the script of this new series' first offering could be better. Alas, I was wrong. It comes as a surprise to me, knowing that Marc Webb did such a fantastic job when he directed ""(500) Days of Summer"" starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel. Where he triumphed in the former, he failed in the latter. What's good though, is that Webb nailed the action on this one.<br/><br/>Shooting from a subjective point of view proved to be very effective as it gives you the feeling of flying with the main character. You can almost experience that sense of velocity when Spider-Man swings through the streets, as if you've just been rescued by him. I bet it would be even more thrilling when seen in 3D (too bad three-dimensional graphics make me nauseous). If I may add, the visual effects, sound mixing and sound editing are outstanding, too.<br/><br/>Now If you were to ask me which one is better, I'd still go with the original. Sam Raimi did a terrific job with the first franchise and remained loyal to the comic books. Nevertheless, you'd have to give props to this movie for trying to identify itself as a reboot, not a remake. It's pretty much a repackage of what we've already seen and what we have always known about our favorite web-spinning hero, so where's the untold story here? It's obvious that the studios are still trying to cash in from the millions of moviegoers who can't get enough of Spider-Man. Whatever the producers are up to – and I'm pretty damn sure that they're cooking up a sequel – it better be good.<br/><br/>P.S. <br/><br/>To those who intend to watch the movie, here's a tip: If you have seen other films based from Marvel Comics characters, you should know better than to leave the cinema as soon as the credits started to roll."

","The Amazing Spider-Man towers over the Sam Raimi trilogy. You can people can get mad all you want but this movie is the closest thing to a real Spider-Man that we have ever gotten. Andrew Garfield IS Spider-Man. Both of suits from the first and second Amazing Spider-Man are both jaw dropping. Also, unlike Tobey Maguire and Tom Holland, Andrew Garfield is actually funny and sarcastic. Maguire and Holland aren't bad actors by any means but they just didn't fit the persona of Spider-Man anywhere near as good as Garfield did. Not only was Garfield a great Spider-Man but he was also a great Peter Parker. Garfield's take on Peter showed us what a true 21st Century version of Peter Parker would be like. Tobey and Tom's portrayal just felt too forced and not relatable at all. My only problem with The Amazing Spider-Man was that I felt that the origin story was too short. The origin isn't bad but it could've been better. As of 2018, The Amazing Spider-Man is BY FAR the best Spider-Man movie we have ever had. It's so sad and annoying when you have Sam Raimi Fanboys trying to convince people that this movie is awful, when it's actually a misunderstood movie. Sam Raimi fanboys only know what they grew up with and refuse to adapt to anything else."

"powermandan","1","2","3","19 October 2014"," Couldn't Help Comparing this to The Original Trilogy.
","Spiderman 1 and 2 were masterpieces. Spiderman 3 in 2007 caught a bad rap because it was much inferior to the previous ones. So they rebooted the series. Thing is, they did it way too soon: 5 years after the finishing if the original. Everything would have been so much better is they waited longer. But noooo! I watched this with an unbiased conscience and did not expect it to be as good as the original. Many times whenever I have low expectations, I am proved wrong. Not with this.<br/><br/>Let me start off with the story. Peter Parker is left in the care of his aunt and uncle some time before his parents die. Years later, as an emotionally scarred teen, Peter finds some answers about his parents that change him forever. The only thing good about this is giving a backstory to Peter and his parents. Nothing on Peter's childhood involving his parents were mentioned in 2002's. Props there. Plus there is lots of science involved, so any science nerds would love that aspect. I hate science, but thought it made great filming. In general the story has a good pace, but it is so unoriginal. A teen trying to find his place in the world has been done so many times with this not being any different. Then there is the love story between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacey. Sure the chemistry between them was better than original movies, but this is so unoriginal and boring. Peter gets the girl after the first try and it turns into cheesy Channing Tatum/Patrick Swayze love fest that makes you reach for a barf bag.<br/><br/>Now let's talk about characters. Martin Sheen wasn't a bad Uncle Ben, but his death scene was hilarious and forgettable. Sally Field sucked and Aunt May. The ones that played them in the original were much better and the relationship between them and Peter were much, much stronger. Flash was not a good bully. Curt Connors (acting wise ) was good, but was a crappy villain. James Franco, whom I thought was the worst villain in the previous was better than Connors. Gwen Stacey was likable, but unoriginal. Her father was likable, but unoriginal. Peter was likable, but inferior to Tobey's. Andrew Garfield does not do a good job of playing a meek, timid, geeky teenager. Tobey owns that portion. Garfield just looks like a One Direction dude with glasses and a skateboard. People say Garfield was wittier and did more wisecracks like in the comic. Tobey did wisecracks too, but Garfields are too long and unfunny. Busting the car thief was extremely dumb. Tobey would have done one line and kicked his ass. After becoming Spiderman, Garfield doesn't really change, staying a confused, sad teen with no goal in life, except finding his parents' history. That makes him one-dimensional. Tobey goes from being a total geek to a sophisticated gentleman. Tobey outacts and outdoes Garfield in every was. Tobey also gained lots of muscle and easily could have whooped Garfield's skinny ass.<br/><br/>Lastly the movie itself. Spidey's suit looked sick. Better than Tobey's? Maybe. Science thing superior to the oldies? Yes. Uncle Ben's death? Hilarious, and all because Peter couldn't get a bootle of milk he could not afford. Peter's ambition? gives up pretty easily finding his uncle's killer and is dead-set on finding his parents' history. Peter's family background? Better than the others by explaining his parents, which barely do! I know that they wanted to make the viewer want to see the sequel but going through a full movie just saying where they worked sucks. Peter exploring his new powers? Pathetic! Spidey saving a kid? Both almost died because of Peter's sheer stupidity of negotiating with a 6-year- old! The lizard villain? Looks exactly like that Jim Henson kiddie show from the 90s called ""Dinosaurs."" Action good? Yes. But there's many parts where the camera shakes at such a wide range with no focus for so long while Spidey's flying around, you may need your barf bag again.<br/><br/>Final thoughts. This movie was not bad, nor good. The action saved what was a major stinker. The story isn't boring, there's just unoriginality and stupidity surrounding it. And it is very forgettable. I noted specific things in this review because I watched this just yesterday. Yet I still forget half of it!<br/><br/>1.5/4"
"MikeMagi","4","2","3","30 July 2013"," It could have been worse...try harder next time!
","Memo to the producers of ""The Amazing Spiderman"": 1)There's a reason they're called comic books. They may not be funny but at least they're a lot of fun. Unlike this movie adaptation. 2)Being tongue-tied and sex appeal are not synonymous. Sputtering, stuttering and stammering does not make you irresistible to women. Even if you're Spiderman's altar ego, Peter Parker. 3)If the hero of the movie inadvertently maims a half-dozen people in a subway car before he realizes his incredible powers, he's a pretty crappy hero. 4) While crafting a script, the screenwriters should check on what they wrote before. Which might explain why tiny lizards are heading for the sewers and what happened to the killer with the star on his hand. 5) Oscar Wilde loved incredible coincidences. But this isn't a farce. So maybe the fact that the kid who gets bitten by a bio-genetically engineered spider is dating the daughter of the cop who is chasing the masked avenger is just a bit too much deus ex machina. 6)When Peter Parker soars across a basketball court and wrecks the backboard, isn't a medical exam a better idea than detention? 7)Just because a director is named Webb doesn't mean that he's the logical candidate for a Spiderman movie. Or didn't you know he spelled it with two b's? 8) You made one terrific decision. Martin Sheen gives his customary fine performance as Spiderman's Uncle Ben. But don't let it go to your heads."
"jamescgallagher","7","2","3","19 November 2012"," It's not 'Amazing' but it was probably worth doing.
","I love Spider-Man. I love the comics, I love the PlayStation games and I think the animated series that seemed to be on Fox Kids 24/7 back in the day is one of the greatest cartoons ever made. What I didn't love, however, was the Sam Raimi film trilogy. Don't get me wrong, I didn't hate them. For what they were, they were pretty solid and part two in particular was a thoroughly enjoyable little adventure. Unfortunately though, I could never take them to my heart. They weren't Spider-Man. Maguire wasn't Peter Parker, he was just someone doing a bad impression of him, and Kirsten Dunst most certainly was not the Mary Jane Watson I knew and loved. Therefore, when I first discovered that this reboot was happening, I was really quite excited. I hoped and I prayed that it would do away with everything Raimi got wrong and bring the real Spider-Man to the big screen, after over forty years of waiting. 'The Amazing Spider-Man' is by no means flawless, it's the closest thing yet to a truly amazing' Spider-Man film.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with Raimi's trilogy was that the vast majority of the people in it had been woefully miscast. In complete contrast to that, Andrew Garfield was quite simply born to play Peter Parker. I've always loved Garfield and I was sure he wouldn't disappoint here. I was right. He gets it down to an absolute tee. The social awkwardness, the cute nerdiness and the dark emotional baggage that has become so symptomatic of Peter Parker over the years is on display here in abundance. From his nervous little ticks, to the facial expressions, the walk – heck, even the conversational style – Garfield IS Peter Parker. Similarly, Emma Stone is great as Gwen Stacy and the chemistry between the two sparkles throughout. Furthermore, the characters themselves are great. Marc Webb, as director, does try a teensy bit too hard to hammer home Peter's troubles, but for the most part it works. Gwen isn't the damsel-in-distress that Raimi's interpretation of Mary Jane turned out to be. She's an active player, she's fun, she's feisty and she's a great counterbalance to Peter's bouts of recklessness. Peter and Gwen are instantly likable to the point that watching their relationship unfold and develop really is a joy. The supporting cast and characters are solid too, and Webb does his best to flesh them out a bit, even going so far as to give Flash Thompson (Chris Zylka) a multi-faceted personality, instead of the two-dimensional jock Raimi gave us. I must give special credit to Sally Field too who, in my opinion, dazzles as Aunt May. I liked Rosemary Harris' portrayal of the character in Raimi's films but felt that the character herself was totally wasted. Here, Aunt May is put to some decent use, as is Uncle Ben whose relationship with Peter, despite his relatively short screen time, is explored in a fair amount of depth. <br/><br/>However, the film doesn't come without its problems. The plot is, for lack of a better word, silly. Admittedly, it's highly enjoyable and makes for a very entertaining two hours, but it doesn't hold up to much scrutiny at all. There are far too many coincidences and conveniences helping it along and it therefore all seems a tad ridiculous. One particular plot device (involving cranes – look out for it) would even give Spider-Man 3's 'emo Peter' a run for its money in the cheese stakes. Having said that, the origin story is executed brilliantly and there are some great laughs to be had as Peter starts discovering his abilities. Yes, it takes a while to get going but solid performances and a good script stop things from becoming tedious. The themes that run through the film (and, one would assume, its sequels) are interesting and Webb succeeds in creating an aura of mystery that is genuinely quite exciting. The background story of Peter's parents and Oscorp industries is handled well and a number of foundations are laid down for a potentially exhilarating set of sequels.<br/><br/>Now for the main problem with the film and, considering this is a superhero film, it's a biggie. Spider-Man is handled brilliantly. Everything that people had expressed concern about, such as his use of 'web shooters' or the fact we'd have to go through the whole Uncle Ben murder thing again, is handled creatively and with care. The film's villain, however, is not. The Lizard (played ably by Rhys Ifans) is not the most interesting bad guy in the World. There's not a whole lot that can be done with him and, whilst Webb tries his best, the character can only go so far. The change in personality, for example, rings quite false and the dodgy CGI is quite difficult to swallow. Ifans is good as Dr. Connors and the character's background is explored as much as possible. Unfortunately, it's a thin background and there isn't a great deal to work with. However, the action sequences are entertaining enough and the fact that Spider-Man is portrayed as amateurish and weak against such a monster gives the film a pleasant twist. We genuinely get the feeling that Spider-Man could lose this fight. At the end of the day, he's just a schoolboy and, as such, it's ludicrous to paint him as a skilled strategist or fighter. By having him rely on the help of other characters to succeed, Webb manages to keep the character grounded, which is a very good thing.<br/><br/>Overall, is a country mile better than 'Spider-Man 3', has a much more interesting origin story than 'Spider-Man' and is, by the strength of its performances, marginally better than 'Spider-Man 2'. As a reboot, it's promising and was well worth doing. I only hope that the sequel is able to build upon the themes laid out here without becoming too unrealistic or contrived. <br/><br/>Oh, and the Stan Lee cameo is hilarious."
"danavenell","2","10","28","17 July 2012"," A boring rushed mess.
","It's flat and boring, just copies badly bits from the first films, Uncle Ben's a jerk, Gwen Stacey works at Oscorp (because it really helps with the ending), everyone looks far too old to be at high school, the director seems completely unfamiliar with the comics, or more importantly how to shoot a good movie All the acting was horrible, except Dennis Leary. And I think those were good actors doing their best, but miscast and trying to inject life into a bad, empty script.<br/><br/>I'll give it two points, At least they tried to make Spidey wise-cracky, and Spidey in action/just posing looked better than the Raimi movies sometimes.<br/><br/>Can't be bothered to write a better review as they couldn't be bothered to make a decent movie. Two more of this version? I hope not."

"dilipbts","8","1","1","10 June 2020"," The amazing Spider-Man
","Being a Spider-man comic book fan I can say that a lot of the stuff that happens in this story is true to the comic book Spider-man. Spider-man has web shooters, Spider-man likes to joke a lot, Gwen Stacy was Spider-man's first love, etc. So Anyone who is a fan of the comics will respect this movie on that merit, the merit that it was faithful to the source material while bringing in new stuff without losing what made Spider-man who he is.<br/><br/>People who've only seen the Spider-man films and never bothered to read any of the comics. Won't like this film as much. They'll say the same old stuff. ""Why was this made? We've seen this already?"" Blah blah blah.<br/><br/>Let me go off saying that behind Spider-man 2, this is probably the best of the Spider-man trilogy for one reason.....it avoids all clichés that the original trilogy didn't. In fact the film pretty much avoids all clichés at all. I'll try and explain a few without spoiling the film.<br/><br/>Well first of all the woman in this film aren't morons. One of the main problems I had with Sam Raimi's films was the fact that all woman were pretty much portrayed as objects that Spider-man can save. None of them do anything helpful. Sure Mary Jane tried to hit Doctor Octopus with a plank in the second film, but she couldn't even do that right. That's not the case here. Gwen actually has a confrontation with with villain and she doesn't screw around, I won't say what she does but when I saw it happen I couldn't help but cheer. Finally a Spider-man film where the woman have a brain-stem.<br/><br/>The second cliché it avoids is being predictable. The original films basically have Spider-man going through the motions. Girl gets kidnapped, Spidey saves girl, Spidey defeats villain or jumps out of the way so the villain can do harm to himself. That is not the case with this film, a lot of the time you think one thing is going to happen but then it doesn't and the opposite happens.<br/><br/>The third cliché it avoids is having silly moments. The first trilogy had a lot of them, yes even Spider-man 2 (The raindrops keep falling on my head scene). Going back an having re-watched the Sam Raimi trilogy before seeing this one, the films are more like popcorn films. Sam Raimi is the master at making B movies and that's what the original trilogy was, an epic scale B Movie. With this film, they get a little more serious. There's not really any goofy moments that I can think of and if there are then it's usually played for laughs.<br/><br/>Also THANK GOD They got Flash Thompson right. Sam Raimi used Flash so he could be the stereotypical bully, and at the beginning you think that's what Marc Webb plans to do, but then he shows that Flash isn't as big a  as he makes himself out to be. Flash is one of my favourite Spider-man characters in the comics, and I'd like to say ""thank you Marc Webb for avoiding the cliché of him just being a bully and actually making him a human being with depth."" The film also does other things right besides avoiding clichés. The actors all do fantastic jobs and I will go on record saying that Andrew Garfield is the perfect Spider-man and a great role model for young boys even though he has his flaws. Martin Sheen was great as an Uncle Ben who is kind, understanding, but at the same time doesn't take any crap. Emma Stone was great as the kind of jokey but intelligent Gwen Stacy who is a strong positive role model for young woman. The Guy who played the villain was great, The girl who played Aunt May was good in the few scenes she was in. Not a weak link in the bunch.<br/><br/>So I've done nothing but praise this film so far, so why is it still behind Spider-man 2 in my books? Well the film does have flaw, mainly two. One it's rushed, the only one who really pays for it being rushed is the villain who only gets one line of dialogue to explain his motives and even then we're not sure why he's doing that. The second flaw is that it doesn't have this big epic feel that Spider-man 2 had, it doesn't feel like it was ma"

"productionslykos","8","1","1","2 April 2020"," A greatly under appreciated superhero movie
","A greatly under appreciated superhero movie that takes pleasure in revamping Spidey into a similar yet welcomed, darker tone. Besides closely resembling Sam Raimi's first Spider-man flick, Mark Webb provides small modifications to the Spidey legacy that soley advances the web head's character. Andrew Garfield exemplifies a wittier, livelier Spider-Man through his astonishing performance, adding additional human movement to Spidey's swings which in all nearly surpasses the greater performance of his counterpart, Tobey Migure. Many fans disliked Garfield's trendier, hip adaptation of Parker. However I believe he performed exceptionally considering much of the negative comments are at the fault of the script and not Garfield's acting. Gwen was beautifully acted by Emma Stone who in favor clicked perfectly with Garfield's Peter, landing the adorable nature between two newely connected individuals. Rhys Ifans The Lizard wasn't unprecedented and at times felt severely underdeveloped, however his connection to Peter and his corrupted nature from pressure and ambition and later the toxins, all served as distinctive antagonist fundamentals that fabricated an entertaining Spider-Man foe. In addition, the CGI was flawless and aided in the engrossment of this gorgeous world making lizard people feel all the more real. Which conventionally added to the already beautiful cinematography that appeared almost too delightful for a comic book flick yet felt earned. The addition of Peter's parent's backstory was clever in constructing contrast between Raimi's and Webb's Spider-Men. Moreover this is an absolute banger of a movie and doesn't deserve the hate it receives. It may have it's plot holes but every movie does. Even if you're not a Spider-Man fan, this movie will still be entertaining."

","Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is bitten by a radioactive spider and has the powers of a spider and fights crime as Spider-Man. He also falls in love with beautiful Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) whose father (Denis Leary) just happens to be the chief of police and hates Spider-Man. Then there's doctor Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) develops a serum that he hopes will cure people of any ailment. He tries it on himself and becomes the Lizard who wants to wipe out the human race.<br/><br/>OK--I never liked the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man movies. I thought he didn't look (or act) like Peter Parker and was WAY too low-key as an actor. Garfield looks like Parker--but his acting is terrible. He's all over the place and never seems to get a grip on his character's pain and anxiety. Also the film is slow-paced and--frankly--just boring. I kept looking at my watch! On the up side the acting (Grafield aside) was excellent. Martin Sheen and Sally Fields were great as Uncle Ben and Aunt May. Stone was sweet, innocent AND sexy as Gwen Stacy. Leary was good as Captain Stacy. It was also great to see Campbell Scott and Embeth Davidtz briefly as Peter's parents. The CGI and special effects were flawless--but we've seen this all before. There's no sense of wonder and amazement at what Spider-Man can do. We KNOW it's done by computers and that robs it of any sense of magic it might have. Boring and badly done. I give it a 2."

","We first saw Peter Parker, the kid who became the iconic hero of all time, back in 2002 when Tobey Maguire made him famous – but this goes all the way back, not just in yesteryear but during the comic book days. In 1963, The Amazing Spider Man hit the bookstores and comic strips, but now a days, we all need a hero.<br/><br/>Peter Parker, (played by new-comer Andrew Garfield) was a troubled young man from the beginning, his parents leaving him behind with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May (played brilliantly by the greatest actor and actress of our time Martin Sheen and Sally Field). During his adolescence, Peter was faced with bullies and the occasional spider bite. But it was not your usual spider bite, a radioactive spider with mutations beyond our capability.<br/><br/>But when things get a little green, Dr. Curt Conners (played by Rhys Ifans, who brought us Xenophilius Lovegood in Harry Potter 7 Part 1), all he ever wanted was to make the human race understand the importance of being treated like reptiles – lizards to say the least.<br/><br/>What an incredible timing to bring this movie before the independence of our country. What an incredible movie that Mark Webb brought us. I know Sam Raimi would be very proud, but Mark you, my friend out-done Sam in every way. The cast was brilliant, the story was awesome, the effects perfection.<br/><br/>If I was Spider Man, the one thing that I would love to do – the web slinging. I would like to fly like Spider Man so that I can save everyone and be the hero of the Red and Blue."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","8","6","15","8 July 2012"," Spidey's back!
","10 years ago, I remember seeing the opening of the biggest film that year, Spider-Man. I'm not kidding, I remember everything about that opening. It was the first time I ever saw teenagers bring comic books to the movie doing comparison notes. I remember it being so crowded and crazy. But I also remember loving the movie and I still watch it today. So when I heard that they were rebooting the franchise, I was kind of curious why they were rebooting so soon. But after seeing the trailers, I still wanted to see the movie. I'm not a crazy comic book fan or anything, I just like super-hero movies. So this review is from the movie-goer, not the comic book advocate. I really did like The Amazing Spider-Man, this was a great pick up from Spider-Man 3. It was trying to touch the territory of being like Batman Begins, taking the character and story a little more seriously without the overage of cheesy one-liners and costumes. What worked well for this movie was the cast and story.<br/><br/>Young Peter Parker's dad, Richard, gathers up hidden documents, and Peter's parents take him to the home of his Aunt May and Uncle Ben, then mysteriously disappear. Years later, a teenage Peter attends high school, where he has caught the eye of Gwen Stacy. At home, Peter finds Richard's papers, and learns his father worked with fellow scientist Dr. Curt Connors at Oscorp. Faking his way into Oscorp as one of a group of high-school interns, Peter sneaks into a lab where a ""biocable"" is being created from genetically modified spiders, one of which bites him. On the subway ride home, he is shocked to find strange spider-like abilities manifesting. After studying Richard's papers, he visits the one-armed Connors at home, reveals he is Richard Parker's son, and gives Connors his father's ""decay rate algorithm"", the missing piece in Connors' experiments on regenerating limbs based on lizard DNA. Connors is being pressured by his superior, Dr. Ratha, to devise a cure for the dying, unseen head of Oscorp, Norman Osborn. He one night does the experiment forcing to him to become a giant lizard and wants to seek revenge on those who wronged him, but Peter with his new powers will try to stop him and save the city.<br/><br/>Did I need to see why Peter becomes Spider-Man again? Not really. Also for ""nerds"", our two leads Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are extremely good looking people. But I'll buy into it and just have fun. I liked the explanation given a little better than the first on why Peter feels the need to be Spider-Man. Also, does Dennis Leary always have to be the downer in almost all his movies? I mean his last lines in the film*Spoiler Alert!!*, he's dying in Peter's arms and tells Peter to leave Gwen alone, that's the finest girl he's ever going to get and he's going to listen to that?! I was telling my fiancé, if I were Peter, I would've hit Dennis before he died and said ""oh, how sad you're dying, just go in peace"" and play it off like it's sad or just screamed after he tells Peter not to see Gwen any more ""Why won't you die?!"". Poor Peter, go get yourself a hottie, Dennis's character was a jerk anyways. I digress; the only thing I have to say that was missing from this one compared to the first Spider-Man, it doesn't quite have Raimi's heart. There are a few flaws with the movie, but all the movies are flawed in one way or another. I think this was a fine addition to the franchise and highly recommend The Amazing Spider-Man, it was a lot of fun.<br/><br/>8/10"
"blogurious","8","8","22","27 June 2012"," Weaving the way out
","The webs of justice are sticking everywhere and the one weaving them is back more powerful than ever. The story of Peter Parker and his inner struggle to understand the past, while bearing an infinite strength to face the future has taken a different turn. It surprises and amazes. <br/><br/>""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is beautifully done and, in spite of the fact that I also love Raimi's lighter take on the bug boy's life, this next chapter has managed to get my attention with its fresher look. It doesn't really match the adult approach that Nolan was able to give Batman, but it still brings a 'je-ne-sais-quois' to the big screen. It has a lot of action, incredible swinging scenes and Garfield, as the super hero, turns out to be a great cast. He is talented enough to depict the difficult young man's life and effort to keep up with things he doesn't understand. Great fun for anyone who's willing to let go of stress to embark in a big adventure."

"bkrauser-81-311064","7","5","12","4 July 2012"," Spider-Man, Spider-Man, the New Movie is Pretty Bland
","The Amazing Spider-Man tries to recreate and remold the titular hero but does so with diminishing results. Like a radically different cover of an old standard tune, the notes are different but the words are essentially the same. A crazed villain still tries to wreak havoc on the city, Uncle Ben still dies, and the love story is still left unfinished and open ended. There are of course differences but they don't have enough flair or pop to really stand out.<br/><br/>It has been only five years since the last installment of the Raimi trilogy and it seems that the principle lesson the studio learned from Spider-Man 3 was don't give the director too much freedom. Sam Raimi's pop sensibilities and ego admittedly got the better of him resulting in disaster. So to compensate for Sam Raimi's too much muchness, they got very green director Marc Webb (of 500 Days of Summer fame) willing to play by the rules at least for now.<br/><br/>There were aspects of the film I did like. Much of the impetus of the story revolves around the mysterious disappearance of Peter's parents which brought new elements to the story. Spider-Man comes home with multiple scabs, bruises and welts from the night's action which is much more realistic when you're leading a life of a crime fighter. Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy was an instantly likable character as was her no nonsense police commissioner father played by Denis Leary. Emma Stone is one of those lucky, popular young actresses who can find universal recognition and praise. She has multiple sides to her which shines in the majority of her performances and makes her incredibly likable. Had the movie been about her I might have actually enjoyed it much more.<br/><br/>Which brings me to probably the biggest complaint I have about The Amazing Spider-Man. I do not like Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man. Not at all. At 28 the actor looks too old to be in high school and much too good looking to be the nerdy, mild-mannered Peter Parker he should be. Once in the suit, he spends an awful lot of time without his mask; likely so people will be distracted by the fact that the costume makes him look like a deflated Voight basketball with legs.<br/><br/>There are those who would argue that this Spider-Man is closer to the smartalecky, brilliant young genius from the comic books. I respectfully disagree. I question whether such praise is deserved when he impresses Dr. Connors (Rhys Ifans) by looking him up on Google then regurgitating what he has read to gain notice. He then further impresses Dr. Connors by giving him the algorithm he needs even though he actually found it in his dad's briefcase and didn't actually come up with it on his own. Then there's the webslingers which I suppose were ingenious until you consider he only invented the mechanism to shoot his webbing. He actually took the cartridges creating the web itself from Oscorp. Oh and then there's the scene where he leaves behind a bulky camera with the words ""property of Peter Parker"" printed on it for The Lizard to find. Yeah not exactly the makings of a genius here.<br/><br/>And what of The Lizard? The fact is the character is ultimately treated as inconsequential. An almost compulsory character thrown in because every superhero must have a super villain. His motivations are tenuous at best and nothing in his scenes while transformed really leave an impact. Also as an aside, the New York water filtration systems seem to have an awful lot of exotic looking lizards and great phone reception. Someone should really check into that.<br/><br/>http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/"
"MaximumMadness","8","5","12","3 July 2012"," While not quite ""amazing"", ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a good, solid and very fun (albeit unneeded) reboot, and has made me excited for a potential new series...
","I should go into this review stating that I wasn't really looking forward to this film. I was 14 when Sam Raimi's 2002 release ""Spider- Man"" came out, and his initial trilogy (featuring two sequels released in 2004 and 2007) truly and completely wowed me as a teen-aged film-goer and captured my imagination in a way that few films had done before.<br/><br/>When Sony decided to trash the planned ""Spider-Man 4"" and instead focus on this reboot, I was a bit crest-fallen. I wanted more Sam, Toby, Kirsten, etc. But, as more and more details came out, and I saw the first images and trailers, I steadily gained interest, bit-by-bit. However, I was never eagerly anticipating this film, so when my best friend handed me a ticket for the midnight screening (from which I've just come), I was only half-excited.<br/><br/>I'm glad I went, however, because despite being completely unneeded, this reboot is actually very, very good!<br/><br/>Mark Webb directs this tale, from a script by Alvin Sargent, James Vanderbilt and Steve Kloves.<br/><br/>Essentially an origin story (at times frustratingly and detrimentally similar to the 2002 film, but different enough to stay fairly fresh), this film follows Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield), a young man in high school whose parents left him when he was a child, following a bizarre break-in at his scientist-father's home. Now living with his Aunt May (Sally Field) and Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen), Peter is a quirky geek in school. After discovering some of his father's old files, he tracks down a former co-worker of his to Oscorp, where he works. There, Peter is accidentally bitten by a genetically-engineered spider, giving him bizarre superhuman powers.<br/><br/>After a tragedy, Peter decides to use these powers for good, and becomes Spider-Man. At the same time, Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans), the man who used to work with Peter's father, is inadvertently transformed into a hulking Lizard-like creature, and Peter (with the help of his crush, Gwen Stacy, as played by Emma Stone) must stop him at all costs from destroying the city.<br/><br/>The film is very well-made. The script is well-written and paced, and the dialog is certainly a lot fresher than the Raimi films. (Which suffered from some hammy lines) Webb's direction is also top-notch, going for a darker, edgier and slightly more realistic style than the former films. (Though I did prefer Raimi's camera-work slightly more) And the visual effects and design are awe-inspiring. Spidey looks startlingly real in this film, as compared to the plastic-y look of the last trilogy. And the design of his costume and the villainous lizard, in addition to the incredible sets, it quite nice. (Don't listen to other reviews who claim it is ""Twilight""-like. I've forced myself to watch those films, and this is nothing like them, whatsoever. Those reviews are extremely inaccurate.)<br/><br/>The acting is also outstanding. Garfield is phenomenal as Peter, giving him much more of sense of humor than previous on-screen incarnations. Emma Stone is great as Gwen, giving her a believability and adorable likability. Ifans is menacing, but slightly under-utilized as Connors/Lizard- he does a good job with his performance, but isn't given enough to do. Sheen and Fields make Ben and May extremely lovable and identifiable. And other roles by the likes of Denis Leary and Chris Zylka are great.<br/><br/>That praise being said, there are some big problems. For starters, the film does feel a little stale, simply because only 10 years ago, we saw this exact same origin story on screen, with only some differences. It was hard to sit through it again, only about 5 years since the last film. Also, there are some problems with the story- certain plot lines are dropped halfway through (including the important search for a man responsible for hurting Peter in an unforgivable way), and some characters are neglected when the pace picks up, giving it a slightly uneven feel. The action is far too abbreviated, with most of the battle scenes lasting between 30 seconds and two minutes, which was a tad anti-climactic. Also, the score by James Horner, while admirable, cannot compare to Danny Elfman and Christopher Young's masterful work from the first trilogy.<br/><br/>That being said, I was still extremely impressed with this film, and shocked at how well it worked and how much I loved it. I was worried that it wouldn't hold a candle to the Raimi trilogy, but this proved that Spidey is in good hands, and I'd say this film is as good as Raimi's first film. (Although not as good as 2004's ""Spider-Man 2"", which was one of those rare, perfect superhero movies.) I'm very excited at the prospect of sequels to this film, and while I wish we had gotten the planned ""Spider-Man 4"" instead, this is still a very good film, and has made a believer out of me.<br/><br/>I give ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" a very good 8 out of 10. It isn't perfect, but it's a web of adventure and excitement that you'll want to take a swing through at least once. Check it out!"
"tan1415","4","5","12","1 July 2012"," Reboot failure...
","First of all I love the original spiderman. Tobey Maguire is great as spidey/Peter Parker. Even though the films are quite dated now with regards to special effects...it followed the story i know about spiderman much better than this movie.<br/><br/>The sad part is...it uses plenty of elements from the original story but they simply jumbled up the plot and worked it out quite badly storywise. So it is quite disappointing. I mean the scene how Uncle Ben dies....is quite silly. How PP gets bitten by the spider....not as good as the original. How he confesses to being Spiderman so quickly.<br/><br/>I was quite shocked that this is a marvel movie and also endorsed by Stan Lee. I mean spideys beginning is a classic story, just like Batman and Superman's. You can do reboots...but YOU MUST NOT CHANGE THE BASIC PRINCIPLES. And if you change it a bit...it must do the original story justice.<br/><br/>To bad really because it started quite interesting and the special effects are awesome and a huge improvement over the original series. Like the suit and also that he has to reload his webs. I guess they tried to explain how Spidey learns how to go webslinging. But wasn't worked out to well. The cast are mainly quite good...only Peter Parker is not that great. PP is a nerd, who turns into a smart aleck superhero when he wears his suit. The difference now is not that great. Tobey maguire did it much better.<br/><br/>Also again 3d was quite disappointing. Right now i feel 3d is just a money making machine and a way to protect the movies vs piracy. The colours are truly effected by wearing the 3d glasses and thats quite a pity.<br/><br/>IMO if you do 3d...make it look goodm, a true asset to the movie. i wont have problems paying extra for it.<br/><br/>So my conclusion it's quite entertaining movie, but lower your expectations and you won't be to disappointed."
"musicmaker23","8","5","12","29 June 2012"," This is how you reboot a franchise!
","I remember walking out of the earlier Spiderman movies so many years ago, in awe of the special effects, the writing, the cheeky humor. Surely, it would be difficult to displace those great memories. So, I went into The Amazing Spiderman with an open mind. I had to believe that Sony had seen more in the director than just the pun in his name. <br/><br/>The Plot: Peter knows little about his missing parents, but stumbling upon their old belongings he finds links that may help him gain some answers. Along the way, he gets bitten by a genetically enhanced spider (Yes, no radiation) & goes through amazing comic sequences coming to grips with his new found powers. He even fashions his own web shooters to complete the spider arsenal (They've stuck to the comics & gotten rid of the irritating oh-so-conveniently-placed genetic web shooters we found with Raimi's movies). Along the way, he meets a girl, falls in love, only to discover her dad (Leary) is the Captain of the police force, the very man responsible for nabbing his vigilante alter-ego. Parker is trying to assist his parents' colleague Dr.Connors perfect inter-species gene transfers allowing the doc to eventually regrow an amputated arm. Miracle cures however, do not come without side effects...<br/><br/>Webb takes the more classical comic book & TV show route into what Spiderman really is, a kid with superpowers coming to grips with reality. On that front, Andrew Garfield is a delight. He's got depth to his acting (go watch the social network if you haven't); he handles all the jokes & sorrow with equal aplomb. I'm extremely glad they redid the ""Epiphany"" scene from the initial movies so differently. Garfield's got the potential to take this Spidey places where Tobey just couldn't. Gone is the calm, ever-tolerant, almost Gandhian, clumsy Peter Parker. He now has the option to grow into a more multi-dimensional character, like in the comics. This was clearly impossible in the original movies, we all know know how miserably they failed in the third movie trying to show a different side to Parker.<br/><br/>Sheen & Field are perfectly cast as Uncle Ben & Aunt May. Sheen especially shows a frailty to Ben's character not earlier seen, a man who's trying hard & sometimes fails with a child he loves as his own but can't outright claim him to be. Who'd have through that Rhys Ifans, who's done great over-the-top characters in the past, would play Dr.Connor with such subtlety? Emma Stone is reduced to being a pretty face who isn't given much screen time to showcase her prowess, but she's still an important catalyst in the movie to bring out the crazed hormone driven teenager that Parker really is. <br/><br/>I recently watched the first and second Spiderman movies. Somehow there were flaws that I hadn't noticed earlier. Tobey's acting skills, an ill- paced screenplay, hammy dialogue, stupid plot-lines with Harry Osborn & the super cheesy sequences that made you feel that New York should've been given its own vanity card. I still love them & they're superbly entertaining, but a lot of reviewers have been wrongly placing these movies up on a pedestal & drawing unfair comparisons with the current film. Those movies set the tone for the next decade of Superhero movies, they weren't without flaws. <br/><br/>The Amazing Spiderman is definitely a movie that has its own share of merits: a superb cast that you cannot fault, a well driven screenplay, the amazing spidey's eye view sequences, the scenes in the subway, alley & the warehouse. Where it fails is drawing in the audience, & feeling emotionally attached to Peter Parker. The movie could've also done without some cheesy & corny sequences that are in direct reference to the older movies. I was almost hoping that they'd pick up the original dialogue at the end, ""Whatever life holds in store for me, I will never forget these words: With great power comes great responsibility. This is my gift, my curse. Who am I? I'm Spider-man"" Wishful thinking? Maybe next time."
"victorl13107569","8","5","12","29 June 2012"," An evaluation on the theme of maturity in The Amazing Spiderman
","To me Spiderman has always been an allegory for growing up. What separates teen from adult is the recognition of responsibility, and Marc Webb captures this element magnificently in his interpretation. For that reason alone I give this film an 8. Let me discuss this attribute further.<br/><br/>The first of four stages into growing into an adult begins when Parker forgets to pick up Aunt May despite Uncle Ben's emphatic reminder. This seems acceptable because Parker had only recently been bitten, and it makes logical sense that one experiments with and indulges in newfound superpowers. But this speaks for an aspect of human nature epitomized by Freud's famous quote: ""A child would destroy the world if it had the power"". If Parker combines his superhuman powers with his outstanding affinity for science, then the world easily becomes his playground. He could wreck the city without knowing it. Webb establishes this point by comically portraying his inability to control his grip strength over common bathroom appliances. Parker lacks a sense of responsibility; Uncle Ben will pay with his life to instill it in him.<br/><br/>When Parker abets a robbery by accepting milk from the thief, he unknowingly jeopardizes the foundation of his morals. Parker was indignant about the storekeeper's lack of empathy about him not being able to pay two cents to buy his milk, so he doesn't stop the robbery when he has the power to. This concludes in a moving tragedy, in which Uncle Ben attempts to stop the robbery and receives a lethal bullet wound. This reforms Parker, as he is convinced of the fatality his moment of moral uncertainty has caused.<br/><br/>The third stage takes place when Parker forgets to bring home the eggs, and the fourth stage is when Parker DOES bring home the eggs. The subtle transition marks Parker's transition from understanding that with great power comes great responsibility, but great responsibility encapsulates all of the smaller ones as well. Just because one is on top of the world, it doesn't mean that he is allowed to disregard his social responsibilities from filial piety to ethical conduct."
"c-mitchell616","10","4","9","14 April 2013"," Don't listen to biased reviews. One of 2012's best!
","People are grading it down because it is the origin story again which even if it was too similar you can't down grade it due to that as you review films on their own. Also you can't down grade it because the franchise didn't need rebooted again that doesn't mean you reduce the stars! Is different from the first film and was closer to the comics. I loved the first two (3 was horrible) but this is the best one yet. Andrew Garfield is (pun intended) amazing as Spider-Man and Peter Parker and reflects the character better than Maguire. Emma Stone is Gwen Stacy and she is superior to Dunst. Gwen is his first love unlike MJ and the film shows Peter's intelligence buy having him make web-shooters (which happened in the comics). The characters and their relationships are the best part of this film with Garfield and Stone having the best chemistry than in any other comic book film. The Lizard is brilliant and is the 2nd best Spidey villain after Doc Ock in SM2 but then again they changed his character in that one. The film is a nice mix of light and dark so it's no Dark Knight but it's not like the original films which were more campy. The film is a great modernization as Peter is portrayed as a geeky, smart, outsider instead of a stereotypical nerd (that's why he skateboards) overall this is the truest Spider-Man film and maybe even one of the best comic book films ever!"

"taigezhang-1","10","4","9","1 March 2013"," This is an awesome film - you guys don't know what you're talking about
","First, I haven't written a review on IMDb in years but I must jump in here because of all the horrible reviews. They're wrong. This is a brilliant Spider-Man movie. I thought it was awesome. I loved the original Spider-Man trilogy. And this one is amazing too.<br/><br/>I'm tired of these hardcore comic book guy fans on IMDb being too good for this film and calling it garbage. Look Stan Lee stands by his work. Like any artist, he loves his creation, demands quality, and if he was involved in the production of this movie and signed off on this... it's f-ing good. If the creator okayed it... who are you?<br/><br/>I'm just glad someone took the time to get this movie made. Movies are hard to make. Deals fall apart. And something happened in the movie, unlike some movies where nothing happens. i.e Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1<br/><br/>I'm not going to sit around and let people bad mouth Marc Webb's film just because it didn't match what some had in their heads. It's a different director so it's going to be a different rendition. I read reviews complaining about the music that was used in different scenes and how Peter shouldn't have beat up the guys in the subway. Come on, are you serious? Why don't you go make your own film then. I literally cannot believe how much ""don't-you-dare-touch-my- facebook"" like people are being with this film. Why don't you complain about how the music wasn't loud enough at 32:49?<br/><br/>Second, this is what I thought about the film. I remember reading the original comics with Gwen in them and watching the TV show with Curt Connors so I was really glad to see these characters on screen. It was really cool. It was a fun, exciting, and moving film. The acting was great. The visuals were super. The story was entertaining. And to all the comic book guy fans out there, of course it's predictable! You've read the comics. It's like reading the spoilers and then complaining the movie sucked because you knew what was going to happen. <br/><br/>Third, I'm annoyed that because of the bad reviews I put off watching this film for almost a year. I don't want other people to make the same mistake. If you like Spider-Man and want to watch a quality movie, this is it. You're going to be entertained and love it. I think it's just as good at Dark Knight and Avengers. <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Taige"
"peter-ferjancic","3","4","9","20 February 2013"," Just not good
","How this got past 5 stars remains a mystery to me. The characters are flat, the story is either rushed in important parts or utterly boring in others. The whole lizard plot is nothing more than a two hour excuse to show a reptile on the big screen. The only reason to get it above 1/10 is decent (although nothing special) CGI and camera. The soundtrack was decent too. The rest of the crew took a vacation and did a below average job. Espetially the director.<br/><br/>You want my advice? Stay away from this waste of time and just watch again the previous trilogy or the cartoons. I literally suffered to see this to the end in the vain hope it would get better in the end.<br/><br/>Seriously, just watch Twilight, this isn't any worse waste of time."
"brando647","7","4","9","28 January 2013"," Disposable Comic Book Entertainment; I Miss Raimi Already...
","How many times must Uncle Ben die for our amusement? If ever there was a movie franchise that embodied modern Hollywood's obsession with rebooting and reimagining the past, THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN is it. It's only been ten years since Sam Raimi brought the web-slinger to the big screen and helped jump-start the comic book movie craze, and it's only been five years since the trilogy came to an embarrassing end with the dud that was SPIDER-MAN 3. Now, rather than pick up where the last films left off and continue on in exciting new directions with a new director, Sony Pictures decided we might as well just start fresh. And that means a reintroduction to Spider-Man's origins, despite the fact that everyone knows by now how Peter Parker came to be New York's web-slinging superhero. I have no problem with rebooting a character franchise and handing the direction over to a new talent, but I don't see why we need to retread old ground. The entire first hour of THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN rehashes everything we've already seen in Raimi's SPIDER-MAN in 2002. Except this one is handled a bit differently, which I suppose is why it's supposed to be all right. Parker's parents are more of a central focus in his eventual decision to become Spider-Man and it's his investigation that leads him to his encounter with the radioactive spider in the first place. I'm not sure why it couldn't have been handled in a ten or fifteen minute flashback. When you think about it, Uncle Ben's death was retconned and altered the story with a few flashbacks in SPIDER-MAN 3 and it worked all right without spending an hour going over the whole scenario again.<br/><br/>The aggravating part is, once the first hour is done and the groundwork for the Parker parents storyline is laid out, the movie shifts gears into a generic superhero storyline that loses interest. Spider-Man's first challenge in his new role is battling the Lizard. Dr. Connors was introduced in SPIDER-MAN 2 and maintained a presence through the last two Raimi movies, so we knew the Lizard was eventually going to make an appearance. I just wonder if Raimi would've handled him better as a villain. Raimi's villains were always interesting. Green Goblin and Doctor Octopus were near perfect, and even the villains in 3 weren't bad for the extent that Raimi was able to use them when crammed into a single movie. Connors has the appropriate motivation (regrowing his missing arm with cross-species genetics) and the Lizard's arrival on the scene is handled well, but his overall plan is just generic. It's a plan we've seen countless times before in other action films, both superhero and normal. As a result, the movie loses a lot of steam and only becomes interesting again when Spider-Man and the Lizard are battling it out on screen. I enjoyed the movie when I first saw it in theaters, even while recognizing that it had some problems. But each subsequent viewing has weakened it and now I'm mostly bored with the whole thing.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint with THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN is that it doesn't feel like a Spider-Man movie. I know the character has been involved in some darker stories but I've always seen the Spider-Man series as a more light-hearted, fun series. Marc Webb's reboot is almost depressing. There's a lot of low lighting and dark colors. Characters always act depressed and angry. Spider-Man fits in a handful of good quips when he's doing his crime-fighting bit but the majority of the movie feels like a downer. Cheer up, people. It's Spider-Man. Leave the gloom for Batman or the Punisher. On a more positive note, the casting was great. Andrew Garfield will make a fine replacement for Tobey Maguire if the filmmakers can lay off the drama and let him have some fun. Emma Stone is a beautiful Gwen Stacy and brings the most levity to the movie. Regardless of how depressing the movie gets, her character's bright eyes and optimistic demeanor comes through. Rhys Ifans was great as Connors, though it's a shame his CG Lizard reminds me of a Goomba from the miserable SUPER MARIO BROS movie. I suppose it's just the lack of a protruding snout. The filmmakers claim they did away with the snout because they couldn't really make him speak with it. That may be so, but at least he would look like a Goomba on steroids. Martin Sheen is wasted as Uncle Ben, and Denis Leary is one of the better characters with Captain Stacy. Really, for the most part, the casting was perfect and should've made for a better movie.<br/><br/>THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN is mediocre summer fun. If this had debuted in a year with weaker competition, it might've stood out more. But no, sorry, this movie has nothing on Whedon's AVENGERS or Nolan's DARK KNIGHT RISES. As a result, the introductory film in Sony's new Spider-Man series falls pretty flat and I doubt most people will find much more in it than throwaway entertainment before moving on to bigger and better comic book films. It doesn't live up to Raimi's first two Spider-Man films, but at least I can honestly say it was better than SPIDER-MAN 3."

"bob-rutzel-1","10","4","9","17 November 2012"," Best One Yet
","Spiderman (Andrew Garfield) gets involved with a version of Animal Control gone bad.<br/><br/>This is a reboot from Hollywood. You are welcome America. The reason this is a reboot is because Hollywood knows we cannot remember the previous Spiderman movies and who cares anyway? That said, this is, by far, the best one yet. Why? Inquiring minds want to know.<br/><br/>This is the best one yet because it was more on a realistic vein. The previous ones were too campy, had too much humor (oh, the horror) and too many scenes were in daylight. The previous ones were good let's be clear about that. Well, except for Spiderman 3 when Peter Parker wore the black suit. Not good at all. <br/><br/>Here the story was more realistic not that we needed it to be, but our main focus is that we are entertained. And, entertained we were. Also, in here we see a good guy Dr. Connors (Rhys Ifans) who changes into a bad guy (okay a lizard, a gigantic one) but with altruistic leanings for the betterment of mankind. How is that possible, you ask? Well, it really isn't, but work with me. <br/><br/>As for Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) as Spiderman we see him as dorky at first, then later we forget all about that and are convinced he can do Spiderman. And, we are good with it. End of story. One of the reasons this works is because we see pain inflicted on Peter and in or out of costume, talking with Gwen or his aunt, we see the tortured face and feel that pain. See?<br/><br/>Supporting cast with Emma Stone as Gwen, the love interest; Denis Leary as the police chief, Martin Sheen as Peter's uncle and Sally Field as Peter's aunt were all very good. <br/><br/>There were not enough scenes to really tell if the chemistry between Peter Parker and Gwen was good enough. Hey, this is a reboot and the feeling each other out took too long. Let's say the chemistry was almost there. Happy now? We'll see more chemistry in the sequels. Count on it. <br/><br/>And, the main plot of the story is animal control gone bad and was easy enough for us to understand. Hey, we go to Spiderman movies to see the CGI and it was nothing short of fantastic. Remember when we saw Superman, the movie (that would be the first one) and we were told we would really believe a man can fly? Well, in here we needed to see Spiderman swinging all over the place and swing all over the place he did. What more can anyone ask? (well, maybe the 3-D Version). <br/><br/>All in all very entertaining and Inquiring Minds are now satisfied, resting and waiting for the next one. <br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No."
"zetes","6","4","9","11 November 2012"," Unnecessary, though not necessarily bad
","A re-boot of a series that only started a decade ago, and ended just five years ago. As such, it feels unnecessary and probably a tad rushed. It has to go through all that origin story stuff again, and, in my opinion, that's almost always what kills comic book movies, especially ones where I'm already familiar with the origin story (Batman Begins, despite being very well liked, has never worked for me either for the very same reason). It also doesn't help that James Garfield, who has proved himself a really fine actor elsewhere, feels weak as Peter Parker. He just never seems like he could be a super hero. Tobey Maguire really surprised me as being capable in the role, but Garfield doesn't. The film does get better as it goes on, especially after the super-villain, the Lizard, is created (played by Rhys Ifans). Before the classic accident that turns him into the Lizard, Ifans is kind of dull, but the actual Lizard monster is truly an imposing villain and actually kind of frightening. The action sequences are pretty good, though both Spider-Man and the Lizard are CGI creation. It thus amounts to simply watching cartoons fight, but it's well done for what it is. Emma Stone has good presence as the girlfriend, Gwen Stacy. Dennis Leary plays her father. Martin Sheen and Sally Field are Peter's Uncle Ben and Aunt May. Sheen's good when he's around, but Field has no presence as Aunt May."

","After watching this film, I can't believe the amount of bashing that people are giving at this film since I think this film was great and is far better than Tobey Maguire's version<br/><br/>Its darker and grittier just the way I like it. Its sad because the only reason in my opinion that this film did not get much hype that it deserves was mainly because it released on the same year as The Avengers<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield played the character verywell and made Peter Parker looked more believable and intelligent. Emma Stone fitted her role as Gwen Stacy perfectly and unless the girl who becomes Mary Jane in the next sequel is able to outshine Emma's performance, I'll be verysad that Peter had let her go. Rhys Ifans as the Lizard was convincingly good too but reasons for him to turn evil did not look strong enough<br/><br/>A minor complain that I would point out would have to be the action scenes. This Spider Man relies too much on his webbing and has almost no fighting skills at all which made the fight scenes look kind of dull so I hope that in the future, Sony would correct out these problems <br/><br/>Overall, an great film, one which truly deserves at least 2 more sequels in the future"
"beatlesdudeireland","10","4","9","16 July 2012"," Great Movie- bow down Raimi
","Having watched the Spiderman trilogy, my expectations of The Amazing Spiderman were initially low. Reading into some early reviews of the movies, I felt unimpressed. Nevertheless, I decided to enter the theater with an open mind. <br/><br/>What I got was unprecedented. I saw a movie that was spectacular, endearing,a film that actually made me care about the characters. Toby Maguire might as well have played a plank of wood sleeping in a field for three hours. Andrew Garfield brought something to the movie, that Raimi could never evoke from Maguire; flavor, a peculiar flair, that stimulates the movie, even when there is no action taking place. His character is rigorously researched, resembling the original Spiderman envisioned by Ditko and Lee. He brings humor to the table( albeit a bit cheesy). He is smart, dependable, and caring. He personifies the high-school geek, but brings to charm it. He encourages us to stand up to the bully. He is bold in the face of danger. He gets the girl. He is smart, both practically and theoretically.<br/><br/>Then we see the dark dimension to the film. The dissonance in the family that leads to the poignant death of his Uncle. A scene that allows us to sympathize with the rebellious geek. We are offered a character with many dimensions, a flawed character, unlike the stereotypical heroes we are normally offered. <br/><br/>The on screen relationship between Garfield and Stone is a pleasure to watch. The chemistry is bubbling between the pair. Including some memorable quotes and moving scenes. Trust, a quality long lost on our generation is exemplified in Stone's and Garfield's characters, when he reveals his true identity to her. The tension is augmented by the fact that Stone's father, Capitan Stacy, is actively hunting Spiderman. We see the overbearing father holds the same level of disapproval for Peter Parker as he does his altar-ego. <br/><br/>The Down to earth nature of the film is best displayed through the blue collar, Uncle Ben, played by the veteran actor Martin Sheen. Sheen brings the intrinsic qualities of family love and togetherness to the movie. He is a man who has worked all his life. He can be tough on Peter but means well. He loves his wife, and is enraged when Peter fails to pick her up from a dangerous neighborhood. When Peter becomes disenchanted, he storms out. Uncle Ben follows, ending up in a dangerous area.Ironically, the danger Ben warns Peter about is the very thing that kills him. In the conclusion, we see the insightful text message sent to Peter, which urged him to come home that night. In a way Peter is faced with a unresolved guilt. He seeks vengeance, but revenge cannot satiate the hole his uncle's death leaves. <br/><br/>I particularly loved the exploration of Peter's past. It gives us a greater character profile and helps us understand how he came to live with his aunt and uncle. <br/><br/>The Lizard was a good villain no doubt, but I felt maybe his character should have had a bit more screen time. Overall, the atmosphere and the plot were good. Rounded off by a great cast. It has all the makings of a great movie. Bow down Mr Raimi <br/><br/>10/10"

","After the train wreck of Spider-Man 3, the powers that be decided it was time for a complete Spider-Man reboot. The vast majority of the audience asked the same question: ""Why?"" <br/><br/>Regardless, here we are, The Amazing Spider-Man. OK, you all know the story. Say it with me:<br/><br/>""When bitten by a genetically modified spider, a nerdy, shy, and awkward high school student gains spider-like abilities that he eventually must use to fight evil as a superhero after tragedy befalls his family..."" <br/><br/>...and straight away we have the biggest problems with this movie. <br/><br/>Firstly, it's not clear who this movie is aimed at. Everyone who knows anything about Spider-Man knows spider bite + dead uncle = Spider-Man, but this movie really seems to drag it out anyway. It's a Spider-Man movie that will at times make Spider-Man fans hit the snooze button, but there's not much in it to attract a new audience either. <br/><br/>Secondly, they get the story wrong. I know, I know, Marvel has many universes, etc etc, but it still just feels... wrong... <br/><br/>Peter Parker isn't nerdy. He's a teenage Bart Simpson, complete with skateboard. Sure, he gets bullied and he understands science stuff, but he still comes across a little like an idiot who has managed to get hold of an answer sheet. <br/><br/>Then we have the new secret agent conspiracy surrounding his parents. This is the big new hook, the whole purpose of a reboot, the story arch that will keep us glued to the trilogy... but who cares? <br/><br/>Spider-Man should be about an ordinary kid, dealing with ordinary life while simultaneously realising that ""With great power, comes great responsibility"" (or the much less catchy paraphrasing used in this film). The parent conspiracy just takes away some of the purity of the character. <br/><br/>That said, it's not that bad a movie. And it does explain the mystery of why Spider-Man always seems to have somewhere to swing on (save the child of a crane driver and you're sorted for life). <br/><br/>But, as expected from a series that just didn't need another origin movie, it feels pointless."
"ssjr-244-672734","10","4","9","10 July 2012"," Great Story!
","First off I would like to say I get kind of annoyed when people write bad reviews to a movie that going into it they weren't very opened minded about. I will be the first to admit that I was kind pretty upset when they decided to reboot this series, and I was totally against going to see it when I heard what they were doing. I changed my mind after watching the previews for the movie. I also get annoyed when comic book nerds write bad reviews because they were insulted by the fact that the movie had nothing to do with the comic book. If you are expecting the movie to be like the comics then just don't go to them.<br/><br/>With that said, I really liked the story line of this movie. It was the untold story about Peter Parkers dad and the mystery that surrounded him. I think that they found the perfect replacement for Tobie Maguire. Andrew Garfield really brought Peter Parker's character to life. I really liked the comical side to this Spider-man that wasn't present in the original versions. They took the working format (the darkness)from the Dark Knight franchise and made it work with this movie. Emma Stone did a great job play Gwen Stacy and Rhys Ifans did a great job playing Dr. Connors/Lizzard. The action sequences where really good and I really like the direction that they seem to be going with this franchise and I am looking forward to see what they have in store for the rest of the series."
"wsills8","9","4","9","3 July 2012"," The Amazing Spider-Man is the new Batman Begins
","The Original Spider-Man Trilogy ended the same way as the original Batman series did, sort of. Both started off strong (Spider-Man 1&2 and Batman 1&2) and both ended with a bang, and not in the good way (Spider-Man 3 and Batman 3&4). Then, both got reboots. Batman's reboot entitled Batman Begins was a critical and box office success which set up one of the greatest films of all time entitled The Dark Knight which gets its sequel, The Dark Knight Rises, this summer. Spider-Man's reboot has so far closed the deal on at least 2 more films, and in my opinion, Marvel's version of Christopher Nolan's Batman series. The Amazing Spider-Man, just like Batman Begins, used Drama to a great effect and showed the more humane sides of both Peter Parker and Bruce Wayne. Just like Christian Bale did with Batman, Andrew Garfield delivers a great performance as Spider-Man, maybe even better than Tobey Maguire's version. The Acting was very good with Sally Field, Rhys Ifans, Emma Stone, and Martin Sheen all giving wonderful performances as Aunt May, The Lizzard, Gwen Stacy, and Uncle Ben, respectfully. Garfield and Stone share great chemistry on screen and Ifans gives a great performance which ranks him up there with Alfred Molina as one of the best comic book villains portrayed on the big screen ever. The story was very good as was the action and drama. The film definitely sets up a sequel and who knows what could happen. One of my favorite comic book films of all time and a MUST watch. I give it an A+ and a 9/10."
"dizzy44","9","4","9","3 July 2012"," IMHO best Spider Man in the series
","I like this Spider Man the best out of all that are in the series maybe because in keeping with the ""amazing"" series, the styling and action are edgier and darker and just out there. Garfield makes a much much better Peter Parker than the Frodo-esque Tobey Maguire (sorry Tobey, no hard feelings) with slimmer and taller figures albeit younger...and a lot more emo than the already emo Spider Man 3 (remember the Sandman vs Venom vs spidey scene in the end? YIKES). Looks physically more accurate Spider Man in costume too. Though Garfield can be annoying to watch at times, at least to me becoz I know people just gush over him here, I still can see him as Erik Larsen's or Bagley's Peter Parker. I didn't see that at all with Tobey. <br/><br/>And where Garfield slacks up, there's always the beautiful Emma Stone to save the day. Really - I firmly believe that it was Emma, not Garfield, who is the real star in this movie. And who saves the movie. I think she is brilliant as Gwen Stacy. <br/><br/>The Lizard, ah well what can I say. Not memorable. Nowhere near Nolan's Joker. Captain Stacy, funny how he somehow, somehow resembles William Dafoe - Green Goblin to me. I just can't shake it off. <br/><br/>Love, love the webbing effects and the web shooters. Finally, web shooters! And done well,too,matching the comic's lengthy make- believe descriptions. Yup, this is the most accurate Spider Man film thus far, right down to the web head's signature smart Alec fighting style and numerous ""shut it!"" webbing to the mouth (this Spider Man LOVES throwing webbing onto people's mouths). But then again, about capt. Stacy... Well if I say it it's going to be a spoiler so I'm going to let you watch it. Spider fans should notice a major inaccuracy with capt. Stacy. <br/><br/>The effects are again, to me, the best in the series. I'm talking about spidey-related effects. The web swinging thru the city, oh the web swinging. Simply. Amazing. Well done. Just trust me when I say cough up the extra dollars and watch this on Imax. 3D is optional, but Imax is non-negotiable. <br/><br/>I learned this the hard way. But I will rectify this situation this weekend when I will be re-watching the Amazing Spider Man... On Imax."

"thescribe7","4","3","6","2 June 2015"," Lacks Heart and Comic
","As cringe worthy as Tobey Maguire is, you always like him at the end of the day. As cheesy as the original film is, it has a heart and a comic book feel. We felt something during Uncle Ben's speech in the original film. In this film, it is merely glossed over to something that's supposed to add up to more or less the same thing. Also, doesn't anybody ever poke an eye at Peter during all the great powers he has? Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man is perhaps more fitting but he's just missing something. He doesn't have the corny comic book feel to him in this film. <br/><br/>I guess this is a more ""serious"" version of the Raimi film but there is no substance here. You have a giant lizard running around doing nothing interesting. Everything that relates to Spider-Man just feels glossed over. I don't even think we find out anything about Uncle Ben's killer. We never see him again! Peter isn't even responsible for anything! There is no guilt felt! There are some subplots in here that don't amount much to anything. <br/><br/>To the film's credit, they sure did pull off a better love interest for Peter. Gwen is cute and an actual character. I also do feel like Peter is almost more relatable here. Him and Gwen do process chemistry and are cute. But sometimes we need a bit comic book to it. Or something to it. Something like a story. As stupid looking as the Green Goblin looked in the original film you remember him for his cheesy lines. He was at least a character! This lizard dude is nothing! The film fails to add anything new to the Spider-Man mythos and you forget most of it by a year. Where's those little warm feelings you get when Spider-Man kisses M J for the first time (as bad as her character is)? The film is not memorable nor does it have a warm spider heart. It just feels like your average mediocre movie. <br/><br/>Putting comparisons aside, there really is nothing here to marvel at. Peter is likable enough but nothing that special. Nothing special in that there's no character development. He starts fighting and stuttering and ends fighting and stuttering! <br/><br/>But the Stan Lee cameo was cool..."

I can understand if there are people who dislike the difference between the comic Spider-man and this version. So be it.<br/><br/>I don't mind, in fact, I prefer this version and the selection of actors. The main plot is still the same. Nerd live with his uncle, get a hard time in school, get bitten and ta-da becomes the Spider-man - and have a hard time finding out what to do with the powers. Love live, identity and police force that has nothing better to do, gives him trouble.<br/><br/>So what if there is no news paper, with a bloody annoying owner. I don't mind. Never liked that character. So what if there are not so many gorgeous girls. I don't mind.<br/><br/>The only thing I miss is a natural ability to create spiderweb. In the cartoon he was able to make his own web. Here he resort to his cool know how to make up for it with a device. So... still 10 points worth.<br/><br/>Recommendation: If you are a die hard Spider-man fan where all characters need to be true to their identity, don't bother to watch.<br/><br/>For all others, I will recommend it."
"bh_tafe3","5","3","6","12 March 2015"," Amazingly unnecessary
","Apparently the maker of this film's surname is Webb, spiders have webs, so that must qualify him to make a movie about Spiderman.<br/><br/>So here's the plot: well actually you should just save yourself some time and watch Sam Raimi's Spiderman instead. It has a far more interesting villain, a cameo from the late Randy Savage, an amusing busker, and follows the comic book far closer than this. Well actually, let's look at one part of the plot in particular. You remember in the original film when Peter gets upset at Uncle Ben because he crossed the line and started talking to him like his father? Well in this one Uncle Ben crosses a line by actually expecting Peter to, you know, kind of be where he said he would be? Well after this spat in the original film he goes to have a wrestling match wins and gets screwed out of the money he was owed by the promoter. The promoter is then robbed, but Peter allows him to escape. The man kills Uncle Ben and Peter hunts him down in a display of out of control vigilante justice. He realizes he has a great responsibility, which also includes his conduct, and proceeds on a mission of sacrifice, losing his friendship with Harry and even giving up MJ. Well in this one, Peter goes to the corner shop where he doesn't have enough money to buy a milkshake. So when someone robs the store he just lets them do it. Let's think about this. This person's crime was not selling him a product he could not afford. Wow, this Peter Parker is pretty petty. Then that person shoots Uncle Ben. Peter starts apprehending villains who look like the assailant (a plot line that goes nowhere). Becoming Spiderman has no great impact on his life and he is even quite happy to put Gwen in danger at the film's end. Could there be a bigger contrast? The original Spiderman was inspired and haunted by the death of his uncle, weighed down by responsibility, forced to go at it alone. Being Spiderman is his calling. In this reboot being Spiderman is a hobby, to sit alongside other hobbies. I'll tell my girlfriend who I am, I'll get innocent people killed and then do nothing to keep them out of danger: your hero Ladies and gentlemen.<br/><br/>Apparently Raimi was taking far too long to develop Part 4 so Sony decided to reboot the whole thing, so we get a more boring and slower burning introduction to the character than the original and the dullest villain in any comic book film apart from the Green Lantern. If you made it to the final credits, your patience is to be commended.<br/><br/>3 times I have attempted to sit through this, 3 times I became completely bored about an hour in. I have never made it to the finish. Garfield is good as Parker and Emma Stone has nice legs. Nothing else about this patently unnecessary film is worthy of comment."
"joetufano882","4","3","6","6 January 2015"," The Untold Story? Not really. Better than Spider-Man 2002? Not in the slightest.
","I've been a Spidey fan since I saw the 2002 film, and I wasn't really onboard with the idea of rebooting the franchise so soon after Spider-Man 3. I gave it a chance though, and while I did really like it the first time I saw it, it wasn't until about a year later and after watching it on DVD that I wasn't really impressed. If anyone watched the advertisements for this, they keep teasing about the untold story and that Peter's parents disappearance is somehow connected to the spider that bites him. But you watch the movie, they don't give you an answer. This movie is practically a remake of the 2002 film, and in a lot of ways it comes off as a cheap imitation. <br/><br/>A lot of people practically worship Andrew Garfield's portrayal of the character, and truth be told I've grown sick of it at this point. Garfield was really good in Social Network, but his performance never convinced me that this was the Peter from the comics. In comparison to the sequel though, it seems like in this film that he's at least making an effort in playing Peter but he comes off as some edgy, rule breaking hipster ""Johnny Cool Guy"" type of character. And the script doesn't really help either considering his character is very uneven going back and forth from liking him to not liking him. And the romance between Gwen and Peter, which is another thing that people annoyingly worship about these movies is boring and not really interesting to watch because they literally have a total of 2 minutes of screen time before they start making out. They do play off each other nicely and Emma Stone is a great actress, but before and after they got together, all they really seemed to do was just flirt and stare at each other the entire time. And just when Peter is starting to come off as selfless when he initially breaks up with Gwen at the end as a promise to her Dad, he decides to go back with her anyway. Which makes him completely selfish and unlikeable. <br/><br/>And by the way for those who complained about Tobey crying in his movies, Garfield cries a LOT more than Tobey did. In ASM 2 he cried 4 times, and here he cries 6 times (yes I counted). Maguire didn't even cry THAT much. <br/><br/>Dr. Connors is just some clichéd villain who has some stupid plan to turn every New Yorker into a reptile which that plan by the way comes completely out of nowhere, and the Uncle Ben storyline is not really that impactful because not only does he die over chocolate milk, he goes after the gun when the thief wasn't really threatening anyone essentially absolving Peter of the guilt he's supposed to feel. And he's forgotten about by a certain point and Peter's reason for becoming Spider-Man isn't really clear.<br/><br/>The pacing is off, the writing is uneven and really lazy, the tone doesn't feel right considering that Spider-Man is a color character and not a brooding figure like Batman, and I don't see how the webshooters and Spidey joking every 4 seconds makes this movie and Andrew Garfield's portrayal of the character ""amazing"". This movie just feels hollow and a wasted opportunity, but the swinging scenes were cool to look at and in comparison to its sequel it feels like Marc Webb and the rest of the team had a bit more freedom to do what they wanted despite the studio interference being too obvious. And I know about the deleted scenes, but if they were taken out the final cut they don't count as being part of the movie. <br/><br/>I don't hate this movie, but I wouldn't exactly call it a good movie either. It's bad considering this is supposed to be a Spidey flick, but there far worse movies out there. And it's unfortunate that it turned out the way it did because had Sony just kept their hands off, it could have been something special."

","We all love the original Spider-Man series. The main lovable character Peter Parker was played magnificently by Tobey Macquire. When you watch this, you can''t help but to compare it with the other series. The new Peter Parker was played very well, but for some reason, you just can't see him as Spider-man. Granted, this movie had a nice storyline, good visual effects, and even a different idea of how he learned to control his power. Directing was good, but like I said, they tried to get us attached to this movie like the original one did, but it just didn't catch on. Graphics weren't bad, but they were good enough to make it seem realistic. Overall, this movie is worth seeing, but don't expect it to be as good as the first."

","When Sony Pictures decided to reboot the Spider-Man franchise, I wondered if there really was a need for it considering that not much time had passed since Spider-Man 3 came out & overall, this franchise hadn't fared as worse as others to justify a reboot. Anyway, The Amazing Spider-Man tries to bring on screen the story of our friendly neighbourhood from its origins. Everyone must already be aware of the premise but in case you're not, it tells the story of Peter Parker & how he became Spider-Man in addition to an ugly, stupid villain thrown in here who is more funny (unintentionally, obviously) than scary. <br/><br/>Director Marc Webb tries very hard to take his movie away from Sam Raimi's versions but it ends up with too many similarities in events, much less charm or excitement & is a dumbed down version of the original Spider-Man movie in a new package. Plus, the romantic arc between Peter Parker & Gwen Stacy is just absurd & eye-rollingly cheesy. Cinematography is more oriented to point-of-view shots while editing is just horrible. Visual effects feel incomplete & the music by James Horner is simply no match to Danny Elfman's magnificent score that actually feels like belonging to Spider-Man.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Andrew Garfield is very much believable in the costume of Spider-Man & does a brilliant job in portraying the recklessness of a teenager in possession of newly discovered superpowers. Emma Stone is a darling as Gwen Stacy but she isn't given much to play with yet manages to tag along with a fine performance. Rest of the cast is simply forgettable. Also, Irrfan Khan's ""pivotal role"" was; to be used as the poster boy for the film's marketing in India, which actually paid off as this movie had a record-breaking opening here.<br/><br/>Now those who are still reading this review & are unfortunately fans of this film, few of them might argue that I should not compare this film with the original Spider-Man but if that's the case then what exactly was the point of making this film if it never was going to be better than its decade old version anyway? On an overall scale, adding nothing but only a new dimension (3D) which had its little moments, The Amazing Spider-Man isn't amazing at all & is just no match to Raimi's versions, which are more fun even today. In short, a needless reboot whose needless sequel is coming soon. Good luck, Sony Pictures.<br/><br/>Full review at: cinemaclown.wordpress.com"

","I watched this movie on 4th of July last year and ever since I saw this movie, I m anxiously trying to figure out what was the objective market in the mind of the director. This movie was excessively complicated for kids and was strange for adults as well. This actually is not the Spiderman I sought to see. Don't take me wrong, I didn't hatred the full movie but this Spider-Man was moderately boring.<br/><br/>I purely cannot suggest this movie. I have many questions after watching this movie. Most likely it's due to Tobey-Man and this is the main cause I give this movie such a low score. You could see the intense part of having great powers and the pessimistic part of continuously having the liability to hide your uniqueness and take care of the closest. The new Spiderman did little attempt to cover his id. I could really say that he was waving his mask throughout the movie. I thought of this movie as remarkable as ""The Avengers"" but evidently I was let down. Sam Ramie was enhanced and we want him back. If you've previously seen the 2002 version of Spiderman, then absolutely you won't find anything new here.<br/><br/>When you have a set presentation of any film, you can change the presentation you aimed for, it is all the time a risk. This risk did Not do any good for this solemnly mess. I don't want to be offensive to anyone by just sharing my sincere opinion. It is apparent that everybody's eyes were on the Parker personality, performed by Garfield. I believe he did a good job with what he had done. Sometimes, there was some clumsiness with the character, but it wasn't his mistake. The bad thing is at some spots I got a ""Harry Potter"" sensation by him. The director, in order to encourage this film, showed off that this film uses very slight cgi technology if any. But this was a big lie. Not only there is wide use of cgi, it's in fact very bad. The only element of this movie which I was pleased of is the leather jackets worn by Spiderman. You can buy all your leather jacket outfits for men and women from Desert Leather dot com who offer best quality leather jackets online at a very reasonable price.<br/><br/>This is Not the Spiderman I appreciate and I now I would in no way buy this on DVD. So, this is kind of boring. Movies to this extent, I individually enjoyed more from ""The A Team"", ""The Avengers"", ""Thor"", the first two versions of Spiderman, (But this Spiderman 3 was just awful). I went out 3 times to refill my soda which I had never done before in my life. I can't really say it was a bad movie, but after the other Spiderman movies I was really disappointed with this one. I would not rate it more than 4/10 on a voting scale!!"

The people who first loved the original could possibly be upset they weren't there, as i am, although I love the character Gwen Stacey and think that they worked that perfectly into the film. <br/><br/>I love how for this film they went a bit further into the story of Peters father, although it wasn't much it was still something to explain a few things that had people wondering from the original films (which were also great!)<br/><br/>To sum up, i loved this film.

","I was eager to see how they'd tackle rebooting this franchise particularly since the 2002 version from Sam Raimi was such a great success. Could they better it, or would they make a total hash of it? Turns out neither, really.<br/><br/>It seems the writers must have been fans of twilight or some other type of modern day adolescent girly slush, because instead of focusing on the core themes of Spider-Man (which has driven the character since the 60s), themes of Power, responsibility, alienation, loneliness, revenge...instead we got highlights from a Taylor Swift music video. Misty eyed, star crossed lovers, going all wobbly lipped with Coldplay songs in the background.<br/><br/>The action scenes, as you'd expect, were very well done - even if the story was a bit ham-fisted and rushed. It was entertaining enough and great to see spidey swinging about the screen again, dipping around skyscrapers. Unfortunately when you compare it to other superhero films of the last couple of years, it doesn't really stack up. The iron man franchise in particular has been superbly done, drawing just the right amount of comedy, drama and romance without ever making the audience squirm or cringe. Add to that the superb Avengers film and unfortunately The Amazing Spider Man doesn't really pull it's weight."
"zurnd","9","3","6","7 April 2013"," A New Spider-Man For A New Time Period
","Just recently, I did a review of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man from 2002. Now, I think it would be cool to have a look at the most recent reboot, The Amazing Spider-Man, directed by Marc Webb. After highly praising Spider-Man for it's comic book feeling scope and great take on the classic characters, what do I think of the revamp of my favorite superhero? I loved it, simply put. Sure, people will be comparing this one to the original, but to be honest, I really can't compare the two. I love them both evenly, but we are not here to compare the 2002 film and the 2012 film, we are here to talk about the 2012 reboot solely. So let's get started, shall we? Refill your web shooters, climb up the nearest wall and enjoy the review.<br/><br/>I think what I like most about this film is that it combines the modern day Spider-Man with the Spider-Man of the past. As the original Spider-Man film was much like the Steve Ditko era comics, this film is a lot like the Ultimate Spider-Man stories from the last decade. There is a much more modernized look to the film and the characters act like real life people do nowadays. For example, Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker/Spidey is a much more sarcastic, outspoken fellow who does what a lot of teens do these days. He explores, he gets into it with his aunt and uncle, he listens to music, and he skateboards. He's a lot like the modern day teen, rebellious and free, just like all of us are in one way or another. <br/><br/>This film also borrows key elements from the golden era, some elements that were even missing from the original Raimi film. Garfield's Spider-Man wields web shooters instead of organic webs and has his trademark sarcastic nature and attitude. Peter also has his first female flame from the comics, Gwen Stacy, who is portrayed by Emma Stone. She is a much more determined and headstrong female lead than Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane in the previous films, who always sat around, complaining about how Peter didn't support her or how Peter didn't care about her. I also liked Rhys Ifans as Dr. Curt Connors aka the Lizard, who comes off as a good man who just wanted to make a difference, but it ultimately turned him into a human reptile killing machine. Martin Sheen and Sally Field were also spectacular as Uncle Ben and Aunt May, and Dennis Leary is incredible as Gwen's father, Captain George Stacey. Unlike his comic book counterpart, Stacey despises Spider-Man and it takes him until the end of the film to finally trust him as the hero he really is. <br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man is simply put, a New Spider-Man for a New Time Period. The audience who grew up with the original Raimi film are now much older, and a new audience will come in to cherish and savor this new take on the colorful hero. Some people who watched the original might even like this one better, for their opinions and perspectives have changed throughout the years. But I like both Spider-Man films and I hope that, in this new series of Spider-Man flicks, they keep the juices flowing and make Spider-Man retain what we admire him for.<br/><br/>Oh, and one more thing. I like the look of Spidey's suit. It actually looks like something an average teenager would stitch together in a matter of minutes. Way to keep the film diverse from the original, Webb! The Amazing Spider-Man is an exciting treat overall."
"Mr_PCM","8","3","6","17 March 2013"," Simple effective reboot of a comic-book staple
","Comic book movies in recent years have tended to be greeted with great regularity with the description 'darker' or variations thereof. This culminated with the excellent but 'darker' Dark Knight Rises, which bordered on pitch-black and outright depressing. However, the latest incarnation of the Spiderman movie series, the reboot Amazing Spiderman has followed in the footsteps of The Avengers by lightening up and getting back to the roots of the comic, with puns and one-liners galore giving the film a much more entertaining vibe than the convoluted and take-themselves-too-seriously original trilogy. However, the comedy generally doesn't overshadow the story too much, and themes of loss and isolation are more deftly dealt with, making this new Marvel superhero film a more rounded experience, which again paves the way for yet another franchise.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spiderman, which was born from Sam Raimi's aborted Spiderman 4 and wiped the slate clean of Tobey Maguire's stories, goes back to the beginning and focuses on Peter Parker's schooldays - a time period largely glossed over in the original films. Science again plays a big part in the genesis of both Spiderman and his latest nemesis - the Lizard. This time however, the science doesn't even attempt to make itself plausible, resulting in explanation that can be just accepted blithely without too much head-scratching. Otherwise, the story follows the -by-now standard origin story format, so no prizes for guessing any plot twists (such as they are): Hero starts life as an outsider in school, aptitude for science, freakish pseudo-scientific incident, tragic loss, responsibility of new powers, etc etc. Everyone knows how the story goes, yet seeing how it gets started is always enjoyable in comic-book adaptations, and this one is no different.<br/><br/>In the perfectly-named Marc Webb's reboot, the red and blue spandex is taken on by Andrew Garfield, while Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy replaces Kirsten Dunst's Mary-Jane as the webslinger's love interest. Both do an adequate job, although Garfield is perhaps too perfectly groomed, buffed and coiffed to play the geeky, nerdy wimp that is Spiderman's alter ego. Martin Sheen and Sally Field are perfectly suitable as Garfield's surrogate parents, but the real standout of the piece is Rhys Ifans - of Notting Hill and 51st State fame - in a surprisingly understated and effective performance as Dr Curt Connors, the hero's mentor-come-reptilian nemesis.<br/><br/>There are many things to enjoy about this latest Spiderman film, including allowing Parker to be a teenager, complete with requisite teen angst, school issues and romance, and there are also some interesting and amusing explorations of the hero's controversial new mechanical web-shooters, making Peter Parker 2.0 a more interesting superhero than Maguire's slightly one-dimensional responsibility-burdened Tarzan-with-webbing. The neat references to the comic-book lore are interesting and deft, without being hidden away so only the true comic book nerds notice them. However, with a run time of over 2 hours, the time taken for the iconic costume to make its first appearance does seem to drag at times, while the lack of the Jonah Jameson-type character feels like a hole in the story.<br/><br/>Interestingly, given the somewhat lightened tone of this new Spiderman film, the music has changed from a largely bombastic and anthemic rock soundtrack to a more cerebral classical-led score, with only Coldplay the solitary nod to pop music. Yet somehow this counterbalances the comedic touches that threaten occasionally to drag the first half of the film down into parody, resulting in a well-rounded film. Overall, while it is unlikely this film will win any original screenplay awards, particularly given the mere decade that has passed since the original, The Amazing Spiderman is an enjoyable entry into Marvel's comic book film adaptation canon, dealing deftly with the familiar themes without beating the audience over the head with them like Thor's sledgehammer."

","Why we needed another Spiderman series after the recent (2002/2007) Tobey McGuire run is probably the same reason we keep getting remakes of foreign films (Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, etc): they make money. And it looks like the public will never tire of Marvel Comic Book stories, so might as well settle in and give them a try. It is an evening's entertainment approaching 3 hours of visual shenanigans that are pretty entertaining.<br/><br/>There are some differences between this Spiderman and the last - aside from cast: the stories are different although they both claim to show the origin of this magic transformation of a lonely confused young man trying to figure out who he is until he discovers some super secrets and the power to change into a humanoid spider-gifted hero. It all starts out well enough - Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is shy and unable to relate to about everyone except his aunt and uncle (Sally Field and Martin Sheen do a fine job here). He fails at a run-in with the high school bully Flash (a hunky and promising Chris Zylka), is noticed by the perky Gwen (Emma Stone) who is involved in Peter's introduction to scientist Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) who is an old friend of Peter's strangely disappeared father (Campbell Scott) and mother (Embeth Davidtz). Peter is smart, discovers a formula in his father's briefcase, and ultimately is able to transform himself into Spiderman - his nemesis being The Lizard who is actually Dr. Connors taking a potent experimental solution. After a lot of flying around on buildings and throwing spider web tendrils at everything including The Lizard, Peter is hunted as a threat until Gwen's policeman father (Denis Leary) eventually bonds with the insecure Peter in a life saving situation. Then we are given footage of what is up for the sequel...<br/><br/>The human (read 'credible') parts work the best - Garfield and Stone make a fine pair and Sheen and Field give fine cameos. Once the transformation takes place the film becomes a lesson in special effects and that is fun enough to watch. It just goes on far too long...and there is more to come. Makes you wonder when the next cycle of Spiderman will come along. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"
"anglesmith719","Null","3","6","24 November 2012"," The Amazing Spider-Man Is Truly Amazing!
","The newest adaptation of the Spider-Man story, although a bit early, is arguably the best one yet. The guys in my office at DISH think that was due to the fact that the script stays a lot closer to the original Spider-Man comics plot, but I think it was because we were giving more information about the disappearance of Peter's parents. Also the writers made a bold move to have Peter spend more time in high school and I am positive that that is going to pay off in the long run. I never have time to stop at the Redbox down the street to grab movies, but since I started renting from Blockbuster at Home through DISH the discs are already waiting in my mailbox when I get off work and this was an awesome first choice."
"danyasmiles","4","3","6","1 November 2012"," disappointing
","I never really understood why they were doing a remake of spider-man. I was hoping for something stronger in concept, perhaps better acting, but i was sorely disappointed. I didn't understand why Gwen (who is a high school student) is an intern in some acclaimed lab. I didn't understand how peter came up with that webbing, or how people of the city liked spider-man enough to help him out in the end. It made no sense! However, the room with the spiders spinning was pretty cool and how peter got bitten was pretty cool, but that was about it! The comic relief between uncle Ben and aunt may held nothing more than that, comic relief. The death of uncle Ben in the previous movie was far more poignant than in this movie, but it does make for a logical explanation for how spider-man came into being. The back story with how peter's parents went missing seemed merely an excuse to make another spider-man movie. It didn't seem all that fleshed out, and peter just happens to stumble into all of that mess and mystery, is just flabbergasting. So why was this movie made again?"
"kdnor2011","8","3","6","27 October 2012"," Not Amazing, but pretty damn Good.
","Here's a little confession, I have not seen the Sam Raimi Spiderman movies. Nor have I read any of the comics, or really watched any form of media about him, I think I saw a few episodes of the old cartoon once, but that's about it. So unlike everyone else, I didn't go into this movie with ridicuously high expectations. And for me, this movie actually exceeded my expectations. I just wanted a fun movie, but this movie was actually a very well done, pretty emotional movie that still managed to be fun.<br/><br/>There's quite a bit going on here, and because of this the film seems to forget about some of it's plot points. Maybe they were setting up for a sequel, but can we really just forget about some of these things that I won't spoil. And also because there is so much going on, sometimes it will either be going painfully slow, or feels rushed. I mean seriously it takes like 20 seconds after the bite and Peter already knows he has powers, but it takes almost a half hour after that for him to actually become Spider Man. Also some of the special effects weren't that great.<br/><br/>But what I really liked was the characters in this movie. I actually really liked Peter, he came off as a real person. He was nice but was sarcastic, he was picked on, but he wasn't a nerd, he gets dramatic about the stuff going on in his life, but he has a sense of humor. There's a bit of an emotional pull to the movie involving his relationship with the other characters. Gwen was likable, she was what a good female lead should be: tough, smart, likable, funny, but even she can get into trouble. Half the time I forgot Emma Stone was playing her. And the villain was threatening, but kind of sympathetic. Despite some of the effects looking fake, most of them look pretty damn amazing. And it's just fun, that's one thing Marvel has over DC most of the time, they have a sense of fun to them. The movie is serious, but it's also a little campy, I mean there's only so serious that you can take a man dressed in that suit. It has a real fun sense of humor (including one of, if not the best Stan Lee Cameos), along with some fun action scenes. And as for the story, it's pretty basic, but it works.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider Man is definitely one of the better superhero orgin stories I've seen. Certainly more fun than Batman Begins and Iron Man. Despite some slow scenes, and some rushed scenes, the film manages to balance the seriousness of trying to make a superhero orgin story, and the fun that a comicbook movie like this should have. And while some people were disappointed, my expectaitons were actually surpassed."
"Bmore1984","4","3","6","26 August 2012"," Why was it made?
","Spider-man at this point is crawling in circles. The Amazing Spider-man makes no contribution to the Peter Parker continuum. There is nothing new or noteworthy about the 2012 Spidey. Instead of utilizing a fresh, innovative approach, Marc Webb and his writers replicate the formula drafted in the original film and redundantly make us witness the transformation of Peter Parker from outcast to superhero again. We saw this spiel only ten years ago. In comparison, see what Christopher Nolan envisioned for the Batman reboot: a realist, dark approach in stark contradiction to the Schumacher pluff. Here there is no appreciable difference between The Amazing Spider-man and the Sam Raimi trilogy. It's not a reboot; it's a recycle.<br/><br/>And if you're going to recycle, then at least improve upon the original. It doesn't; its fatal sin is actual regression. The Maguire-Dunst combo was more dynamic and likably than Garfield-Stone – poor Emma was miserably miscast. In an era, where the audience is accustomed to dynamic heels, what we get is an over-sized CGI-ish lizard lacking all nuance and substance; a completely forgettable, default villain. <br/><br/>It's not all bad though. The 3D aspect is one redeeming quality of the film especially in the latter scene where spidey is soaring through the rainy sky coming to the rescue. It's a fun moment."

","The Amazing Spiderman (2012)<br/><br/>What do you do with a movie that's impeccably well made, acted to the pitch required of a superhero movie with realistic themes, and filled with really fluid wow factors? I mean, this is a really compelling movie on some levels. And if you like these kinds of movies (and there is no shortage of them every year) this is one of the best, technically, and from the point of view of unaffected acting.<br/><br/>What no one wants to say or hear in this context is that the movie isn't everything it could be. Or even worse, it's everything that other movies have already been, including earlier Spiderman movies. Marc Webb isn't at fault--he directs with aplomb, and gets the most from the series of action scenes. It's the writers, and the producers who are guiding the writers, who have to take some rap in presenting another movie about the same kind of thing we've seen too too many times. Or at least too too many times for me, for singing praises.<br/><br/>But if you don't mind the formula again, you'll be in for a treat. I know I enjoyed it all even so. The swinging through space, the life or death fights with a hugely powerful monster, the last minute race to stop the doomsday device (with a timer to let us know exactly how much suspense lies ahead), the girl who is smart and pretty and actually pretty capable, too. All of this is in place, and well done.<br/><br/>Well done. Is that enough? Up to you. It's hardly the kind of movie the invites deep thinking or parsing out the components. It's more the kind of movie to just rush in headlong and enjoy, and drive home thinking about something else."

Previous entries ignored the balletic beauty of Spiderman's poses in the comic books. Film makers need to recognise that we love Superheros because they look damn cool: Iron Man looks like Greek God; Batman looks like a brooding gargoyle; and Spidey looks like a sleek red and blue Mikhail Baryshnikov.<br/><br/>Two...The Amazing Spiderman is the greatest superhero script ever scribed. Like a celluloid guerrilla, it captures our hearts and minds rather than rely solely upon the brute force of special effects and snarky one-liners. It contains the most succinct piece of drama I have ever seen in which Peter Parker, in one deft move, reveals both his heart and his alter ego to the object of his desire.<br/><br/>Three The love story. Yes, I said it. Ordinarily, my cynicism for cinematic calf-love knows no deeper depths. However, the chemistry between Peter and Gwen dredged up my own sickly sweet memories of young love, so much so, I was happily disgusted with myself.<br/><br/>There are many more than three reasons to see The Amazing Spider Man.

","¨We all have secrets: the ones we keep... and the ones that are kept from us.¨<br/><br/>Spider-Man is back with a reboot and although it seemed sort of early for it, Marc Webb did a great job with this film by refreshing the story and the characters. I enjoyed the first three Spider-Man films, although I wasn't a huge fan of them. Webb not only refreshed the series, but he also improved it in my opinion by doing one thing: getting Andrew Garfield to play Peter Parker. Garfield, who I really appreciated in The Social Network despite having flown under the radar in that movie, is excellent as Peter Parker. He has the right amount of charisma and wit that his character needs. I loved his performance much more than Tobey Maguire's. The other great addition to this reboot was the inclusion of Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy, Peter's original love interest in the comics and who was played by Bryce Dallas Howard in the third film. Emma Stone is one of the greatest young talents on the screen and she is just lovely in this film and had great chemistry with Garfield. Webb had proved in the past that he could make a strong romantic film with his feature film debut, 500 Days of Summer, but I wasn't sure how the action was going to work out in The Amazing Spider-Man. The truth of the matter is that the action scenes were excellently choreographed and the film was visually stunning; I had a great time at the theater. I don't know if a reboot was absolutely necessary at this stage, but I had a fun time nonetheless. <br/><br/>There are a few similarities between the original Spider-Man and this film, but for the most part screenwriters James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent, and Steve Kloves chose a different approach in this version of the superhero story. They focused more on Peter Parker's (Andrew Garfield) troubles in school as a teenager and how he dealt with his parents death. After leaving him with his Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field), his parents never returned so Peter was raised by them with strong moral values. Despite having a great relationship with them, Peter is still hurt about the loss of his biological parents and is trying to deal with it as well as his growing feelings for his classmate Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). While trying to deal with all these normal teenage feelings, Peter discovers a forgotten briefcase of his father which contains some secrets about his past. Peter finds a picture of his father with Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans), who used to be his good friend and science partner in Oscorp. That is when Peter decides to visit Oscorp and is bitten by a genetic spider. We all know the result of that spider bite: Peter becomes Spider-Man. As he tries to manage these new special abilities, Peter also befriends Dr. Connors in search for answers about his parents past. Peter deciphers an equation he found from his father's briefcase which allows Dr. Connors to make a huge advance in his genetic experiments, which ultimately leads to him becoming the Lizard, Spider-Man's nemesis.<br/><br/>If you would've told me that the silly guy from Notting Hill would be playing The Lizard I would've thought it was a joke. Rhys Ifans is great in comedies, but I never imagined he could play an important villain with such success. The people behind the casting of this film did a tremendous job because every character seemed to be played by the perfect actor. I mean who better to play Captain Stacy than Denis Leary? Every role just fit perfectly and that was what ultimately made The Amazing Spider-Man such a fun film. Andrew Garfield with his unique wit and charm works almost in the same way that Robert Downey Jr. did as Tony Stark. It was as if these actors were born to play these roles. The entire cast was great in this film, so was the crew behind the special effects department. The film looks really good and is exactly what a summer blockbuster movie is supposed to be. The Amazing Spider-Man might not be as great as The Avengers, but it still was a really entertaining film worth the ticket price. Spider-Man fans will be pleased and I doubt anyone will be missing Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker after this performance, although I still have my reservations over whether or not a reboot of the series was necessary at this early stage.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com"
"zordmaker","8","3","6","8 July 2012"," Finally, story over smash and bash is back in style
","First the Avengers and now this.<br/><br/>After 15 years it seems story is finally back in style for superhero films. After so long with each film year after year trying to beat the last with it's bangs, effects, wow factor ad not much else.<br/><br/>I've always measured the greatness of films by considering whether (or not) I would want to sit through a film again. A ""Favorite"" film of course I can watch dozens of times, etc.<br/><br/>Before TASM, I cant think of a single superhero flick that's been released in the past 10 years that I have wanted to see again. At best I could get my gratification by watching a crucial five minutes but never be bothered sitting through the whole thing.<br/><br/>TASM (despite its length) is a film I could sit through again - end to end. On so many levels it works and that's because there's attention to detail. Yes there's still those stupid unbelievable moments (now come on.. a lizard and a toilet?) but on the most part finally TASM puts science back into SciFi. The story tries so hard to explain why things are the way they are and watching this unfold (without having to tax the mind through plot twists) is entertaining indeed.<br/><br/>TASM works because the hero is limited. Rules have been set as to what Spidey can (and can't) do and the producers have rigidly stuck by that rule book. That's something that was sadly lacking in the previous Spidey franchise where so much stuff went on without any explanation at all, every time the third act just became too unbelievable and any illusion was destroyed.<br/><br/>TASM explores so many aspects that the original franchise either didn't want to touch or couldn't be bothered to because they were so busy proving they had the best special effects for the given week when they were produced. In TASM, you get the idea that it wouldn't matter what the effects looked like, the film would still stand up on it's own and be entertaining. It'll be a hard one to sequel.<br/><br/>And the best thing is.. it really didn't cost that much to make now, did it guys. Geez 20 years ago we Aussies were making superflicks in this category for for $40m and we thought that was a lot of dosh. Then came Kevin Costly and his $200m flop and that seemed to set a new bench mark for how to waste insane sums of money in film that everyone has followed since.<br/><br/>Now here's a superflick that cost less in todays' money than that Kevin Costly crap did 15 years ago and will easily make that back four times worldwide even if it doesn't win the US box office this week. All because they told a story instead of just making another long music video.<br/><br/>I'm glad I lived long enough to see that there's still hope for superflicks. TASM (and The Avengers before it) will hopefully become part of a new breed that will finally sweep away the crap and result in films which anyone, anywhere can sit down and enjoy, end to end - just like the super hero flicks of long ago.<br/><br/>ZM"

"nishikazuhiro","10","6","16","7 July 2012"," Better than the older movies
","Now this is what I call an excellent ""reboot"". Why? Not only this version carries more details and has a more intelligent dialogue among the characters, but it also shows the Spider-man in a more faithful way, like it would be in the comics (he is more sarcastic, has more fluid movements and provokes his opponents). The plot is also more faithful compared to the older movie. The introduce of Dr. Connors, Gwen Stacy and the fact that Spider-man has to create his own web comproves it.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the small details, like the fact that people might get surprised that he doesn't wear glasses in the beginning (which makes you think that the director forgot this fact), but a little bit later shows Peter removing his contact lenses. Also, in the older movie, Peter only took some time to get used to his new powers after the got bitten and then he was already flying like a champ, which is very strange, because you body has to adapt to it's new condition. The new movie show this transition more slow and Spider-man is somewhat clumsy until the end of the movie. This is a great ""small"" and very important detail in my opinion.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-man also puts more weight to the responsibility that Peter has as a superhero, like in the part that he tries to save the boy at the bridge. Even you can feel this by the end of this scene.<br/><br/>Overall this movie, to me, is just and simple plain better than the older Spider-man trilogy. I really enjoyed watching it and you're not going to regreat it."
"virindra","10","6","16","29 June 2012"," See this one in the cinema, definitely!
","When I heard this movie would come out I was very skeptic. Andrew Garfield is not very known as a good actor. He doesn't have the looks. What new could this spider-man movie bring after the trilogy of Rami? After seen the commercials about spider-man to be the outlaw, a vigilante, I got this cheap feeling about this movie was to become a similar reboot of the spider-man movies like Batman begins was with Christian Bale. For Batman begins it worked out great, even with that movie I had my doubts at first.<br/><br/>Due to the high rating om IMDb I had to see this one in the cinema and so I did. Garfield turned out to be a fantastic Peter Parker and an actor. This movie had almost the same story like Rami's first movie had. This Lizard was a cross-over between Green Goblin and Doc Oc. The movie was moving all the time. Spiderman had almost no time to sit down. As a viewer I got entertained all the time. The movie was funny, scary, very good.<br/><br/>The acting was good, I loved Emma Stone, Martin Sheen, Sally Field, Irrfan Khan. Special effects were great, soundtrack was awesome. There were some little mistakes, like Peter Parker breaks the window of the front door of his aunt and uncle and at night the door is fixed. But I don't think we should really be picky about this, especially when I left the theater well entertained. I was glad that spider-man shot his webs and really hit something all the time and not hitting the open air and still now falling down, if you know what I mean.<br/><br/>Some people keep comparing this movie to Raimi's spider-man movies. But let those movies be. Rami's movies were, except the third one, very good too. So I don't think this is a reboot of Raimi's Spiderman movies. This is an improvement of the Rami's movies. To be honest I think The dark knight rises has a big competition this year. I wonder if there will come more spider-man movies with Garfield. Will it be a trilogy again?"
"3xHCCH","6","6","16","29 June 2012"," We Can See Why It Should NOT Have Been Rebooted So Soon
","There were so many reasons why I was ready NOT to like this movie. First of all, the original Sam Raimi-Tobey Maguire trilogy was so recent, and were done very well and did so well also box-office-wise. I did not really feel the need to make this reboot at all, much less, too soon after the ""Spider Man 3."" I was also very leery about the choice of Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker/Spider Man. Watching the trailers, I do not know what it was about Garfield's face and body build that did not seem right to be Peter Parker. Anyway, the hype was still really building up, as evidenced by the grand first day showing today in almost 100% of cinemas all over the country. Of course, it was inevitable that my whole family will still go and watch!<br/><br/>As it began by telling Peter Parker's high school life, you see that Director Marc Webb was trying so hard to make it different from the first Tobey Maguire movie, and this can be noticed as the movie went along. The story of how Peter was bitten by the super-spider was so far- fetched and unbelievable. The story of how Gwen and Peter became a couple was so rushed. The story of Peter's parents which was what I thought would be a main theme in this movie was hardly tackled in detail at all. <br/><br/>Andrew Garfield painted a different Peter Parker than Tobey Maguire. Garfield made the role his own by amp-ing up the angst. I have to grant that Andrew was a better dramatic actor than Tobey. His scenes with veteran actors Martin Sheen and Sally Field (as Uncle Ben and Aunt May) were heartfelt and sincere, as with his romantic scenes with Emma Stone (as Gwen Stacy). However, he seems to become schizophrenic when he dons his Spider Man costume, as he becomes all too cocky for comfort. <br/><br/>Emma Stone acted very well as Gwen Stacy. She was a much better love interest than Kirsten Dunst was as MJ in the first movie. I guess it was because Gwen was written to be smart and courageous, unlike MJ who was nothing more than a mere damsel in distress. Rhys Ifans does an effective departure from his usual comedy roles to play the tragic Dr. Curt Connors. It was just too bad that the story of his descent into Lizard madness was too sudden to be affecting or logical. <br/><br/>Admittedly, there were so awesome-looking visual effects in this movie. The cartoony multi-color palette of the Tobey version was replaced by a darker and more serious mood in this one, more fitting into the Marvel canons. Overall though, while the effort was there but the final impact of this film could eventually be forgettable. Even the extra scene in the end credits hinting a second installment was predictable. After watching, all my three kids declared that they liked the Tobey version than this. Ultimately, we still remember the Tobey Maguire films too much for this film to take any serious roots into our memory. Let's see if the next installments will make a difference."
"IMDbUser93","1","9","28","6 July 2012"," What has become of you spidey?
","Watched it, and it is in my opinion the worst Spider-Man movie there is. The movie is more focused on the emotional relationship between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy, there is not enough action it's all boring conversations and feelings.<br/><br/>The actors looks way to old to be in high school. They also got Dr. Connors character all wrong, Connors wanted to maintain his human nature in the comic books, he didn't want to play a god. This Connors was very gloomy. Personally I think Andrew Garfield is a bad choice for Spider-Man, he looks like something that escaped Twilight, he doesn't look anything like a nerdy outcast.<br/><br/>In the movie nothing about Peter's parents is really unveiled. I was looking forward to see the movie, I thought it was an interesting reboot, I liked the new costume and that they have gone back to the web shooters. But it was a great disappointment, I was hoping the Lizard could safe this movie but the villain was poorly made and nothing like I had expected.<br/><br/>To me the best Spider-Man is and always will be Tobey Maguire."

","It was a much different approach form the 2002 version of Spider-Man, but still just as great. If not, better! 136-minutes of amazing science fiction entertainment. Great special effects. I got lost in the movie, not one point did I ever get bored with it. To make it clearer, this movie has you laughing (Spider-Man's sarcasm toward the Lizard, the carjacker), crying(When 'Uncle Ben' dies), and more importantly, sitting on the edge of your seat. It's a family movie (rated PG-13). To people who read the famous Stan Lee original comics, a lot of this movie stays true to the comic books, although much of it is Hollywood-twisted, like most movies. I would even go see it again! It's definitely worth seeing."

His path puts him on a collision course with Dr. Curt Connors, his father's former partner.<br/><br/>Right I am going to say one word for this film Amazing It really was this my reason. First the Acting is just brilliant from Andrew Garfield He really shows emotion and the dry sense of humour that spider-man really had and Emma Stone and Rhys Ifans both played there roles very well. This film isn't just a story about a boy who gets powers and uses them .In this It shows the drama side of Spider-man and how he has to push on from later events .Then in the second half there is a bunch of action and well thought out Action sequences to give the film its true spider-man. Now The humour in this film is brilliant would come hilarious to a Young child all the way up to seniors it really keeps a smile on your face and i tell you now Marc webb has really made a good job of this film a lot better than Sam Raimi this film is the true Spider-man film.<br/><br/>10/10 BRILLIANT"
"achyutaghosh","9","5","13","29 June 2012"," The Amazing Spiderman- fly, swing and get positively amazed!
","""The best types of promises are those that are meant to be broken""<br/><br/>Superhero movies reached their nadir with the atrocious and mindless Batman and Robin in 1997, which is why the next superhero movie to come out- Sam Raimi's Spiderman in 2002 is remains especially memorable, in addition to it being a great movie in itself. So why make a remake? Is Marvel's comic book chest this threadbare? Or is it a testament to the fact that no matter darkest nights or assembling avengers, Spidey remains one of the most bankable stars, and a seriously capable superhero.<br/><br/>You have seen it all, you have read it all, folks- coming of age story where boy becomes spider and spider becomes man, dealing with loss and taking on responsibility. High school kid gets bitten by a radioactive spider and begins to acquire spider-inspired superpowers. That and personal issues conspire to make a vigilante out of this teenager, resplendent in impossibly tight red and blue spandex. The first hour is predictably mushy family stuff, so have some patience, because the second half literally explodes out of the screen with visceral 3D action.<br/><br/>Yet that's where the similarity ends, and there are a bunch of things that make this movie to find its own voice. Compared to the 2002 version, this one is a far truer representation of Spiderman and his universe as Stan Lee envisaged. For starters, this is more about Peter Parker than Spiderman, Peter is the face, Spidey is just an act. Its a teenage superhero, so much of the movie takes place in a college. This one is actually the polar opposite of The Dark Knight- nothing heavy handed, mostly light-footed, breezy treatment, with the core being a love story rather than moral corruption. This version attempts to answer a lot many questions that the previous brushed under the carpet- for example, what happened to Peter's parents? How does Spidey get his webs? Where does he gets his super sized brains from? And this Spiderman is THE Spiderman- right out of the comic book downright funny- always ready with the one-liners, not able to take out his kid self whatever situation he may be in. <br/><br/>Director Marc Webb who certainly knows how to weave love stories (as shown in his previous outing, 500 Days of Summer) , gives this movie its moments of magic- No upside down kisses, but Spiderman using a mobile phone, the sequence in a crowded train where Peter begins to discover his powers, and him using a web to tell Gwen that he is Spiderman, in addition to the Godzilla inspired climactic showdown with the Lizard where Spidey keeps delightfully improvising just to keep up with a powerful villain were awesome. <br/><br/>Unlike wide eyed Toby Maguire, Andrew Garfield with his nervous energy, and a nerdy demeanor, gives his own spin on Peter Parker. Effortlessly charismatic, even a bit of a showoff right from the start, with a slightly reckless attitude- he even takes on the school bully when in a non super-powered state. He is bumbling, awkward, socially inept, but deeply charming. Hell, what a casting coup this is- watch closely, even without his spidey suit, Andrew with his thin frame and gangly arms looks like a spider! Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy is no bimbo and not a perennially damsel in distress as Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane Watson was, but she is smart, sassy, and sensitive-perfectly complementing our hero. She in terrific form, as the only one who is able to enter the sanctum sanctorum of this confused, gawky teenager struggling to use his powers, and makes him her own, and in so many ways, completing him. Martin Sheen and Sally Field as Uncle Ben and Aunt May are solid, and our very own Irfan Khan plays a small but crucial role in the film.<br/><br/>It has its weaknesses though- sometimes it felt the editors went on strike, not in an overtly bad way though, but the movie felt a bit overlong. For all of Sam Raimi's flaws, no one can still question him for making impact in his trilogy, this one though sincere, is less so. Rhys Ifans as Dr Curt Connor whose experiments go wrong and turns into a giant Lizard is serviceable, but not scene stealing as Raimi's Doc Ock and Green Goblin were. And at the end, he is not truly evil, just a kindly soul gone astray.<br/><br/>I have a secret to share. When I was a kid, I used to try to get myself bitten by spiders- Spiderman has always been and will remain my favorite superhero- not only because he is vulnerable, but because he always has a knack of seeing the lighter side of things. And unlike other superheroes, his character has not changed according to the whims and fancies of writers. The last Spiderman movie was just 5 years ago, yet this reboot is welcome enough for me just to see Andrew Garfield as the titular character- he is the best Spidey ever, and his act alone is worth the price of admission. From the scheme of things, a sequel seems to be already in the works. But I have had enough of reptiles, is it too much for me to wish for more ""Venom""-ous action? <br/><br/>9/10- Go ahead, take to the air with Spidey- fly, swing and get positively amazed, enjoy with your family!"

","The Amazing Spider man could be treated as a glass half full/empty depending on which side of the fence you are on. Compared to Sam Raimi i think that this film does not measure up at all. TAS i agree with most critics saying that it was too soon to make a reboot since its only 5 years after spider man 3. While this movie may have some nice elements to boot it is in a way not Amazing like the 1st film. This one lacks any decent action or romance i feel like Marc Webb didn't really put any effort into this film or at least not enough. <br/><br/>I have little complaints of the actors but some complaints against the characters they play. Andrew did a tolerable job as the webhead but he was more rebellious then a nerd which peter parker is NOT. Emma was the same as Gwen but she lacked any innocence gwen has in the comics. Making her a science intern made her look occupied instead of loving. Rhys was great as Connors but the lizard i felt like was too much off character. Lizard's plan while relatively the same as in most comics did not live up to doc ock and ""maybe"" the grren goblin but was better then sandy or venom. <br/><br/>In short this film i feel like should not have been made. I see this film as a knockoff to a great spiderman film when compared to raimi"

The previous versions of spider-man may not have been the greatest but at least they were watchable.<br/><br/>I've been trying to figure out how this movie received an IMDb rating of 7.4 and more importantly how it grossed 700 million.

"rds_1","1","8","25","24 July 2012"," Disappointment
","(why the spoiler tick? isn't that a given in reviews?)<br/><br/>First of all when I saw the trailer/teaser I was already disappointed seeing that this spider-man had to rely on tech for his web-slinging. That has always been something that bothered me in the spider-man stories so I was happy with the previous movies where they did not ""cripple"" spider-man in that fashion. Makes no sense a spider/man hybrid with no ""natural"" web-slinging abilities. Also compared to spider-woman, spider-man is quite weak, the reliance on tech only ads to this weakness (they should have been more or less equal). In general I've always been hoping that he would somehow become stronger so the Venom story was great in the beginning, disappointing later on though, it just couldn't be a blessing, it had to be a curse. But all the bruises in this movie made him look even weaker than ever.<br/><br/>Why they chose ""lizard-man"" as the villain? I don't get it, that has always been a rather unpopular/boring character. They could have chosen so much more fun adversaries. Mysterio for instance (great for the big screen with all the illusions, especially in 3D). Also what makes no sense with this villain, that he loses his arm when reverting back to human. If you regrow a limb and then mutate to a lizard-man why would that new arm then mutate back into oblivion?<br/><br/>I much rather would have watched a 4th spider-man movie with madam-web for instance and maybe some story lines from one of the better games.<br/><br/>If you ask me the whole Gwen Stacy + high school doesn't really fit. Not with MJ as a neighbor (I assume that's still the case even though it's not mentioned).<br/><br/>By the way, I might have missed it as I occasionally ""dosed off"" but where the hell was the phrase ""with great power comes great responsibility""?"
"pushfrog_2000","9","7","21","4 July 2012"," A Great Summer Flick, A Worthy Spider-Man Story
","Other people have said it more eloquently than I ever possibly can, so I will leave short and simple: this is a great movie. It takes the story that we all know and love and places it in a real New York, with real people whose lives have real emotions and real consequences. It does not cater to any specific age group, but pumps the story with family-friendly nods to all. There is the perfect blend of humor and drama, and every character is given a strong backbone for their personalities and developments.<br/><br/>My only issue with the movie was a lack of a prominent character of color. While we saw a New York rich with people of different races, there were only two characters of racial minority given lines, and one was used as a gag. It would have been nice to have Peter interact with more racially diverse people.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie to everyone, though. It has some flaws, but it is an agreeable movie with most crowds, and is just generally entertaining."
"maa_aaa","10","4","10","13 July 2012"," Simply, Amazing
","This movie is way better than the last 3. It deserves a lot of praise for its cast selection and the talent. Andrew Garfield is simply amazing and is a great actor, he portrays Perter Parker very well.People shouldn't even compare it with the others, but you do compare it to the first since this is the first in the series. Don't go saying it isn't as good as the second when this is the first. It certainly beat the first one in Raimi's series. Wait till the second one to compare it to Spiderman 2. It deserves more than a 7.7, i would give it at least an 9 to 9.5. And for the ones that say it uses the same plot points as the old ones, of course it uses the same plot points,its spider-man. And don't even start by saying it copies batman by saying it has a realistic dark-Knight vibe, dark knight didn't create that theme so you cant really say its a copy. Its just a way the director wanted to show spider-man is more realistic rather than the cheesy Raimi movies. Overall this movie is truly amazing, Andrew Garfield deserves a lot for what he has done with the character, and its perfect. If it had come instead of the old spider-man it would have been the movie of the decade."
"destruction-420-755975","10","4","10","11 July 2012"," To address the people giving it low ratings for less than reputable reasons... seriously
","OK, this movie was better than the other spiderman movies in my opinion. I'm a huge spiderman fan and the gripes people have with this movie are: He doesn't seem like a super hero, he seems weak. News flash. When spiderman first got his powers he wasn't 'spiderman' there's a learning curve. In the next movies I'm sure he will be more like the spiderman in the Sam Raimi movies, but in those movies he was basically a pro at web swinging right away and honestly, spidermans powers would take a lot to get used to, he isn't superman. Another thing they complain about is his personality not matching when he's spiderman. That makes no sense to me, psephologist have proved people are different when they are behind a mask. Christoper Nolan knew that when he made batman, they say that you're only your socially calibrated self in without a mask, but you're your real self behind one. People also say it's a rip off of the dark knight... because it's dark? The dark knight was a good movie but I feel like it's getting overrated. ...I gotta tell you a secrete ...I didn't wanna have to tell you but ...Lifes a little dark, get over it. People said the drama wasn't good, in my opinion it was, but I mean not great. So I'll give them that maybe. They said he takes his mask off too easily. Well I think they are helping shape his character. Spoiler, but Gwen Stacy is gonna die, and he wont tell Marry Jane who he is, or he will at least be hesitant because of that. The original spiderman skipped that part, and it felt unnatural that he wouldn't just tell her. I wish they would have had Harry Osborn in the movie, other wise it seems like they just dump the Osborns on us in the next one. They also said that the main point was about his parents but you never find out through the whole movie... I think they did that on purpose... you should have stayed after the credits and watched the ending."
"mroalf30000","10","4","10","8 July 2012"," A short review
","I really do not understand why so many people are hating this movie, it is a lot closer to comics and generally much better than the original Spider-Man trilogy. I enjoyed Spider-Man 1 and 2 but I have always hated how they changed the story so much and the acting. Tobey Mcguire is a good actor, he really is, but he was a pretty bad Peter Parker/Spider- Man and Kirsten Dunst as Mary-Jane (who I have always hated in the comics as well) was so incredibly annoying and bland. Andrew Garfield is a perfect choice for Peter Parker and Spider-Man and played the role very well. Gwen Stacy is my favourite romantic partner in the comics (because she actually does something as opposed to Mary-Jane who was useless and moaned at Peter for being Spider-Man) and Emma Stone was also perfect for the role. Admittedly, the Lizard is not my favourite Spider-Man villain, in fact he is one of my least favourites, and also I wasn't particularly fond of the design of the Lizard in the movie, he turned out to be an interesting and decent villain, plus Rhys Ifans is a fantastic actor so it couldn't have gone wrong there. Overall, the Amazing Spider-Man is definitely the best of the Spider-Man films and I know it wouldn't get half of the complaints it is receiving if the Raimi trilogy didn't exist as people can't just seem to move on. They would not have been satisfied if they had just made Spider-Man 4, look at how much the 3rd film changed the entire story and how badly it ruined the trilogy, giving THAT a sequel would have been awful, just look into what Sam Raimi said he would have done. Vulture I could have dealt with, but having Felica Hardy not as the Black Cat but turning her into a super powered villain that doesn't even exist? It makes me wonder how Sam Raimi was even allowed to make Spider-Man films in the first place, no wonder Sony wanted to reboot the franchise. Anyway, coming back to the Amazing Spider-Man, it truly does live up to it's name, good plot, believable acting, and just a brilliant Spider-Man film."

","THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN (2012) ***1/2 Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Rhys Ifans, Denis Leary, Martin Sheen, Sally Field, Irrfan Khan, Campbell Scott, Embeth Davidtz, C. Thomas Howell. Unnecessary but entertaining none-the-less blockbuster reboot to the epic Marvel franchise in its re-imagining of the Peter Parker mythos of his web-slinging alter ego super hero whose origin story should now be known to every man, woman and child. Garfield - exuding James Dean cool/geekiness as the awkward teen - is indelible as he tries to find out who he is, why he is and how to use his powers for greater things (that's right crime fighting). Ifans is reptilian to the hilt as anger management in denial Dr. Curt Connors, a one-armed colleague of Parker's late scientist genius dad attempting to use hybrid species DNA for re- growth of lost appendages and instead becomes the menacing Lizard. Added to the mix is Stone as Pete's gal pal Gwen Stacy and a nice laconic by-the-book Leary police chief dad out to stop the masked vigilante in the jungles of Manhattan. Director Marc Webb (no puns please) does a remarkable, skillful and unlikely heir-apparent helmsman job with the Herculean task of making something old fresh and he's ably capable with a decent script by James Vanderbilt, Steve Kloves an Alvin Sargent (who scripted the last two SPIDER-MAN flicks under Sam Raimi's realm) and some truly vivid 3-D imagery CGI and fantastic lens work by John Schwartzman. Bonus: Stan 'The Man' Lee's fun cameo as a high school music librarian missing out on the action behind him! Get your web on!"
"Darkknight951","10","4","10","8 July 2012"," My review on the new take for spider-man
","This movie was absolutely brilliant it was funny and had great action scenes In it and had heart and was a fun ride throughout yeah sure this new take was more modern and less well ten years ago but in all seriousness this was much better than what I was expecting they did such a good job with all the characters they were spot on with them Martin sheen nailed uncle Ben down to the last note playing the innocent loving uncle and Sally field did a great job with aunt may playing the emotional and loving mother figure with what screen time she had Emma stone got right the smart and quirky Gwen Stacy who's top in her class and cares for Peter on a physical but especially emotional level but the chemistry between her and Andrew Garfield is well amazing and well thought out Rhys ifans is just a marvel at curt Connors/The lizard as he played the experimental scientist who you felt empathy for but at the same time he had to be stopped because as soon as he becomes the lizard it's all about getting rid of humans and replacing them with reptiles and world domination and a new species rising above humanity but doesn't realize their is an antidote which he probably should have anticipated but was barely stopped by spider-man at the end of the film and Andrew Garfield nothing short of amazing for Peter Parker/spider-man I thought he did a little bit of a better job for Peter Parker but he had some great moves for spider-man and you could tell he went through great fight training for the movie. But all and all the amazing spider-man will be one of big surprise sleeper hits of 2012 and will set up a great future movie series the after credits scene was very interesting and we'll have to wait and see what villain their talking about in that particular scene in the sequel movie darkknight951 out."
"kevinxirau","10","4","10","8 July 2012"," An amazing thrill ride of webs and scales!
","This movie truly lives up to its name. The web slinger has quite a history in the world of cinema. Sam Raimi may be the first to bring the superhero to the big screen (and he did a good job...mostly), but Mark Webb pretty much perfected it. Not only did Mark bring back Peter Parker, but he gave the wall crawler a much needed makeover, especially after the disaster called Spider-Man 3. So, let's swing into The Amazing Spider-Man.<br/><br/>The plot is excellent: We know Peter Parker is a bit of a social outcast at school and lives with his Aunt May and Uncle Ben, but what about his parents? Richard and Mary Parker had to leave Peter for some ambiguous business, and disappeared for it. Years later, Peter finds his father's possessions and seeks answers, not only getting himself bit by a genetically-altered spider in the process, but also running into his father's former partner Dr. Curt Connors, who specializes in cross-species genetics. As Peter struggles with his newfound powers and a growing romance with fellow genius Gwen Stacy, Connors, through his experimentation, becomes the monstrous villain known as the Lizard. Can Spider-Man deal with the stress of being a hero and face this reptilian menace? <br/><br/>The cast can't be any more awesome. Let's start with Spider-Man. Much as I like Tobey Maguire, he was a little too goofy and emotional. Andrew Garfield nails the character right on. As Peter Parker, he manages to make him smart and enthusiastic, but also both tragic and hilarious. As Spider-Man, he gets the whole wisecracking thing right as he makes criminals look like total idiots with his jokes. I like the way he fights as his movements are more fast and spider-like. I'm also happy to see the web shooters as they are a huge part of the comics, something Sam Raimi avoided in his movies. Nicely done.<br/><br/>A lot of people will agree that Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy is way more interesting than Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson. Not only does she have the looks, but also the attitude and sweet nature Gwen has. While Mary Jane is not portrayed entirely accurately and is always the damsel in distress (not to mention constantly balling Peter out), Gwen Stacy is more active in her role and is more cunning. She's also fairly intelligent, perhaps rivaling even Peter. Definitely a huge improvement over the older films.<br/><br/>Doctor Curt Connors a.k.a. The Lizard is by far my favorite character in the whole franchise. Rhys Ifans did an excellent job portraying one of the most complex characters in the comics. As a man, Connors is a good man who want to help people, including himself, and he can relate to Peter quite easily for he knew the boy's father. As the Lizard, he is totally awesome. The villain is so powerful and menacing that he puts the other villains to shame. I daresay the Lizard is more threatening than a guy dressed as a goblin, not only to Spidey but also all of New York. It's so satisfying seeing the scaly fiend take a starring role after sitting on the sidelines in the original trilogy for so long. Lizard, you're the man...or...reptile! <br/><br/>The rest of the cast is a load of fun too, like Denis Leary as George Stacy and Martin Sheen as Uncle Ben. The special effects are to behold as they are realistic to the finest detail, from Spidey swinging to Lizard's complex design. There's also a good deal of realism to the science like how can one fight crime as Spider-Man (as well as the pressures of being the hero) and how cross-species genetics (a reality by the way) works and its uses. The action scenes are without a doubt the best in the film series, having a fast pace and quite a bit of destruction as the raging wall crawlers duke it out.<br/><br/>In conclusion, The Amazing Spider-Man is by far greater than Sam Raimi's original trilogy. With this new path Mark Webb is taking with Spidey, I look forward to any sequel coming up. This action-packed thrill ride is sure to please any fan and any newcomer to the franchise. Definitely worth the watch, so check it out!"
"bowski21096","8","4","10","8 July 2012"," Amazing Movie (Though, I'm tired of the pun too!)
","This was easily my most anticipated movie of the year. Spider-Man being my favorite character in any form of media, and reading just about any and every Spider-Man story I can get my hands on, you can trust me when I say this is easily the best Spider-Man movie to date. Now, I don't know if as a movie it tops spider-Man 2. I'll have to see it again, but I can assure you that that characters are a lot closer to their comic counterpart and the action scenes and ideas brought up are exactly what you would want in a Spider-Man movie. The acting as a whole was great, but I want to focus on Emma Stone and, of course, Andrew Garfield. This is the first time I've legit cared about a romance in a superhero movie. Usually, they feel to tacked on, or just kind of there, but here fell in love with both characters (....no h**o). Their scenes together were the best parts of the movie for me, especially the scene on Peter's porch near the end that I won't spoil. Now, Andrew. I felt with him exactly what I felt with RDJ playing tony Stark in Iron Man. The same kind of magic, as if he were born to play the role, and I know this is just my opinion (as is the whole review) but I'm going to say that this is the best performance in a comic book movie since Heath Ledger as The Joker in The Dark Knight. He truly was fantastic as both Peter and Spider-Man. The only complaints I have are that the Lizard is a HUGE missed opportunity, where they could've told a kind of Jekyll/Hyde story and show some humanity in the character, he just kind of turns into ""Generic Villain A"", though the fight scenes are cool. Second, and final complaint is the movie is very obviously cut up at points. It's kind of distracting at first, but overall if you love spider-Man or you've never read a comic book in your life and are just looking for a fun time, go see this movie. In fact see it twice. It truly is Amazing...sorry...no really I am...I'll stop now."
"charlieb10-416-969064","6","4","10","7 July 2012"," Good, but not good enough
","This movie shows loyalty to the comic books and is presented well. The choice of cast, sets and props are also spot on. <br/><br/>However despite these good factors I still feel that the franchise being rebooted was unnecessary. Despite the fact that the change of directors was inevitable, it would only be wise to keep the same continuity however still create a new era. In my opinion if a franchise is to be rebooted it needs to be done so in a completely new tone and a slight differ in origins. The best example to use is the Batman franchise being rebooted in 2005, gave us a totally new perception of the character and story.<br/><br/>In comparison to both movies, I do prefer the transformation from Peter to Spider-man. I also think that Peter's parent's back-story was also much more interesting than the previous movie.<br/><br/>Overall this movie was enjoyable and I think Andrew Garfield done a splendid performance, however it did not give of the same charm as it's preprocessor."

Initially I thought what was the point, to me Spiderman is still a new movie, and to be honest, the last movie wasn't all that good.<br/><br/>But truth be told, I wasn't expecting this, a brilliant movie, but on a par with Spiderman 2.<br/><br/>The cast are a lot better, and Garfield nails as Parker, this is the Spiderman we got from the comics, not the wet blanket that Maguire gave us with just looks of awe every other minute.<br/><br/>But it does hark back to the first movie, New Yorkers coming together toward the end, the main Bad Guy having some sort of chat with himself, even the guy who killed Uncle Ben in the first movie is the limo driver!! <br/><br/>The relationship between Ben and Peter feels more real in this, and it really does have more emotional impact when he is shot this time around. but it is totally a different movie this time around. It's all about high school and Parker gets hurt in this, quite a lot showing his vulnerable side.<br/><br/>Spiderman being more cocky is the biggest positive for the film, even though he is in peril, he still has time for a one liner. Stone is amazing as Stacey, she really is more than a damsel in distress (Hello Kirsten).<br/><br/>The Lizard is an okay villain, but it just feels like a way over the top villain, and despite a good turn from Ifans, his prerogative just feels like the Jokers from Burtons Batman.<br/><br/>It's a well made film, very exciting, and very funny too, I laughed a lot through the film, the inclusion of the new webs is great too, they seem more fluid I this one and are more intricate to Spidermans powers in this, with these he wouldn't be doing what he does.<br/><br/>See it and enjoy it, it's really worth seeing"
"liggins14","10","4","10","6 July 2012"," Spider-Man v. The Amazing Spider-Man: ""Amazing"" wins by a knockout
","Both movies are great for their times. And though I enjoyed both, I liked ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" a bit more. Why? Better acting, more gritty and realistic feel, better special effects. This movie benefits from learning from the many movies that came before it: Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, Iron Man, etc. Andrew Garfield nails Peter Parker with his outstanding performance, and Emma Stone was gorgeous as Gwen Stacy. While I had to stretch my imagination a bit to see Kirsten Dunst as a supermodel/actress, there was no stretching with Emma Stone. I enjoyed the retelling of the origin from the vantage point of a new director. Definitely not a rehash. The web swinging and fight scenes totally knocked it out of the park, especially in 3D.<br/><br/>The biggest negative to me was the costume...should have stayed closer to the comic book classic. Yellow eyes, really? A stripe on the side of his pants? Redesigning the spider logo was fine, but I would have pretty much left it at that. Otherwise, highly enjoyable and recommended."

I must say this Spiderman movie was Amazing and much better then the Previous Spiderman 1,2 and 3. This spider man movie is not cheesy at all.

"ersinkdotcom","8","4","10","3 July 2012"," Marvel's most popular superhero triumphantly returns in ""The Amazing Spider-Man""
","Let's be honest from the get-go. The question on everyone's mind when it comes to ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is, ""How is it in comparison to the three Tobey Maguire movies?"" After all, it's only been five years since the last film in Sam Raimi's trilogy about the web slinging superhero. Forgive me if my review reads like a comparison chart, but isn't that what everyone is looking for? <br/><br/>There's really no comparison between the two except the source material. While ""Spider-Man"" was trying to be everything to everyone, much like 1978's ""Superman: The Movie,"" this new version of the story is more geared to the teenage demographic. It's hipper and has an air of teen angst to it. If you've seen it, imagine ""Kick-Ass"" but the hero of the story actually has superpowers. <br/><br/>The Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) in ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a rebellious smart-mouthed skater kid who is also a genius. Tobey Maguire's take on the character was nerdier and straighter than what we get from Garfield. There's really not much to compare between the two. <br/><br/>The tone of the movie is also more serious. Is the story as ironed out as Raimi's ""Spider-Man"" or ""Spider-Man 2?"" No, it's not. The structure of the film is three-fold. The first part examines the strange events surrounding Parker's parents leaving him with his aunt and uncle. The second part deals with Parker becoming Spider-Man. Thirdly, we get the superhero battling the Lizard. <br/><br/>The first part of the film leaves a lot of unanswered questions in the end. The second part is well-done as we see Peter deal with his new super powers, put together his costume, and use his scientific smarts to make his web shooters. While all this is going on, he delves into a romantic relationship with Gwen Stacy which further complicates things. The Lizard sections of the film may frustrate some and leave them feeling a bit rushed and searching for more story. There's also a part where I was left wondering, ""Why did they introduce that situation and then completely drop the ball on it?"" <br/><br/>Most of the acting in the film is perfect. Garfield is a believable Peter Parker and emits the angst, nervousness, and excitement a teenager would feel in all the given instances he faces. Emma Stone does a wonderful job convincing us she is a high school genius and is very likable. Sally Field is a stronger Aunt Mae than we saw in Raimi's ""Spider-Man"" series. Denis Leary plays a toned-down version of himself as a cop and father. The only weak point in performance is Rhys Ifans as the Lizard / Dr. Curt Connors. For the most part, he's good and pulls off the role. However, he goes a little over-the-top when spewing his crazy-talk at Spider-Man during their battles. <br/><br/>The special effects and CGI in the movie look great. They're much better than the the first ""Spider-Man"" trilogy. There were a lot of complaints directed at the effects and CGI when it came to the hero's aerial escapades in Raimi's films. Producers and the effects houses hired for this really stepped it up. The POV shots of him swinging through the city are brilliant. I thought the Lizard melded well with the live-action backgrounds and characters as well. <br/><br/>The 3D was useless and unnecessary. It was well-utilized during some of the POV and wide shot web swinging scenes, but for the most part it really didn't matter. I found myself getting a little eye-fatigue in the beginning because of blurry background images. I haven't had that in a long time while watching a 3D film. <br/><br/>Is ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" a good movie? Yes, it is. I would recommend every fan of the superhero go see it. Put aside any skepticism and expectations you have because of Raimi's version of the character. It's better than those films in some ways and not in others. Three things it is for sure are endearing, heartfelt, and entertaining. Director Marc Webb obviously has a love for the source material. I can't wait to see where the story goes from here."
"Ashes_Phoenix","9","4","10","3 July 2012"," Don't listen to the naysayers, this is a very good film !
","Lets get things straight. This was a film that was about the character of Peter Parker. Yes, we did have the Lizard as the main villain but this was not about that character. <br/><br/>Andrew Garfield was excellent. He brings a new dimension to the character of Peter and I was astounded by the way he made Peter feel like a real person. He has problems that he learns to iron out during the film and that makes the character extremely relatable. Tobey was great but Andrew Garfield owned this role in my opinion. <br/><br/>The rest of the cast were great too. I loved the rooftop sequence between Gwen and Peter. It had a really beautiful moment in it and I really felt the characters emotions during that scene. <br/><br/>The cinematography is delicious. It has a very artistic flare to it and it made it feel like it had come from the pages of the comic book at times. <br/><br/>The score worked really well in this movie for me as well. It has more of a classical approach to it and I thought it complimented the film with a tremendous amount of spirit. There is a particular moment when Spidey has been captured by the police, that really pushes the score to the next level. In a weird way it kind of reminded me of the Superman theme. <br/><br/>The action I found to be refreshingly clear and exciting. The CGI was great all in all with the occasional hokey areas. I let this off though because some of the action sequences were creatively realised. Loved the school fight particularly. Great use of Spidey's abilities in that sequence. <br/><br/>The only flaws I could see were definitely Connors character development and Ratha's role being rather minute. I wonder whether there will be a director's cut? Also the pacing was a bit fast at times. Though to be fair they had a lot to go over in this movie. I think when the sequel is released it will have a much more consistent pace to it and have some time to develop the next main villain properly. <br/><br/>All in all this film gets a 9/10 from me and it is now personally my favourite Spider-Man and Marvel film. I preferred this over The Avengers and some of my friends who went to see it with me felt exactly the same way. I now look forward to the sequel and I believe if they can develop the characters even further and push the boundaries, we could have something unbelievably special. <br/><br/>Also just for the people who have not seen this yet. Pay no attention to the negative reviews, that attack it because it contains the origin again. This feels nothing like the original Raimi origin and should be appreciated as it's own entity. Yes we have the basics but that is not Raimi's origin, it's the source materials. Spider-Man is back and he is better than ever !"
"Fields201","9","4","10","3 July 2012"," It's Amazing!
","When I first heard that Spiderman was being rebooted, I was like, ""Why?"" But I'm happy to report that this turned out to be an INCREDIBLE film! I just don't know where to begin.<br/><br/>Let's start with the performances. WOW! The story had a lot with this one, but I hadn't been this emotionally invested into characters since.... well, I don't know when. For a comic book movie, the performances were powerful this time around. For once, we have a Peter Parker that really felt like a Peter Parker. Tobey Maguire was okay, but Andrew Garfield just nailed it. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacey, well, I just don't know who could play that part better. The real show stealer is Denis Leary as Gwen's dad. But then again, I love Denis Leary anyway.<br/><br/>The story is almost essentially the same as the first Sam Raimi Spiderman movie but just replace Hob Goblin with The Lizard and, well, okay, there are a few differences here and there but the way the story was handled, it felt fresh. It felt more human this time around, almost darker. The film even took some chances like how Spiderman goes into the sewer and makes this web concoction thing and just waits. While I'm at it, I really like the touches with the lizards foreshadowing that Lizard is around and the spider that follows Peter.<br/><br/>If there are some things I didn't like about The Amazing Spiderman that would be the fact that whenever Lizard talks, he's less menacing. He also looks like one of the Goomba characters from that Super Mario Bros movie. Also, why would Peter Parker plant stuff around with his name on it? For a genius, that's pretty stupid.<br/><br/>But besides that, this is a great movie! It's a comic book movie with emotion and solid performances. It may even beat out The Avengers. That's a tough call since Robert Downey Jr. is awesome. Dark Knight Rises better be good, because the competition is fierce this year!"
"omega_work","8","4","10","3 July 2012"," A nice balance of action and drama
","I was initially worried about this movie since so many of the previous reviews suggested it was Twilight-esc. To be fair I've only seen about half of one twilight film (the first one), which was poor in pretty much every way and where it wasn't poor it was clichÃ©... This film however was actually quite good for what it was. I really enjoyed Spider-man and Spider-man 2, but I think the filmmakers really wanted to improve upon some of the weaknesses of the previous series, most of which seemed to have to do with character. All of the characters seem really well developed. Uncle Ben and Aunt May have a really neat dynamic and even almost an unspoken language of their own that makes them feel like they have a long history together. Flash Thompson even has an interesting arc.<br/><br/>Of course Peter's past is the focal point of this story and it's done in a way that builds mystery and impacts the story greatly. It seems his father, Richard, was involved with Dr. Connors on cross-genetic research of some kind. His father was doing research involving spiders, and some of that work was continuing hence the lab where Peter gets bitten, but I'm not really sure how that relates to the reptile work Connors is doing. Maybe I missed it, or perhaps it was unclear.<br/><br/>But this leads of course to Peter getting his powers a good hour or so into the film (though the pace is pretty good up to this point). His realization that he has powers and starting to use them is done fairly well, the only bad thing is that after an hour of building up to this point it seems a bit rushed. I felt the same with Uncle Ben's death.<br/><br/>Another departure from the original series (but more true to the comics) is that he uses web-shooters, which made me nervous... I thought the idea of the webs being organic was brilliant, but they actually made this work really well, and even gave the devices some limitations.<br/><br/>Overall the film seemed to strike a nice balance of action and drama, and felt a lot more grounded in reality than the original series (which sounds odd for a fantasy film). Stan Lee makes his trademark cameo in what is perhaps the best scene of the film! There were only two things I remember that really bugged me. One was in a scene after Lizard attacks the high school a male paramedic is attending to a student (I think it was flash) and he is wearing a really goofy-looking earring that I doubt a real paramedic would be allowed to wear on the job... The other thing was the CGI work in the very last scene. Throughout the whole film the effects were very seamless and never took me out of the movie, but in the last scene Spidey was obviously CGI.<br/><br/>The ending was typical of Spider-man films in that he has to keep away from the girl for her own safety, but in order to be a happier ending he suggests that he intends to break the promise... that's fine, but I just hope that the sequel doesn't spend the whole time being a ""will-they-won't-they"" film... Spider-man 2 already did that."

"Michikwee","10","7","22","30 June 2012"," Bitten by the Amazing Spidey
","I am never a fan of Spidey and always skeptical when Sam Raimi's movies came out, and this one was no exception at first, but oh boy.....how this one proved me wrong.<br/><br/>From the moment, the teaser was released, I was already intrigued and when the official trailer and longer trailer were released, I knew it would be a good one and a better one, for sure.<br/><br/>I still recalled how the negative comments was when news broke out that Andrew Garfield, a Brit and relatively quite unknown to public aside from The Social Network movie, being selected.<br/><br/>Lo and behold,in my opinion, Andrew Garfield gave us the perfect Spidey so far. He portrayed Spidey as how I recalled reading the comics and watching the animated movies.<br/><br/>His body language was superb, even when he was in costume, you could tell that Spidey was just another teenager. Salute to this young Brits. Not sure if it only me, but I felt the Brits lately are on the rise, not only in State but worldwide. <br/><br/>Emma Stone was adorable as always, her chemistry with Andrew was excellent, no wonder they are a pair now.<br/><br/>Rhys Ifans played Dr Connors aka the Lizard in such convincing act, another good casting.<br/><br/>Marc Webb is superb as the new Director, everything was made to perfection. The pace, the acting, the details and the angles when he shot the scene, definitely 2 thumbs up! <br/><br/>And in all Marvel movies, especially Stan Lee's creations, I am always on the lookout for Stan cameo. No exception for this one, if usually you blink and miss kind of thing in spotting Stan in other movie, this time, Do Open Your Eyes, people! It is the best cameo by Stan so far, in my opinion. Seeing Stan is like reminding me how great he is, his creativity is beyond description.<br/><br/>The movie pace was excellent, I thought it was a bit too fast in beginning but as it moved on, I found it did made sense. The casts were excellent, the script was credible, the action sequences would definitely pleased the viewers.<br/><br/>I couldn't find any fault in this movie, i just felt it went back to the root of Spidey comic. And perhaps what impressed me more, how the script made the characters here smarter, especially for Gwen Stacy's character, not a screaming gal like in other Sam's movie.<br/><br/>Definitely A Must See Movie!!!<br/><br/>PS: After Watching Spidey, I am wondering whether Justice League movie would ever being made. Perhaps after the new Superman and Wonder Woman movies? Couldn't imagine the pressure on the Director if there is one."
"Aaron1375","9","5","14","9 July 2012"," It was pretty amazing.
","I enjoyed the first three Spider-man films immensely even the highly scorned third film. So I was not to sure what to think about a reboot to a still young franchise. However, I just realized that Sam Rami is not Spider-man's creator, that there are thousands of stories and ways to portray Spider-man so why keep us waiting fifteen or twenty years for another film? There is no reason at all, I want to see Spider-man on the big screen and honestly while the first three Spider-man films were enjoyable this portrayal of Spider-man is the more accurate. Does it follow the comic book exactly...well of course not. No comic film does that, why is it even necessary? Sam Rami gave Spider-man organic shooters, bypassed Gwen Stacy in lieu of Mary Jane, and had Sandman kill Uncle Ben...so yes, the formula did not match the comic the first time, so why now or ever? This film seemed to be a combination of the original Spider-man that first appeared in the 60's and Ultimate Spider-man which launched either in the late 90's or early 2000's. And the match up worked and now if they wish to continue the success they need to continue the story in an interesting way and not let it end as badly as the third Spider-man film ended without a resolution.<br/><br/>This story is an origin tale, so you know the basics without me going into details. Those not familiar with the ultimate story arc may be confused about certain things such as Peter knowing his parents and things of this nature. The main thing that is different though is the villain as we finally get the Lizard. You also get to see Peter learn to use his powers a bit more here than in the first film. It is not quite the smooth transition. He soon begins fighting crime which leads him to having to try and capture the Lizard. The Lizard has plans of his own though.<br/><br/>Things this movie did that the previous films did not do are plentiful. Do not get me wrong, this one was not as good as the second Spider-man film, I am just saying they did the Spider powers better. They also had the web shooters, even when I was at my most negative about this film from the first trailers I salivated over Spidey finally using mechanical web shooters. They also had him move like a spider more. During a fight with a lizard the way he entangled the lizard in the web was very spider-like. They also had a scene where he shot multiple webs in the sewer and used the vibrations to try and locate the Lizard. This Spider-man also wisecracks and constantly talks during battles, another trait missing from the previous entries. So all in all this Spidey was more like the Spidey I know from the comics.<br/><br/>The villain is the Lizard and while I enjoyed how they integrated him in the origin plot there was a problem I had with him. Mainly that it was not explained that he could telepathically communicate with other reptiles. I knew why there were so many lizards and such present, but for those not familiar with the character there may be confusion. Just as in his motivations. When fully transformed he hates humans and wishes reptiles ruled the world, while this comes across a bit in the film I read a review where the person questioned his motivations and how he became evil so quick. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy was great, much cuter than Kristen Dunst and looking more like the character she was portraying. I thought her and James had good chemistry and I liked how their romance was not simply he pining for her.<br/><br/>Finally, I want to cover one thing that this movie did that I was so happy when a certain something did not occur. That is Gwen did not get taken by the villain and Spider-man did not have to rescue her! I was so certain this would happen, but to my surprise and delight it did not. Sorry, but Mary Jane being kidnapped at the end of all three of the first films was a bit monotonous. I swear the makers of this film felt this too as it looked like Lizard was going from her and then he just gets what he was coming for and leaves her in the room. Leaving me to think the makers were like ""Gotcha! Ha, thought she was going to be taken for the final confrontation didn't ya?"" So this film was a nice restart, though I do hope they film the movies quicker and get in a good three or four films in and have a complete story done. The first series was good, but it did not end all that well as there were still a number of things left in the air. This one has set up a good beginning and hinted at a future villain in the upcoming films. I believe if all goes well the next film could be the best one yet, but let me reiterate if all goes well. And should they complete this set of movies I would want for them to reboot once again. I love Spider-man and want to see him on the big screen...however, I am good on origin stories so you can at least skip that next time. This time though it was simply nice to watch Spider-man swing his way in and out of danger once again."
"watshudirite","10","5","14","1 July 2012"," Waaaay better than the previous installments... and I mean ANY of them!
","The Good: This movie is one of the rare superhero flicks with a heart. At the same time it possesses some of the best CGI and action sequences. The 3D surely does enrich the visual appeal of the movie, especially in the action sequences.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield is simply terrific as Peter Parker and no spider-man fan will be disappointed with his portrayal of the wise-cracking yet troubled teenager. (Even though some say that his sense of humor borders on arrogance.) His portrayal of Peter Parker is so amazing that it will surely set a benchmark for all the future Peter Parkers to come. Emma Stone is simply lovely as Gwen Stacy. Her character has been fleshed out neatly by the writers and her acting is way better than Kirsten Dunst's MJ. Special mention to Rhys Ifans as well. His portrayal of the Lizard is simply awesome. I'm sure you'll be pleasantly surprised by how the Lizard looks and how its mannerisms have been captured.<br/><br/>The camera work is also stupendous and the direction is fabulous. The action set pieces will surely blow your mind away. This is equally true for romantic/emotional scenes as well (This, of course, is no shocker given that Marc Webb had earlier directed ""500 Days of Summer"").<br/><br/>The Bad: MANY of the scenes and dialogs depicted in the trailers were completely absent from the final cut (or at least the one released in India). This was really very irritating. Irrfan Khan's Dr. Ratha had a blink and a miss role. Not exactly ""the untold story"" as these elements of the story kind of remain underdeveloped. (Perhaps this issue will get resolved in the coming installments).<br/><br/>What some critiques are saying and my take on it: <br/><br/>1. ""Origins story not required"" -- Really? I can see another Spider-man origins story if it brings something fresh to the table. And this movie does more than what is required to infuse a sense of originality the previous one.<br/><br/>2. ""Too much deja vu"" -- For crying out loud, it IS an origins story. It's basic ingredients cannot change all of a sudden. For then people would have accused it of not remaining true to the comics.<br/><br/>3. ""CGI not up to the mark and 3D is useless"": I had no such issues. And trust me I had gone with great expectations... and as it turns out all those expectations were met. And not watching the movie is like reducing the fun by half.<br/><br/>4. ""Twilight for the superhero generation"": Spiderman is NO Superman. Fortunately or unfortunately, he is a teenager and he has Twilight-ish issues in his life. That is in fact one of the reasons why he is so loved all over the world. I don't see any reason to crib if the same is depicted in the movie at the cost of mindless action scenes.<br/><br/>5. ""Story not up to the mark"": Kind of agree with this one. But the 'Goods' totally make up for this one flaw. (And I agree it is not a minor one... but then I am a crazy Spidey fan!) Do watch this one. I'm sure you won't be disappointed."

"costantis","2","3","7","13 July 2013"," Totally no reason of existence
","I strongly believe that even people who did not have any special interest on Spiderman found the original Tobey Maguire trilogy at far more interesting than other superhero films. Why? Because simply these films (and especially 1st and 2nd) were very human-like, and especially moving! For example, who does not remember the original uncle-Ben scene?<br/><br/>However, this new version of the spider man story is just too flat, and too poor compared to the original. Weak performances, poor storyline and definitely a movie without any social aspect or meaning. <br/><br/>For me the only reason to watch this movie would be some action scenes, which however are not that impressive for 2012, and which render this film watchable for only a small minority. And I have to admit that the relatively high rating really surprises me."
"stephparsons","5","3","7","24 May 2013"," Good special effects but nothing to get exited about
","Well I have to say, this wasn't a horrific movie , (it wasn't a great one either). I rather liked Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker and thought he brought more of a 'comicy', lighthearted feel to the role. I suppose it was inevitable that we had to go through all the clichéd bullying scenes where poor wimpy Parker is beaten up by the most stereotypical bully known to man (I felt very sorry for Chris Zylka who played the bully, Flash Thompson, I don't know Zylka from a hole in the ground but I think he should give the scriptwriter and director a good roughing up for making him cough up such corny, done to death lines and scenes ). Another inevitability was all the bright, shiny, futuristic technology at Oscorp, the lab of Dr Curt Connors, Parker's father's former partner and the stereotyped human/animal gene splicing caper but I suppose there's not much to be done about that if one wants to stick to the original Marvel Spiderman theme, I just felt it could have been portrayed more subtly and less unoriginally.<br/><br/>It was fun to see Spiderman swinging from the skyscrapers and saving people left right and centre and all those reptiles skittering about but, yet again, the cops aversion to the 'vigilante' AKA Spiderman was portrayed in such a hackneyed way it made me want to scream. There's 'sticking to the original story' and there's writing and directing with a complete lack of creativity and I'm afraid The Amazing Spiderman falls into the latter category. So, all in all, lots of fun bits and good special effects but nothing whatsoever to get excited about."
"Arbaaz","7","3","7","1 March 2013"," Better than Spiderman (2002)
","Alright, here is my take. I watched this movie last night and to be honest i could understand why people are being so negative about the movie? When Spiderman (2002) was out, i was about 12 years old and i loved the movie. I am 22 now and i enjoyed watching the remake. I would have enjoyed this much more if i were 12 right now. So i guess people who have been complaining are complaining for the same reason. They do not realize that they are 10 years older now and they no longer enjoy Super hero movies as they used to in their childhood. Also they do not realize that this is the first part, i am pretty sure the next one will be more exciting. One of the things which i liked about this film was that this time they lengthened the ""underdog-beating-up-the-bully"" part. One of the thing which i did not like was the music. I mean seriously the background music did not do the justice to the movie. A serious fight scene must have really thrilling music to compliment it. Which is movie didn't have. Overall it was pretty entertaining. I wasn't disappointed."
"kobebusia","9","3","7","14 January 2013"," A Surprising Treat for Spider-Man Fans Everywhere!
","I've read the first page of reviews people wrote for this movie, and honestly, I think you're all overreacting and making a pre-conceived assumption about it! I went to see this movie during the summer, and I saw the 3D presentation of it. As much as I enjoyed Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy, this movie turned out to give off a better impression.<br/><br/>Character and story development was the biggest improvement because we really got to know Peter Parker as a person very well, and we actually got to see how he ended up living with his aunt and uncle, as opposed to in the 2002 movie, where he's already living with them, and his parents are never mentioned, as if we're simply supposed to accept that he lives with them, his relationship with Uncle Ben is a lot stronger and we actually feel sorry for him when his uncle dies, which was rather hard to do in the original movie, his love interest, Gwen Stacey, is a lot smarter, stronger, and much more likable and interesting than Mary Jane Watson ever was, because she wasn't just some damsel in distress, and also in this film, when Peter develops his superpowers, he actually has a real reaction to them, instead of just quickly adjusting to them and acting like being genetically mutated is normal. For those who think Tobey Magure played Peter Parker/Spider-Man better than Andrew Garfield, you couldn't be more wrong, I personally liked Andrew Garfield's performance, and he wasn't better or worse than Tobey Maguire, it's just 2 different takes on the same character, that's all.<br/><br/>The one real downside to this film is the villain, the Lizard, and that's because even though he has a motivation, he's boring and doesn't come across as a menacing threat in any forceful way, but that's not a big enough flaw to really drag the movie down. I will say that even though he has a device for the web-slinging, I think the way he could do it naturally in the original trilogy was more exciting. Director Marc Webb did a great job of telling what is essentially the same story over again, but in a more complex and in-depth way, and the special effects were really top-notch. I can't wait for the sequel to this film, cause it truly deserves one.<br/><br/>All in all, The Amazing Spider-Man is one of the best superhero films I've ever seen, and it's really great for those who want to know and understand Peter's character better, as well as see a more accurate telling of his story. 9/10 in my book!"

","Going into this movie I was wondering what else they could do after all the recent Tobey and Kristen movies. I was pleasantly surprised it turned out to be different - more serious, with good acting and a compelling story that leads into a sequel.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield is a good actor if a bit mutant looking. He is quite good in the role. Emma Stone can play a wide range of ages and looks quite convincing as a high school student. She is more vulnerable and expressive than Kristen Dunst was in her role. Sally Field provides high quality supporting cast.<br/><br/>The scenes of NYC and the swinging around are as good as can be expected.<br/><br/>Liked it better than the Tobey versions.

"zombiefan89","3","3","7","10 January 2013"," Too soon for reboot, Wanted Spiderman 4
","The Amazing Spider-man is a bit of a mixed bag. It's really nothing new at all. Anyone who has read the comics or seen the 90's TV show would know exactly what's going to happen. Personally, if they had cast Alan Rickman as Doctor Connors, I would have really liked this movie. I did feel a lot of nostalgia when watching, but the whole thing seemed just bland to me. There was a lot of excitement when Gwen Stacy was in danger, as everyone knows she dies in the comics just as Uncle Ben does. This is not a spoiler. Everyone who knows anything about Spider-Man knows that Uncle Ben and Gwen Stacy die. Also, I'm positive Gwen will die in the sequel, if they make one, which makes her character all the most tragic. Google Gwen Stacy and you'll see ""The Night Gwen Stacy died"". Next, on to Spider-Man taking off his mask a lot. It's not much of a secret at this point. Peter Parker is about as synonymous with Spider-Man as Clark Kent with Superman, but he really does reveal his identity a LOT! Of course Gwen's father did have him at gun point, but that's nothing new to Spider-Man. Also, what the hell? How did Spider-Man get SHOT!? Spider-Sense, writers! Ever heard of it!? Seriously, it SHOULD be nearly impossible to hit Spider-Man with... ANYTHING!"

"coltsfan963","9","3","7","28 November 2012"," The Best Superhero Film I Have Ever Seen
","Let me just say before I get in depth here that I thoroughly enjoyed the original Spiderman trilogy. Spiderman (2002) is a classic superhero film that understandably so gets put right in line with Superman (1978) and Batman (1989), and for good reason. The film was fantastic. It had humor, great special effects, action, good acting, and an incredible story. It truly was one of the greatest superhero films up to that point of time. Then, Spiderman 2 (2004) came along and shocked the world as possibly the greatest superhero film ever made. It outdid the original with the same corny humor, the same effects, the same action, same good acting as the original, but an even more incredible story. The dual characterization of whether Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) truly wanted to be Spiderman or not took the thrill right out of all of us for a superhero, solely, and put us right in the middle of a very well done drama. Spiderman 2 was one for the ages in the class of superhero films. Then, came Spiderman 3 (2007), which was not as good as either the first two , or even in the same league. However, despite the heavy criticism that Spiderman 3 has received over the years, I was somewhat used to the format which it took, following that of it's two predecessors, in terms of its humor and reaches for an epic climax to the franchise, and enjoyed it for what it was. <br/><br/>The original trilogy really did it for me. I was sorely convinced that the idea of even doing another Spiderman film, let alone with 10 years of the original, was a horrible idea. What else could we expect? I walked into the movie theater to see The Amazing Spiderman with that attitude, expecting to see a movie that would not even come close in terms of the original. The attitude that I walked out with was far beyond unexpected.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spiderman immediately takes it's audience into the back story of Peter Parker, showing him as a child searching for his father in a game of hide and seek, a very subtle reference as to what Peter originally sets out for in this film. As we all know, he is taken to live with his Aunt May (Sally Field) and Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen), but in doing so also gives us something we didn't originally know, the perception that Mr. and Mrs. Parker seem to be running from something. They die in a plane accident and what was thought to be a temporary living condition for Peter ends up becoming the household that he is raised under, all the way up until his older teenage years (Andrew Garfield). Peter develops into a socially awkward young man, quite noticeably choosing to exclude himself from the norms of his fellow classmates at Midtown Science Highschool. <br/><br/>The story really begins when Peter stumbles upon a briefcase that once belonged to his father, and in a hidden compartment inside are long forgotten documents... documents that point to some mysterious scientific experiments that his father worked on a long time ago with another man, Dr. Curtis Conners (Rhys Ifans). Peter takes it upon himself to visit Oscorp Industries where his father once worked, and where Conners still remains. He does not reveal who he is to Conners, but during his visit curiosity overwhelms him and leads to his finding of a room filled with genetically enhanced spiders, bred by his own father coincidentally. Peter is bit by one and begins to experience some extreme changes and enhances in terms of his physical capabilities. During his phase of change, his Uncle Ben tries desperately to help Peter become the man that he is capable of being. And after an argument with Peter, which leads to the young man storming out of the house, Uncle Ben is shot and killed while looking for him. The loss of his only real father figure leads Peter to begin searching for the shooter.<br/><br/>But, in the midst of all of this, love begins to slip its way into Peter's mind as well when a classmate of his, Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) begins to show interest in him. ""He's second in his class,"" Gwen tells Dr. Conners during Peters visit to Oscorp. ""Second?"" Peter asks, smirking from her gloating, to which Gwen flirtatiously grins and responds, ""I'm pretty sure"". And aside from the girl, Peter also visits Dr. Conner's at his private residence and finally reveals himself to b Richard Parker's son, shocking Conners from being reunited with his long lost colleague's only child. The two hit it off immediately, and using his father's notes from the briefcase, Peter helps Dr. Conners develop a serum to try and regrow limbs, influenced by Conner's missing right arm. However, the serum develops side effects and begins to turn Dr. Conners into a vicious lizard monster, battling Peter as he develops into the Amazing Spiderman. <br/><br/>This film did many things for me as a viewer. I literally sat back and watched as a very good love story for a adolescent character in a superhero film was shown before me. And the acting was far superior to that of the original trilogy. Also, the characters are developed far more smoothly and emotionally, taking the humor the original trilogy had out of their growth and replacing it with serious backgrounds and story lines. This film really overwhelmed me, and surprised me in every way. I had walked into that movie theater thinking that I was in store for a crappy reboot, and in the end gave me a movie that outdid the entire trilogy of original Spiderman films. This film may in fact be the best overall superhero film I have ever seen."

"Rollum","4","3","7","26 October 2012"," Too little and too soon
","I will remember this movie as The not as Amazing as the other Spiderman reboot. I cant understand why this was made and not Spiderman 4. There have been suggestions that previous director Sam Raimi was unhappy with the ideas for Spidey 4 so Sony went with Webb and made this movie instead. The Spiderman hero is such a huge idea that any attempt to bring this character to life needs to be BIG This movie is not worthy. Its more a re hash of the original story with some cheap editing of the more complicated parts like the death of Peter Parkers Uncle.<br/><br/>For me, Andrew Garfield was so weak i couldn't believe he was Spiderman, one of my favorite super heroes. Not that Tobey Maguire is that much better but he was first and he played the character of Peter/Spidey with more range.<br/><br/>Overall I was left wondering why? There wasn't enough zing to warrant starting all over again. Too little and too soon. They should have made Spiderman 4 instead."
"r_wind0300","8","3","7","23 September 2012"," Better than the previous one...
","I LOVE THIS NEW VERSION! It's a lot better than the previous one (Sam Raimi's/Tobey Maguire's version). Better Spider-man, better story, better plot! As we've seen, Andrew Garfield has successfully delivered an amazing performance, his acting is great in the movie. One obvious fact, Garfield is a sanguine person, and he brings it up into his character. Now we have a sanguine Spider-man, more cheerful and more charismatic.<br/><br/>I'm also touched by the romantic scenes and friendship scenes in the movie. You all should watch this movie, and find out whether we'll share the same effects from those scenes..... Hahahaha....<br/><br/>Only one thing, to my recognition, that is not as good as the previous person, that's is about the quotes! The first trilogy has successfully brought up memorable and deeper meaning quotes that will be globally remembered!"
"LKimbler68","4","3","7","22 September 2012"," Can't believe Stan Lee agreed to this tripe
","Very few movies that I've ever seen have given me reason to discuss how poor they are. I usually try to forget seeing them, but this movie sparked something in me that just needs to be expressed.<br/><br/>I've been a Spiderman fan for years, and when the first Sam Raimi movie came out, I was ecstatic. They finally with Spiderman seemed to start to get Marvel movies right and entertaining. But then after 2 sequels that never equaled the first, the series was stopped. And now this attempt at a relaunch...<br/><br/>SPOILERS!!!!<br/><br/>On the good side of this movie, it was nice to see Spiderman need web- shooters like the comics. It was also nice to see something other than just swinging on it and Spiderman using the webs in combat situations. But sad to say, that's about where the good side ends.<br/><br/>The store robbery that lead to Uncle Ben's death was completely ridiculous and unbelievable. Seriously, must spend $10 to take a penny? And he's gonna argue with a customer about that? And then Uncle Ben diving on a gun like that? What a joke. And despite hunting him, Spiderman never found the killer?<br/><br/>Martin Sheen and Sally Fields, although both fine actors, are just not believable as Uncle Ben and Aunt May. For one, they are way too young. And Sally Fields towards the end appears to realize that Peter is Spiderman, which Aunt May didn't know and actually hated Spiderman. Which brings me to the whole secret identity piece. By the end of the movie, at least 1/2 a dozen people knew Peter Parker is Spiderman. What is that about? Spiderman wouldn't last long as a super hero taking his mask off every time he turned around as he did in this movie.<br/><br/>Instead of J. Jonah Jameson chasing after Spiderman, we have Dennis Leary as Captain Stacy. This captain, in the midst of a dangerous lizard trashing the city, turning a dozen or so police officers into lizard men as well, is more interested in chasing down Spiderman, who he then releases and works beside him on the Oscorp rooftop, and in his dying breath decides the city does need him. OMG.<br/><br/>Even in your basic fantasy or fiction story, you want people to get invested in the characters and story to where people can make it believable for themselves. This movie failed to do that on so many levels, that even though it may be a box-office/worldwide success, it would be in best interest that Spiderman not have a sequel."
"thefilmdiscussion","9","3","7","13 September 2012"," In many ways superior to Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man""
","The last Spider-Man movie was 5 years ago, and here we are at a reboot? Who cares! Marc Webb's (his name suggests that this film was his destiny, no?) ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" has enough freshness in it to make this latest blockbuster worth the watch. Although Spidey's origin tale is basically the same, Webb takes more time here than his predecessor to develop the characters and establish more motivation for the story to take place. Acted with gusto by the likes of Rhys Ifans, Sally Field, Denis Leary and Martin Sheen, especially notable are the performances of Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker/Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man and Emma Stone as his sweetheart Gwen Stacey, a resourceful firecracker who can take care of herself if need be. The chemistry between the two leads will stick to your heart like a whole web-ball of warmth and charisma. The nuances that all of the actors bring to their characters ring of such truth that we are swept up into the fantastic elements of the story as easily as Parker swings from web to web. Most surprisingly, the RomCom based Webb directs the action superbly, using 3D well and staging everything where we can see and understand what's going on, making the battles all the more exciting and intense. And what a villain he's brought to the screen in The Lizard, Dr. Curt Conners' biologically created alter-ego. He's brutally strong, exceptionally fast, and still has his wits about him even when he's all scaled out! For all of the feelings of sameness and repetitiveness, this ""Spider-Man"" earns its name. It's nothing short ofAmazing! And on a closing note, I was surprised to see that this film was shot digitally, on a RED camera. I would be lying if I said that this film didn't look great, and you could have fooled me. I suppose if Marty Scorsese is ready to embrace digital, then I can at least acknowledge that digital film-making may finally be getting somewhere respectable.

"ivern-326-711636","8","3","7","2 September 2012"," Better Than the Sam Raimi Movies Even!
","The Amazing Spider-Man is a reboot of the Spider-Man movie franchise. It's mostly the same story of Peter Parker, a high school nerd, who gets bitten by a genetically enhanced spider and gains super-reflexes, strength and the ability to climb on anything. He develops a web- shooting device and becomes the amazing Spider-Man.<br/><br/>I am a huge fan of the Sam Raimi Spider-Man movies. His interpretation is just brilliant. The first movie is a bit outdated today, but it is still a fun action movie. The second movie took it to a whole new level, and we actually cared more about Peter Parker than Spider-Man, but that was also because Spidey only had about 30 - 40 minutes of screen-time throughout the entire movie. And finally the third movie, which is my favorite, balanced the screen-time of Parker and Spidey, while also having some of the best superhero action of all time, and some of most emotional scenes in superhero movies to date. So with a superhero trilogy this good, of course I was skeptical about a reboot. Especially since it's only been 5 years since Spider-Man 3, and because originally it was supposed to be Spider-Man 4, but it got canceled and turned into a reboot instead. I just didn't see how a brand new Spider-Man movie starting from scratch could top anything like the Sam Raimi trilogy. But I was wrong.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man is the best Spider-Man movie to-date! And that's saying a lot. Even if this movie doesn't have the charm of the first and second movie, and the emotion and action of the third movie, it still somehow manages to be more enjoyable. Or at least better.<br/><br/>It's very hard to explain how The Amazing Spider-Man is better than Spider-Man 3, but it has to be because the characters are introduced better than they were in the first Sam Raimi movie. In the first Sam Raimi movie, we didn't really get to know any of the characters too well. It wasn't until the second movie came along that we finally hit home with Peter Parker, Mary Jane Watson, Aunt May and all these wonderful characters. But with this start of a new trilogy, it's done much better. With Sam Raimi's movies, it wasn't until the third movie that I cared enough about the characters to almost tear up in some of the scenes. But in the new movie, however, I was very touched by what happened to the characters, even if this is the first time I've been introduced to them. The main character is much more relatable, because he isn't as awkward as the Tobey Maguire Peter, who didn't really even out until the second movie. The only character who they didn't improve on was Aunt May. Rosemary Harris as Aunt May in the Sam Raimi trilogy has to be one of the best characters, as she led some of the most emotionally powerful scenes in those movies. In The Amazing Spider-Man one, she is younger and not as warm-hearted. But of course, the same went for Aunt May in the first Sam Raimi movie, and then she became your favorite relief character in the second movie.<br/><br/>There is so much to talk about when it comes to the characters in The Amazing Spider-Man, because nearly all of them are so fleshed-out and improved from the Sam Raimi movies, even though it's only the first movie in the now on-going trilogy. The last character I wanna talk about is the new villain: Lizard. Dr. Connors was a character in the Sam Raimi movies. He didn't have much screen-time in the second movie, but was there none-the-less. It wasn't until the third movie where he actually had a relevance to the plot, where he explained to Peter what the symbiot was. But in this one, he turns into Lizard. He is very similar to Dr. Octopus in Spider-Man 2: He is working on a ground-breaking invention, but it's not ready for testing. He testes it on himself, crap goes wrong, he turns mad and decides to harness the potential of his invention and take it out on the entire city of New York. See, just like Doc Oc. The only significant difference is that he is not as over-confident about testing his creation as Octopus is. Anyways, I really liked this villain, and he was better than Green Goblin from the first movie. He was just as good as Dr. Octopus, but personally not as good as Sandman or Venom. Sure, more developed, but not as enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>As I think I mildly stated, the story is much better. It's much more well-paced and interesting. And the action and special effects are MUCH better! Let's face it, the original Spider-Man looks like crap now-a-days, and this new movie makes even the second and third movies look bad in comparison! Some of the action is so intense and exciting, that I was on the edge of my seat many times! The scene on the bridge is just so spectacularly suspenseful. I love it!<br/><br/>As a Spider-Man movie to start a new trilogy, The Amazing Spider-Man is incredible, and makes the first Sam Raimi movie look like a high school project (granted a very good high school project, but still). And as a Spider-Man movie, it's also very, very good! Some people complain that this movie was just made so that Sony could claim their rights to the character of Spider-Man, but since the movie turned out to be this good, I don't see how that's a problem. The Amazing Spider-Man is an awesome movie! While it may not have the charm of the Sam Raimi movies, and it may be a bit too long, it succeeds on everything else and I can't wait to see the sequels.<br/><br/>P.S: Bring Venom and Dr. Octopus back for one of the sequels, please!"
"anthonyjacob79","9","3","7","30 August 2012"," Action packed and great visuals
","I really enjoyed this film from the start, I like action flicks and was very fond of the Iron Man movies so far. Although spider man is not one I would normally be interested in or follow I am glad I decided to make the effort to watch it. Some great special effects especially liked the nightscape swinging scenes. There were a couple things that were a bit out placed or far fetched but you do have to allow yourself to get swept along by the current of the movie and not think about realism too much, especially considering the plot of this particular film. I thought at times it was maybe a bit jumping and vivid for the younger minds that might be certified to watch it, but this seems to be the way the film censorship is going, maybe a bit more relaxed nowadays. Overall enjoyed and would watch any additional Spiderman movies."
"Cristi_Ciopron","9","3","7","29 August 2012"," Wearing a mask means not hiding, but being empowered—in a quite unorthodox take, where Ifans shows brio, and E. Stone—arresting legs
","Nowadays kids know perhaps less about the three Spider—Man movies made, tailored from TV footage—they have been released between '77—'79. Then the wrist—shooter guy, whom many have come to like, has been optioned by Corman, and after-wards by The Cannon; nothing came of these—how could it have, one wonders now? The 21st century cinema gave life, or in some instances new life, to many franchises, as a matter of fact the trend began in the late '90s. The Spider—Man, the most photogenic of the superheroes, is also the most graceful, wearing the best—looking suit. An adolescent, and a proletarian superhero, the Spider—Man is endearingly youthful; these are the best things—the suit, the gracefulness, the moves of the character, his dry one—liners and teases when addressing punks. To me, that's the most fanciful of the franchises.<br/><br/>In my hierarchy of the superheroes, Spider—Man ranks no. 1, followed by Batman, then Superman; I didn't enjoy the X—Men, I don't know the Hulk shows—have only seen Lou Ferrigno as a guest star in a sitcom.<br/><br/>Now, if I understood well, Raimi has been more or less kicked out of the franchise. They decided to start it all over again instead.<br/><br/>The 1st installment of the relaunched, reignited franchise, in Romanian UIMITORUL OM PĂIANJEN, where Parker defeats Curtis Connors—an intensely dis-likable mad scientist (played with amazing gusto and brio by Ifans—the guy has a really screwed name ), changes some bits of a storyline, e. g. the mutagen is different, as for an updated scientific level—genetic crossing instead of radiations, etc., otherwise it has wonderful assets, a likable cast and a charming lead, the Spider—Man looks great, Gwen has awesome legs, the fight scenes, the action, the special effects are very good, often exciting and suspenseful, and if the directing lacks a bit of personality, the storytelling is gripping, relentlessly and genuinely thrilling, with patches of dream logic and even incoherences (Parker should of found information about Curtis, via Google searches, earlier, since he was presumably keen on anything concerning his lost family); I have watched it in a movie theater I hadn't set foot in since the summer of '97—15 yrs ago—but the Spider—Man provided enough of a momentum for me to set foot again in the VICTORIA movie theater.<br/><br/>So, yeah, Garfield makes a good Spider—Man—while the storytelling and FX are engrossing. E. Stone is conventionally nice, of a very Germanic, Anglo—Saxon type; there are some arousing shots of her legs. I would of liked more of the idyll, more love scenes—and a bit spicier, more daring. Otherwise, the cast might seem quite meager numerically, quite reduced.<br/><br/>Curtis Connors is the foremost herpetologist, and a conflicted, mitigated villain; while scarier villains are only alluded to—and then, vaguely—like a forehead, enshrined in mists, of a giant , like a barely sketched land beyond the known—in this installment. And aside from Ifans' rants, I do have my reservations about calling his character a villain.<br/><br/>The fancifulness of the franchise was served by the comments made by Parker when confronting thugs, his wry playfulness, his utterly graceful moves, and he has a nice line about being empowered by the mask—when he saves that recalcitrant, scared, perhaps nasty kid, during the fight on the bridge; Curtis has also got some good one—liners.<br/><br/>I didn't like the look of the lizard—man, the head should of looked different, more oblong, it's as if Connors doesn't morph sufficiently, gets glued, caught in that viscous, organic magma, between reigns; sometimes, he's definitely more goofy than menacing.<br/><br/>There's also an interesting moral aside, when Parker tries to hide from Gwen the reason for his unwillingness to meet her again; she guesses it, asks him, Parker doesn't answer verbally. He tries to conceal the pledge asked by her now deceased father. Well, where's the moral in posturing as a bad kid, and breaking the girl's heart? He strives to rescue the policeman's memory—but he does so by wronging his own image—which is also immoral. <br/><br/>So, UIMITORUL OM PĂIANJEN, an urban thriller about an adolescent superhero with the best—looking suit (and girlfriend), registers as a lively, enjoyable, even engrossing movie, revealing the authentic richness of the franchise's world; I liked spending time with Garfield, Ifans and E. Stone. I would of enjoyed more romance—and also —but the action scenes were a knockout, and Parker's training, after he discovers his new powers—and the scene in the subway—the beer bottle, the beer drop scene, with Parker jumping on the ceiling; Sheen was something of a bore, but I suppose he was meant to, and I liked the adolescent's retort and burst when being lectured about responsibility. Parker chooses the suit of a Crusader, we are shown, which is apposite, since the spider wears a cross—as Blaga knew. As a footnote, the lizard was still Curtis, so it wasn't a mutant lizard—but a mutant scientist; there again, the reptile should of looked more scary, more menacing. The determination of the policemen in shooting to kill, after Gwen's dad shouts he wants the Spider—Man off the streets, the one who had saved the boy on the bridge—and the cops must of known about that act of his—is puzzling. Otherwise, the citizens in this 1st installment of the awaited reboot show a nice team spirit, willingness to help, and nonjudgmental attitude (which is a bit at odds with what I happen to know about the early comics); and I liked Parker's final resolution to neglect what he had been promising to the old fart.<br/><br/>And the tag-line is: Wearing a mask means not hiding, but being empowered—in a quite unorthodox take, where Ifans shows brio, and E. Stone—arresting legs (I wouldn't of mentioned it if it had been vice versa). So let Ifans show ahead more brio, and Gwen—the same legs!"

"avansteinberg","6","3","7","17 July 2012"," Your Average Big-Budget Action Movie
","Let me preface this by saying that if you're a Spider-Man fan, or a mid-pubescent male, you will enjoy this movie. I'm neither, but I can objectively say that this is not a ""must see"" film. However, I ended up seeing it twice and shucking out about 20 bucks in the process. I got what I expected. I just didn't expect very much at all.<br/><br/>I'm not a huge superhero fan, but some friend's wanted to see it, so I tagged along. Occasionally these sort of movies pleasantly surprise me, as was the case in The Dark Knight. Unfortunately, this movie is exactly what I expected; a few hours of thrilling action shots and engrossing fight scenes.<br/><br/>Like most films of this genre, the story line was sub-par, but they managed to pace it rather well. On the other hand, the screen-writing was actually pretty horrid. It featured boring and stereotypical scenes, corny wisecracks, and was really repetitive in some parts. Sometimes these repetition really took away from the advancement of the story line, which made an average story broken and disconnected. It just didn't come off as a very well put together movie.<br/><br/>But I'm not going to sit here and act like I have some exceedingly delicate movie-viewing pallet. I enjoyed it for what it was. Like I said, the action and special affects were entertaining, and the chemistry between Peter and Gwen (Garfield and Stone) really shown through out the entire movie. The characters were also well rounded, the only thing that keeps me from putting a price on the writers heads. Even the bully and the villain were real people.<br/><br/>The saving grace of this movie: How good looking the lead actors were. As a guy, I can say that Emma Stone looks kind of hot as this sweater-wearing high school intellectual. And the ladies were probably all over Garfield. So good job Marvel! You can't hire writers, but you can hire hot actors!"
"connorallen2606","6","3","7","17 July 2012"," The Good but not Great Spider-Man
","First let me just say, this is not a negative review. The Amazing Spider-Man met my expectations. Nothing more, nothing less. This reboot gets a lot of things right. Marc Webb does an excellent job, he creatively and playfully filmed the action scenes and successfully executed his own fresh, unique vision of Spidey's adventures. The scenes where Spider-Man is swinging through New York City are breath-taking and vertigo-inducing., perhaps even more-so than Sam Raimi's. <br/><br/>The cast was perfectly chosen and I can't really think of any role in the movie I would have rather seen another actor fill. Andrew Garfield makes for a much better Spider-Man than Tobey Maguire in my opinion, he brings a lot of charm and cheekiness to the role that wasn't really seen in Raimi's trilogy, this film really shows Peter Parker develop as a character throughout, and the chemistry here between Garfield and Stone is excellent.<br/><br/>I had issues with a few things though. The CGI on the most part was incredible but The Lizard looked laughable. He looked like a cartoon Godzilla and was less menacing and frightening than I would have liked to see. The villain and character of Curt Connors was really underwritten in my opinion, and it failed to really fully utilise Rhys Ifans' acting capabilities.<br/><br/>Whilst the director's take on it was visually distinct from the other trilogy, it wasn't really the ""untold story"" as the marketing would have us believe. Sure, it threw in a few extra sub plots and tweaks here and there (so he made the web shooters himself, what a game changer THAT one was), but the majority was stuff we've already seen. This would have been forgivable, had this not been released a mere 10 years after the original (and 5 years after the last one!)<br/><br/>Ultimately I did have a good time watching The Amazing Spider-Man, and I'm sure many others will do as well. It shouldn't massively disappoint anyone, just don't expect anything too spectacular here. A sequel is very much on the cards, and now the origin story is done and out of the way, with the talented cast and crew involved, I believe and hope the franchise becomes genuinely original and starts to go places Raimi's trilogy never did. 6/10."
"thewillt08","6","3","7","14 July 2012"," OK, but the original was better
","Pros: Acton scenes were fantastic. I saw it in IMAX so the 3d was awesome. The effects were amazing and the lizard looked real. The web didn't look like fishing line and the Spiderman suit looked a lot better. Martin sheen made a good Uncle Ben but Toby McGuire made a better peter parker. Overall it was an OK movie but the original was a lot better. Cons: acting was mediocre. Peter Parker had a lot of cheesy 1 liner and was less of a nerd. Peter parker is a nerd not a skateboarder. The character of Uncle Ben was less of a hero and more of a random guy. He and aunt may were less important. The main difference is character development...or lack thereof. Luckily I didn't have 2 stare at Kirsten Dunce 4 2 hours. The new girl was hot but their love story was not as epic. The story was more about action and less about Spiderman. I didn't like that. I like character development and more about the story. Characters were mentioned and forgotten. The guy who kills Uncle Ben is seen 1 time and never seen again. Loose ends. The main villain doesn't die. He lives. Retarded. The entire movie was predictable. Not because I knew Uncle Ben was going to die. I knew what was going in the climax and the end 30 minutes before it happened. Overall it was an OK movie with really good and really bad. It can't compare to the original but as its own movie it was decent. I would recommend it but i will not buy it or see it again. The fact that they r going to make 2 more is a big mistake."
"RonnieHR","5","3","7","10 July 2012"," Not nearly as good as the first one
","Not a fan of this one. I believe it was re-booted was too soon. The first one is so recent there's no way (in my opinion) not to be influenced by both the screenplay and even the actors of the first.<br/><br/>The review on the IMDb home page of this movie indicates this one is funnier than the original. I don't know what movie that reviewer was watching, but no way was this one funnier. In fact, in my opinion, there wasn't one funny line or scene. Actually, they tried so hard to make it funny that the lines fell very flat. I'm thinking the reviewer was either part of the movie making process or is related to someone in this film.<br/><br/>I'm not going to fault the 2 main actors in this movie, as I think they were let down by a marginal screenplay. I've not seen Garfield in anything else so I'm not going to grade him. And it will take a lot for me to say anything bad about Emma Stone as she's just way too cute."
"migas_martins","8","3","7","10 July 2012"," To say that Tobey Maguire's performance was better than Andrew Garfield's is to not know Peter Parker/Spider-man
","Yes I said it, Andrew Garfield is a better Spider-man and an even better Peter Parker than Tobey Maguire's was. He is much more interesting, he is an outcast, and shy figure, not dorky, like Tobey's was. And I personally relate more to that. As a person that grew up with Spider-man comics and the 90's TV Series, I think this version is much more closer to that one and so I liked it a lot more. I think overall the movie's tone was more realistic and one could relate more with Peter's inner struggle and anger. The cast is great, and I liked the chemistry between Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield. I thought that retelling the origin was unnecessary, and still do, everyone knows it by now...even so, I liked the scenes between Peter Parker and Uncle Ben, Martin Sheen does a good job in this one, and because of that one can relate more to Peter Parker's pain when he looses his fatherly figure. This version of Spider-man actions and reflexes are much more spider like. The way webs are used in action scenes was overall much more imaginative, whether it was used as a real web to catch a prey in the sewers, or the detail that I loved when Spider-man tried to wrap the Lizard in web while circling around him like a spider would. The movie is not perfect though, that's why I gave it an 8. Where it misses is in the plot, some questions left unanswered leaving much to a sequel, and some scenes like the basketball and American football, I think they took them too far, I understand the idea, basically if I had such power I would like to show it off too.. But the way it was shown, everyone would know that he is Spider-man.. Overall I liked the movie a lot and I wait eagerly for a sequel, I think the potential is there for a much better trilogy, much closer to the comics version of Spider-man!"
"donaldjohn316","8","3","7","9 July 2012"," A must watch for Spider man fans!
","The movie was terrific in every sense. I wasn't sure what to expect from this reboot mainly because I thought it was unnecessary and I was expecting a sequel to Sam Raimi's trilogy. I have to be honest, I thought there was no possible way to top the first Spider man because it delivered everything I wanted to see in a super hero movie. But this movie completely blew me off and was much better than the last three movies in my opinion.<br/><br/>The performances of every actors where outstanding including Rhys Ifans who played the role of the villain, the Lizard. Emma Stone played the character of Gwen Stacey well and her romance with Parker was good and seemed natural.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield played his role almost perfectly and portrayed Spider man just as in the comic books as most importantly did a much better job than Tobey Maguire. Hats off to the director for this achievement. I am not disrespecting Tobey but Andrew definitely showed better sense of the character of Peter Parker and Spider man. <br/><br/>The ups of this movie include : good action, good performances, good storyline and narration. The major narrative arc of this movie is what happened to Peter Parker's parents. This element is missing in the past three movies of Spider man. Unfortunately this movie leaves us with a cliffhanger and does not completely tell us the untold story of what happened to them and it is for the sequel to show us wider explanation. <br/><br/>The movie has more elements of drama than the first trilogy when it comes to finding out about Peter's parents. This is very good indeed as it brings newer story lines into the Spider man movie and not just fighting his enemies and saving innocent civilians. I feel this sort of storytelling is adapted from The Dark Knight trilogy of Christopher Nolan but it's still very good.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie might seem a bit excessive as there is nothing really happening that need to be acknowledged off. It certainly drags the side stories further which makes the movie feel a bit dull and boring. It is the second half that keeps us entertained which the introduction of the Lizard. These scenes keeps us on the edge of the scenes. There are three major fight scenes in the movie. This is not too much nor too less. Fight scenes are good and there are moments which is quite scary even when it is predictable. Although the climax is interesting it can be questionable as fans might have different opinions on how the villain is defeated. <br/><br/>Few downsides are also present. There are flaws in the movie but you wouldn't bee too concerned if you are attached to the main story and what is happening. *Spoiler alert* In a scene the policemen come to capture what they thought was a dead or unconscious Lizard are gassed by some chemical potion by the Lizard that made them turn slowly into Lizards themselves. The audience at this point believe that the policemen will turn to Lizards and come to attack the civilians along with the original Lizard. In the next scenes we see Spidey fighting with the Lizard and in the end just when Lizard is about to release the chemical cloud that turns humans to lizard-like from OsCorp's tower, Spider-Man eventually disperses an antidote cloud instead that turns back the earlier victims to normal. This might seem disappointing as you might have wanted the affected victims to turn lizard-like and start destroying the city before they are put back to normal. Another flaw is when the dying Captain George Stacey, father of Gwen Stacey makes Peter promise to keep Gwen safe by staying away from her, but then towards the end he decides to see her anyway. I actually wanted Peter to start seeing Gwen again in the sequel as it might have made more sense then. <br/><br/>There are humorous scenes which gives you few laughs as well that is needed to break some tension. The next movie should reveal what happened to Parker's parents and this story should be more interesting. I hope the villains will also be just as good as the Lizard.<br/><br/>Also stay tuned until the mid post credits scene which confirms the sequel for the movie.*Spoiler alert* I assume the mystery man to be Electro or Mysterio as they have ability to disappear and become invisible during lightening.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is a complete entertainer as fans of Spider man will not be disappointed. It is a great much needed reboot of Spider man and I am sure you will agree with me if you watch it.<br/><br/>The movie gets a worthy 8 out of 10."

"josh_youngbwfc","9","3","7","9 July 2012"," The Amazing Spider-Man Lives Up to its Title
","When The Amazing Spider-Man was announced there was a mixture of uproar and confusion among audiences. After all, Sam Raimi and Tobey Maguire's trilogy had only ended in 2007 and Spider-Man 3 became the highest grossing movie of that franchise so why start from scratch again, why not continue? Everyone had an opinion on whether it should be rebooted or not but one thing was guarantee; whether it was Spider-Man 4 or The Amazing Spider-Man people were going to see it because Spider-Man is one of the most popular superheroes in the world. I will only make one comparison between The Amazing Spider-Man and the trilogy of the last decade and it is this: Things that are better in The Amazing Spider-Man than in Sam Raimi's trilogy: EVERYTHING.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield takes on the role of teenager Peter Parker who after being bitten by a spider blah blah blah. Everyone knows the story, so what is different here? This time Peter Parker is looking to try and find out who he is, why his parents disappeared when Peter was just a child, what work his father was working on that was kept so secret. All the time, trying to come to terms with his new abilities and manage a love life with the beautiful Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), avoid being captured by the head of New York Police who just so happens to be Gwen Stacy's father (Denis Leary) and eventually saving New York from a huge giant Lizard, or Dr Curt Connors, if you would prefer, (Rhys Ifans). So really, he's got it easy.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield in the lead role is superb. A genuine fan of Spider-Man since he was a kid and it shows in the charisma and life he brings to the troubled teenager on screen; he carries a great emotional range and the one liners and witty remarks are delivered perfectly. The chemistry with his co-star Emma Stone is there for all to see and she puts in a performance to rival that of Garfield's. The lead duo are supported excellently by Rhys Ifans, a man born to play villains. But my favourite performance of The Amazing Spider-Man is from Michael Sheen as Uncle Ben, really really fantastic! The Amazing Spider-Man is visually wonderful and I really would not have expected anything less from director Marc Webb. A lot of trust was put in Webb with this being only his second ever film and his first on a big budget but he proved with (500) Days of Summer that he has a great talent for capturing great performances, stunning visuals and examining relationships.<br/><br/>Despite this being a clear superhero comic book movie film, the superhero antics seem to take a back seat and we are allowed to delve deeper into the characters. Peter Parker is clearly a conflicted guy who has grown up having a troubled life which isn't about to get any easier and the relationships he forms with his Uncle and Aunt are really well written, his relationship with Gwen Stacy (a vital part of Spider-Man history in the comic books) is dealt with wonderfully and with a huge deal of respect. You get a real sense that all of these characters are believable in their motivations, their friendships, their triumphs and short comings.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man doesn't quite match up to The Avengers and probably won't beat The Dark Knight Rises either but what we have here is proof that they were right to reboot the Spider-Man"
"brunowangtaiwan","9","3","7","8 July 2012"," Must See in IMAX 3D for the Full Experience
","OK, it's not a given that a huge Anime fan is also a comic book fan, but when it comes to most of the major franchise titles from DC and Marvel Bruno Wang will admit that he is a bit of a glutton. That said, I am a huge fan of the Spidey franchise and feel that the original trilogy was done extremely well.<br/><br/>With that out of the way, the new ""The Amazing Spiderman"" is, in and of itself, a really good flick. The only criticism I would say coming out of the theater is that it lacked the usual schmaltzy humor that accompanies 'comic book' films. Sometimes that humor is just the right ingredient when dealing with, what we all know deep down, are impossible realities such as doctors turning themselves into giant lizards.<br/><br/>The new Spiderman movie succeeds on many levels though, not the least of which is the CGI. This is pretty much a MUST see in IMAX 3D. IT was really designed for the full on experience both visually and from a sound standpoint. You will however have to wait till near the final third of the film to really see the intense CGI and 3D effects...but it is well worth the wait.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spiderman tells a story, basically much more of the original Spiderman legacy, and it does a superb job. It is a deeply emotional and well-acted script with very little fluff. The first hour of the film is pretty much plot build and also introduces the key characters. Rather than jumping immediately into intense action sequences, we are taken deep into the origin of Spiderman and we get a very real sense of connection with his family and his love interest. <br/><br/>Andrew Garfield really does a great job as the new franchise front man Peter Parker and, much like his predecessor Tobey Maguire, he has boyish good looks that allow him to pull off being an 18 year old high school student. Emma Stone plays his love interest, Gwen Stacy, and she also has the ability to pull of her role as a 17 year-old. It is the fire and naiveté of teenager energy that makes the script much more realistic for these two actors. Stone also delivers some very emotional scenes and really carries you through her feelings with near perfection. Garfield does a great job playing the angst ridden teen who is, at the same time, trying to grapple with his super powers after being bit by a genetically engineered spider. <br/><br/>The story line follows Peter as he hunts down the mysterious disappearance of his parents and uncovers his father's research into cross-breed engineering. In the process, Peter Parker contacts Dr. Curt Connors (aka The Lizard) and offers him part of a missing formula for genetic enhancement. While visiting Connors at OsCorp, Peter gets bitten by the spider and, well...<br/><br/>The choice of Martin Sheen and Sally Field as Uncle Ben and Aunt May is absolutely outstanding. Here we have two veteran actors who bring this deeply emotional substance and reality to the film. The balance of the harsh, know-it-all, energy of the late teen and these two sincere and loving caretakers is the perfect blend. This heightens the audiences experience on Parker's deep inner struggles. Denis Leary also delivers a strong performance as Captain Stacy, Gwen's father, the police captain who is dealing with the 'meddling' of the outlaw Spiderman and his own sense of civic duty to the city. <br/><br/>Since the film has crushed the box office in its opening week it is pretty much a lock that there is a sequel. We are treated to a forward view at the end of the film and introduced to a shadowy, but unknown, character. <br/><br/>I give this film a Bruno Wang 4.5 out of 5 stars. The CGI is absolutely stunning, the IMAX 3D experience is one of the best I have seen to date...particularly near the very end where you are taken on an almost dizzying ride in 3D. The acting is solid and brings out some very strong emotional sequences. Again, the only criticism would be the lack of laughs that, while usually corny in comic book movies, brings a small sense of reality to the films."
"johnnymacbest","Null","3","7","8 July 2012"," The most amazing Spider-Man film ever.
","I just came back from seeing ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" and in my opinion is the best Spider-Man film ever made; far surpassing even the Sam Raimi films. What Mark Webb has done is nothing short of amazing. He wiped the grime that was Spider-Man 3 from audiences and, like Chris Nolan, gave him a clean slate and made him exist in a world that is highly plausible and believable at the same time. Everything feels real and it just draws you in. Character emotions, action scenes, well written dialog feels real.<br/><br/>Part of the reason why this works is because it feels wholly cohesive. Sam Raimi's films were good in their day, but the felt a little too cartoonish and campy though I liked Spider-Man 2 better than part 1. But Webb gives it a more human angle while setting it in a gritty, contemporary world that is haunting and unforgiving.<br/><br/>With all that said, it's the acting that's the most impressive. Andrew Garfield thoroughly sets himself up as a more believable Peter Parker/Spider-Man. He's more agile and full of physical action than the one portrayed by Tobey Maguire as well as more emotional and expressive. We see his anguish, his heartbreak, his anger, his frustrations, and determination. But we also see something that has never been touched upon in the previous films: his inventiveness. How he builds his devices in which to fight crime(as well as guarding his privacy) showcases that and I applaud the filmmakers for exploring that bit of the iconic character. Sam Raimi has never done that.<br/><br/>Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy does a lot more than she did in Spider-Man 3. In that film she was nothing more than window-dressing and a substitute for when MJ wasn't available to warm Peter's heart, but in this film,she is really caring about Peter and the build up to their relationship is organic and really natural; something that's been missing in Spider-Man 1 and 2. With such well written dialog between the two characters, you really feel for them; almost as if they were real people despite being fictional characters and this film has that nailed down very well.<br/><br/>But no Superhero film would not be complete without a superb villain and Rhys Ifans does an incredible performance as the menacing, giant green monstrous Lizard. I so wanted to see this character portrayed on live-action film and thankfully I got that chance. With such believable and realistic CGI, much better than Spidey 1 and 2(though 2 was incredible in it's depiction of Dock Ock)the filmmakers make him more than a worthy adversary for ol' web head to tangle with. I only wish that there was more banter between them in their alter egos. Though I enjoyed their interactions with each other before becoming enemies, I would've loved it if they had more interaction.<br/><br/>I was thrilled by the action. I doesn't feel artificial at all; it feels more organic, especially when Spidey is swinging around town, beating up bad guys, or just simply hanging around. No thanks to the state of the art technology powering the film, it's only used to emphasize the film, not completely dry it.<br/><br/>I like The Amazing Spider-Man. No, I LOVE IT!!! The best Spider-Man film ever made. Everyone on board has gave the audience an amazing thrill ride from start to finish while also getting into the character's head. I'm really looking forward to see what Marc Webb and the rest of the gang are spinning for the next film. Kudos to everyone involved, The Amazing Spider-Man is truly amazing."
"WydeOpen","8","3","7","8 July 2012"," Creative new spin on a modern-day American fairy tale that doesn't stray far from the heart of the classic origin.
","Studio: Columbia/Sony Cast: Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Rhys Ifans, Martin Sheen, Sally Field Rating: PG-13 Running Time: 136 minutes<br/><br/>One of the only strikes against ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is the fact it's a reboot of a very popular and successful film series. That's an issue only because in a summer where two of the biggest comic book based franchises ( ""The Avengers"", ""The Dark Knight Rises"")  compete to break and set box office records, few were excited about a do-over of the film series that takes the audience back to the beginning of an already well known story. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the very capable Sam Raimi, director of the first three Spider-Man films and Columbia/Sony couldn't agree on several aspects of the future of the franchise so instead of moving ahead with a fourth installment the studio immediately began production on this ""re- imaging"".<br/><br/>The gamble paid off as ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" creatively puts a new spin on a story so well known that it is practically a modern-day American fairy tale. <br/><br/>From the opening scene, the score reveals that the tone of the film is going to be much darker than the Toby McGuire/ Kirsten Dunst vehicle.<br/><br/>Since the majority of the characters have been well established on screen over the past 10 years (nevermind the past 50 years of comic book history) in order for the latest film to succeed it was imperative for the new cast to totally own their roles beginning with Andrew Garfield (The Social Network) as the new Peter Parker. <br/><br/>He does an excellent job not only establishing himself as the iconic alter-ego of Spider-Man but he also successfully reinvents the personality of Peter Parker. At the core of the character is his witty one-liners which Garfield delivers with the comic timing of comedy veterans like Billy Crystal. His Peter is still a super smart teen and sort of a square peg but Garfield manages to infuse an aura of cool never before been seen in the character. <br/><br/>Denis Leary and Rhys Ifans seamlessly take over roles previously played by James Cromwell and Dylan Baker as police Captain Stacy and Dr. Curt Conner - relatively minor characters on the previous films. However in this movie both are major protagonists. In Ifans case, he also introduces Conner's alter-ego -The Lizard; a bad guy out of Spidey's rouge gallery whose origins are directly tied to Spider-Man's. <br/><br/>The extremely talented Emma Stone (The Help) takes over the role of Gwen Stacy played previously by Bryce Dallas Howard. However, this film (staying true to the comic) introduces Gwen as Peter's first love interest. Stone and Garfield demonstrate chemistry that in the midst of all the action tells a sweet teenage love story. <br/><br/>Director Marc Webb consulted with 3D guru James Cameron during the planning process which led to the movie bring filmed in digital 3D rather than converted post-production. This brings clarity and crispness to the scenes and the special effects that doesn't detract from nor overwhelm a surprisingly well written script.<br/><br/>(Audiences should be aware that beginning with this movie Sony is charging theaters for the 3D glasses which will undoubtedly result in higher prices at the ticket office. Is the additional price justified? Here's a great article to help you decide.)<br/><br/>While the writers took some artistic license and modernized some elements of Spider-Man's beginnings, the story essentially doesn't stray far from the heart of the classic origin. <br/><br/>Many have said they aren't as excited about this movie as they were/are about the other summer  blockbusters. Had anyone known how good of a movie this would turn out to be I'm sure the Web Crawler's ticket pre-sale would have rivaled all the other heroes of the big screen."
"rebecca-ry","8","3","7","8 July 2012"," A Massive Improvement
","'The Amazing Spiderman' is a film that has been greatly anticipated but has also made a lot of people worry. The re-boot of the franchise so quickly after Sam Raimi's attempt seems ridiculous as there is not really a new generation of children yet to be introduced to Spiderman since 'Spiderman 3' was just released in 2007. I think director Marc Webb has taken this opportunity to fix what was wrong with the previous trilogy.<br/><br/>The script is great, the film promised more information relating to Peter Parker's back-story i.e. what happened to his parents but you do not get a great deal of NEW information. Compared to Raimi's trilogy there are only a few extra bits in the beginning. Aside from that, the story is different because it sees Spiderman deal with a new villain, the Lizard. The whole story was well-written and the Lizard had a lot to do with Parker's identity.<br/><br/>The acting was good, Andrew Garfield is already far better than Tobey Maguire. I think this may be because the film focuses on Parker's life in high school rather than in adult life so you see him in some scenes behaving like a real teenager which is great. Rhys Ifans was good but not great, he did portray both sides of his character well but I think there was a lot of room for improvement there. Emma Stone was really good; she played the love interest of Spiderman very well if you compare it to Kirsten Dunst's performance in the previous trilogy where she had no on-screen presence whatsoever. <br/><br/>One thing that was really impressive was the special effects, they tried to use as little CGI as possible when it came to stunts but for scenes where Spiderman is swinging through the air it did look a lot more realistic, unlike Raimi's trilogy where scenes like this would look too weightless, thankfully in this film they have managed to sort this out so it really does look like it is a real person swinging through the air. The effects used to create the Lizard were very well done too, the whole design of the villain was great, particularly the face which looked very creepy, especially when he spoke.<br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend this film as it is a massive improvement on the previous trilogy. If you've not seen a Spiderman film before this is a great place to start. Andrew Garfield is a great superhero and I can't wait to see what they do next."
"PJGuitar","9","3","7","8 July 2012"," Nailed it
","As a Spider-man fan I was very much looking forward to this film and it did not disappoint. Lets first discuss Andrew Garfield.<br/><br/>Whilst some believe he's too cool but he plays the awkward nerd very well, those among us who consider themselves awkward nerds will identify with almost all the scenes in this film. In the action scenes whether stuntman or whoever it was, Garfield holds his own. Most importantly this Spider-man quips.<br/><br/>Emma Stone as Gwen is also a far more interesting character than Mary Jane. This is early in Peter's life, there was no Mary Jane at that point, she'll presumably show up later. Anyway, Stone's performance is very convincing, but we already knew that she was capable of delivering solid performances. As a character we have something more than a damsel in distress, someone who can help, I won't say how but we do.<br/><br/>Rhys Ifans is also very menacing when he needs to be and kind when he needs to be. His performance is so good I completely forgot about his role in Notting Hill.<br/><br/>This story is a lot more character driven, as well it should, it is about teens growing up basically, whilst attempting to stop a giant lizard terrorising New York. And for the most part this film nails the emotional side, I was gutted when SPOILER Ben died, but I was equally happy to see the relationship between Gwen and Peter grow, the roof top scene is very sweet.<br/><br/>That does not mean it skimps on the action, there is a lot of action in this film and it is very intense and films in such a way that you can see what's going on. Coupled with the action is the web slinging, and there are moments when the swinging is great taking, the introduction of the occasional first person camera was a genius move.<br/><br/>I recommend this to everyone, yes you've seen his origins before, but you'll be surprised at just how different they can make it, whilst still keeping with the comics."
"TheMovieSnob247","6","3","7","7 July 2012"," A good reboot of the Spider-Man franchise, but keep your expectations in check
","So it's an annoying pattern for me with some of these summer films. They mostly go like this: a so so story, average acting at best and great special effects/action. That's pretty much what we have here. I wasn't expecting much going in given as I felt like they just finished making the original trilogy and this film was somewhat unnecessary. But after the debacle that was Spider-Man 3, it was probably inevitable. Truthfully though, my low expectations were met. <br/><br/>First of all there are some tweaks to the story, but that's to be expected of a reboot. Some changes I liked, some I didn't. For the most part, they stayed true to the story line you'd expect. However, it was a bit formulaic and the themes were still fairly simple and somewhat childish, but it's a comic book film, so I can't get too upset about that, right? Well, not exactly. I know, it's just comic book movie, but The Dark Knight has spoiled me, I'm sorry. I'm still hoping for a bit of a darker tweak to the franchise at some point. <br/><br/>The film definitely got better as it went along, much better. The first third of the film did feel really rushed to me a it seemed they wanted to very quickly setup the known elements of the origin story to get to the action and later story arcs. Kind of surprising, I mean, I think we know the Spider-Man story at this point don't we? But I digress. It was was over the top in a number of ways. The soundtrack was over done and pushed the sentimentality a little too much for my liking. And it was also way too cheesy, I had a few too many ""oh come on"" moments. Particularly one that was just so over the top I gasped, but it's one the young ladies in the theatre loved; it was both romantic and incredibly cheesy.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield was definitely a solid choice, he clearly felt much more like Peter Parker than Tobey McQuire did. He was very shy, awkward and a little troubled, staying true to the Peter Parker we've seen while effectively improving on those performances. I'm curious now to re-watch the original trilogy to see how I feel about him in that role after seeing this. He and Emma Stone are cute together and much more likable than Tobey and Kirsten Dunst were (especially Dunst, who I found annoying). The film had a childish playfulness to it that I enjoyed and found authentic and this was directly because of them. Martin Sheen and Sally Field were also good in the limited roles they had.<br/><br/>The high point of the film were the special effects, hands down. I loved the Lizard, easily the best visualization of him I've seen to date. He was very sinister and a little dark. Also loved the voice over work done for him as well. Didn't really care much for the Rhys Ifans pre-lizard character however, felt he was not as compelling as Alfred Molina's Doc Oc. Spider-Man looked fantastic, the effects for him have clearly gotten better, much better. Given the new bar set here for special effects, I can't wait to see what they do with Venom later in the series.<br/><br/>Now having said all that, this was fairly entertaining. The fight scenes were very impressive and well choreographed. It definitely had a genuine comic book and cartoon feel to it and I thought was cool in a nostalgic kind of way. It reminded me very much of the Fox afternoon Spider-Man cartoon I used to watch back in my early high school days. So definitely credit there, as I don't think any of the original films did this for me to this extent. <br/><br/>I was however baffled by the rapturous applause it got at the end in my theatre. I can't remember the last film that got that much applause, to be really honest (not even The Avengers got that). Was it good, yes. Was it deserving of that kind of applause, no. But then again, I'm a bit snobby I guess, so to each his own. In a nutshell; it was enjoyable and I look forward to the rest of this series with this improved cast. But the standard for Spider-Man movies remains 2004's Spider-Man 2. <br/><br/>http://www.themoviesnob.ca/<br/><br/>@the_movie_snob"

"Prichards12345","6","3","7","7 July 2012"," A solid reboot . Do we really need it?
","The Reasonably Decent Spider-Man would be a far better title for this movie. The two leads, Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone do excellent jobs; Stone, indeed, is way better than Kirsten Dunst. The movie is much more character-focused and less action-filled than the original Raimi trilogy. But it's also much less dynamic and quirky. <br/><br/>There's some funny moments but much of the plot is a mixed bag, many strands simply don't go anywhere or trail off into nothing. Parker's parents feel like Harry Potter all over again. Aha, I spot Steve Kloves in the writing credits!<br/><br/>We've seen a guy turn into Spider-Man before, of course. And we've also seen the decent scientist turn into a super-villain spiel. The movie is watchable but never really excites; it is teen orientated but isn't teen mush. At times Spidey seems strangely grounded - only occasionally do we get the swinging past skyscrapers stuff; and yes, there's a people in peril on a bridge sequence. Too much feels like ""Done that, have the T-shirt."" But it's Garfield who really scores well here. I won't say he's better than Toby Mcguire but he feels much more like the comic-book Parker. It's a really good performance but in the wrong movie. I can't help feeling Sony would have been better simply continuing the series with the new actors rather than re-booting it. Saying that Denis Leary has a nice role as Capt. Stacey.<br/><br/>I also think the Peter/Mary-Jane/Harry thing, one of the original films' great strengths, is sorely missed here. And because the film stays resolutely in High School there's no J.Jonah Jameson either. I'm probably sounding a bit harsh on the film - it certainly isn't a failure in many respects. I just don't think we needed it yet."
"brent_or","6","3","7","6 July 2012"," Great potential, but not very well-executed...
","In spite of several very good individual elements, Amazing Spider-Man falls short as a whole. The good includes a beautiful, more modern aesthetic (compared to the previous Spider-Man films), a for the most part very good cast, and an admirable effort to build more technical/""realistic"" explanation into the back story. That being said, to me it fails as a reboot because far too much of it feels both highly derivative of, and sadly inferior to, last decade's Spider-Man 1 and 2. When rebooting a franchise, the last thing that you want the audience to be thinking as they watch the film is, ""this is really a lot like the other version, but not really as good."" That thought went through my mind multiple times. The other problem, which is sort of the same problem, is that the villain was just not convincing. Too clichéd, again too derivative of both Green Goblin and Dr. Octopus, without being nearly as well fleshed out or understandable, and thus not nearly as truly menacing. Also, the villain's form, literally, did not make sense. I will not spoil that, but the character's visual design is incongruous, which make him harder to buy into. The exposition was lacking in some other key areas, as well. I will say that the cast was terrific, in particular Emma Stone, Sally Field and Martin Sheen, in addition to Andy Garfield. It is saying something that they fully atone for the absence of the much-beloved Toby and Kirsten. The Spidey costume is awesome as well. The problem is that this is not as good as Spider-Man 1 or 2 were as fully-formed films."
"tangochan85","6","3","7","6 July 2012"," Cartoonish in a good way. I had fun.
","If the Raimi trilogy was about Spider-Man in reality, then this is about turning the comic into reality. This is most evident during the battle between Spider-Man and Dr. Connor where the special effects look very much like moving comic panels. This movie also seemed to highlight what separates those from generation Y born in the 80's and those from generation Y born in the 90's. This is very much Spider-Man and Peter Parker is very much Peter Parker, however, there are marked differences between Maguire's Parker and Garfield's Parker that come down to the movies trying to relate to the teenagers comprising the audience in their respective runs. I think that if I was ten years younger, this movie would have spoken to me on the level that Raimi's movies spoke to me on, but I'm not a teenager anymore and so there was less to relate to this time. It still made for an enjoyable movie, however, and I am looking forward to its inevitable sequel."
"jmfall20","10","3","7","6 July 2012"," Peter Parker's Story - Well Told.
","The Amazing Spider-Man has received far too many mixed and bad reviews from people angry that the beloved previous series was rebooted so quickly. To put it simply, the cinematography, plot, acting and character development of The Amazing Spider-Man make 2002's Spider-Man look like a bad TV Show that has lost most of its connection to its original source material. <br/><br/>Many people claiming to be comic book fans are complaining about vast and sweeping inaccuracies from the comics, and are raging about how Stan Lee should be furious and ""This isn't Spider-Man, it's Twilight!""<br/><br/>Now, this film doesn't exactly follow the comic book down to the page, there are a few slight changes that I won't point out for the sake of avoiding spoilers. However compared to most comic book movies, this film is very surprisingly accurate, and far more so than its predecessors. Very few actual Spider-Man fans have any complains about the romantic scenes between Gwen and Peter (although we're used to reading about them in college, they make the transition to high school very well), and love the way classic characters like the Lizard and Captain Stacy have been modernized while remaining true to the original spirit of their creators. <br/><br/>Certainly this Peter Parker is a far more modern high school student than the old one (who was in high school for around forty minutes), but this needs to happen! It's not 1967, and we need characters who are relatable NOW. This Peter Parker is a superb modernization of the original character and captures the Peter Parker/Spider-Man magic much better than the previous movie version.<br/><br/>There is room for criticism in my review however, and some complaints are well founded. For example, complaints that the film was not well paced do have some merit. It's almost as though the Peter Parker scenes are slow and thoughtful, but the Spider-Man scenes are rushed and panicked. Unfortunately to anyone disappointed, Spider-Man has always been about Peter Parker, and we've seen three movies of him swinging around and hitting villains while rescuing damsels in distress. <br/><br/>Now it's time for Peter Parker's story."
"hamaadshehzad","9","3","7","5 July 2012"," Great Film!!
","I absolutely LOVE the Spider-Man comic books that were originally created by Stan Lee and also enjoy Brian Michael Bendis' ""Ultimate Spider-Man"" a lot. First of all let me say wow, the casting for this movie was perfect and I couldn't think of another guy to play Peter Parker the way Andrew Garfield did. He had a great sense of humor mixed in with the 'nerdiness' of Peter. Emma Stone did an amazing job as Gwen Stacy and I really hope she doesn't get killed in any of them since I like Gwen Stacy a lot more than Mary Jane Watson. The story for this movie and some of the darkness makes it very interesting and I hope to see more in this series. The action scenes in this movie were amazing since the fighting style of Spider-Man is my favorite of any Comic Book Super-Hero. Stan Lee had his best cameo yet in my opinion as the school librarian who is listening to some classical music while there is a very intense fight scene going on behind him and happily walks out the door without noticing. You could hardly hear the music when everybody was laughing. I really think Marc Webb did a great job staying true to comic book fans with ""The Amazing Spider-Man and I am very happy to see Tobey Maguire and Kristen Dunst out of the picture. It is not because their acting is bad, because it isn't. It is the fact that I find that the actors weren't good for the characters they were acting as. Overall, this is a great movie for everyone! GO WATCH IT NOW!!!!"

","""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a superhero film that consists of action, drama, suspense and comedy. The film is a reboot of the Spider-Man trilogy that started in 2002. Marc Webb has taken the challenge of making Spider-Man his own and ready to compete with a competitive comic- book hero summer that consists of The Dark Knight Rises and The Avengers. Let's see if the ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" has what it takes to compete with the big boys.<br/><br/>Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is very smart high school student who loses his parents at a young age and lives with his Aunt May (Sally Field) and Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen). Peter, being curious, tries to find out why his father disappeared and stumbled upon a cross-genetic that leads him to meeting Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans). Wandering around the lab, he comes across a room full of spiders and gets by one and soon realizes that he shares the traits of a spider. After learning some interesting stuff about Dr. Connors and his father, he has to balance several things: his high school crush Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), staying away from the police captain (Denis Leary), and stopping Dr. Connors.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield's performance of Peter Parker and Spider-Man was phenomenal. He had the perfect combination of shyness, awkwardness, and humor. When the scene was supposed to be emotional, he was emotional; when it called for humor, he was funny. Each scene he owned from beginning to the end. Emma Stone was fantastic as Gwen Stacy and Rhys Ifans was a great villain. And the rest of the supporting cast was solid as well. The thing that impressed me the most was the use of the web sling. He not only used it to swing, but to trip the enemies, use as a bungee cord, and shoot enemies with. The CGI was great; I liked the first person view shots of Spider-Man when he was swinging or running. The 3D was really good too; it didn't hurt my eyes or get me dizzy at all. It was perfect. The pace was good, it got you hooked early and never it never let go.<br/><br/>I loved the movie. I loved the Avengers, but I liked the feel of this movie. I enjoyed Garfield's take on Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Everything was great. If there is one problem I had it was that Peter and Gwen's relationship was rushed and we could have gotten and few more scenes of them building the relationship. I highly recommend this movie seeing this movie. Anyone can enjoy this film.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 stars.<br/><br/>bkstaReviews.blogspot.com"

","This, ladies and gentlemen, is how you reboot a franchise within a decade of the original and still make loads of money. There was no particular reason to fire Tobey Maguire and Co. for a new Spidey flick (except that you'd have had to show him with little Spidey-babies next), but boy how supremely pleased we are that it turned out so. The Amazing Spiderman is not necessarily a better movie than its predecessors, but it's bolder, wackier and hell, cooler. You feel a kind of energy that had been on the wane ever since Doctor Octopus had met his doom. <br/><br/>Andrew Garfield is Peter Parker Ver#2, who looks like he could devour the Tobey Maguire-Parker, the shy, nerdy awkward guy with major self- esteem issues, and spit him out. The upgraded Parker is an aggressive being, extrovert, rebellious and sure of himself. He is back to being sixteen here, a regular high school kid with skateboarding skills and an antennae out for the opposite sex. Particularly for one Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), who shares his love for science and breaking rules. Of course, Parker has unresolved parent-issues too, like Batman, and Superman, and Iron-man, and Thor, and Bruce Banner, and Wolverine One fine day, Mary and Richard Parker (Embeth Davidtz and Campbell Scott) pack up their stuff and leave little Peter in the hands of Uncle Ben and Aunt May (""Someday, you'll understand""). Right. So anyway Little Parker grows into Garfield, stumbles upon his father's old suitcase containing some Beautiful Mind-sort of equations, and begins to investigate. You know the deal, he gets bitten by a genetically engineered spider, and pretty soon he's beating up random people in a subway train, scaling walls and leaping and bungee-jumping in tights. His investigation into his parents' disappearance puts him on a head-on collision course with his father's former research partner Dr. Curtis Connors (Rhys Ifans), a scientist who seems to carry with him an unhealthy amount of secrets. This guy is one-armed and injects himself with some green-liquid (always a bad idea) thinking it'd sprout back the missing arm. It does, and as a bonus, also gives him a tail, fangs, and for all purposes transforms him into Godzilla's intelligent midget-cousin.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Spiderman swinging around is generating videos on YouTube, and Captain Stacy (Dennis Leary) of the New York Police Department is not happy about it. He deploys ""five-hundred"" police officers on Spidey's tail. Guess there had been nothing much for the NYPD to do since Bin Laden died and all. But, what's this? Captain Stacy is Gwen Stacy'sI'll leave out that part. Miss Stacy, of course has by then fallen head over heels in love with Parker for no apparent reason, and the two spend a significant portion of the movie breathing down each other's necks. No upside down smooch-storm in this case though, guess Tobey scores one over Garfield there. <br/><br/>Dr. Connors thinks he'll be awarded the Nobel Prize for Saving Humanity if he upgrades us all into giant lizards. Spidey finds his lair, and deduces what the Good Doctor/Hyperventilating Lizard is up to and races to stop him. <br/><br/>All well and good. Garfield (The Social Network) is the heart and soul of the movie, and gives us a cocksure hero who has no qualms about showing off his superhuman powers in college or venting his anger at the soft-spoken Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen). Nevertheless, his interpretation of Peter Parker is likable and stuffs in enough emotion to make us root for him. Stone has Stacy doing a bit of running around herself even as she plays the damsel-in-distress. The supporting cast comprising of heavyweights Sheen, Leary, Sally Field and Irrfan Khan do a neat job weighing up the story. <br/><br/>The Lizard, well, he is big, mean and has anger-issues, yes, but he doesn't make an entirely menacing villain. Most importantly, his motivations to do all that bad stuff he's doing is not convincing. The movie is not without other flaws too. One-of-the-best-scientific-minds- in-the-city walks calmly into a sealed room that he'd seen a man come out of wearing bio-hazard suit just moments ago. The Oscorp Industries' skyscraper has kindergarten-level security in place that any teenager can break into and walk out with his hands full. Obese crane-operators can operate heavy machinery in a section of the city that has been evacuated by what seems to be the SWAT team. And the movie contradicts itself several times on the issue of 'spider-sense'.<br/><br/>However, I am impressed. The movie looks good, and feels good. The casting is spot-on, and the chemistry between Garfield and Stone is nothing sort of nuclear. Peter's motivation to take up the red-and-blue suit is better explained. He is not a man without flaws of his own, and makes mistakes, inventing Spider-man as he goes along. <br/><br/>Mark Webb (500 Days of Summer) makes sure the movie does not take itself too seriously, and therein lies his success. Like Joss Whedon before him, he wisely stays away from too much realism. It's a good ol' fashioned battle of Good vs. Inexplicably Evil, with just the right dose of humor and teen-romance. <br/><br/>Bottomline: Go see it, if only to satiate your tingling spider-sense. P.S : ListenWhat is it that I hear? A talk of Spidey joining the Avengers?<br/><br/>For more reviews, visit noahjamesatmovies.wordpress.com"

","The Amazing Spider-Man is a very great movie! For me, it is better than the first Spider-Man.<br/><br/>The movie was a roller coaster ride! It will make you laugh, cry, be in love, and be thrilled. I like this more than the first maybe because I like Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker and Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy. It is an all-in-one movie,full packaged! The costume of Spider-Man looks cool and made by Peter Parker himself. This movie is really intense and touching to the heart. For the people who cry easily, watch out.<br/><br/>All in all, The Amazing Spider-Man is great! Love it! I'll give it a score of 9 because it's still the first and the second can be more amazing, and the next one other it would be the most amazing!"
"haneaux","1","7","23","20 November 2012"," Unbelievably awful.
","My mom and I both knew going into this movie that it was going to be terrible, but neither of us realized just how terrible it was going to be. Thank god we watched it at home so we could openly criticize and scoff at every stupid aspect of it. Off the top of my head:<br/><br/><ul><li>Peter. What the hell happened? He is a cocky hipster little jerk who skateboards and reveals himself as Spider-Man at the drop of a hat. I loved Tobey, I rooted for him, I cared for him, I wanted him to succeed. But I just wanted to punch Andrew in his stupid face every time he was on screen. And I actually like Andrew Garfield! But he is NOT Peter Parker. They butchered his character and it is an outright disgrace. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Everything feels completely forced and contrived and like it is trying way too hard to be ""young"" and ""edgy"" and ""cool."" The number of times I rolled my eyes, shook my head in disbelief, or simply uttered sounds of disgust...The whole thing is ridiculous. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>It is almost entirely unwatchable. I could re-watch the first two Spider-Mans forever, because they are entertaining, nicely-paced, well-casted, and interesting. But I would never in a million years re-watch this movie ever again. I could hardly sit through it the first time. There is absolutely NO charm, humor, wit, or any warmth whatsoever. I couldn't care less for any of the characters. Not a single one. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>In the original, Spider-Man (understandably) becomes famous and a well-known part of New York. You really got a sense that he was part of the community and people knew who he was. I loved all the press about him (plus, J. Jonah Jameson!) and the people interviewed. In this one, it's like no one even knows who he is. The man at the end sees an injured Spider-Man crawling up a building on TV and he's like ""Hey, that's the guy who saved my son on the bridge!"" Like he's just a completely unknown entity. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The pacing was horrific. It was so boring yet there was way too much going on at the same time. It switched focus and motives and you never really seemed to get any sense of what was going on and why. Who are these characters and why the hell are they doing what they're doing? And why should we possibly care? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Put simply, though the original movies are not perfect, I cannot stress enough how unbelievably superior they are to this atrocity. Every single scene and element of this movie was done so much better in the original: the character of Peter, his aunt and uncle, the love interest, getting bitten, discovering his powers, Ben's death, the villain, the action scenes, side characters, pacing, character development, musical score, etc. </li></ul><br/><br/>I actually had to watch the original Spider-Man directly afterward as a palate cleanser, or else I would just be angry all night that this was ever even made."

","I literally just came back from seeing this and suffice it to say I enjoyed it immensely.<br/><br/>OK, first of all, Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker is amazing. In my opinion he owns the role in the same way Robert Downey Jr. is Tony Stark and Christian Bale is Batman. And in terms of quality as far as reboots go this is up there with Batman Begins and Casino Royale.<br/><br/>The pacing is methodical, a considerable amount of time (about the first half of the movie) is spent on character building and introducing us to the relationships and the people in Peter Parker's life. If you can stomach origin stories, you will love it.<br/><br/>The story arc is bound to seem familiar but the focus of it is on Peter Parker, akin to Batman Begins for Bruce Wayne. It works wonderfully and makes for a much more emotional movie. Oh yes, if there is anything this particular Spidey has more than its predecessor, it's heart.<br/><br/>A must-see for comic book fans,<br/><br/>10/10"
"mailboxontheinternet","1","6","19","30 May 2013"," If films had a specific category for the mentally retarded, this film would be their delegate.
","This is easily one of the most horrendous experiences I've ever endured. I sat through this illustration of how bad acting can possibly get for more than an hour. It was excruciating. The pain was on par with having a giant cactus shoved in your recently prolapsed butt hole as a hammer smashes your ball sack while a series of glass tubes are repeatedly inserted into your weiner and destroyed only to have to pain slightly tranquilized by an injection of sea salt and lemon juice, accompanied with the shame of your mother watching you. In other words, it's not a good feeling whatsoever.There is a distinct absence of emotion within all the characters. You have to be either blind, deaf, or mentally deficient in every way imaginable to even try to enjoy this tragedy."
"jaredpahl","3","5","15","1 June 2016"," Sony and Marc Webb's Attempt to Recreate Perfection Swings and Misses.
","When dealing with comic book characters, you know studios can't let a good thing die. Sam Raimi's 2002 Spider-Man film is one of the greatest comic book adaptations ever made. Not only did it have groundbreaking special effects and action, but it had a perfect cast, a mature love story, and themes of growing up and becoming the man you will be for the rest of your life. It was a definitive take on the character. Yet, here we are with The Amazing Spider-Man. Just five years after Raimi finished his Spider-Man trilogy, this origin reboot was commissioned by Sony; and for what purpose? Marc Webb's Spider-Man brings nothing new to the table, instead opting to try its hand at its own version of Spider-Man's origin. You know what they say about trying to recreate perfection.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man is nothing more than a remake of Raimi's first movie. Sure, We get a half-baked romance between Peter and Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), and a fully uncooked subplot about Peter's dead parents, but those plot threads are window dressing at best. It's another origin. The difference? This one sucks. In an effort to appeal to the nerds who equate comic book faithfulness to quality, some details are tweaked. For instance, Spidey uses mechanical web shooters instead of Raimi's more dramatically potent natural version (which worked as a symbol for bodily changes during puberty), because the comics are always right, right? In the end, these superfluous changes mean nothing. This is the 2002 film, just way worse.<br/><br/>The villain this time is The Lizard, one of my favorite spidey rogues. It's nice that he's in the movie, but he's completely wasted. Rhys Ifans plays a boring British scientist, who might as well be a parody of boring British scientists. He brings nothing of the warmth that Dylan Baker brought to the role in what was basically an extended cameo over 2 films, and as a special effect, The Lizard is even worse. The design is ugly (Webb went for a lizard/human hybrid look that would be more at home in the tie-in video game than the actual film), and the CGI is rudimentary. By 2012, I thought I had seen the last of that herky-jerky 90s era computer animation. I was wrong.<br/><br/>The problem with all the revisited plot points is that every single one of them has been done infinitely better ten years prior. Compare any scene to Raimi's version, and it's unmistakable, one is a work of giddy passion and the other is a contract. Forget the clearly inferior compositions, set design, cinematography, and casting. At some point, you have to step back from all the little details and realize, this is barely even a film compared to the original. It feels like a TV pilot for a direct-to-Netflix Spider-Man show. How can a film with such a big budget end up so cheap?<br/><br/>There is a fundamental problem with The Amazing Spider-Man. The handling of Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker is all wrong. There is something non-negotiable about the character of Peter Parker, something essential to his personality. He has to be uncool. Tobey Maguire brought to the role a sweet, boyish naiveté. Garfield's version is a sulky male-model. He skateboards, talks to girls, and rejects authority. You can't make Peter Parker edgy and hip. It goes completely against what the character is all about. He can't be ""cool"". Andrew Garfield is way off the mark with his performance, and he is not alone. His counterpart, Emma Stone, is equally repulsive to me, but that might have more to do with my general disdain for Stone as an actress. She's too gruff and crude for my liking. Unfortunately, the movie lives and dies by your connection between these two characters. I found them grating to an extreme. They're nails on the chalkboard whenever they're on screen.<br/><br/>There is action in The Amazing Spider-Man, but even it is no saving grace for the film. Director Marc Webb, another example of certain studios' inexplicable pattern of hiring quirky indie directors to helm big-budget action blockbusters, is apparently lost when it comes to envisioning or generating any kind of exciting sequence. The set-pieces are lame. I've seen all the rooftop fights and high-tech labs a person can see. If you're going to hang your hat on these set-pieces, you need to be a special kind of filmmaker. Raimi is, Webb is not. He handles the camera with nothing of Raimi's slick confidence. His action is diverting, but it is devoid of any style, any dynamism, any life. To make matters worse, almost all the action in the film is set at night, and its all smothered in this murky, dim sheen. The muted, gray, ""realistic"" cinematography represents The Amazing Spider-Man's head-scratching desire to be gritty (a Hollywood word meaning devoid of color, style, or individual artistic license), and it does nothing but hurt the film.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man was made to ensure that Sony could keep the rights to Spider-Man and it shows. There's no shaking the feeling of cold studio contract fulfillment that infects the film. Marc Webb was hired to get the script on screen and nothing more. The final product checks all the boxes Sony thought pertinent to check, but collectively, it is useless. There is no individuality, no heart, no soul, nothing to The Amazing Spider-Man. It might look nice here or there, and some of the effects are impressive, but The Amazing Spider-Man is an empty experience. It's a forgettable origin story, rendered downright antagonizing by a pair of extremely unlikable leads. Sony and Marc Webb set out to re-envision Spider-Man for a new generation. Newsflash, perfection doesn't need re-envisioning. The Amazing Spider-Man is one big mistake. I hoped Sony and Marc Webb could at least take Spider-Man in a fun, new direction. What they did was a cobble together a disposable imitation of Sam Raimi's game-changing original.<br/><br/>33/100"
"adhipar","6","4","11","9 July 2012"," A teenage hero movie which more serious than all those ""grown up"" Avengers
","When you reboot a story, there must be some necessary stuff which should be included in the previous version but completely left out. So the reboot version should give better perspective about the hero or his story.<br/><br/>I'm not Spider-man comic fans but I watch all Sam Raimi's film including Spider-man. And I still feel that his version does not need any reboot.<br/><br/>The film itself is developing quite slow, it's like a Disney teenager movie when a teen slowly building his rapport throughout the film and become somebody but in very serious way. It's more about Peter Parker than Spider-man, which I think could be speed up since it's become boring in 2nd half due to its darker tone and very serious ambiance.<br/><br/>The film itself is quite decent but nothing extraordinary. And I still like the Sam Raimi's Spiderman because he seems more fun.<br/><br/>6/10"
"IllusionOfLife","4","4","11","4 July 2012"," Avoid This Film Like the Plague
","In 2002 Sam Raimi and Columbia Pictures made a movie like no one had ever seen before. Raimi's Spider-Man, at least in my opinion, was really the first super hero movie since Superman: The Movie to fully embrace and understand its source material. It perfectly captured both the joy of being Spider-Man and the tragedy of being Peter Parker; the gift and curse nature of that spider bite. In 2004 they topped the first film to make what I still consider to be one of the greatest super hero movies of all time. Spider-Man 3 had some serious missteps due in no small part to meddling by Sony, but there were still momentary glimmers of what made the first two films great.<br/><br/>When Disney acquired Marvel in 2009 and Sony wanted another Spider-Man movie in order to hold onto the rights to the character, they initially went to Raimi, however the same kind of studio meddling that hampered Spider-Man 3 was back for the proposed Spider-Man 4, and unwilling to put up with it again Raimi walked away. In the wake of Spider-Man 4 collapsing Sony announced plans to reboot the series, a desperate attempt to prevent the rights from reverting back to Marvel. They hired a younger, cheaper cast and a younger, cheaper director to head up the reboot. So here we are with the result of all these shenanigans.<br/><br/>How is the movie? Exactly as bad as you'd expect it to be given its troubled history. It's joyless, heartless, nonsensical, completely devoid of character or personality, and grossly betrays the very identity of its titular hero. Imagine you took the characters from Twilight, the tone from Batman Begins (without any of the compelling characters or interesting narrative), nonsensical plot threads from the Star Wars Prequels, threw it all in a blender and pushed purée and you can start to get an idea of what this movie is like. This is an origin story where almost nothing of consequence happens and every character in the film ends in exactly the same place they began. There's no character development, there's no compelling narrative, it's just a jumble of forgettable set pieces, empty dialogue, and a love story that is so unrelated to the rest of the film that it has no reason to exist. It's a shame because honestly the love story is the only thing in the movie that even kind of works which I imagine is because Marc Webb was the director of (500) Days of Summer.<br/><br/>The fact that this is a boring, forgettable film wouldn't be so terrible by itself, but it also feels the need to betray the very foundation of who Spider-Man is. I'm not sure if this was an ill- advised attempt to differentiate itself from the other films/comics or if the people involved just really don't understand Spider-Man (possibly a bit of both), but either way, this element is what tips the scale into the territory of truly awful. I usually try to avoid spoilers, but I can't get into why this movie is so bad without giving a few things away, so be warned, this next paragraph contains minor spoilers.<br/><br/>So there's this brand new, completely ham-fisted idea that Peter Parker's parents were involved in some crazy corporate conspiracy and that Peter's dad was friends/partners with Curt Connors (The Lizard). Their research is actually what creates Spider-Man in this film which completely robs the character of the important element of being a regular kid who happened to get these extraordinary powers due to a freak accident. Now Spider-Man is some pre-destined product of a conspiracy. On top of that, they completely throw out the whole ""with great power comes great responsibility"" lesson that is the entire point of who Spider-Man is! Seriously! This is as bad as doing a Batman story where the Waynes were killed in a freak industrial accident rather than gunned down in cold blood! It betrays the legacy of the character and completely ruins his whole purpose of being.<br/><br/>On top of completely betraying the character of Peter Parker/Spider-Man, the film also has no idea what to do with any of the other characters. Curt Connors is a nice guy who suddenly does a heel-face turn and becomes a megalomaniacal lunatic bent on world domination for absolutely no logical reason, Police Captain Stacey hates Spider-Man for no real reason other than the fact that they needed people to hate Spider-Man and didn't even want to attempt to recast J. Jonah Jameson (which is actually one of the only smart decisions they made in this film), and Ben Parker never connects on any meaningful level with Peter. The only person who is halfway decent is Emma Stone as Gwen Stacey, but they still can't manage to give her any kind of meaningful character development other than Peter Parker's smart/sassy girlfriend.<br/><br/>It's obvious that Sony wanted to try to capitalize on the success of Nolan's Batman films by making this ""dark and gritty"" but in the end, all they did was superficially suck all of the joy out of the story without having any kind of mature, contemplative, or emotionally resonant themes to make it worthwhile. Raimi's Spider-Man films were far more mature and emotionally resonant than this and they never sacrificed their sense of fun in order to achieve that. The characters were compelling, the relationships had weight, the story was exciting, and the whole experience was just fun. The Amazing Spider-Man, on the other hand has none of that, it's just a hollow film with hollow characters and a hollow story that has superficial trappings of ""dark and gritty"" draped over the top. This is a film that had no reason to be made and you as an audience member have no reason to see it. Avoid this one like the plague.<br/><br/>F"

","I have seen this movie and came away disappointed yet happy that Raimi's work is there for re-watch – which I did after TASM. The difference is night and day. Raimi's work stands the test of time.<br/><br/>I didn't support a remake in the first place simply because it's too soon and the whole exercise smelled of money grabbing. But after the second trailer I changed my opinion and thought, TASM could be a good movie – I was wrong.<br/><br/>Initially I thought Garfield would make a good Spidey, and felt that Tobey was too downbeat as Parker. I was wrong. They both played their characters well – the best version would be a combo of both. Tobey played nerd well. Garfield plays Spidey as a smart alec. Though Tobey showed some glimpses of that as well. Go re-watch the first two of Raimi's films and you'll know what I mean.<br/><br/>Now for the review – C<br/><br/>The film struggles to stay average.<br/><br/>The plot is quite weak and the pacing is slow. You'd expect the pacing to pick up after the initial half of the film after Parker gets bitten etc. but it never really hits a high comparable to Raimi's works – all three of em.<br/><br/>Just to get it out of the way, comparisons between Raimi's trilogy and this are inevitable and you will do so yourself once you start watching.<br/><br/>The action is not special and the transformation of Parker to Spidey is hum-drum. The musical score was a detriment to this film. James Horner did a real disservice to this film with his heroic score but failed to account for the youthfulness of his characters.<br/><br/>The saving grace to an extent is the relationship between Parker and Gwen, ahem I mean between Garfield and Emma. You can see they really like each othera lot!<br/><br/>The whole subplot about his parents, scientific work is so thin it's almost laughable if it wasn't for Rhys Ifans Lizard who lends an element of credible menace. But it's resolved too readily at the climax.<br/><br/>The mid credit scene was poorly executed. It gives no real anticipation of what's coming next. Webb is clueless in how to do so. Overall the film barely makes it in my opinion. It pales to the more recent Marvel films (though this is by Sony) and is no where near The Avengers or Dark Knight as others would have you believe.<br/><br/>Raimi's work was truer to the comics genesis plot. Webb's work majored on the minor – Gwen instead of Mary Jane, web shooters instead of organic web. It lost the soul Spidey's beginnings and weaved in the missing parents 'plot' simply to differentiate and little else. Even this is unresolved and is not very interesting to begin with.<br/><br/>Sorry Spidey fans. This is not a good movie to re-watch again and again."
"andrewjsutton","5","4","11","2 July 2012"," Too soon for a remake
","Just 10 years after the 2002 'Spiderman' movie was made, I was originally baffled as to why this movie would be - not Spiderman 4 - but instead a remake. Was there something lacking in the original movie I wasn't aware of? Was it not true to the original comic book story? Or was this just an easy cash-in job for Hollywood?<br/><br/>The verdict: easy money for Hollywood producers. There was almost nothing original about this movie. The storyline is almost identical, and whilst you are, strictly speaking, about to read so-called SPOILERS, I assure you if you have seen the 2002 film, there's nothing new here. Peter is being picked on at high school by the jock; he fancies a girl there; his uncle is shot by a bandit Peter previously decided not to stop; he gets bitten by a spider which gives him superpowers; etc. Even the bad guy has a connection to one of his friends (it's his girlfriend's mentor). The pacing / sequence of the movie is almost to the minute predictable: initial confrontation with bad guy, one more encounter in the sewer leaves our hero scarred, then a final battle atop a skyscraper. Yeah, been there, done that. Not impressed, sorry.<br/><br/>One of the major selling points to this movie, no doubt, will be the amazing special effects. Admittedly, i did not see this movie in 3D, but I honestly couldn't notice much improvement since the original. The camera work during his swing-across-the-city scenes were all very impressive, just like the previous movies.<br/><br/>It seems the current obsession in movie-making is the superhero theme.

Some parts even feels similar to the way to Batman Begins, but could have been better but great nonetheless. <br/><br/>Very good and personal plot, good acting by the cast, Andrew Garfield was amazing, no over exaggeration in the movies you see these days and basic stunts and action sequences done very well then throwing in hopeless complex sequences just to make it look good.<br/><br/>More of a ""teen-flick"" as this is the first movie I've seen where the girl is beautiful yet clothed all the time and dry and the guy is stripped at a point :P (which makes it enjoyable for females and probably a good movie date?) but not to be mistaken as some action- romantic film as some of the trailers might suggest, this is actually a very good super hero movie, having good moments and having a good balance between comic, dark and realistic.<br/><br/>I'd give this a vote above The Avengers on this years best movies.

","I'm not a Sam Raimi fanboy or elitist. I liked Raimi's original trilogy but it's not perfect. And Spider-Man 3 was OK. But I really wanted to like this movie, but I didn't. I have my limits when it comes to dark versions of classic characters and this movie just passes through them. For Spider-Man, this is way too dark. There is some light-hearted stuff here, but I just can't enjoy this movie with how dark it gets. If it was like Spider-Man 2 then maybe I could enjoy it a lot more because Spider-Man 2 along with Avengers: Infinity War manage to put Spider-Man in a dark setting whilst still making it enjoyable and fun to watch with some great drama. This movie just tries too hard with blood, a grim and dark setting, hell, the POSTER for this movie pretty much summarises why I dislike it so much. Other than the unneeded edgyness, the soundtrack was fine, the cast is OK (but Andrew Garfield does not fit Peter Parker at all), and the action is decent enough. But this movie just gives off such a weird and depressing vibe when it's a movie about one of the most light-hearted, fun and cheesy comic book characters of all time. It may be a technically fine movie, but I just can't enjoy it with how much they try and make Spider-Man edgy and dark."

","Approximately 5 years since the making of the third and final Tobey Maguire ""Spider-man"" film, Andrew Garfield is the next actor to hit the stage, with a new story, villain, and lover.<br/><br/>After a school excursion, Peter Parker is bitten by a radioactive spider, giving him superpowers similar to those of a spider (including amazing instincts, super strength and the ability to climb up walls). After receiving this power, he attempts to use it to his advantage, but after the death of a close relative, he undergoes a period where he seeks vengeance, before progressing to a goal to protect others.<br/><br/>Easily the best ""Spider-man"" film since 2002, the first of the Tobey Maguire legacy, the film features an amazing line-up of actors with Andrew Garfield playing Spider-man/Peter Parker and Emma Stone playing Gwen Stacy, Peter Parker's love interest. The two perform spectacularly together, with an obvious attraction between both actors and characters. The CGI for The Lizard (Rhys Ifan - the antagonist of the film) is also extremely well done, making him seem all the more realistic. The return of ""Spider-man"" is definitely not to be missed."

The times the movie works directly correlates to when Stone and Garfield are sharing the screen, or when he's fully suited."
"mjplysaght","4","2","4","10 July 2017"," The untold story? Yeah, right
","So after the mixed reviews of Spider-Man 3 and the aborted plans for Spider-Man 4, Sony decided to reboot the franchise with a new cast, new director and a 'new' story thread.<br/><br/>Peter Parker is now played by Andrew Garfield, who is a decent actor but his portrayal as Spider-Man is kinda questionable. Once again, he is too old to pull off the illusion that he's still in high school. Also, the classic archetype of Peter Parker pre-spider bite is that he's a reclusive nerdy brainbox. This iteration of Parker takes a different turn, as Garfield plays the part as a hipster wannabe who is already handsome and charismatic.<br/><br/>His love interest is Gwen Stacy, played by Emma Stone. Their chemistry is perfect together but Gwen's input to the plot is fairly minimal, other than her father being the Chief of Police, played by Denis Leary. Gwen finds out that Parker is Spider-Man and tries to keep the fact hidden from her father, who is out to foil him for vigilantism.<br/><br/>So the promotional marketing tried to pass off this movie as the 'untold story' of Spider-Man, which turns out to be a complete lie as the origin story of Spider-Man is rehashed with the only different being a loose thread as to how Parker's parents passed away.<br/><br/>Uncle Ben is now played by Martin Sheen who *spoiler alert* dies. Big shock. Parker tries to track down and confront his uncle's killer. Or at least 10-20 minutes of the film focus on his efforts to find the killer, but then that subplot is completely aborted and never referenced again. Instead, we get thrown into a hastily thrown together villain story about Curt Connors/The Lizard, a work partner of Parker's dad, played by Rhys Ifans.<br/><br/>The motivation of the Lizard is an unfocused mess. An Oscorp professor with only one arm, specializing in cross species genetics, he gets his hands on an incomplete algorithm from Parker, based off his father's research, in which he tries to use lizard DNA to regenerate his lost limb. Things go horribly wrong when he mutates into the Lizard and then all of a sudden, he goes on a mad rampage attempting to infect the city of New York with the airborne lizard gas and turn everyone into lizard creatures.<br/><br/>I gave this film a pass when I first saw it, thinking nothing of it, but in retrospect, it's kind of a mess. Parker's rarely likable, we've seen the 'story' before and there's hardly anything memorable. The only thing I bought into was the chemistry between Garfield and Stone. Other than that, this film is a solid 'meh' for the entirety."
"wiholke2020","8","2","4","8 July 2017"," The Amazing Spider-Man in my opinion is an underrated reboot.
","The Amazing Spider-Man is directed by Marc Webb and stars Andrew Garfield as the web slinger himself and Emma Stone as his crush, Gwen Stacy, and Rhys Ifans as doctor Curtis Connors/The Lizard. This movie, like the previous Spider-Man films, was very hyped and anticipated for. The reactions were very split for this movie. Some people hated this movie, some people loved this movie. I certainly don't hate this movie but I don't quite love this movie either. I like it a lot. I love some scenes, but there are a couple flaws preventing this film from being great rather than being just good.<br/><br/>The movie begins with Peter as a young boy and already this film score is not as good as Danny Elfman's score for Raimi's trilogy. James Horner, however, did do a very nice job, just not quite as well as Elfman's. I like this scene with Peter as a boy. It explores ground that wasn't discussed much in Raimi's trilogy. Other than that, most of this movie retreads the first Spider- Man. I honestly don't have a problem with that. Force Awakens did a similar thing but they did it well. So did this movie.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield is a very good Spider- Man in this movie, but not as much of a Peter Parker. He's kind of a punk, he rides his skateboard in school, and, of course, he sounds like a 27 year old. And that's because Andrew Garfield was 27 when casted for this movie. However, I love his chemistry with Gwen Stacy. The reason it was so good was because Andrew and Emma were dating in real life. And some people really hate seeing Uncle Ben die again, but I honestly don't mind it because technically speaking, it's one of the best scenes in the movie. Great performances, lighting, set pieces and music. <br/><br/>Let's talk about Spider-Man. I love the action scenes. His action style is awesome. The special effects are great. It's cool to see a smart Spider-Man. What I don't like as much was his suit. It looks very basket ball like and his eye pieces look like sunglasses. That's because that's exactly what his eyepieces are and his costume design just seemed lazy in my opinion. <br/><br/>The Lizard in this movie was ultimately wasted. He starts out like he can be this really cool villain but his evil plot ended up being sort of disappointing and ultimately absurd. It was kind of distracting. I liked the action scenes with him, but his visual design also could've been better. His comic design looked better than the design we actually got. <br/><br/>Speaking of the action scenes, while being good, it takes over half the movie to even get to one action sequence either the Lizard. It's kind of sad actually. We have a lot of build up to Peter and Spider-Man and the Lizard. The good thing is the build up is good but they needed to get to the point faster. The first Spider-Man had his first fight with Green Goblin in the second act. In this movie, Spider-Man and the Lizard don't have an action sequence until the beginning of the third act. It takes awhile to get to the point. That's the only problem. I like the scenes leading up to the epic action scenes, but it was just too long for my liking.<br/><br/>I certainly don't hate this movie I like a lot of the scenes and love some of them too. In my opinion, it isn't as good as the first two Raimi Spider- Man movies, but certainly better than Spider-Man 3."

The plot makes it till the half in a very clumsy manner and then it just ends. Andrew is an amazing actor but he is just not fit for the role of Peter Parker.

"ihatemarcwebb","3","2","4","16 September 2014"," Ouch! What a mess!
","Going into this film, I had no expectations. I set the bar at about the same level as the first Fantastic Four movie, and sadly, it didn't even manage to reach those. Just about everything except for the visuals and the acting in this film is done incorrectly. <br/><br/>Where do I begin? I might as well start with the writing, which happens to be this film's biggest sin. First of all, it's all over the place. Way too many plot points are introduced into the film, which play no part in the general story, and make the movie very boring. The most glaring example of this is the back story of Peter's parents. I already know what all of you are going to say. The back story is important because: A) It wasn't in the Raimi films, and it gives the film its own identity, and B) Knowing what happens to his parents is important because his father's research leads Peter to investigate Oscorp, which allows him to meet Dr. Connors. To explain my original point, let me shoot both of those pathetic excuses down. When making a good movie, the Raimi films should be completely unimportant. If a movie is good, it's good, and audiences will still appreciate it (except for the rabid fan boys of the comics who only care about following the books perfectly), and not care if the film so happens to borrow or utilize plot points from similar films. That's why it's a shame that this movie felt the need to advertise itself as the ""Untold Story"" because as long as it's not a direct shot-for-shot remake (like the Psycho remake), and is entertaining, it can still be enjoyed as its own separate thing. You don't need to be too concerned with creating a separate identity. It also adds too many layers to the story. All that garbage with Dr. Connors could've been dumbed down to Peter following Gwen to Oscorp, sneaking into the internship, and ending up meeting Dr. Connors, while gaining his powers. That still keeps the same principles and ideas of the story, while cutting out 15 minutes from the film's total runtime. Doesn't that sort of make sense? Second of all, the characters have no motivations whatsoever. For Peter, he takes his uncle's message about using his powers to good use, which is fine. But after Ben dies, due to his son's stupidity nonetheless, the film decides not to use a perfect setup that would allow Peter to reconsider what he wanted to do with his life, and cause him to feel the need to change as a person. That would've allowed Peter to be more well rounded as a character and perhaps connect to the audience a touch more. But nope! He can be a perfect Spider-Man just by being himself, which is infuriating, and causes him to be extremely unlikable and disgustingly arrogant. He doesn't even have to try! For Dr. Connors, he injects himself with the self-healing serum because he desperately wants to grow his own arm back, and perhaps win a Nobel Prize while doing it. That's fine. But it is never explained clearly why he ends up going on a rampage across New York City. I guess the drugs made him go insane(?), but it would've been much nicer, and more reassuring to have that be clarified. Finally, and most importantly, this movie was unable to get me to care about any of the characters in the movie, except for Aunt May. Peter, horribly miscast as Garfield, by no means sold me as being unpopular in the slightest (I'll get to that later), which instantly took me out of the movie. My brain kept hurting trying to comprehend why this kid would get picked on. Also, like I said earlier, he never felt the need to change as a person after the death of his uncle, which to me was just insulting. Uncle Ben was the biggest jerk in the entire movie. He was a cold, angry, and heartless human being, constantly reprimanding his son for not walking his aunt back home 8 blocks, without realizing how much his son's life sucked. If I knew someone who lived a sad and miserable existence, I'd do my best not to yell at them because it's not what they need. I was happy he died, but still was unsure why he tried to reach for the gun of a man who just robbed a liquor store. For Connors, me not caring was a case of him being underdeveloped. I felt that his story of not having a hand would be powerful enough if it got more screen time. Maybe he could've been fit into the 15 minutes that should've been cut with Peter's parents.<br/><br/>Now that that's done, it's time to move on to acting. I felt that the cast turned in pedestrian showings at best. Sally Field was great as Aunt May, and was the only person that seemed to truly try. Martin Sheen was way to preachy in his portrayal of Uncle Ben, as it felt like he was giving a sermon more than being a good father figure to Peter. Stone and Garfield are fine, and have good chemistry. Rhys Ifans was alright as Connors, but never brought much much true emotion into the role. Denis Leary as Captain Stacy was very one-note; his performance could've used more heart.<br/><br/>Having a huge budget, the technical elements such as sound, lighting, and visuals are where I'd expect them to be. I did think the CG looked a tad fake at times, and could've used the presence of actual actors at several points, but I was overall satisfied with the technical elements.<br/><br/>Final thoughts: I know that this film is enjoyed by a lot of people, so I am unable to fully say that I can't recommend it. However, there is no denying that this film could've been much, much better."

","Sam Raimi's Spider Man trilogy began in 2002 and a decade later we have the reboot with Andrew Garfield's more geeky hipster take replacing Tobey Maguire.<br/><br/>However the film feels pointless, we have another origins story with Peter Parker getting bit by a radioactive spider and learns to harness his new powers and then the tragedy of Uncle Ben dying and realising that with his powers comes responsibility.<br/><br/>The villain here is a Green Lizard instead of the Green goblin, a man wanting to regrow his arm but the experiment goes horribly wrong. The police pursue Spider Man as they believe he is a menace and Parker has a touching and believable relationship with Gwen Stacy whose father is the policeman pursuing Spidey.<br/><br/>The film is well made, slightly darker hued after the rebooted Dark Knight films, a good mix of action special effects and humour although the CGI lizard could had been better but the film feels empty despite the efforts of Andrew Garfield. A soulless film made solely so Columbia Pictures can retain the rights to make Spider Man films."
"cheyennesmith-762-532623","3","2","4","9 August 2014"," This movie sucked .
","This unnecessary reboot is far from amazing. As a Spider-man fan this movie was really a disappointment to me. I grew up reading the Amazing Spider-man and Ultimate Spider-man comics, and I got to say that the movie really lacked similarities between the two.(Especially the Amazing comics)The origin was crap, and inaccurate to any of the comic versions. Captain Stacy didn't think Spider-man was a criminal. He was a strong supporter of Spider-man. Dr Conner's wasn't a British scientist that works at Oscorp. He didn't have any help from Peter's parents, or from Peter while making the lizard serum. Gwen Stacy wasn't Peter's first girlfriend. Betty Brant was his first girlfriend in the original comics.( If you don't believe me read Amazing Spider-man # 142) Mary Jane was his first girlfriend in the Ultimate comics. Peter didn't let the robber get away because the cashier wouldn't sell him a bottle of chocolate milk and he didn't sneak out every night trying to find Uncle Ben's killer, and later forgets about it.<br/><br/>I didn't like Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker/Spider-man. As Peter, he's just a hipster kid who doesn't brush his hair and rides around on the skateboard. I wasn't convinced that Peter is a smart, science nerd in this movie. The crappy web shooters didn't really help either. When Peter sneaks into Oscorp to find Dr. Conner's, he looks around acting like he's never been in there before, he obviously didn't know about the tour, but went along with it anyway, and has a surprised look on his face when he see's Gwen guiding the tour. Like he didn't know that she was working there. You think a kid who was really smart and really into science like we're made to believe Peter is; He would have know and actually be in that tour just to see the labs of Oscorp, or he would have his own job at Oscorp like Gwen Stacy did, but he didn't. As Spider-man: He constantly takes his mask off and walks around with it off. Not only is it out of character for him to walk around with his mask off, but also makes him look like he lacks common sense. If I was starting out as a masked vigilante I would know NOT to take my mask off in public. Because of the risk someone would see me. He did fine with the sense of humor part, and that was about it. The suit was crap. It looked like it was made out the same material used to make basket balls. The design was ugly and too complicated. I get the idea that's supposed to look like a homemade suit, but why did they make the design look so complicated? The forearm part of the gloves are red and the hand part is blue with red on the fingers. If it's supposed to be Peter's first suit, why didn't they make it look simple like the original design in the comics?<br/><br/>The film had a couple of plot holes in the story. For example: Why was Captain Stacy much more determined to stop Spider-man while there's a 9 foot lizard rampaging through the streets of New York? Why was Spider-man swinging from crane to crane despite the fact that he's surrounded by tall buildings? The lizard's plan didn't really make much sense either. Basically, his plan is to use a lizard serum that he made and use it to turn all the people in New York into lizards. Throughout the movie, Dr. Conner's repeatedly injects himself with the serum, and temporarily turns into the lizard. Apparently, the serum doesn't last very long. If the serums effects doesn't last on him, what makes him think that it's gonna permanently turn all the people into lizards? The movie also had a couple of dumb scenes, like the basket ball scene. And the one where Peter skateboards in a warehouse and starts swinging around on some chains hanging from the rafters.<br/><br/>I didn't really care about the romance. Peter and Gwen look cute together. But, they completely rushed through the chemistry. They briefly talk to each other a few times, and Gwen invites Peter to dinner, and just like that he tells her that he's Spider-man and they start making out. When they did talked Gwen did most of the talking and Peter just mumbles to himself.<br/><br/>The CGI was good, except for the lizard. The lizard looked cheap and unfinished.<br/><br/>I have more problems with this movie. But, I believe you get the idea. The Amazing Spider-man is far from amazing and far from good."

","The AMAZING Spider-Man? well not quite. With the Raimi franchise finished only five years ago in 2007 did we need a reboot of this super hero? in my opinion no we didn't and this film hasn't really changed my mind.<br/><br/>One can't deny the impressive new visuals and ideas for this new feature, Spider-Man does look good with new state of the art CGI effects and Spidey POV as he streaks across the night sky. The suit is pretty much the same albeit for some minor cosmetic differences, but Spider- Man's new moves during fights and skyscraper swinging are much more elaborate sexier and closer to the classic motions we all know and love from the comics and those top notch Capcom 2D fighters even!<br/><br/>That said I still see no point in this film other than to show off what I just pointed out. Yes Spider-Man looks much slicker as he should five years after the last film but other than that there is nothing new here. I might add its only Spider-Man that looks good in this film, Lizard looks pretty ropy if you ask me. Close ups of his face and eyes especially are pretty nice but when the action kicks in he looks like a dodgy Godzilla with a weird facial design. Obviously trying to look somewhat like the actor Ifans but it doesn't work too well.<br/><br/>The plot for Lizard is also kinda loose too really. He wants to turn everyone into lizards hmmm. Wouldn't that kinda make him no longer special? if everyone was the same as him he wouldn't be the strongest being around anymore, more importantly...why do this? On another note, again I realise this is a comicbook adaptation but isn't this plot like something out of a kids Saturday morning cartoon? to be more precise...a TMNT cartoon.<br/><br/>A lot of the film is so darn stupid also, OK its a comicbook adaptation but it just seems they have tried too hard, plus trying to squeeze too much into the one film. The origins segments seem to fly past and before you know it he's Spider-Man and everyone is calling him that! There isn't much exploration of his suit creation, he just makes it...just like that! and things happen that are just too daft to make any sense. <br/><br/>Parker's first use of his spider powers on the subway home is one example. some guy does something completely pointless whilst Parker sleeps (balances a beer bottle on his forehead?? duh?). He awakes startled and leaps onto the carriage roof, sticking there, he jumps down and accidentally rips off a woman's top with his sticky fingers. Straight away some guys completely forget about the amazing feet they just saw and try to beat him up...as you would do of course.<br/><br/>Then of course there is all the obligatory high school fluff where Parker does things slightly out of the ordinary yet no one ever seems to question it. Yes I know its all part of the comicbook lore and gives the film some funny moments but my god its so clichéd and ridiculous.<br/><br/>Personally I see nothing here that beats the Raimi franchise by any great lengths. Naturally the effects are much better but cast wise I actually prefer Maguire (although Dunst was terrible). Garfield was quite annoying, I found, and didn't have any of the emotion. Probably down to the fact Maguire is a good actor and Garfield is not...whoever he is.<br/><br/>I just feel this is all so ridiculous, they could do this every other year, just remake the same film with a pretty new cast and sparkly new effects, slap some gloss on the top and voila! yet another brand new origins remake. The thing is everyone will rush to see it too! (yes I see the irony in myself having seen it but I have a good reason for this...I'm a hypocrite). Its the same as before in a shiny new wrapper people! Hollywood must be rubbing their hands with glee.<br/><br/>With the amount of super hero films made and being made there really is no need for remakes/reboots of franchises that aren't very old. There are plenty of really good super hero characters out there Hollywood, lets see some of them get an adaptation, stop churning out the same spiel over and over.<br/><br/>Purely by the numbers cookie cutter film making in every sense and offers nothing new. There are some nice fight sequences between Spidey and Lizard yes but that's it, I get the impression that's the only reason they made this, to show off cool fights between cool comicbook characters. Cast aside the only differences are the change in villain and the visuals are prettier, everything else is as you would expect so where's the fun?<br/><br/>5/10"

In the previous Spider-Man series you had strong themes and motifs and a sense of realism in Peter Parker's life to make the story strong. In The new 'Amazing Spider-Man' series you have childish dialog and not a single strong theme to help make the film powerful. The visuals are even bad!

","This is a great movie that tells a more modernized, less strung out, version of the Spiderman story with a few twists from the original comic books. <br/><br/>I think they did an awesome job at making the Peter Parker character more ""real"" while giving him that more sarcastic feel that you may have remembered from the comic books. Being traumatized by the awful Spiderman movies that came out in the early to mid 2000s, I was almost afraid to watch this movie in fear of what they may have done to the whole idea of Spiderman, but I am glad I watched it. <br/><br/>Not too over dramatized and not too modified, which is what you found in the previous films. The story isn't exactly like the comic book for a few reasons, one of them being the fact that they would drag the story out too much and cause it to be boring as we seen in the last attempt. So if you are one of those people who think that everything should remain unscathed in the comic book story-line then this probably isn't for you, otherwise, I would definitely recommend it."

","I must say that the casting took a different role and did not cast according to looks. The child at the beginning of the movie looked more like the woman that Parker is in love with than Parker himself. One must notice that the boy had a round face and very small chin while Peter Parker had a long face and prominent chin. The woman had a round face and not a prominent chin. The special effects look like nothing but cartoons. I give the special effects people a zero on this film. I could hardly watch this film as it has no capacity to even keep one involved. The fact that there is a sequel amazes me. poorly written,very poor acting and the lack of story only shows that comic book people will love anything. This so called movie would be great if a 13 year old child had written the script. The acting is sometimes good and sometimes very bad. The man who plays the father of Spider-mans love is a very bad actor or he has been given a very bad script. If I was 5 years old. I would love this movie."
"takenistaken","3","2","4","19 April 2014"," Terrible.
","I don't even know why I watched this. I was bored. I knew it was gonna be the same old Spider-Man story, AGAIN.<br/><br/>Though I didn't expect it to be this bad. This movie is clichÃ©, cheesy, and really really stupid. I really have tried to sit back and accept that maybe this movie isn't supposed to be serious.. its trying to have that comic feel. But no, acting is terrible and jokes are cheap, and it just constantly feels like the creators are looking down at our intelligence. (So many face palm invoking moments..it's just not funny)<br/><br/>The first movie franchise started very well compared to this, it had a much better cast and depth (as if this one has any) and- as far as I'm concerned this is an unnecessary, stupefied recycle attempt. If I had not known better I might have thought this is a bad parody. (Something like ""Superhero Movie"" but that was actually pretty good)<br/><br/>It's just sad movies like this are doing well. (But people are gonna keep watching it just because its Spider-Man)"
"josh-rhoden","8","2","4","18 April 2014"," The Amazing Spider-Man. Is it amazing?
","The Amazing Spider-Man retells the origin story of Peter Parker's transformation into the superhero we all know and love, Spider-Man. This time around Peter Parker is still in high school and the intelligence of his character is shown more throughout the movie with Peter having to create his own web shooters after realising his powers of course.<br/><br/>The villain in the movie is The Lizard. A rather poor attempt and making him the villain severely butchered his character. 1)This version of The Lizard does not have a snout making him look like a taller, green version of Voldemort. 2)There is no balance between the morale of Dr. Connors and The Lizard. Dr. Connors is supposed to be a good guy but after his first transformation into The Lizard, Dr. Connors himself starts to become a villain. <br/><br/>The relationship between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy in the film is very convincing due to a large amount of brilliant acting (unlike that of the Sam Raimi trilogy) and explains their relationship easily. Gwen Stacy is much more likable and entertaining to watch than Kirsten Dunst's portrayal of Mary Jane.<br/><br/>The only real flaws are that The Lizard/Dr. Connors character was butchered and Spider-Man was only on screen for 25 mins of 136 minute running time.<br/><br/>Overall The Amazing Spider-Man has great,but short, action sequences, an interesting story, a great relationship between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy and a cool suit in my opinion. I recommend it to any Spider-Man fans out there."
"alindsay-al","8","2","4","16 April 2014"," A new fresher tale on much loved comic book character
","I first watched this film on a plane to New York and I must say I wasn't that impressed. But I have now watched this film for the first time at home and I thought this film is great and a fresh take on Spider Man. This film is slightly familiar because most people know the character of Peter Parker as Spider Man but this film stays fresh with a new love interest, a new time period and a new villain. Now this film will be compared to the original spider man films and where I preferred the first two Sam Remy films over this one I still believe that this film does things better then those films and some things worse. My favourite part of the film is the chemistry and relationship between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy with Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone having great chemistry. Also I felt the Lizard was a good villain for this opening film as it links to parts in peter's character that hadn't been explored in previous films. However, I still believe the Green Goblin and Doc Ock were better in the previous films. This film does a few things in it that just angered me and is the main reason this film does not have a higher rating from me. I must say though this film and all the marketing has got me so amped for the sequel and this Spider Man franchise could go on to rival that of X-Men and the Marvel cinematic Universe in the future."

Lizardman misses his arm, co th entire city needs to be transformed into lizards???

"dean-dsouza","9","2","4","14 April 2014"," Surprisingly good!
","I didn't think I'd like this. But I ended up loving it! All the actors/actresses in this film were so good, so believable! There was something really believable about the new Peter Parker, Andrew Garfield. He acted like a true awkward (and raw) teen! Also, when I watched the Captain America film, my girlfriend complained how unrealistic it was that Cap adapted to his new body immediately. Whereas in this new Spider-man film, Peter Parker was ripping out bathroom taps (US: faucets) by accident, and shattering glass whenever he shut the door hard (again, accidentally). It took him time to master his speed and coordination too. It was really, really good - really believable. My friend - a long-time Marvel fan - told me that this Peter Parker was more like the one from the comics, a true wise-cracker. I never intended to watch this film, but am so glad that I did! This is a true Spider-man film! (Though I preferred the villains in the Tobey Maguire films - the Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus. The current film is like a more serious version of the Maguire films.)"
"jaredmartin-464-711711","5","2","4","13 April 2014"," A Mediocre Reboot
","This film proves that as long as you have a bankable star like Batman, Iron Man, or in this case Spider Man, you don't have to make a good film, people will flock see it anyways. To be clear, I never read Spider Man comics, my introduction to the character was a cartoon series, and the original Raimi films. After seeing Spider Man 1, and 2, I started to read up on the character, and I realized some differences between the original films, and the comics. This happens in any film adaptation, because film doesn't have the luxury of time like comics do. That begin said, aside from organic web shooters, and Peter being a bit nerdier than the comics, I really bought into the heart, and soul of the story in the first two Spider Man films. <br/><br/>This is where I feel TASM really falls short. A reboot should refresh a previous series, and do something completely new with it. Take for example the Tim Burton Batman films, and the Nolan reboot. Now I know some people don't like one, or the other, but thats how a reboot should be. Nothing about those two series look anything like each other, but both are clearly about Batman, and both, in my opinion capture the essence of Batman, while making it their own. TASM, although with slightly updated technology, doesn't feel a whole lot different visually than the Raimi films. The biggest problem the film has, is that there's so much going on, that the plot becomes convoluted, and the pacing makes the film feel much longer than it is.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield looks fine as Spider Man, but I didn't feel as much for the way Garfield portrayed Peter Parker this time around. I get in the comics that Peter's a bit more sarcastic than how he was in the Raimi films, but it's a fine line between being humorous, and coming off as a complete ass. Acting wise, Garfield is fine so I can't fault him, in fact the acting is not the problem in this film, as the cast is very strong with the likes of Stone, Sheen, Leary, and even Sally field. The problem is that there's no real depth to any of their characters, so their acting talent is essentially wasted. For instance, there's many awkward scenes where Peter, and Gwen have flirty, stutter filled dialogue, but I don't see how any of that makes them head over heels for each other. Peter's relationship to everyone in this film, doesn't really feel very genuine whether it be Dr. Conner's/Lizard, Uncle Ben, Aunt May, Gwen, or even her father Captain Stacy. There's no real build up to any scene, or the core relationships, so everything feels hollow.<br/><br/>There's also just plain stupid scenes like Peter on the subway train, his constant breaking of everything he touches, and the ridiculous football bending the goal post scene. None of these would help to conceal one's supposed secret identity. The whole film itself seems to not know what identity it should take. Tonally it tries to be dark, although it has slapstick comedy at times, is it a straight love story between Peter, and Gwen, sort of not really, is this Spider Man meant to be taken more seriously, the film never really seems to know. TASM more often than not seems to bore, rather than entertain, something I wouldn't think possible with a Spider Man film."
"thecomputeraddict28","4","2","4","27 February 2014"," Mediocre and forgettable reboot with a cool Lizard
","Sam Raimis Spiderman was cool. It was fun, heartfelt, action packed and even had good dramatic moments. Above all, it was a passion project-only Sam Raimi could have put out those films. <br/><br/>The Amazing Spiderman lacks the energy and passion and comes across as cold and cynical. It has it's good moments but is overall a solid ""meh"".<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield I feel is a talented young actor who could be a good Spiderman. However he comes across as very unlikeable here, more of the hipster smart-ass douchebag I was at school rather than the lovable geek we have come to expect. He does excel in scenes with Gwen Stacy, played wonderfully by a stunning Emma Stone. This character is one of the highlights of the movie-she is cool and clever but also is reckless and gets into the action a lot-not something you see so often in comic book women. Rhys Ifans is creepy enough as the Lizard who is a decent bad guy. Although his motivation are a bit thin he is undeniably cool to watch on screen. The CGI can be ropey at times but the design is pretty cool and the motion capture is well done. Overall a highlight of the film.<br/><br/>Denis Leary is likable as Captain Stacy, although I did side with him in his arguments against the detestable Peter Parker. Sally Fields is decent enough as Aunt May but isn't given much to do. Martin Sheen makes for a very good Uncle Ben and while he doesn't say the iconic line ""With great power comes great responsibility"" he is the highlight of the first half.<br/><br/>And that's the biggest problem: the first hour. It is boring. I'm not complaining that it is a rehash of the first Spiderman film-its a poor rehash. A film like Batman Begins, Man of Steel or the Incredible Hulk were good reboots because they change the structure of the origin giving us something we haven't seen before. However the Amazing Spiderman shows us old tricks used in Spiderman and Batman Begins. And the worst part is that it seemed no one cared when writing it. Sure the acting is strong but what's the point if I don't care. The only interesting stuff that was happening was the relationship between Gwen Stacy and Peter and the whole Curt Connors sub plot-and that's because I've never seen it before. It also moves at a snails pace. Once Connors becomes the Lizard the film picks up with a silly plot of turning everyone into lizard people. Surprisingly this is more interesting than the death of a kids uncle and gaining super powers. Yes its comic book cheese but its decent. I would have preferred it if this had been the main story 10 minutes in. The sub plot on Peters parents should've been the highlight but its just clumsily shoved in there and forgotten about. <br/><br/>The action lacks the kinetic style of Raimi but is decent enough, especially at the end against the Lizard. In fact any action scene with the Lizard was pretty cool and are the highlights of the movie. <br/><br/>The directing is decent from Marc Webb, but the visual style is somewhat lacking. The scenes in the sewer look admittedly nice with the green lighting but New York looks like Gotham city in the Dark Knight (and I was no fan of Gotham in that film). Spiderman costume looks decent enough as does Oscorp. James Horners score is OK but isn't very memorable. <br/><br/>The film treats the source materiel with as much respect as the Raimi films. It has mechanical web shooters now but removes the characters of J Joanh Jameson, Norman and Harry Osborn completely as well as make Peter Parker unlikable. <br/><br/>Overall the film is unremarkable. The second hour is a pretty decent comic book movie but the first half is a slog. I'd say ots the weakest spiderman film so far. While Spiderman 3 was more of a mess it was a least interesting and memorable but this film is neither. Watch it for Emma Stone, Martian Sheen and the Lizard with a few cool action scenes here and there but as a satisfying reboot to this franchise? I'd rather have seen Spiderman 4."

","If I hadn't have seen the original Spiderman trilogy I would have probably rated this movie higher, but I have so therefore I can't help but to compare it. In itself, this movie is good- Emma Stone played the part very well and the plot line was believable for a 'comic book' movie. The problem is that I don't think Andrew Garfield was the right choice for the lead role; he is a good actor as we saw in The Social Network but something was just missing for me, lack of Peter Parker quirkiness? <br/><br/>The plot line was believable as I said but also predictable - there were no interesting plot twists and I found myself getting bored in the talks bits, the dialogue between the characters could have been written by a 9 year old! I understand that not all action movies need to have action 24/7 in them, but honestly, this needed more! There were only a handful of decent action sequences and most of them were pretty short. All in all I was disappointed leaving this movie, I will see the sequel and hopefully Garfield will have stepped up to the role."
"scott-sw","5","2","4","3 July 2013"," Decent Reboot
","When you reboot a franchise, the goal is to give the story a shot of stimulants to get it going again. Just like the recent Star Trek reboots, the Amazing Spider-Man does give the franchise a little boost, especially after the flawed and unfocused Spider-Man 3. However, it isn't the most groundbreaking, either. We have to get the origin story going again - although this time we get a little more into Peter Parker's absent parents. Once the story gets going, we are introduced to Dr. Curt Connors - AKA the Lizard. In all honesty, this was a great villain - probably the best one Spidey faced in the comics of yore. This was a flawed person that Spider-Man/Parker was always trying to help and redeem. We also have two vintage comic characters, Gwen Stacey and Captain Ned Stacey. Yes, they were introduced in Raimi's campy Spider-Man 3, but they were out of sync with the canonical story. This fresh take, does keep with the older comic stories and characters - and with Parker developing the web on his own. There was also a good casting call of making Martin Sheen who made a great Ben Parker. Sally Field, though, as Aunt May seemed a little weak as opposed to Rosemary Harris who gave the character a lot of strength. The one miscast (slightly) was Andrew Garfield as the new Parker/Spider- Man. I'm sorry, but Garfield did not give us the nerdy outcast vibe Maguire gave us. I thought the story moved a little slow. This one is also darker than the previous installments. It does not, however, resort to the camp and silliness of the previous Spidey venture. Overall, though, it was a fun time at the movies. It was not as fun as Raimi's first two ventures, but still enjoyable."

","as admirer of Andrew Garfield, it is difficult to say something bad about this film. soft, nice, it can be an useful introduction in Spiderman universe. great cast, decent special effects, few slices of humor, it is not waste of time but, in same time, far to be amazing. sure, idea of confrontation between red - blue hero and a version of Godzilla is new piece of old game and the fight scenes are example of deja - vu. so, after all, it remains a little question - why an another Spiderman ?or, more precise, why a new series ? it is clear, the scriptwriter can realize four- six parts but it is not exactly a question about imagination but about sense. result - a nice-strange film. for kids for some viewers. for the Garfield CV for others. or, only, for discover the perfect Spiderman who can be Peter Parker."
"Red_Identity","Null","2","4","15 June 2013"," Better than I expected
","It's not that I thought the film would be bad that I had never seen it until now. I just didn't think it would be anything more than merely OK. As it is, it's in the same level as the first Raimi one. Andrew Garfield makes a fantastic Spider-Man, for me this is the most obvious improvement. I also liked this film's origins and backstory, since it also takes longer for Parker to develop himself as Spider-Man and because of this the action takes longer to develop. But I think its the main villain that is the most obvious flaw here, and has nothing on Raimi's Green Goblin. Everything else though is on par and in many ways I prefer this version."

"ParanoidAndroid97","8","2","4","12 April 2013"," Andrew Garfield plays Spider-man in the first of what may be a new trilogy of remakes
","It seems odd to remake a trilogy that only ended in 2007, but I suppose people just got bored without 'your friendly neighbourhood Spider-man' around and wanted more. But rather than add to the existing plot line, the producers opted to remake the originals, re-creating Peter Parker's character and some of the events that happen to him whilst also sharing some parallels with the originals. For example, we have to go through the Uncle Ben death all over again, but the reasons for his death change - Peter's entry into a wrestling tournament from the original is replaced by Peter visiting an off-licence to purchase a carton of milk, before being denied the purchase because he is 2 cents short. Although I think this change was unnecessary and made things worse, most of the changes made to the plot were for the better. Andrew Garfield makes a modest and likable Peter Parker, and the growth of his wit and confidence as the film progresses is credit to Garfield's ability to develop a character. There were several things that bothered me, though. Firstly that, because the spider that bit Peter was one of dozens of spiders with the same characteristics, surely anyone who had access to a key card to open the door could stumble in there and be given the same powers Peter has by another one of the spiders, right? And if that was the case, why didn't Dr. Connors just make more spiders to bite people with, the spiders that had been around since Peter's father left, rather than waste loads of time tying to generate a formula for cross- species genetics if all he wanted to do was make people stronger? Sticking with Dr. Connors for a moment, there were two things that didn't work for me about him. One, I'm sick of British bad guys, they just don't have the effect that they used to. Two, his idea was actually pretty awesome (who wouldn't rather be a giant invincible lizard than a human?) so I found myself wanting him to succeed at the end despite Spider-man being my favourite superhero. And then there's the constant issue of 'why are there so many conveniently-placed cranes in the Spider-man movies?', but that's unimportant, really. So, for some good action, acting and story line changes, I think this was a very worthy remake of the originals, so it gets 8/10 from me."
"harlequin-ghost","3","2","4","31 March 2013"," Very disappointed !!!
","When they use the title The ""AMAZING"" Spiderman, you would expect to be amazed and be thrown into comic book heaven. Sadly this was not the case.<br/><br/>I thought retelling the origins story wasted time and was unnecessary, but it was clear that they wanted to put their different take of Spiderman to the masses.<br/><br/>I did not gel with Garfield as Spidey but did with the nerdy Maguire.<br/><br/>In this version Spiderman willing accepts stolen goods from the man that then goes onto kill his Uncle. So it is not just a case of him letting the criminal get away, he was actually implicit in the crime. So I don't think he has a valid reason to get on his high horse and try to catch the villain.<br/><br/>A lot of daft things happened as already mentioned. A beer bottle placed on his 'sleeping' head causes no reaction, but a single drop of water running down the side of the bottle onto his head causes him to wake and react instinctively? He displayed much of his super hero ability unmasked so it would not really take long for anyone to work out Parker was Spiderman.<br/><br/>Very rushed and did not add anything new. Should have just created an action movie from the outset. We all know who Spiderman is, so cut to the chase and spend the time and money on a proper storyline and special effects."
"HelenMary","7","2","4","28 January 2013"," Reboot of Marvel's Spiderman; good film experience, not brilliant
","I enjoyed this film in so much as it was fairly exciting, interesting and the SFX were good, excellent in fact. I didn't mind the CGI, which is a good sign, it didn't annoy me, except I did wonder how much Andrew Garfield was actually IN the film. The character of Peter Parker did annoy me though; whilst watching I got sick of his selfish uncommunicative mooning around, I often wonder how quickly problems would be sorted if people just said what was going on. He was too fashionably good looking and intelligent, and a skater, to be the subject of such excessive bullying, and too confident, to my eyes, so didn't really cut it as a geek as well as the quiet and mousy Tobey Maguire in the role. That saying I really liked him, I felt he was believable in the character once he changed and how he dealt with it. The previous boot of the film had Spiderman finding his webtastic skills as the way he adjusted, and likened to adolescent change, whereas this skirted back to - I am led to believe from what I've read -the original Spiderman using technology to spray his webbing but this showed a similar transition in his inability to control his powers and strength, and so therefore perhaps his anger and mood-swings too. I preferred the emotional range of Garfield in the role. I'm sure Marvel fans will comment more knowledgeably on why there was a reboot and the authenticity of this one, but I was mainly hung up on a few things, that I saw as inconsistencies and imponderables that I found a little irksome which I should have just suspended my disbelief over. <br/><br/>The pretty and wide-eyed Emma Stone was typically great, I like her a lot, and in this she was sensible and mature in her role. I loved Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen), he was such a lovely character, as was Sally field as Aunt May, Peter's surrogate parents since his parents disappeared, and whilst I understood his anger and angst towards them, I didn't like it - but then you're not supposed to are you? The family brought the characterisation more to the fore in this adaptation, I think, so his anger etc did was it was supposed to; create a roundness to the titular hero. Rhys Ifans never ceases to amaze me as I always associate him with his character in Notting Hill and he's always so different, like a chameleon... also a Lizard! Great seeing C. Thomas Howell again as Jack's Dad, so I predicted we'd see him again as otherwise he was in too small a role, at least I would hope, and Captain Stacey (Denis Leary) as Gwen's father, was ideal as a comic book square-jawed Law enforcement hero, and I like him in most things I've seen him in, he has a dry authority which worked well. Overall an enjoyable and emotive film with a great score, atmospherics and performances. The teaser cliff-hanger in the credits - make sure you don't miss it - nods to obvious suspicions from the start of the film. Certainly an entertaining film experience, and I'd probably go see the sequel as it's got Emma Stone in again and maybe Jamie Foxx, which should be fun."
"garrett_cranney","8","2","4","17 January 2013"," Great, but stolen story line from the first Spiderman
","The movie has some very good parts and also some funny parts. The story line is basically the same as the first Spiderman, which is cool to be familiar with the film, but it makes the story too predictable and boring. <br/><br/>Some good parts I liked, which actually made me think outside of the movie. The amazing quote Uncle Ben stated and the old picture of him when he was younger just made me realize that we as people have to cherish more in life. Stop taking everything for granted and thank everything we have. If you're a good person, don't let the bad things get in your way, pound them down and move on. Don't let the bad bring you down, when you're originally a good person.<br/><br/>I felt like the bad guy did not play long enough in the movie and there was too much of an intro to the movie than anything. If the directors and writers decide to keep moving on with this movie than I would rate this film 10/10. Other then that it gets an 8/10."

","I really wanted to like this film. I saw it twice at the cinema and have since watched it on DVD. Each time I watch it I get angrier. I've read a LOT of Spider-man comics over the years and I don't recognise this Peter Parker at all. After initial annoyance over the thought of a 'reboot' (how I hate that term) I was won over because I thought the origin would be done differently. What made it to the screen is almost a carbon copy of the first film, though poorly executed and with a really unlikable version of the protagonist. The Lizard looks silly, Peter is arrogant and idiotic (standing up to Flash, ignoring all figures of authority, walking into a room of spiders willingly, etc, etc) and what could have been a good mystery story turns about his parents into a run of the mill battle to save the city. In short, the 'untold story' promised to us never got told. Plot threads are left swinging, if you'll pardon the pun, yet I lack the desire to find answers after watching this. <br/><br/>Not to be completely negative, there are some great shots of Spidey swinging around the city and Emma Stone is always nice to watch! My favourite scene is the one where Peter saves the boy from the burning car; it's perhaps the only selfless thing Peter does in the whole film. Though this can't make up for a wholly disappointing film about a rather unheroic hero. Two words that sums up how bad this version is: Milk Chug."

","As a boy I loved the first Spider-man movie. It got me hyped! It got me obsessed with Marvel comic movies. Then the second film came around and it got better. The third...well...I liked it. When I heard they were making a reboot I got furious. But when I took some time to calm down, I figured I should give it a chance. It was WORTH IT! This makes up for all the faults the trilogy had and the effects were top-notch. Granted, the effects in Spider-Man 2 got better, they even got an Oscar! But the trilogy was cheesy. But it was marketed for kids, it's suppose to be. This film was more for mature audiences. I loved Danny Elfman's score in the first two movies but when I read James Horner was composing this movie I got even more hyped. And yes, the score rocked. The acting is solid, the action is awesome, the casting is perfect, the villain is NOT over-the-top like Goblin and Doc Octopus which is better; it's just the right superhero movie we needed. It did Spider-man a justice. I will pay to see the future sequels."

","When the first spider-man movie came out, in 2002, i was 12 years old, the movie had a huge impact on me. I pasted spider-man stickers everywhere in the house. I used to fantasize about me being spider-man and used to go jumping over walls. Me and my friend even had a cable wire tied to a tree branch and used to swing holding the wire making big circles in air. The thrill we used to get was priceless. Oh, those were the days. Before Batman Begins trilogy happened spider-man was my favorite superhero. Even to this day my hand automatically goes in the pose to release web sometimes. My point is i loved spider-man.<br/><br/>The next two installments were also fantastic. It seems they planned to make a 4th one but Tobey Maguire wanted to be the part of this project only if Sam Raimi was directing it. So they chose Andrew Garfield. He was good in The Social Network. <br/><br/>The movie is very high on technical values. Not only the movie but also the making of the movie. This one is very refreshing and takes a realistic approach towards the main character rather than being clichéd. Marc Webb directed 500 days.. it was a very very good movie. The romance in this movie is portrayed much better than in the original. <br/><br/>It did not have much action compared to the original 1st. But the action sequences were very well done. Andrew Garfield has done very good job in the stunts and also in displaying different emotions. Emma Stone is like a doll. She is also a talented actress. The movie did not answer Peter's past life questions, it only raised more. <br/><br/>The web releasing gadget, the suit are a good improvement over the original. Some people on the message boards are questioning why a reboot? Well as long they are good, I say keep em coming. And this sure did not disappoint me. So Iam not complaining. Though the action could have been more. It is very well written, directed and acted. After the movie ended, I was craving for more, I did not want it to end. <br/><br/>All-in-all nice movie. Emma Stone looked really gorgeous. And the ending was good too. I cant wait for the sequel."

","All the reasons not to see this movie can be summed up in one sentence: at a critical point in the movie, Spider-man is hanging off a building and needs to be rescued, as he has suddenly and inexplicably forgotten that he can climb on walls.<br/><br/>There are a hundred other reasons why this movie is bad, like how there's plot reset every thirty minutes that causes all characters to forget their previous motivations and never mention them again, but the above should cover the worst of it: whenever convenient, Spider-man forgets that he is Spider-man, and the writer and director somehow assumed that you would too. And you just might, because aside from the names and the costume, there's not much left of Peter Parker or Spider-man in this story reboot.<br/><br/>The action sequences are okay (but not great), and if all you want is another generic superhero movie, then this is decent, but that's all you'll get: a generic, forgettable movie about someone with a vaguely defined set of super powers."
"vailsy","9","2","4","30 November 2012"," True to the spirit of the comic books, this really is Spider-Man!
","People are entitled to their opinion but I grew up reading the comic books and this movie is far more accurate than Sam Raimi's efforts for a whole plethora of reasons <br/><br/>Firstly Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is brilliant.. nerdy, witty all at the same time and precisely how he should be.. much better than the incredibly dull Tobey Maguire. This Spidey is expressive and energetic <br/><br/>He also has the correct physique, slender and long limbed he looks perfect in the Spidey suit and has all the correct poses precisely as drawn in the comics. The suit is better and the effects on Spider-Man are also far better and look real.. I absolutely loved the web slinging sequence at the very end of the movie and that is the first time I have seen Spider-Man on screen.. I found it very moving to see that at last after imagining him in my head for so long reading the comic books <br/><br/>He has web shooters. Hallelujah! <br/><br/>There are some excellent casting choices.. I really liked Gwen (Peter's proper first girlfriend), Flash, Uncle Ben, Aunt May, Dr Connors and Captain Stacey too. The actors in this were superior pretty much across the board <br/><br/>On the negative side, yes some liberties are taken with the storyline but it really didn't matter to me. The music wasn't memorable although the sound design more than made up for this. Also the lizard was a little chunky and didn't move very gracefully which made the fight scenes rather limited.. I would've preferred a smaller more wiry Lizard, this one looked a bit like a dinosaur <br/><br/>But these are small criticisms and as a complete movie it beats Raimi's first Spider-Man (and probably matches his second one with Doc Ock). Judging by the ending during the credits it looks like the Green Goblin will be in the next one and after Raimi's completely horrible metallic Goblin I am really looking forward to finally seeing him on screen as he should be in Amazing Spider-Man 2 <br/><br/>If you love the comic books then take the IMDb rating with a big pinch of salt because this really is Spider-Man!"

","Can you reboot a franchise that once held the record for largest opening weekend in history? Can you create something original using a character who was first introduced to the world in 1962?<br/><br/>Peter Parker, age 4, (played by Max Charles) is playing hide and seek one night when he discovers someone has broken into his father's study. His father, Richard (played by Campbell Scott) sees this and takes some important papers, his wife Mary (played by Embeth Davidtz) and his son to the home of his Aunt May (played by Sally Field) and Uncle Ben (played by Martin Sheen). Peter is left in that home for his own safety and never sees his parents again. At least a decade later, Peter (played as a teenager by Andrew Garfield), is being bullied by an athlete named Flash Thompson (played by Chris Zylka) and has a crush on a student named Gwen Stacey (played by Emma Stone). When Peter returns home at the end of the day, bruised and beaten by Flash, he finds papers in his father's briefcase that show he once worked with a man named Dr. Curt Connors (played by Rhys Ifans). Connors works at a company named Oscorp, so Peter disguises himself as an intern to gain access to the lab and, hopefully, Connors. Little did he know, the tour for new interns was led by Gwen Stacey. She knows immediately that the ID badge that Peter's wearing belongs to someone else, but allows him to continue on the tour regardless. Peter sneaks away from the group and finds a lab filled with genetically-modified spiders that are producing biocable. As is often the case with people who bother animals for no reason, Peter gets bitten. Security eventually finds him and escorts him out of the building. While on the subway, he discovers that he gained far more than knowledge from his visit.<br/><br/>Now, I saw the 2002 Spider-Man film starring Tobey Maguire and the 2004 sequel. I liked it initially, but over time, I grew tired of it. I thought 2004's Daredevil was a much better film, despite mixed reviews from moviegoers and critics. Not to mention, I believe Kirsten Dunst gave a less-than-stellar performance as Parker's love interest, Mary Jane Watson. Not to mention the irony of having blonde Kirsten Dunst dye her hair red to play Mary Jane Watson and then having redhead Emma Stone dye her hair blonde to play Gwen Stacey. Forgetting all that for a second, this was a much better film than the one we got from Sam Raimi. Director Marc Webb and company have created something with a much darker, more serious tone, a better story, and a solid conclusion. I enjoyed this film very much."
"erik-swinson","3","2","4","23 November 2012"," Decent movie, if you know nothing about Spider-Man.
","If you have never heard anything about Spider-Man at all, this movie would be watchable. But of course tons of people got into Spider-Man after the movie series with Toby Maguire, so I doubt that this applies to too many people.<br/><br/>Where to begin. How about we hit the biggest screw up in comic movie history? They either forgot, or purposefully did not (to be ""different? from the series before) add Uncle Ben's famous line ""With great power, comes great responsibility"". How do you do that??? This quote is an echoing reminder to Parker throughout his whole life to do what is right. Hell, its a comic book quote that is beyond comic book famous, it holds meaning in real life! Maybe I'm just a nerd about this stuff, but I was astonished that this wasn't included.<br/><br/>Next, lets talk go scold Parker. Aren't you supposed to be hiding that you're Spider-Man?!?!? Oh wait, apparently the New York that you live in is completely brain dead. You stick to a public subway ceiling, and beat up a bunch of guys, but no one seems to notice the problem with that. You jump 10 feet in the air, just to embarrass ""Flash"" Thompson. But no one is asking questions. And lastly, you started to practice your powers in public? What in the world? And in broad daylight none the less. But that's OK, I'm sure there are plenty of places in New York that are just empty and vacant for you to do that. Empty streets/sidewalks and all. You would think that even if he got lucky somehow, and not a single person reported this stuff, that eventually someone would realize ""Hey, that kid was Spider-Man!"". I mean hell, Spider-Man does eventually become well known in New York. <br/><br/>Now to the point of the reboot. What was it? I had heard that they wanted to reboot it due to disputes with the actors/director, and they wanted to go back and be more in line with the ORIGINAL story. Now personally I know the original story, maybe not perfect, but pretty damn well. This movie had me lost. No Mary Jane in high school? Flash Thompson is hugging Peter? Peter was an uncoordinated nerd before the bite, yet he rides a skateboard? I'm sure I could rant on forever, but this is already getting a bit long.<br/><br/>I'm very glad that I did not pay movie ticket prices to see this disgrace. I'm very surprised that the great Stan Lee made an appearance in this butchering of a movie. With this start to a series I really can't imagine how you would save it, short of another ""reboot""."
"sonicfan5715","9","2","4","14 November 2012"," Amazing is an understatement.
","When I heard there was going to be a new Spiderman film with a new storyline and actors, I honestly looked forward to it while most people were bashing the idea because they loved the first three Spiderman films too much. But #3 ended on such a dissatisfying note that a new film was inevitable. And this is not technically a reboot, it's based on the storyline of the Amazing Spiderman comics while the other films are based on the Spectacular Spiderman comics (two different premises and story lines to this character). This film is just amazing in so many ways (save for 1 nitpick I'll mention later here), one being Parker/Spiderman himself. Andrew Garfield was a great pick for Peter in my opinion, and trumps Tobey Mcguire, because he portrays Peter as a very shy, timid, yet smart and likable character, and once he dons the Spidey suit on, he is allowed to act however he wants, one scene in particular being absolutely hilarious when he's apprehending a car thief. And when he's around his Uncle Ben and Aunt May (who are wonderful and I surprisingly like them a lot more than the other films, particularly Ben) it feels like a real family, they get along very well, but they get in arguments and disputes. On top of that, this films take on Uncle Bens death is so much more effective and emotional than the first one, it just feels like such a great loss. And Peter does not get to get his revenge yet in the first film, we'll probably see him get his vengeance in the upcoming sequel, so it's not thrown out the window right away as an emotional turmoil for him to conquer. And I love Gwen Stacey (played by the wonderful Emma Stone) as a character, and is so much more dynamic than Mary Jane (Dunst) as a love interest. Plus, Gwen is not a useless, damsel-in-distress like Mary, she finds out who Peter really is towards the middle of the film, and actually gets to do something very worth while and beneficial in this film (make an antidote to stop the Lizard). Heck, she even b$#@% slaps the lizard with a trophy (or stool, I forget) and that's pretty sweet. Dr. Conners/Lizard was the Spiderman villain I wanted to see for a very long time during the Spiderman movies, and we finally got him. Conners (Ifans) seems like a very intelligent and soft person due to his arm lost and his history with Peters father, and is soon drawn into a duel personality that makes him crazy to make the world a perfect place with perfect beings. The Lizard himself does have a very cool design, although I probably would have preferred he had a more lizard-like head as opposed to his human like/lizard face. It's just slightly awkward to see at first, but it's a small nitpick, and all in all, it's still a pretty decent and sometimes bad ass portrayal of the Lizard. I don't want to give anything else away, but this film is indeed amazing, and it is worth a buy over a rental at redbox if you didn't have the opportunity to see in theatres, I personally recommend it. (Fun fact, almost every single shot of Spiderman swinging through the air on his hand made webs, was all done by stunt work, not CGI, and that's awesome that they took the time to launch stunt men through the air to provide a fresh, unique feel to the swinging spiderman scenes.<br/><br/>(8.5/10) Amazing, except for a weird lizard/human face combo, but even that's still cool"
"david_ostby","5","2","4","5 November 2012"," A too hurried reinvention of Spiderman that pales compared to the previous trilogy
","I enjoyed Spiderman and Spiderman 2 very much, and think they deserve a little higher rating here on IMDb. They had good story line, well done acting, good action sequences (especially the second movie) and the good mixture of drama, love and action that I associate with a classic superhero movie. You may complain that it's a little too conservative in style, not daring to take new leaps, but the director did however succeed in making the very best of that kind of movie.<br/><br/>When I first heard about a new movie I was skeptical since I think that the ""old"" movies are still keeping up in quality to this date. I got that usual feeling about Hollywood making the best to make more money, adding nothing to already good movies but some new visual effects and new actors. However I saw that the movie had a quite OK ranking of 7.4 on IMDb and that critic reviews were not too bad in my home country so I decided to give it a chance.<br/><br/>The movie however, turned out to be as much of a success that I first expected. In this version Peter Parker is much more of a careless average teen riding his skateboard and going to school, and we don't get a chance to start feeling any sympathy or care for him while his personality and relationship to other characters are not developed at all. At times it feels like watching a commercial version of Spiderman where everything is happening too fast. <br/><br/>Spidermans love interest follows the same fate as Spiderman himself, lacking any problems as well as personality. One of the great accomplishments in Spiderman & Spiderman 2 was that they managed to make the antagonists into characters you at least could relate to in a certain degree, and then turning them into monsters in a somewhat believable way (for a superhero movie). Here we have a very nicely behaved and boring scientist that turns into something as original and fascinating as a giant lizard... Well, this is a superhero movie and you should not expect seriously deep characters with truly complex relations (those didn't exist in the previous installments either), but I still expect a Spiderman you could get into as an adult and not a movie with acting more like a regular high school movie.<br/><br/>Also, the problem with being Spiderman and at the same time living a life as Peter Parker has to a much higher degree turned into moral lessons about helping your family in the household, one more thing that makes the movie feel more suitable for younger viewers.<br/><br/>The action sequences is quite OK actually and doesn't lack anything special, but the movie won't be remembered for them either.<br/><br/>The only thing that really is improved is the visuals, with some cool sequences when we see the world as Spiderman when he flies between the skyscrapers. However, with all improved special effects I think the movie is a little too bold as it starts to feel like they are there only for their own sake and not supporting the movie. In a movie like this I prefer special effects for their requirement and not as standalone attractions.<br/><br/>In the end this was merely OK for a standalone movie. Nothing was all terrible (maybe besides a few really cheesy things such as the skateboard scene and the girl wanting Parker to take pictures of her boyfriends car) but the movie suffers from being inferior to the previous installments, while still reminding them a lot. Trying to refresh Spiderman with a new movie right now doesn't only sound bad on paper; it was a failed attempt."

After meeting an old friend of his father's he begins to think he may have an answer and helps him with a scientific equation that has very, very bad side effects...for all involved. I was never really a big fan of the Sam Raimi ""Spider-Man"" movies. To me they were too cheesy. I was looking forward to this one because it seemed darker then those. While this did feel more grown up it was still nothing like I was expecting. I think my big problem with it is that it was so much like the other series that the movie didn't feel like it was needed at all. This isn't a fair comparison but the Chris Nolan ""Batman"" series was much, much different from the Tim Burton series that the re-boot felt fresh and original. This one just felt like...hey let's do ""Spider-Man"" again...OK. This may just be my opinion but there is nothing new and fresh in this movie compared to the others and to me that seems like a waste of a movie. This again though is a movie that people will watch regardless of any review written, but just so you don't get your hopes up don't really expect anything different or amazing. Overall, if you liked the other series then you will probably like this one, since it's basically the same movie. I give it a B-."
"matthewchermside","5","2","4","29 October 2012"," Some Good Ideas in a Poorly-Told Story
","There is no way to avoid a comparison with Raimi's films. Spiderman 1 was an interesting and good if slightly underwhelming film. Spiderman 2 was completely awesome. Spiderman 3 was a total mess, hence the feeling that the character needed a reboot. This film is neither good, nor awesome, nor is it a total mess. And it certainly is not amazing. Andrew Garfield is unconvincing. Emma Stone similarly so. Rhys Ifans was criminally underused. <br/><br/>The script was poor, and important scenes like the invention of the suit and the web-slingers. also the evolution of The Lizard were rushed, and other scenes like the death of Uncle Ben and those about teenage high- school angst were much better handled in Raimi's films. The motivation of the antagonist was also muddled and didn't even come close to the good-guy turned bad of Alfred Molina's Doctor Octopus, even if the crazed idea of forcing mutated evolution through biological agents was interesting, if not original.<br/><br/>The greatest shame was that there were some interesting ideas that were not properly developed - the link between Connors and Peter Parker's parents and Norman Osborn was only alluded to, when it could have been the spine of the plot that was sorely missing. This really could have been an interesting 'untold story' - but it still remains untold!<br/><br/>The action scenes were underwhelming and there was little chemistry between Gwen Stacy and Peter Parker - nothing like the mystery and fatal attraction between Kirsten Dunst and Tobey Maguire in Raimi's films - in this film the revelation that Peter is Spidey is clumsily sandwiched in between other pointless scenes instead of being the cliffhanger at the end of the film like in Raimi's Spiderman 1.<br/><br/>This is pretty much a pointless remake and missed many opportunities to really reboot the franchise. Poor casting and the wrong director in my opinion. What a shame."
"richy1024","7","2","4","27 September 2012"," Maguire move over... Here comes Garfield!
","When the publication of rebooting the Spider-man franchise from scratch instead of progressing on with the Toby Maguire/Sam Raimi trilogy, there was a distinctive scepticism surrounding Sony's announcement. Considering the first of Raimi's Spidey outings only hit the screen a decade ago, some documented Mark Webb's -take on the Marvel phenomenon as being too premature.<br/><br/>Arguably every Spider-man fan, artist and costume owner would compare Andrew Garfield's character in relation to Toby Maguire's disposition. Garfield is much more compelling; intriguing to watch and his physic characteristically reminds us of the Peter Parker in the original comic. He carries himself with a professional tone, knowing how to express emotion and anger in a believable manner, unlike Maguire's freaky Gothic outtakes and inarticulate voice tone. Garfield's twenty eight years of maturity celebrates his ability to act like a teenager but with a distinct level of ripeness, helping Mr Parker become an attractive persona beyond the red mask.<br/><br/>The story at times seems a slightly hurried, especially during Peter Parker's transformation from geek to freak in an outfit. But this is fascinating and very articulate on the director's behalf. Even those beyond the audience are conscious of Parker's difficulty to fit in, how he foolishly becomes victim to one of Oscorp's radioactive spiders and so on, yet Webb changes the shade of our hero to a remarkable effect. Rather then studying his new spidey techniques, Webb's adaptation introduces Parker's sudden change with a hint of laughter, causing collisions and confrontation by mistake, overly sticking himself to things and being a little over-aggressive without intending to do so. The element of surprise here keeps the interest with Garfield's volatile persona.<br/><br/>The sequel to Webb's refreshed wall hiker could be enormous in comparison to Raimi's filming. Webb has the delight of deconstructing Raimi's trilogy and pick-pocketing every blunder, potentially turning it into a polished and expansive trilogy that may be difficult to emulate if Spider-man is to continue at the movies in future."

","Most people might have overrated this movie, just because they went in expecting this to be one of the worst Blockbusters made (in recent years). Fortunately that is not the case. Just the fact they cast Martin Sheen and Sally Fields as a couple was one great coup. Great chemistry there. All the actors work in this one actually, but those two bring some weight/gravitas to the whole movie.<br/><br/>Of course the movie does have its weaknesses, such as logic or other things the screenwriter couldn't be bothered with. But that doesn't and shouldn't be an obstacle you can't overcome. Because otherwise you wouldn't be able to enjoy the movie as the majority did (as is evident by the voting on here).<br/><br/>Of course it is a bit weird seeing a similar origin story again after only 10 years (most will still have the Raimi movie fresh in mind).

","Up next I'm doing a movie review on the movie ""The Amazing Spiderman,"" starring Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, and Rhys Ifan.<br/><br/>A lot of people were saying this film came out too fast. They should have waited a couple more years to revamp this film. I'm not going to lie to you, I was so excited that it was coming out in July; I didn't even care about how fast it came out. It's crazy how they messed up the third Spiderman movie so bad that they had to revamp the whole series.<br/><br/>I loved this film! ""The Amazing Spiderman"" was simply brilliant! I felt that they did a great job of showing Spiderman's origin. I like how they made it so Spiderman had a little bit more of a personality and wasn't too nerdy. In the comics, he wasn't ready that nerdy/shy. Nothing wrong with those qualities, but Spiderman was a regular guy that was just very intelligent.<br/><br/>I also thought The Lizard was done well too. The Lizard was a good bad guy to choose. I like how they showed how The Lizard was a good person that was just looking for a cure and got addicted to the cure. I also loved how they put Gwen Stacy in the film. Peter Parker and her love story was fun to watch. Emma Stone did an excellent job as usual. There are so many things I love about this film, I could go on forever.<br/><br/>I'm giving this film an 8 out of 10. This film had great execution, good acting, and it's just an all out awesome film. If you're a Spiderman fan and, you followed the comics you are going to enjoy this film more than anyone. Definitely see it in the theaters if you have a chance. Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoyed the review!"
"theblessedresistance01","9","2","4","21 July 2012"," ""The Amazing Spider-Man""
","I really appreciate Sam Raimi as a director, and I do really like his first two 'Spider-Man' movies, but the problem is that they stray so far from the comic books. And then after the mess that was 'Spider-Man 3,' I lost interest for the series. Now, five years later we have a reboot. Some argue it's too soon, and for a while I agreed, but then I started reading into it and watching the trailers and I began to be pumped.<br/><br/>'The Amazing Spider-Man' is directed by Marc Webb, director of the Indie Romantic Comedy '(500) Days of Summer,' so the amount of romance in the film can be expected, but surprisingly it works well. Marc Webb does a masterful job directing this film, creating the dark tone that was set for comic book films in 2008's 'The Dark Knight.' The performances in the film are top notch. Andrew Garfield, 29, is very believable as a teenager, and Emma Stone is absolutely great as Gwen Stacey. Martin Sheen and Sally Fields are great as Uncle Ben and Aunt May, Rhys Ifans is a good villain, and Dennis Leary plays a tough police chief, Captain Stacey.<br/><br/>The story telling is more intriguing than in 2002's 'Spider-Man,' mainly because we get back story and reasoning as to why Peter Parker does the things he does. This is a fantastic comic book movie, one of the best, and even though it doesn't quite meet the heights of 'The Avengers,' I really enjoyed it, and I think it is one of the best comic book films out there today."

","Well it is realistic as weird as that may sound, but it was pretty good actually, I didn't know how I would like Andrew Garfield as Spiderman, but he was great! Not as good as Toby though, Toby was the quintessential nerd for me. He's awesome in every movie he is in. Emma Stone was so much better than Kristen Dunst. I love Kristen Dunst though, she is pretty and likable. A very likable movie and a very likable Spiderman if I may add, but no Jonah Jameson these days. Dennis leary was a surprize as the police comissioner. I like Gwen Stacy more now. I've always been more of a Kitty Pride, mary jane kind of a fan, but yeah she was good in this movie, unlike Spiderman 3, which totally sucked I mean what is this Sam Rami some middle finger to everyone who has ever liked Spiderman I think no I know it was.

He seemed more harsh with his ""everything can be solved with well-meaning quips and violence but I'm responsible when I cause property damage"" thing.<br/><br/>Character- B+, for dynamic, while cliché, offered a fun 2 hours. Plot- A-, solid, yet again cliché, but still good. Errors- Standard continuity errors with a few geographical issues. Stan Lee scene- A+,hilarious!<br/><br/>All in All, A movie, but after other summer movies, it is just not Avengers standard."

","A boy is bitten by a spider and is given arachnid-like powers that allow him to become a vigilante crime fighter. Meanwhile, he unwittingly assists a Doctor to achieve his goal of regenerating limbs but its side effects jeopardises him and the inhabitants of his city.<br/><br/>Director Marc Webb's Amazing Spider-man is essentially a satisfactory superhero film which captures the character of the Spider-man who appears in the comics and cartoons. While like its recent counterparts there's lots of computer generated imagery. However, this version benefits and looks much better for its practical segments that ground Spider-man making him that little bit more amazing.<br/><br/>Rhys Ifans is excellent as the troubled, empathetic Dr. Curt Connors/Lizard. Again the special effects are well put together and The Lizard is wonderfully realised. Andrew Garfield balances his transition into a superhero coupled with the collage kid successfully and makes a great Peter Parker with his enjoyable wit, sincerity and charm. The supporting cast are first rate including the likes of Sally Field, Dennis Leary and Emma Stone as gifted love interest Gwen Stacy. Notably, Martin Sheen captures the sense of humour and gravity required for Uncle Ben. The pacing is spot on and the film never out stays it welcome, accompanied by a top James Horner score that really comes to life during the action scenes.<br/><br/>While James Vanderbilt's screenplay with input from Steve Kloves and Alvin Sargent is full of subtleness, one liners and repartee, Vanderbilt's story is all too familiar reminiscent of X-Men (2000) our Lizard, like Magneto wants to make everyone like him. There's also the regurgitated plot elements.<br/><br/>That's the main stumbling block for this incarnation of Spider-Man, familiarity. It hampers what essential is a good foundation. There were 25 years between the made for TV The Amazing Spider-man (1977) and Spider-man (2002) and in that time there were advancements in filmmaking and more money put into the first true film. With this Spidey there's less of a gap - with Sam Raimi's last surprisingly heavy and drawn out outing being 2007. Webb and cinematographer John Schwartzman can't get away from it being the same setting, period and time so the look here is inevitably similar. It's not that comic, film, cartoon Web slinger fans don't know origin story already but it's the fact it feels we've just seen the same thing, in the same medium only a moment ago.<br/><br/>For anyone alien to the superhero this will be a great version of Spider-man. It's an improvement on its predecessor - certainly in its spirit and tone but by default it's not fresh. Like the Hulk (2003) and it's reboot The Incredible Hulk (2008) it's a shame the studio didn't get it right first time, but hey, with great power comes great responsibility."

","I saw the Tobey Maguire trilogy, and I liked it, those movies were significant in my childhood, then I began to read the comic-books and I liked Spider-man even more, it was my obsession, and I realized that the movies were so different than the original story.<br/><br/>Now, this brand-new movie comes out and I feel good with the result, everything is better! The cast, of course, is more accurate to the idea of the original Spidey, while in the other movies Sam Raimi used mature actors, a big mistake, Peter is a teenager! Point to TASM. The story in this movie was not perfect, but I liked it. Acting was great! All of the actors got into their characters so well. Visual effects were awesome, beautiful, well-done. And finally something that cannot miss in any spider-man story, the humor, in The Amazing Spider-man the humor goes by funny and smart quotes and situations, while in the previous movies the humor was a little bit ridiculous.<br/><br/>Finally all I can say is, now I'm older, and after watching the four movies, my thumb-up goes to this one, a true success."

","I was waiting for the movie with quite big expectation, and boy it didn't disappoint me. I enjoyed the movie so much because it looks to me that the maker tried to bring fresh air to Peter Parker character. In the three latest Spiderman movie we can see that the main character is somewhat emo/vulnerable and has been friendzoned for years, but you won't find that in this movie. <br/><br/>What I like the most is, beside the funny add-on scenes and fabulous heroine, the fact that this movie showed me more real feeling about being a superhero. Spiderman in this movie didn't just go fly away right away, no, it took time to perfect his move and everything, but that's what interesting. The special effect is very good looking and the fight has actual unexpected major casualties, it makes the movie looks even more real.<br/><br/>Indeed, there are some downside like the plot that is a little bit hard to grasp and lack of information (deliberately, it seems) on many important names like Osbourn and Parker's family. However, the fights and the funny scenes could make up for it. You cannot find Spiderman who bring his bag while wearing the costume, actually good looking and charming for the girls, using phones while on action, and still remember to borrow something home in most Spiderman movies."
"siberiandante","7","2","4","16 July 2012"," Mixed feelings, but a good movie overall
","The Amazing Spider-Man is a reboot to the superhero film series owned by Sony and not related to any other Marvel films out there. This film comes out a decade after the original Spiderman but my feelings are mixed whether I should review it as a stand-alone, or as if it was better than the one that came out in 2002.<br/><br/>The film, as with any first entry on a superhero film series, deals with the origin story of Spiderman and how his life changes dramatically after the usual ""radioactive exposure event that gave him superpowers"". Like I mentioned before, I am not sure whether it would be fair to compare this movie to the first one since they're kinda in the same levels of quality, but the original cast is naturally more likable for me and most of the audiences.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Tobey Maguire is a much more likable Peter Parker than Andrew Garfield. Andrew's performance was quite juvenile and refreshing, yet he does not really look like a ""high school nerd"" that Parker is supposed to be. Andrew did succeed in performing more joyfully than Tobey, which made the film's tone less dramatic, and while he is wearing the Spiderman suit he seems to be having more fun than the corrupted Peter in Spiderman 3.<br/><br/>The film's cinematography is great and overall I think the cast is on the same level like the original film series, although anyone is obviously more used to the first. The Lizard is the villain on this film, and Rhys does succeed in making his role work, although I was slightly disappointed he didn't have a ""crocodile-like jaw"".<br/><br/>On other comments of the cast, Gwen Stacy didn't look too different when it came to her portrayals by Emma Stone and Bryce Howard. I am not familiar with Denis Leary's work in Rescue Me, but I actually believe his animated sabertooth counterpart Diego was a lot more expressive than his performance in this film. Peter's new adoptive family was well cast, and supported the film when it came to comic relief at times.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is quite good, but I am unable to tell whether it was better than the first Spiderman. This film's tone is less dramatic and more cheerful, making it more appealing to the younger audiences. Truly worth to watch it if you're interested in comic book adaptation movies."
"demarcoshannon","9","2","4","15 July 2012"," It's about the introduction and background info! NOT NECESSARILY THE ACTION
","I have to say, I actually thought this was very good. Some people liked it some people didn't. It definitely can't beat the Spider Man 1 and 2 with Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and James Franco, however; I thought that it portrayed the background of Spiderman really well. I have also heard that this one follows the comic more. One thing I really liked was the background info given on Peter's parents. I also liked how he has the web developer in this one rather than pressing on the palm of hand or whatever Tobey Maguire did in the first one. I also found the villain interesting-the lizard. I thought the scenes where Dr. Connors turned into the lizard were cool, however; I DO NOT Recommend SEEING IT IN 3D; I SAW IT IN 3D, I APPRECIATED The STORY AND ACTING BUT NOT NECESSARILY THE 3D VISUALS. Andrew Garfield did an amazing job as Spiderman. He embodied the role so well; Emma Stone did a great job as well. There was good humor in it too but not as good as the original. I thought it was funny when he broke the alarm clock. I also liked the scene with the basketball."
"zasmith92","9","2","4","15 July 2012"," Epic! Far better than the original

I really cannot see any element in which this movie does not surpass the original. The actors- I believed that Garfield gave a role that awesomely fits spidey from the comics, he delivered wit smoothly while also embracing Peter Parker's nerdy persona. Emma stone likewise filled her role quite well and her acting abilities surpass Kirsten Dunst. Furthermore, the action and special effects. Anyone reviewing that says this element of the film is subpar is just being biased and lying to themselves. The fight scenes were incredible and there was so much suspense I was on the edge of my seat sweating. The special fx was delivered so flawlessly everything looked unbelievably realistic and not only that spider man's animations were awesome, pure awesome.

He uncovers a briefcase that allows him to follow in his father's footsteps in a breakthrough study of biological research, but when Peter is bitten by an unusual spider and the research turns out to be much more radical than he anticipated, his life is quickly turned upside down. Reboot/remake of the series that began with Sam Raimi's 2002 original can't avoid some familiarities, and is let down by a long running time and some thinly developed characters, but it's made worthwhile by good casting, nifty special effects, and intense, edge of your seat action scenes.

Andrew Garfield is the next big thing, Emma Stone is destined for greatness, everything is nice but i have got to say that it was not as expected. The story line is very predictable, it was not creative enough some details were actually kind of useless and exaggerated.

"Al_The_Strange","8","2","4","14 July 2012"," ""Amazing Spiderman"" Review
","It's hard to approach this movie on its own merits; it's only been ten years since Sam Raimi's first ""Spiderman"" film, and only five years since his series was rounded off in ""Spiderman 3."" With these films still fresh in the consciousness, one can't help but to approach this reboot with the forethought that it's completely frivolous and unnecessary, especially since it covers some of the same ground as the first original ""Spiderman"" film. Chances are that your decision to see and enjoy this film will be entirely biased based on your views on this, and your opinion on the other Spidey films. Hated Tobey McGuire and Sam Raimi's cartoonish style? Then perhaps this reboot will satisfy you better. Otherwise, you might really will think it's unnecessary.<br/><br/>If you can push your memory of the other films out of your head, ""The Amazing Spiderman"" is a perfectly serviceable blockbuster. It has its share of action and special effects, especially toward the end with the climactic duel between Spiderman and the villain. There are some fun heroics in the middle of the film. Even when Spidey isn't kicking butt and taking names, the movie's comedy is successfully funny and the melodrama/romance is not too overbearing. If anything, I felt this movie's drama was more entertaining than in the other ""Spiderman"" films, thanks largely to the film's style and acting, but I'm sure other viewers may disagree. The pacing is admittedly not perfect; some parts whiz by and skim over some plot points, while other parts take their time. The best that can be said is that the film rarely drags.<br/><br/>The story is familiar territory, albeit told differently. It may irk some viewers to have to sit through Peter Parker's drama all over again; I also found it a little disconcerting that many details have been withheld, presumably to be revealed in a sequel. Still, the film does a fine job of telling the origin story, detailing the main character's transformation into a superhero, and establishing all the characters and their relationships. In fact, character development is where the film excels: Peter Parker (and in turn Spiderman himself) is a far stronger character, showing a broad range of emotions. It is a blast to watch his wisecracks and his attitude, but he does show a perfectly serious demeanor when necessary.<br/><br/>Filmed with solid, quality photography, the film looks stylish, without being cartoony like Sam Raimi's films. The editing is good most of the time, with only a few parts that appeared choppy. Acting is pleasing; Andrew Garfield is impeccable as Peter Parker, Emma Stone makes for a perfectly likable love interest, and Rhys Ifans does his best with the villain. The writing is pretty decent. This film features plenty of good-looking sets, props, and costumes. There are some special effects that don't look that good, but most hold up. Music is pretty decent.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I felt it was a good film, and I really can't say whether I prefer this one or Sam Raimi's films better. As it is, I like them all pretty equally. As for recommending ""The Amazing Spiderman"" to anybody else, I would only recommend a rental, because your enjoyment will depend on many variables.<br/><br/>4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Good | Film: Good)"
"CowboyShot","7","2","4","13 July 2012"," The Slightly-Amazing-Yet-Ultimately-Impotent Spider-Guy.. vs. a Lizard!
","With better editing and more sweeping soundtrack, the film could have been epic. Instead, it mostly fell flat; even in spite of solid direction, writing, and performance.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi always brought the audience into his world and taught you how to truly care about what was happening within the silver screen. Here, it just felt like a 2012 rehash of something we've all seen before, but now, care less about.<br/><br/>As an avid fan, I always hated Raimi's mutant web-shooters; so the induction of Parker's technical genius into this series marks a welcomed return to the source material. In addition, the filmmakers did an amazing job at capturing the sardonic tragedy that is at the core of Spider-Man's reality. Without Raimi's camp-humor, this tone was even more ever present.<br/><br/>Stone, Garfield, Leary, and Ifans gave it their all, and it was enjoyable. The clash between The Lizard and Spider-Man was certainly nothing to the scale of Batman vs. The Joker, but was enjoyable nonetheless.<br/><br/>Unfortunately with the film's pacing and unengaged soundtrack, things felt sluggish and tired: two things you never want to experience in a superhero action epic. In this regard, The Amazing Spider-Man was more of a Slightly-Amazing-Yet-Ultimately-Impotent Spider-Guy. I look forward to the sequels and how they are going to bring in the Goblins. There were some really interesting plot points teased throughout the film.<br/><br/>7/10, would watch again - though it could have easily been a 8-9/10 with improved post-production work."
"harryjnicholson","8","2","4","11 July 2012"," Overall a great film, that has been performed fantastically.
","First of all can I say I'm only 14. this is a teenage view on this film. Also I haven't had much experience on writing reviews so bare with me. Some people may think this is an necessary addition to the already bulging collection of superhero films; The Avengers, Iron man, Captain America, Thor (dare I go on. But this film adds a new level to the superhero genre that I think will be hard to beat. This is the story of a young man called Peter........ you know the story, you've heard it before and watched the original trilogy of films. The thing that makes this film differ to the original story is the focus on Peter's father, who seems to have been white washed out of the original. Peter wants to find out about him and try to understand why he left him. Andrew Garfield's portrayal of Parker out trumps Tobey Maguire's, as Garfield adds one extra thing. Emotion. Throughout his search for truth, Parker has some rough times and emotions are flying! His way of putting across his feelings are outstanding!<br/><br/>overall I thoroughly enjoyed this adaptation of an already amazing story. I wasn't too sure on it before going, due to the fact I wasn't the biggest fan of The Avenger, however from start to end I was hooked. I recommend this film to any 90's kids who grew up with the originals, any kids who are too young to remember the originals, and of course any adults who never knew when to grow up fully.<br/><br/>(Keep an eye out for Stan Lee's cameo as with all Marvel films)"
"tshine-800-984292","8","2","4","11 July 2012"," Almost amazing, but the Stone+Garfield combo made it
","I envisage becoming a Peter Parker like character. The awkward teen is made cool by intelligence, a rebellious style and last but not least, impeccable charisma. I love how it plays on his mental aptitude and characterised roundness, and not as a shallow superhero character (it's not just save the world, get the girl - it does have depth of emotion). Both Stone and Garfield's were believable whilst mastering the entertainment value of the film - the comedy is witty and appropriate whilst not undermining moments of tension and heartbreak. Not forgetting the fact that Emma Stone epitomises the 'girl next door' look, definitely a major plus factor.<br/><br/>However, this film is not without flaws. The action scenes were average, but then again, I am not the one for completely over-the-top sequences (simple fighting scenes worked well, but maybe could have been better executed - nothing that screamed out ""that's cool""). <br/><br/>Peter ends up neglecting his drive for justice - finding Ben Parker's killer - when it seemed to initially be his only motivation to be Spiderman. This is then completely disregarded, no mention of Peter's loss at all after news of Connors' dangerous exploits. <br/><br/>Gwen Stacy is overly accepting and forgiving of Peter's role in the causation of the death of her father. She is the one to confront him after the death, when he obviously has a sense of guilt. Stacy is more than happy to start seeing Peter again - the relationship is more upbeat than needing each other for emotional support. Adding to this, Stone's mourning seemed to be non-existent after a very brief grieving scene to Peter at his front door (adding a nice pathetic fallacy of the rain to add to the sorrowful mood - although I do quite like these clichés for atmosphere). Stone's character seemed to care more about being with Peter and not focusing on her family ties at all - I know it makes for a happy ending, but it is far too idealistic. <br/><br/>Overall, disregarding the flaws, I did enjoy this film. Comparing to Tobey Maguire, I am in total favour that Garfield did a better job. He is much more suited to the role (story aside); having more charm, breaking free of the awkward nerd stereotype and being what a superhero should be - cool."
"mert-ulusel","8","2","4","10 July 2012"," Good, but not for everyone
","I am not a hardcore fan of the spidey, and while this movie may have upset many of the hardcore fans, I thought it was, though lacking in some parts, a brilliant re-boot, certainly better then raimi's version.<br/><br/>I have to warn you though, if you want to see spidey in action and don't have much care for the plot, this is not for you.<br/><br/>First of all, in this movie, Peter Parker's character was a great improvement overall from its predecessor. He was human, had problems, got cocky when he realized his powers, and had his weaknesses. He wouldn't just magically heal himself every two scenes, even though they may have overdid the wounds a little bit. And most importantly he had the sarcasm and the sense of humor has been improved greatly.<br/><br/>The effects are not as pleasing as one would expect to be. First person web-slinging parts are greatly done, though the lizard himself doesn't look as good as you would expect him to. Also that mutant lab rat was just funny.<br/><br/>The lizards motive of ""destroying weaknesses"" was too forced in if you ask me. The bit where he talks to his ""evil self"" were too. <br/><br/>Sure, the story behind peters family was never revealed, but to be honest i didn't have much care for it either. If you did, thats what we have sequels for!<br/><br/>Spider-man is portrayed as a human with super powers, rather than a super hero with a human side, which is in my opinion an a lot better approach.<br/><br/>It was a good movie, but if you want two something hours of pure action, I wouldn't recommend it to you. If not, go see it, you wont regret it."
"Doylenf","7","2","4","10 July 2012"," Action scenes are magnificent but story takes too much time developing Spidey's past...
","Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone make a likable enough pair as the teens who find themselves in a heap of trouble once they learn that Dr. Curt Connors (who transforms himself into The Lizard), intends to make huge trouble for the unsuspecting denizens of the city.<br/><br/>It takes an hour for the story to start unwinding at a faster pace, once we learn about Spidey's parents leaving him to live with his Aunt May and Uncle Ben (Sally Fields and Martin Sheen). But once bitten by a spider, after a forbidden excursion to an experimental lab, the story leaves some of the character development behind and takes off once Spidey discovers his power of web flights and his ability to deal with school bullying.<br/><br/>Garfield never seems quite as vulnerable in the role as Tobey Maguire, but there's a sensitivity necessary for the more intimate scenes. He handles the action scenes well. Rhys Ifans does a commanding job of histrionics as the scientist whose regeneration of lost limbs transforms him into The Lizard, with spectacular effects.<br/><br/>James Horner's score is very effective at capturing all the thrills and excitement of magnificent photography and the special web effects are all any CGI fan could ask for, even when seen in 2D.<br/><br/>But there's an obvious discrepancy between the rather ordinary script and the magnificent special effects that will leave some disappointed that more time wasn't spent on the script itself furnishing a better story treatment.<br/><br/>The whole thing is stylishly directed (especially in the action scenes) by a director with the apt name of Marc Webb."
"rogerdarlington","Null","2","4","9 July 2012"," Another money-spinner swings into view
","It seems that the world can't get enough of super-heroes and it's a genre that I always find fun but, after three Spider-Man movies with Sam Raimi as director and Tobey Maguire in the arachnid persona and an interval of five years since the last film, it seems that it's time for a re-boot. So now Marc Webb (""(500) days Of Summer"") takes on the directorial duties and British actor Andrew Garfield (""The Social Network"") spins Peter Parker's webs and the storyline goes back to the beginning with a reprise of the spider-biting incident and the death of his uncle.<br/><br/>We have a new baddie in the guise of Rhys Ifans who, after his charming arrival in ""Notting Hill"" seems to have adopted the frequent role for British actors of being the unpleasant character in an American movie (see also ""The Five-Year Engagement""). At least Emma Stone, who was in ""Spider-Man 3"". has made progress with a larger role as Peter's girlfriend Gwen (who unfortunately has a police chief as a father). Even Spider- Man creator Stan Lee is back with his usual cameo (look out for the music teacher).<br/><br/>All involved - especially Garfield - acquit themselves well - and the special effects are fine (I saw the movie in its intended 3D), but there is really nothing new or special here. A short clip early on in the credits, however, makes it clear that a fifth episode of the money-spinning franchise is on the way."

"jimbo-53-186511","7","0","0","30 May 2020"," It's a lot of fun, but the silly story does let it down slightly
","I would normally write a short plot summary when opening a review, but there is quite a lot going on in the first hour of The Amazing Spider-Man so I'm finding it difficult to do this in a manner that is both short and concise. So I think I'll just skip that and give you some of my thoughts on the film...<br/><br/>Inevitably, this film is going to be compared to the original 2002 film starring Tobey Maguire and whilst in my opinion this version comes up a little bit short by comparison it is still a very entertaining film in it's own right...<br/><br/>I'll be honest with you I was really sold with the first hour where we have young Peter trying to find out what happens to his parents, wanting to learn about Connors research, tracking down the guy who killed his uncle and of course trying to bag the lovely Gwen Stacey. For the first hour this film is magnificent and the wonderful emotive and funny performance that Garfield gave in his portrayal of Spider-man really upped the ante making me genuinely believe that I was witnessing something truly special here. However...<br/><br/>Once we reach the second half of the film things weaken slightly; Connors decides to do a human trial on himself which goes wrong and turns him in to a crazy angry ass-kicking lizard. OK you could perhaps argue that the cross-species genetics went wrong which accounts for Connors psychotic rampages whilst he's in lizard mode, but to me it's a rather weak foundation to base a story upon particularly when it's one that has no real narrative rules. For example, Connors occasionally comes out of lizard mode and goes back to human mode, but with no explanation of how this is achieved. Its flimsy things like this that weaken the whole foundation of the film. Also Spider-man begins pursuing the man responsible for the murder of his uncle, but this pretty much gets forgotten about in the second half of the film for no apparent reason.<br/><br/>On the plus side though, I thought Garfield was amazing and personally I thought he was far more convincing than Maguire. He doesn't quite convince as well in his role as the dork as Maguire did (though I'm not necessarily sure that could be considered a compliment), but in the tough guy moments and in the emotive stakes he eclipses Maguire - one thing I also thought was funnier here were Spider-Man's vigilante moments which were almost conveyed in a Deadpool style comical way which was hilarious which I felt was achieved by a combination of Garfield's terrific acting and the wonderful humour employed by both the director and the screenwriter.<br/><br/>The acting was also top-notch; as I've said Garfield was quite literally amazing and blew the field apart. Emma Stone did an OK job (arguably a little more interesting than Mary Jane) and Martin Sheen and Sally Field (both very strong) were excellent in support.<br/><br/>The only other troubling thing I could think of was when Gwen rung Peter when he was in the sewer and the signal seemed to be crystal clear. Would a signal really be that good in a sewer? Also the disjointed and fragmented nature of the narrative takes some getting used to but it is a fun ride once you're on board.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong this is a great film and is very entertaining and Garfield puts in a superb performance, but if I'm totally honest the story is a bit daft (close to Spider-Man 3 daft), but it's executed so well by director Marc Webb and his team of screenwriters that you rarely have chance to give it a seconds thought. Sure it's a little dumb at times and falls short of the greatness of the 2002 film, but it is very entertaining."

First, unlike the film of the 2002, here is further explored why Peter has no parents and only teien his uncles, explain themselves better and there is more than one reason why Peter wants to be Spidey, which in the film of the 2002 was never well explained , this problem is solved, Peter, who is adapted from The Amazing comics, adapted well, but in a different way, since here Peter, instead of being a boy, who is doing badly with his classmates, here is more someone who wants to get away from the world , although it is forgivable, since in the same comics had friends like Gwen Stacy (who is a success in the film, as unlike MJ in the films of Raimi, here Gwen has more importance outside that is the love interest of Peter) MJ or Harry who did not begin a A good relationship with Peter, but over time it was getting better.
Meanwhile, the lizard/Curtis Connors was portrayed as a mediocre villain (like the Green Goblin who was a villain like mediocre form) because, well, Tégnicamente is not a villain because his same motives were not, but the solutions posed made to see Curtis A villain, not to mention that his motives are not very well explored.
The action is half disappeared, but is forgiven in bringing us a better plot and better character development is concerned, although the CGI used for action is slow, but makes sense and feels enjoyable and serves.
Meanwhile, the CGI used for the movie is Buenisimo (unlike the 2002 film, which was mediocre) combines well with the scenarios, are well positioned and although some scenes are re false (as when Parker is thrown into a building) but most Scenes are well positioned and excellently well worked.
While the OST, then, is half meh, unlike the 2002 that was more memorable, the OST of this film is not so memorable as in the saga of Raimi, but that goes that works for the scenes.
And Finally, the film has a slow pace to take an hour to better explain the character of Peter, why only have uncles and non-parents (although this is best used in the second) and why it should be Spider-Man.
The slow pace is forgiven for the aforementioned, Peter is better developed in this than in the 2002, (although when they killed his uncle, as much as this Peter and Raimi are well developed but Webb is better developed).
And in other circumstances, The relationship and Chemistry of Peter and Gwen in this film is better than Peter and MJ in Raimi, as apart from having better exploration in the characters, Gwen's father, Captain George Stacy, is the policeman who wants behind the bars the man Spider, making the relationship between these 2 difficult.
And when George dies in the hands of the Largarto in the final battle, for at least it makes sense, because George wants to protect his daughter in any way, even to tell Peter that promises him to take her out of his life (which Peter meets in this movie but Lamentablem It breaks in the second.
While with the performances, Andrew acts better to Peter as well as to Spider-Man, without making strange noises, until he studied the movement of the spiders to have a more realistic performance, and the truth if it feels that he is Spider-Man.
Meanwhile, Emma also does a good job as Gwen Stacy, as well as the rest of the film cast.
In short, it is better than Raimi alone for a little, many exaggerate that it is a bad film just because it is not his childhood or other nonsense, instead, is a good film that deserves more recognition.
3.5/5."

","This satisfied my fix for a marvel superhero film after watching Infinity War, went digging & found this. I'd always passed on Spider Man, gave it a shot & glad I did. Bonus that it stars Andrew Garfield, hooked on him ever since his performance in ""The Social Network"", he's terrific in this as well.<br/><br/>There's lots of action, enjoyed the lightness provided by humor, I've moved on from the grimmer ""Dark Knight"" films I used to go for. The romance between Garfield & Stone is sweet, and perfectly offset by a truly nasty villainous Lizard.<br/><br/>Learning poor Spidy's backstory was enjoyable as well. No mom & dad growing up but a big bonus having Sally Field & Martin Sheen for grandparents; they both play the roles really well.<br/><br/>The director's name is Webb ...guess I'm easily amused but that cracks me up."
"carrjudd","2","0","0","19 February 2019"," Really dissappointing
","My 15 tear-old son and I decided to watch this film last night as neither of us had seen it before. I didn't have high expectations but I was really dissapointed.
Overall it was just so flat. From the script to the music, direction, editing, lighting, and pacing.
I'm not sure where to start but I guess the script would make sense.
It's so boring. It's full of dull conversations between one-dimensional characters. Peter Parker is a bit of a jerk and almost every one he encounters is even worse. They are so badly written that I didn't feel anything for anyone. None of them seemed like real people. And it moves so slowly that my son and I were losing interest minutes into the film. And people's actions don't make sense. For instance, he stops a bad guy from beating up a woman in an alley. Then, for some reason, a whole bunch of bad guys start chasing him. They chase him over fences and onto rooftops. Really? Why? Do bad guys have such a strong bro code that they will push themselves to the limit and risk their lives just because some kid beat up some other bad guy? It doesn't make sense.
Then the film spends so much time on Peter's emotional relationship with his uncle and aunty. Who cares? It's a frickin' superhero movie.
It was about 90 minutes before he even put on the suit. And he's suddenly a master tailor? I couldn't make that suit in a year with all the resources in the world.
It's okay to be unrealistic in a superhero movie if it's a superhero movie. This was trying to be genuine and realistic but it was also silly.
I have to mention the cinematography. It was so dull and static. Again, it's a superhero/comic book movie. Don't shoot everything in static mid-shots. Use dramatic angles and lighting. There were some important conversations in the first half but they were shot and edited exactly the same as the non-important ones. It just all felt so flat.
I could go on but I'll just say we tried watching the whole thing but my son asked if we could stop it halfway through."
"josh_lambert1991","7","0","0","26 January 2019"," A bold move
","A bold move starting again telling the story from scratch with a new lead and Andrew Garfield plays both parts brilliantly. The story is decent and the support cast are great aswel. A move that has really paid off"
"punchp","10","0","0","13 January 2019"," It's a classic, and the attraction is not the surprise of the plot, but to see how it's done this time. The answer is: very smoothly.
","The Amazing Spider-Man reboot didn't arrive with the kind of media circus that the masked vigilante is accustomed to on the streets of NYC. Instead it quietly spun a solid, intricate plot in a corner left abandoned for the past five-years and waited patiently for the buzz to begin. Once word gets out, Marc Webb's Spidey will be swarmed: this is the spandex-clad saviour no one knew they needed.<br/><br/>Sure the quips aren't as quotable as The Avengers, or the action as big-balled and sprawling, but there's a real story there and an emotional trajectory that forces you to care. Happy 50th Birthday, Spider-Man. The Brit who got bit, actor Andrew Garfield, is superb as the skater boi meets science nerd turned webslinger. He starts out as an updated outsider, popping contact lenses until he stumbles upon his father's specs in a briefcase that propels him on a journey to discover the fate of his folks.<br/><br/>Square specs on and the high school image is complete, with Gwen Stacy (played by an endearing Emma Stone) making the opening act look straight from the pages of Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's own Amazing Spider-Man circa '65. Gwen is Peter Parker's intellectual equal, number one in her class if you ask her, excelling as his squeeze and making Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane appear shallow for falling for the hero first, boy second. ""I've been bitten,"" Peter tells a wide-eyed Gwen, ""Me too,"" comes the sincere reply.<br/><br/>Their first kiss succeeds in rivalling the memorable peanut smuggling, upside down antics of the Sam Raimi original and delivers a very real and passionate clinch (with webbing). You can practically hear the hormones firing and sparking. She's effortlessly likeable, a honey trap for fans that are bound to feel a creeping dread the deeper the character gets into the franchise. It's billed as the 'untold story' and manages to cover new ground whilst putting a fresh spin on the cornerstones of Spidey's origin. The radioactive arachnid lurks in a lab at Oscorp where Peter's search for the parentals winds up.<br/><br/>Here we're introduced to Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) who's working on a formula that can regrow limbs (including his own absent appendage) and ultimately make everyone equal. It's a noble ambition and one that easily gets out of control, fluidly slipping into danger territory once the experiment goes awry and he becomes a giant city lizard. Ifans plays the tragic antagonist with subtlety, teasing the would-be father figure role before his descent into full-blown, green tinged madness. This scientific development marks a huge breakthrough in villainy that leaves the Lokis of the world looking around wildly for a better excuse. The film is by no means flawless, though.<br/><br/>The CGI rendering of the Lizard really is as awful as you suspected it might be. Police Captain George Stacy sums up the incredulity we feel with a curt, ""Do I look like the mayor of Tokyo to you?"" You never quite believe the monster is there in the scene rather than in a computer and his booming voice is too over-the-top evil to be taken seriously. Step away from the microphone and snarl or something, Rhys.<br/><br/>There's also an unnecessary nod to the comics when he shrugs on the shredded lab coat for the final showdown and engages in fighting talk that teeters uncomfortably on cringe. Even Spidey's wisecracks misfire when he starts pounding on a car thief, kicking off a running commentary that Iron Man should have given him pointers on. Elsewhere, the script is much slicker and succeeds in spinning a yarn that will have you displaying genuine concern for the main players, and even the fate of some bit-part ones. Martin Sheen makes a wonderful Uncle Ben and he's given some great material to work with, whilst Sally Field's calm and confrontation-skirting Aunt May balances the guardian double act.<br/><br/>Much like the original venture, The Amazing Spider-Man takes its time developing the characters so that by the time Peter gets in his first sticky situation, you definitely give a damn. Incidentally, the scenes where his spidey senses kick in are some of the best in the film, adding humour that the Tobey Maguire version lacked as he grapples with his newfound super strength; slamming doors never looked so satisfying.<br/><br/>This reboot also corrects what irked so many the first time around: those web-shooters. True to the comics, Peter has manufactured his own artificial weapons loaded with super-strong adhesive. The fact they are artificial rather than organic also gives him a weakness, which every good superhero needs. The whole shebang was captured in stereoscopic 3D rather than a shoddy post-conversion and if any superhero was going to suit this medium, it was always going to be Spidey. He shoots from one corner of the screen to a truck to a crane leaving us suspended, 60-storeys up in downtown New York and in awe of the view.<br/><br/>The city makes an exhilarating backdrop for his urban ballet and seems much more grimy Gotham than The Daily Bugle's usual technicolour beat. Patriotic parades and daytime adventures are traded for back alley brawls, gunfire and those graffitied arachnids that form part of Spidey's viral marketing campaign, on and off film. Thanks to this stellar retelling, Andrew Garfield's spin will be going global."

","It was a good movie to watch. After watching The Amazing Spider-Man, I thought to myself: ""This could be the start of something great."" Sadly, it wasn't the case after what happened behind the scenes. The Amazing Spider-Man had all the ingredients to be one of the few successful remakes of any movie or franchise out there. I'd say that because, like I've already stated, the movie was a pretty good one. A new villain (Lizard) was good to see. One of the most popular spidey villains out there. Remember the Lizard well in the animated series shown on Fox Kids. The choice of cast was good too, so there was so much potential, but it just didn't live up to its mark since. But I really like the title: ""The Amazing Spider-Man."""

","I cant believe that some piece of human waste thinks he can re write spider man a well established trilogy with a piece of disrespectful distortion like this .this is the most sacrilegious movie I've ever seen peter parkers transformation has already been well established and cant be changed at the frivolous whimsy of an LSD fueled script writer you cant rewrite the past. once a time line hes been established it must be adhered to. you cant re write history this movie and every one associated with it should be burned in a public square as an an example for others ,this is yet another example of writers with absolutely no imagination trying to create something from the work of others they don't have the skill to work a more detailed back story into the history so they write a story that completely contradicts everything thing that has been written and hopes that we are stupid enough not to notice"

","The Amazing Spiderman is really a amazing but not that amazing compared to first spider-man. it is better on action sequence and the CGI but the story feels little bored.i only find more interesting on the movie is Lizard. lizard is the best choice for the movie and Rhys Ifans did really great job Andrew Garfield also did great job on the movie and Emma Stone is really incredible. i didn't care that re-making a movie spider-man 3 is already a messy but it didn't work as i expected. in drama it is excellent so on love story action was awesome and the story it didn't work that right.<br/><br/>i think it is the third best movie in the franchise after spider-man 1 and 2. what i mainly like on the movie why peter turned him into spider- man. it shows the early life of peter parker so, it ignores many things from the original and feels like incomplete."
"supermanflies","2","6","20","13 July 2012"," Some thoughts...
","Actually I rated this a 2 because I only read negative reviews, and am writing this for people like me. Don't let the critics fool you. This movie was awesome. I'd like to address some of the complaints I've read in those negative reviews. There was confusion about what happened to Peter's parents. Agreed. The scene with the kid in the burning car was unnecessarily long. Agreed. Can't say the music was awesome, because I don't remember noticing it. Agreed. But the movie's strengths, the acting, and the CGI were so spectacular that it's difficult to imagine someone finding fault with them. Casting was excellent. Didn't expect to like Emma Stone in this role, but she was a good fit. Also, I didn't expect there to be so much emotion. Had to pretend to scratch my face when I was actually wiping away tears (slick). I don't remember that kind of emotion in the first set of Spidey films. People have been complaining about the suit not being so skin tight; that it wasn't realistic. That actually makes it more realistic. How is it possible there would be no creases in the fabric? Peter was picked on in the beginning, but he wasn't a super-nerd in this film. It makes the romance more believable. Peter never found Uncle Ben's killer, but I realized that is OK. We know that the shooting was an accident, and the killer wasn't all bad because he gave Peter the milk he didn't have the money for. The audience can be OK that he isn't found and severely punished. Again, the CGI and acting were excellent. Can't wait for the next one. Go see this movie."
"maria-santos2010","10","6","20","30 June 2012"," Amazing
","The movie is too much I enjoyed watching the series is far superior films of Sam Raimi Peter Parker is much more faithful and the HQS Andrew Garfield is better than Tobey Maguire. The action is very good and fast and makes the film leaves us bored and not any time. The 3D is incredible I felt the film itself mainly when we are the first spider in person with the 3D glasses, the Lizard is very good for more look of it is a bit strange, I preferred him with a muzzle and evil, but in the middle of beating all you do not care for it it's scary all the same! Emma is great as Gwen. Anyway The Spectacular Spider-Man is the best super hero movie ever made!"
"Raj1010","1","7","25","16 July 2012"," Weakest, thin and skinny spider-man, ideally nowhere close to be called a superhero
","*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br/><br/>I heard negative reviews about this movie but being a huge fan of Spiderman I went with a positive mind. However, this movie shattered my image of powerful/superhero spider-man to a very humane and weak spider-man. Which it didn't suppose to be as we have lived with the the super hero image of his for years.<br/><br/>This is the weakest, thin and skinny spider-man to hit the screen. A normal person without powers like Jason Bourne could kill this skinny poor spider-man. The freaking captain of the police who fought just as good as spider-man had to save his life with a shot gun and his gf had to save him with the antidote. He has different hairstyle and not like the peter parker has in comics and earlier spider-man versions. Tobie was the best. He had to get the new artificial device for the web which earlier used to come out from spider-man's wrist. What a pity the lizard broke that instrument and that poor spider-man was helpless and he had nothing to swing when he was falling from the top of a tower in the last scene.<br/><br/>He was unmasked numerous times. He was handcuffed by cops. He couldn't jump over a small building like the real spider-man. You would notice that when he was running you will see his knee caps, what a pity. He needed cranes to swing which he could have done swinging over the building aside like the original spider-man....how embarrassing. He got beaten and bruised by normal people. He can't dodge bullets properly except that one time with the car thief.<br/><br/>I am disheartened with this poor skinny spider-man..."
"peterparkerspidey28","10","7","25","28 June 2012"," amazing
","The film was all the way amazing. Andrew portrayed Spider-Man extremely well. This new film gives us a better take on spider man. Growing up with spider man, I always knew what he was like, and this new film has a closer take to the comics. The romance was great as well, along with the action. The lizard was a great character as well. The effects were really well done. The 3d was actually worth it, and was of course well done. Emma stone portrayed the young miss Stacy well enough to make the viewers believe as if she came right out of the comics. This film was all the way amazing, and is a definite see. This shouldn't be compared to Avengers, or Dark Knight Rises, as its a film on its own. Some scenes made me feel as if I was actually spider man. The film is great for everyone of all ages. kids, teens, and adults."

"vip-danii","1","6","21","13 April 2013"," Unimpressed!
","What exactly was this? A remake? Or a prequel? Not clear.<br/><br/>First of all, who the hell remakes a 5 year old movie!? <br/><br/>It's acceptable to remake movies from the 70s, 80s, and even the 90s! But the original ""Spiderman"" franchise is only FIVE bloody years old! Come on! If it ain't broke, why fix it? <br/><br/>If it was meant as a prequel, then why are we seeing the same stuff we saw in the original, and why are all the characters so different? <br/><br/>I honestly have no idea what possessed these people to produce such crap. The original ""Spiderman"" was (and still is) 100 times better, and it's not REMOTELY old or outdated.<br/><br/>By the way... this is NOT an action movie; it's a chick-flick! Literally.<br/><br/>And what's with this annoying tendency to cast 30-year-olds to play teenagers? It's lame. Speaking of the actors, they couldn't have picked a worst set of amateurs. I don't even remember their names, and I hope they're going to retire from the movie industry sometime soon, because they have no business being in it.<br/><br/>The direction was seriously bad. Like I said before, it's NOT an action movie, but the VERY LITTLE action there is, is happening in total darkness, so you don't actually see it! Stupid and annoying! <br/><br/>This is NOT the real ""Spiderman""; it's a cheap imitation. Some pathetic 30-year-old wimp, pretending to be a teenager, is running around and getting beat up by regular folk? What an insult to ""Spiderman"" fans! <br/><br/>Oh, and why release this utter nonsense in 3D if 90% of the movie is in 2D? <br/><br/>This weak, useless, uninspired chick-flick was made for one reason only: to capitalize on the name of the ""Spiderman"" franchise and rip people (fans) off!<br/><br/>Shame on you!"
"omnipredator","1","6","21","20 October 2012"," Spiderman...(tries to) Begin
","...but where do I begin? I am sorry to say that I -had- to watch this film to the end only to see how much worse it might get but about 40 minutes in I realized it could not get any worse. In other words, it was a complete two hour waste of my time.<br/><br/>Spiderman is one of my favorite old school iconic super heroes and yet again they managed to destroy everything I came to love about the character. I say yet again because the previous 3 films, though a bit better overall, they still were no prize either. <br/><br/>I truly made an effort to try to understand this film but I did not manage. The acting is horrible and faceless, the action is too fast injecting me with the sensation that everything was crammed into a tiny cookie jar, the special effects are non existing and I share the belief that when you want to produce such a movie you should at least try to create some pleasing eye candy. Everything was convenient and extremely predictable, there is no time to get to know the characters none what so ever and all they did was to transform Spiderman into a faceless vigilante bent on getting revenge through his super actions for the death of his uncle (come to think of it, he was not faceless at all since he popped his mask every opportunity he got). Yes, Peter Parker learns to follow in his father's steps ""doing good and helping others"" but there is a story, a reason, emotions behind this, not raw, uncontrolled actions of a teenager and just a few seconds of incoherent lines referring to his wounded past. Also, on a technical note, the web wrist projectors reminded me of the wing lights on a small single engine airplane. <br/><br/>This is the fourth film in a row that screams ""help"" and I felt ever so disappointed while reading that there is second installment coming in 2014 and possibly a third. Of course, everything has to be a trilogy these days. I suppose its an easy way to kill time and make money. However, I fail to understand why the producers have to annihilate everything in the process. Since they plan it this way, they could i.e. build the characters in the first part (we would get to know them), in the second part they would mature with all their unique qualities and disadvantages (we would feel for them and support them in their decisions) and finally in the third part all hell would brake loose (we would fight with them, Good prevails and general Catharsis from everyone, maybe even a tear at the end). Throw in some action, SFX, good photography, a touch of slow motion, some drama and the end result would be far better than watching a ten hour movie squeezed into two. A wonderful example is the Dark Knight trilogy, directed by one of the geniuses of our time, Mr. Christopher Nolan. It was a trilogy of nail-biting suspense, exemplary character building, carefully planned special effects action and choreography without exceeding the limit between fantasy and nonsense. In fact it was so well done that I would not be the least surprised if I exited the theater and saw the Bat Tank strolling down the street and disappearing around the corner. That is the feeling I am longing for. Not to keep looking at my wrist watch.<br/><br/>To sum up, The Amazing Spiderman fails in every aspect. As a viewer of adventure films I have to express my utter disappointment and even sadness that a reboot could be so poorly executed. I express solely my point of view on the film and unfortunately, there is nothing Amazing about it."

","we all know the difference between spider-man and the amazing spider-man series but when the beginnings were so similar i couldn't help but wonder, whose idea was this? Granted, cast was better except of course the lead role spider-man. even the script was not good about his high school life and it only exhibits him as a spoiled child, still he can do justice the role of the spider-man but well he did not.

","I grew up with the original spider man story and I must claim ignorance of spider mans origins in the ultimate universe, so with that said, I am basing my whole critique on the original origin story. As far as the story line goes, this version is so completely off the mark, it does not even resemble spider man. The way he was bitten, by what, and how was not even recognizable. as a matter of fact, the whole movie was unrecognizable. This is why I am confused by the people who say that Raimi butchered the spider man story in the 3rd film (which I agree with) and then turn around and say this story was more in line with the comic? Someone please educate me if I am wrong. Gwen Stacy? No Mary Jane? bitten on the back of the neck? How Uncle Ben died? No wrestling? Flash Thompson trying to make friends with Peter? The whole story is WAY off. This is why I did not agree with a reboot, Do another spider man, skip the origin story and I would have bought it. I personally loved the effects but HATED the story..."

","I absolutely loved The Amazing Spider-Man and left the theater with a big grin of delight!<br/><br/>I found the Raimi films fun and mostly good (except for the third film's ridiculous musical montage), but I also found them flawed. In particular, I found the romance uneven and stilted in the first set of films. <br/><br/>That's why I was so pleased to know that the director of (500) Days of Summer was at the helm of this version - because he clearly knows how to do sweet and bittersweet romance. And he and his talented actors knocked it out of the park as far as I am concerned. <br/><br/>Spider-Man was my favorite superhero growing up. I've been a fan since I was able to hold a comic in my tiny hands and for as long as I can remember. I enjoyed the Raimi versions and was glad to see Spidey on the screen, but Marc Webb's version absolutely nails the characters and the relationships and the overall flavor of Spider-Man, and the actors all sold it.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield embodies Peter Parker/Spider-Man. He is absolutely stellar. Emma Stone is great as Gwen Stacey, and these two leads deliver a thoroughly natural chemistry. All the other actors are solid in their supporting roles, and Marc Webb keeps it all feeling smooth, believable, and true to the spirit of the Spider-Man comics.<br/><br/>The visuals are delightful and the 3D is used to enhance - not distract. It should definitely be seen in theaters!"
"Max_cartel","10","4","12","4 July 2012"," AMAZING spiderman
","This film is the reason for the phrase 're-boot'!<br/><br/>Now I must start by saying I did not hate the original spiderman films and in fact still Think they are great iconic superhero films.<br/><br/>That being said this new addition adds a great deal of emotional depth to Peter Parker and the spiderman franchise in general. So many people complain that the character has become weaker, but what everyone has to realise is, this is about a young adult who is only just becoming aware of his new powers and how to use them. Not only that but he is still trying to find his place in this world and battling many emotions such as love and revenge. How many of us can say we were fully established as the people we are now at such a young age?<br/><br/>I feel the film also does a great job of showing just how hard it actually is to be a superhero by showing the injuries to Peter and how the city gets behind him to help him. (one of my favourite concepts of the spiderman comics). Admittedly also showcased in spiderman 2.<br/><br/>In my opinion this film has added a great amount of story to this franchise and has planted the seed for many great epic sequels to come.<br/><br/>I would just like to add that all the naysayers of this film complaining about many scenes being similar to the first film seem to be talking out their...... This film Is greatly different! There are a few similar scenes but then how many ways can you think of to say he was bitten by a radioactive spider and his uncle dies??? Really!!"

Again, heroism brand of spider-man focus on his relationship to his family, friends and peers, and of course our superhero is one-hell of a lover-boy; new love interest which an ingredient of fresh story and is a sample exploits an untold story which I think the major flaw of the movie because it doesn't elaborates the secret behind his parents death which I hope can be lighten to us the next spidey-movie.<br/><br/>Overall, Andrew was great to replicate what Tobey done and Emma and other cast were good. The story maybe a shadow of the Sam Raimi's Spider-Man Franchise but is still effective enough to let you bite. Action and web-slinging choreography and other visual effects were great even the background music, especially Coldplay's ""Till Kingdom Come"" track.<br/><br/>In case you were wondering how did I rate my favorite Comic Movies, here it is; (my opinion only)<br/><br/>The Dark Knight - 10/10 Batman Begins - 9.5/10 Spiderman 2 - 9.0/10 Kick Ass - 8.9/10 X-Men First Class - 8.9/10 The Avengers - 8.6/10 The Amazing Spiderman - 8.6/10 X2 - 8.5/10 Iron Man - 8.5/10<br/><br/>So far thats my Top 9 Comic Movie of all time. And I do hope The Dark Knight Rises can live to its reputation because I reserve a slot for it."

","When I initially heard about this reboot, I was skeptical. Why make them again so soon? When I was little, the Spider-Man movies came out and those were the first superhero movies I ever watched. I loved them. However, as I got older, I realized that much of what makes up those movies was quite cheesy, particularly Tobey Maguire's portrayal of Peter Parker. But this is not a review of those. I am reviewing the new and improved ""amazing"" Spider-Man. And I am pleased to say that it was surprisingly well done and very worthwhile. What was really missing from the previous installments was that level of darkness and threat that is present here. This film offers a dark, fresh new take on the traditional Spider-Man that I think you will enjoy. The characters are more engaging and more developed. I don't have much to say about this is terms of complaints. It is a refreshing, enjoyable piece of entertainment. Also, in all of Stan Lee's cameo appearance, I think this one is my favorite."

","My review will be short. I don't have so many things to say, because it's a great movie, and I only write big reviews for bad movies. I'm a huge Spider Man fan, and I liked the other 3 movies of the franchise. Now, lets just face it: New story, new actors. Andrew Garfield is really good, and Emma Stone is adorable. Is the hero that we wanted to see, the hardcore hero of the comics. He's still nerd, but he is cool, funny and kinda hipster. <br/><br/>You will not regret. You really like the Spider Man franchise ?

","I have seen the film twice in order to create a good, honest review of the film. If you want to avoid the analysis, skip to the overall consensus.<br/><br/>I found myself praying, just before the movie started, that it would not be a let down. Spider-Man is my hero and has never failed to entertain me. yes, I even loved the third one. I was pleasantly surprised at how drastic Marc Webb had changed it. Peter Parker, who is played by the talented Andrew Garfield, does an amazing job as peter parker. This peter is darker, smarter and edgier than the Peter we had seen by Tobey. Also, Gwen Stacy, played by Emma Stone, was the perfect choice. The scene that really defines the film, in my opinion, is the rooftop. When peter shoots the web at Gwen and pulls her to him, her exasperated look combined with James Horner's brilliant score made me tear up slightly. It was beautiful. The action scenes, even though they were scarce, were tantalizing. They were crisply shot and edited. The best fight in the film took place at Parker's School. Watching the fight was like watching a comic book page come to life right in front of you.<br/><br/>Overall Consensus: The Amazing Spider-Man is, by far, one of the best reboots Hollywood has churned during a time when the word reboot was almost a curse word. The film is thoughtful, engaging, dark and mysterious but will definitely leave you wanting more."
"kylspe","10","3","8","18 July 2012"," The Amazing Spider-Man was a great movie.
","The Amazing Spider-Man was an amazing movie because of the actors and actresses, Andrew Garfield played a really great role as being Spider-Man and Emma Stone played a great role by being by Spider-Man's side and helping him when he needed it the most. They both really helped each other in the movie. And I think they are an excellent pair to work with. If you are someone who really likes and enjoys Spider-Man movies you know there is always a villain, The villain in the movie is fantastic, the visual effects that the directors and producers use to make the villain really make it seem real. In some movies I see the visual effects of a villain or a monster seem fake to me, but in The Amazing Spider-Man it definitely seems real.<br/><br/>I am only 14 years old and I really like Spider-Man movies."
"pij_ruleroftheworld","10","3","8","16 July 2012"," A fantastic watch
","*WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* I'm going to level with you all. I probably would have given this 10/10 even if it was terrible, such is my love for Spiderman. Happily, this film is not terrible and so I feel like I can justify the rating.<br/><br/>Firstly, Andrew Garfield is superb as Peter Parker. Maybe a bit too good looking, but definitely brilliant. His performance is magnificent which allows us to see an emotional side of Parker that we haven't seen before. Add to this his brilliant sense of humour and this movie is on to a winner. Emma Stone is great as Gwen Stacy. I know we're not supposed to compare this reboot to the old trilogy but it's inevitably going to happen so let's get to it. Kirsten Dunst IS Mary-Jane. That's it. No-one will be able to do that part justice. Which is why I'm glad the filmmakers opted for Gwen as Peter's love interest. And Emma Stone plays her really nicely. Denis Leary is superb as Captain Stacy and Rhys Ifans captures the vulnerability and ambition of Dr Connors really well. The cast really impressed me.<br/><br/>The effects are really nicely seamed into the movie. You can tell that most of it is done with live action and the effects just add to the whole atmosphere of the film. I watched it in 3D and I have to say that (despite me not being a huge 3D fan) I liked it, mainly because it didn't seem forced.<br/><br/>This film is a real winner for me. We get to see why Peter decides to embrace his alter ego and how it affects him emotionally as well as physically. I really hope they make this reboot into a series of films because it has so much potential."

","OK, if you are wondering why they made another spider-man movie, there is actually no concrete answer. The story is mostly same and there is no amazing fight scene or whatsoever that could make this movie or the spider-man character amazing. So if anything at all, you can call this movie as the pointless spider-man. I am sick of watching remakes of great movies. Just that you can shoot the movie in 3D (and the 3D of this movie was the worst I have ever seen) doesn't mean you should make another movie. I mean it, I don't want to pay to see the same things over and over anymore. Here is my grading for this movie. -1 for the originality, -1 for the acting, -2 for the super super bad 3D."

It's suitable for the whole family to watch, and I truly hope that there's more Spider-man films to come, because everyone has been filled with action throughout, ever when there's not really any bad-guys there at the time.

"simoaussie","4","3","8","9 July 2012"," The AMAZING SPIDER MAN: Another great Spiderman? Or a New Spiderman?
","I was very excited about this coming title. Indeed, I am a big spider man fan and I was reading its comics when I was a kid. Therefore, I loved the first 3 chapters. They made me feel like a kid again. I loved very much how spider man was presented, i.e just like in the comic book: Very shy, sensitive,humble, a bit confused, a sort of looser and very much oppressed by his boss. He also had very complex relationship with Mary Jane. There was also a strong and mixed friendship with Harry...So a very lovable and king person, with gentle character, high morals and excellent attitude. A model for kids, and even adults :) All of that is what made me love spider man, above the super hero and super powers. And I believe it is the reason for its success above super hero fans public. He felt like a real guy, with real problems, and a real life. Someone everyone feels attached and emotional about. His love story made many frustrated when he couldn't face his lover, and finally relieved when he did. So I am a real spider man lover, and I should have loved this new movie as much as I did with the others.<br/><br/>So with this ""new"" spider man, I was wondering what would be new about it? I expected amazing 3D, and being transported another time in the complexity of Peter Parker's life. But what a shock! Peter Parker was turned into a confident high school teenager,and quite good looking I must confess (Better than the previous one I suppose). He has no job, no friends except his future girl friend. Also, the story seemed to have somehow changed, and this teenager is trying to find out more about his parents. Basically,this new movie has kept the ""spider man"" basics to make up a new whole spider man, lacking of character, humor, depth. There was not a moment where I heard anyone laughing at the cinema, whereas the original spider man always attracted a lot of laughter, especially with his boss. In fact, I felt it was a NEW spider man for a new generation of kids, aged 7-14 to make it look closer to their life interests and to help sell more merchandise. Indeed, the new spider man is in high school (almost an adult for the age categories mentioned above) and displays more his gadgets than the previous one. These are clearly identified in this movie, so the kids can get them in the shops. This new hero is good looking with a winner look and attitude, he is what we can call "" cool"", exactly the opposite of the genuine spider man. He shows off when he is angry, beats his friends at school, mocks the police, and displays a lot of arrogance. To me, it is nothing like the spider man I know.<br/><br/>To come back to this new movie, the transformation into spider man has been shortened to few min in the subway, probably a cut in the editing to make the movie shorter. His uncle was also killed very quickly and his deep love to his aunt was barely showed, or at least not enough. His love for Mary Jane looked more like an attraction and admiration for someone out of his league. It was almost the case in the original spider man, but she was his neighbor and they grew up together. So there was a real connection and emotion between them, mixed with their trio friendship.<br/><br/>The only positive point of this movie is it is obviously taking advantage of the new computers capabilities, rendering a much better appearance and action scenes. But still, the 3D was the slightly enhanced 3D most new movies offer, nothing like the magnificent 3D superman was given. Indeed, Spider man is one of these movies where you could demonstrate new and maximum 3D capabilities. I was expecting break through in 3D, but instead the action scenes were kept to the minimum, probably covering 10% of the movie length.<br/><br/>To resume, the new amazing spider man is a set up for a new hero, with similar background than the original spider man. But it represents to me a transformation of the story making the character superficial, impulsive, lacking of emotions, which could match better kids and teenager-to-come ideals and taste. I don't believe any grown up or genuine spider man fan would fall under the spell of this new spider man. Just too simple and not deep enough. Now, many younger viewers who don't know spider man or who haven't read the comics may still find it is an ""Ok""or even a good movie. And this is what the producers are tabling on: creating a new hero to suit better a new generation needs. Is it though really necessary? As the fundamentals and moral principles are still unchanged, and I believe there was no need to spoil a great story and a super hero with character into a good looking orphan teenager with super powers and the respect of his entire school.<br/><br/>All other super hero movies kept the original spirit, including the latest avengers where nothing needed to be changed to make of it a block buster. I heard they are already preparing a second opus...maybe they should make it a ""lego"" one...At last, people would know who it is really meant for."

","I absolutely loved this movie! Every actor and actress in this movie did a really great job. Andrew Garfield makes a great Spider Man and Emma Stone does a great job as Gwen Stacy. Rhys Ifans was good as the Lizard and as Dr. Connors. Sally Field, Denis Leary, and Martin Sheen all played very well in their roles. The Amazing Spider Man makes the first three look even worse than I thought they were before. I loved almost everything about this movie. There's only one thing that I didn't love about it. They made the origin story very long. It was a pretty long movie because of this, but everything was very enjoyable. Everything in the movie contributed to the overall story. I think anyone would love this movie. I love comic books and comic movies and most action movies. I took my girlfriend who only likes comedy and horror movies and she enjoyed most of this movie which I wasn't expecting. So if you want to go see a really fun, exciting movie with a good story and good action, go see The Amazing Spider Man. It's definitely worth it!"
"canadiannuts","10","3","8","7 July 2012"," Incredible in all genres. Great action, romance, drama, and effects.
","the original Spiderman series really set the bar for superhero movies. Some people say the dark knight raised it. The Amazing Spiderman rips the bar off and ate it for breakfast. The movie is unbelievably fantastic from start to finish. The setups are not distracting, but not overlooked either. They tie in to later events, and really pull you into the story. There is never a dull moment, with action, suspense, romance, or breathtaking visual images in every scene. I went to the theater expecting a decent flick, one that might think of rivaling the original, as a nice set-up to the dark night rises in a few weeks. My mind was completely blown, and now I'm wondering if batman better watch his back. The Dark Knight really changed the way people looked at superheros, and The Avengers further cemented that belief, but The Amazing Spiderman proves that it can definitely contest those two. The Dark Knight Rises better watch its back, because The Amazing Spiderman takes viewers for an exciting ride, and believe it or not, really has a chance of being the blockbuster of the summer."
"jai_gibson","10","3","8","7 July 2012"," Emotional Depth and Brilliant Entertainment
","I saw this today for the first time and I absolutely loved this film. I grew up with the comics and hand on heart, I can honestly say that this is a truly great film (for both geeks and regular cinema goers!) and one that is far more faithful to the Spidey universe than Raimi's version ever was. Sure, Raimi's was more accurate with the origin story, but when it comes to characters, this one has it spot on and is the comic come to life. Webb's new version manages to be both exciting and truly affecting. It has an emotional depth unlike a lot of similar genre films and is really quite an adult take on Spider-Man. It wisely takes the time to establish the characters and by the time the action starts, you're truly invested and care about the story and Peter. I'll be honest with you, the villain could have been better (although Rhys is great as Connors) and like Raimi's goblin design, could have done with a little bit more thought, and yes a giant lizard running around New York does jar with the new 'realism' aspect Webb has introduced, but these are minor quibbles when the overall package really is fantastic. Anyone going to see this just to see CGI fights (yes Michael Bay fans, I'm talking to you!) will likely be disappointed. But if you favour character and acting over spectacle (although it does have some fantastic effects and set pieces) this is for you. To give you and an example of the type of film this is, both the Guardian and Radio 4 gave this 4 out of 5 stars. Thats unheard of for a film like this!! I can't wait for the sequel. Bring it on!"

","Upon entering the cinema i was hoping for an experience much like the Avengers. I was optimistic and enthusiastic, yearning for a thrilling movie experience.But unfortunately, i was immensely disappointed. The movie was nothing out of the ordinary really, no scenes exhibited that enthralling factor which movies like The Dark knight are known for. The Amazing Spiderman represents a movie that promised so much yet delivered so very little. Since i haven't read any of the comics, its hard for me to understand what the comic readers are going on about.They say that The Amazing Spiderman stays true to the comic and that it is how the earlier Spiderman movies should have been portrayed from the commencement. The performance by Andrew Garfield was commendable, what with the myriad intensely emotional scenes scattered across the film. His acting was accurate,believable and deserved of ample praise.<br/><br/>The movie dragged on for large periods, making me feel restless and impatient. By the end it felt so thoroughly anticlimactic and mundane that i couldn't help but fiddle about with my cell phone.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spiderman, although having some real impressive moments in between, does not deserve a spot amongst the truly great superhero films.The film acts like a reality check for those eagerly awaiting the release of The Dark Knight Rises ; we don't always get what we expect."

The weakest part of the 2002 movie was the cast, and especially Kristen Dunst. This was a great movie. The cast was spot on. The chemistry between Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield was terrific. The story was great and had a good balance for a superhero movie of action and dialog. There are a few weak points but after all it is a comic book. This was not related in any way to the origin story told in 2002, but for fans of Spiderman this version stays true to the essence that we know and love. Marvel has been on fire recently. They are doing a great job translating their stories to the big screen and this was no exception. I look forward to the next chapter."

"KineticSeoul","6","3","8","5 July 2012"," My biggest disappointment at the movies this summer
","Now I ain't a big fan of Sam Raimi's version of ""Spider-Man"" it just wasn't that consistent with the comic books or even stayed all that close to the comic books all that much. This one decides to go in a more cool and realistic direction but that seemed to be the main focus of it all without much emphasis on making a entertaining movie with a better script. I liked how makers of this movie tried to modernize everything in today's standard, thus not making the movie all cheesy and stuff like Sam Raimi's version. Like for instance Peter Parker(Andrew Garfield) is a nerd like how Peter Parker is suppose to be but he isn't portrayed as one of those stereotypical nerds. Instead he is one of those quite nerds that is very quite lack confidence in many areas and always sits in the back to the point of almost never getting noticed. What was the most disappointing is how lacking it is, in character development and the bonding elements in this movie. Marc Webb's only full feature movie besides this one is ""500 Days of Summer"" which was a well made romance/relationship movie. But the chemistry between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy(Emma Stone) isn't well developed. Sometimes it's just not close to being believable at all. In fact it's really inconsistent yeah it's playful but inconsistent. I kept wondering what really linked these two characters together. Even Peter Parker's bond between Uncle Ben(Martin Sheen) is just weak and not enough bonding time went into it. When the main reason why Peter Parker became Spider-Man is because of Uncle Ben. Even Peter Parker isn't all that likable in this movie, so he is going through some traumatic time in his life. But people around the world is going through so much worse. Now Spider-Man is known for being a superhero that taunts and humiliates his foes and I was expecting him to do that quite a bit in this. And wanted to laugh or at least be amused by his one liners but there isn't much of that here. Maybe it's because he is just getting use to his powers in this one, but was still sort of disappointing. When they marketed this movie to the public it tries to go in some untold secret, but there really isn't anything like that in this. Nothing that will throw the audience off in a good way or anything like that. Now I didn't like Sam Raimi's version of ""Spider-Man"" all that much, it's was just so darn cheesy sometimes and doesn't connect with the comics all that much but it was still enjoyable and entertaining. Now some reviewers claim this reboot is better than all the Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man"" combined and that is a overstatement in my opinion. This is a darker cooler and more modernized version of ""Spider-Man"" but it sure does have it's flaws. Now when it comes to the Spider-Man fight sequences it's really realistic, especially with the movement of Spider-Man and all. It really felt like your watching a webslinger in action sort of. The physics and movements seemed like your actually watching a guy in a suit moving although it's CGI. The fight scene with Spider-Man and The Lizard was cool and sort of reminded me of the fight in ""Ultimate Spider-Man"" although that was against the Green Goblin. The casting choices is good Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone is alright although there are other actors and actresses that might have done a better job that I can think of. But Rhys Ifans was perfect for the role Dr. Curt Connors and Denis Leary was right on target with the role of Captain Stacy. Overall this isn't a terrible Spider-Man movie, much better than ""Spider-Man 3"" for sure. It almost seemed like they tried to be different just for the sake of being different between the past ""Spider-Man"" movies. Which is understandable, but it just seemed they were really forcing it. I really wanted to enjoy this movie, in fact Spider-Man is one of my favorite superhero but this was kinda disappointing. ""Spider-Man 2"" is still the best Spider-Man movie so far.<br/><br/>6.8/10"
"edwbur","6","3","8","3 July 2012"," an improvement, but still not good enough
","first spider man movie. OK second spider man movie. good third spider man movie. bad fourth spider man movie, the reboot the amazing spider man was better then the third, better then the first, but still nothing to get all excited about. to be fair this movie had a lot of hype and the pressure certainly hit a lot of the cast and crew. especially Andrew Garfield. he is really the only person who plays a main character from the other films. the lead role. and if he doesn't do good, the movie fails because it centers around spider man. but Andrew Garfield topped Tobey Maguire performance by a long shot. Tobey Maguire to me in some ways was like the Adam west to spider man. very kid friendly, and hes not intimidating. Andrew Garfield it much darker and can be taken more seriously, mainly because he is surrounded by a darker area and has a better script. i like how they put Gwen Stacy as the love interest because she was the first love interest and i wont say what, but her story ends very dark, which will lead to a even darker sequel with a much more darker villain. the villain curt Connors I've been waiting for in the raimi series. they gave Connors a lot of development but never went anywhere. this one i think they put him in there with you supposed to know who he is from the raimi films. but the actor that played him very well. veteran actors martin sheen and sally field do great in there roles as uncle Ben and aunt may and bring some maturity to the cast. and Stan lee of course makes an appearance. now this movie said it would be closer to the comics. in some respects they were but there was a lot missing and no doubt this spider man could not keep his identity secret. the story is strong but it seems rushed towards the end. they refer to Norman Osbourne a lot in this film, but technically doesn't make one appearance and the reason i said technically is because the clip after the credits were Connors is talking to someone may or may not be Norman. but this movie couldn't live up to the hype and it was a lot of hype and i guess people that like the film can use too much hype as an excuse but if the dark knight rises is good, that has massive hype and if it lives up to the hype that excuse goes out the window. again a movie worth checking out, but not to rush to see. i say see it, but no hurry. see it"
"marcuserenberger","8","3","8","3 July 2012"," ""A Marvelous Spider-Man""
","Marc Webb's ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a well rounded film that captures everything you'd expect from a Marvel story line and a Spider- Man film as well. It had everything you want from a Marvel film including: romance, comedy, action, and fun. Some reviewers have criticized this films over-use of the romance element, but I personally enjoyed this aspect.We must not forget that Spider-Man is in high school and romance is undoubtedly a pivotal part in the mask vigilante's comic book presence as well. Most importantly this movie is FUN and I never found myself bored at any point. In fact some of the scenes are so visually phenomenal that you are left in shear amazement. For a two-hour long film, it feels slightly rushed but that's what adds to the constant excitement.<br/><br/>The actors were phenomenal in almost every area. Andrew Garfield completely embodies the Peter Parker/Spider-Man persona perfectly. I can't say that I was shocked because he really took this role as an honor and was very dedicated to embracing the character. Emma Stone is equally as great in her role as Gwen Stacy and you will not be disappointed. Generally I'm not huge on Emma Stone, but I absolutely adored and bought into her character throughout the duration of this film. The only character I was slightly turned off of was Sally Field as Aunt May. She wasn't necessarily bad, there was just something about Sally Field's portrayal of Aunt May that was slightly unsatisfying. Rhys Ifans as Dr. Curt Connors/The Lizard was an excellent selection and you'll find that he is a viable good guy and bad guy simultaneously. His story line isn't really explored enough for my taste, but that's a matter of my personal opinion. <br/><br/>Ultimately, I noticed that if you go into this film trying to compare it to the 2002 series you're going to be overly critical of ""The Amazing Spider-Man."" That being said, in comparison to the old series I felt this one was far more visually pleasing and the overall tone of the film was much more gripping. Andrew Garfield exceeds Tobey Maguire as the masked superhero and he portrays the character better in almost every way. This movie may seem rushed or overly fast-paced for some because Marc Webb didn't want to over-state plot-points that had already been used in the previous trilogy.<br/><br/>Don't allow others to manipulate your view of the movie before you enter the film. If you go in with an open mind and are prepared to have a good time, I guarantee you will not be disappointed!"

She and Garfield had a perfect chemistry on screen.<br/><br/>Finally, the movie itself was beautiful and tear jerking. I almost cried a couple of times.

","This is some of the rare moments that new movie is shown a step ahead of the US. Benefit from the young crew, this reboot is refreshing and much more energetic / light-hearted. On visual effects side, this is perhaps the best 3D among all recent titles -- the scenes are not dimmed with 3D effects. The swinging scenes are sharp and not too fast (that you can catch up and appreciate). One tip - as usual - don't sit too close to the screen. That said, the view time is a bit too long, I don't mind to cut it short by 5 to 10 minutes. Honestly, some of the scenes are a bit slow and can be removed. In short, this is a movie you need to view in theater because many of the frames are packed with color and details, and definitely, the swings are a lot more powerful in big screen."

","Yes its amazing. Introducing Spidy again was difficult when we have already seen him in action over the past few years. Marc Webb has done a superb job in setting the storyline. Andrew Garfield did a good job in new avatar. Emma Stone looked cute playing Gwen Stacy. Dr. Curt Connors was really a bad-ass villain. The movie had a humour which was great . Good action sequences, not at all boring. The Movie is a must watch for all the Spiderman fans. One thing which i am still thinking is for whom was Rajit Ratha(Irrfan Khan)working. Now we have spidy back in new style lets wait for his next encounter with is new enemy. Who will it be, The Chameleon or The Vulture or The Jackal or Mysterio or Electro or J. Jonah Jameson."
"bhaveshbhatia","8","3","8","1 July 2012"," Old wine in a brand new 3D bottle!
","""With great power comes great responsibility"". These were the words of advice for young Peter Parker by his Uncle Ben. After looking at the Marc Webb's latest flick, The Amazing Spiderman 3D, we understand that he too have the same advice in mind. The expectations that were already set by Toby Maguire as Spiderman and Sam Raimi as the director of the previous Spiderman trilogy had to be reached, if not exceeded. Let us not even compare. Let's try to find out whether the duo of Andrew Garfield as the new Spiderman and Mark Webb excel in terms of the hype that was created for promotion of the movie.<br/><br/>It is for sure that Marc Webb had to recreate the magic that was created a few years back by Sam Raimi. Only time will tell whether he has been successful in his venture or not. However it can be said that this time the viewers are in for more. This time the story does not start from where Peter was bitten by a genetically engineered spider. We get to see Peter's parents as well and are made aware of the reason why Peter and his parents are not together.<br/><br/>Besides this, we also see crime rising in the city of New York. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy (Peter's first Girlfriend) is quite a handful. Andrew and Emma together have taken the emotional degree of the movie to new heights. And Gwen is not naïve and soft hearted girl as Mary-Jane Watson. She doesn't think twice to land a punch or two towards the bad guys.<br/><br/>Next comes Dr. Curt (Jekyll) Connors, a character played by Rhys Ifans. He shares an equal screen presence with the Spiderman and his alter-ego Peter Parker.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield fits perfectly in the Spidey-suit and also brings out the helplessness of his alter-ego Peter Parker. This time though, Peter Parker has a comic touch to his character.<br/><br/>Whether you will call Irrfan Khan's role in the movie as meaty or a promotional stunt is up to you.<br/><br/>One thing that can be assured is that this movie is a visual treat. Let's see whether The Amazing Spiderman 3D is able to bring a new outlook to the superhero genre."
"uberlist","2","6","22","9 July 2012"," I don't blame the actors
","====May Contain 'General' Spoilers===== I don't blame the actors for this letdown. It was really the script. The storyline was all over the place. There was no explanation about why his parents were important. His origin, their origin, nada. He just cried a few times when they were mentioned. The only thing you come away knowing is his father was a scientist that worked at Oscorp and abandoned him. Based on the commercials, there seemed like there was going to be a completely new door opened on how peter parker came to be (I think in one commercial the villain was asking rhetorically ""you thought this was an accident??"". I don't even recall that line being stated in the movie at all.) <br/><br/>So there was no 'Untold Story', which I thought was the point of this movie. It was just a remix of the same story with a different villain. And the special effects were NOTHING to write home about. <br/><br/>Basically if you saw the previous Spiderman, you already saw this one."

The Spidey Franchise was Re-Booted from 10 years ago, not 40. That means dang near everyone in the audience has probably seen the other iterations. So Dragging out in part of the Love story, or awakening story was a mistake.<br/><br/>Actors: Overall the Acting was good, but there were some extremely Corny lines, that their good acting covered up.<br/><br/>Visuals: Spidey Looked great, the sets looked great, but the Lizards, and the Lizard looked terrible.<br/><br/>Story: Love story was forced, Plot was Juvenile, the talking while spider man was fighting was terrible. <br/><br/>Action: How could you ruin the action of a Genetically created 8 Foot Lizard, fighting a Genetically created teen endowed with the strength of a spider....I don't know but they did.<br/><br/>In Closing I thought this was going to be a great movie for the summer after classics this year such as Prometheus, and the Avengers. It did not live up to those standards. once the word of mouth is out about how bad this movie is it will not break 100 million domestically."
"jsmclean01","8","6","22","25 June 2012"," A New Spin on a (Not So) Old Friend...
","I recently attended a preview screening for The Amazing Spider-Man, and it was, without a doubt, an excellent (re-)interpretation of Spider-man's origins. Yet, after the film, I overheard a number of people comparing it to Sam Raimi's ""original"" trilogy. It's as if by saying that they enjoy this film, people feel they are somehow ""betraying"" the memory of Raimi's trilogy, which is, of course, nonsense.I love Raimi's efforts, and include Spider-man 2 as one of my favorite (not just superhero) films, but to compare them, particularly in either positive or negative terms, would be, to my mind at least, completely pointless. The Amazing Spider-man stands firmly on its own, yet it could just as easily be placed right alongside Raimi's films, as it in many ways, complements them. I have also read, with interest, a couple of reviews citing thematic similarities between The Amazing Spider-man and the Twilight saga, which is just plain ridiculous. After all, I don't recall seeing Gwen pull a Bella and lock herself in her bedroom for six months (or was it a year? I forget) after her last conversation with Peter, do you? As for those that have ""reviewed"" the film without even seeing it, well, the less said the better.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield's portrayal of Peter Parker/Spider-man was just brilliant, his is a character you can empathize with and cheer for, and it was refreshing to see him display some heroic qualities even before he is given his powers by the not-so incy wincy spider. Emma Stone showed great humanity as Gwen Stacy. Sassy, funny and fiercely intelligent, she was an inspired choice to play Spidey's first love. Rhys Ifans was suitably conflicted as Spidey's nemesis. I was also thankful that Dr Connors went through an organic, therefore literal, transformation into the creature, it makes me look forward to seeing how the filmmakers portray other members of Spidey's ""rogues gallery"" in the future. I would have loved to have seen more of Uncle Ben, because, well, Martin Sheen is just awesome. Sally Field gives us an Aunt May that epitomizes the saying ""still waters run deep"". She is quietly dignified, and also strangely accepting of the, very traumatic, changes happening around her, particularly when she witnesses, first-hand, the very real consequences to Peter following his new status as both a superhero, and designated vigilante.<br/><br/>For me, what made the story of this particular Spider-man so interesting, was not what was put in the film, but what was left out. I won't spoil it for those that haven't seen it (yet) but part of the appeal of this incarnation of our favorite web-slinger, is that the film leaves out some of the very (canonical) elements that we, as an audience, expect to see in a ""traditional"" Spidey film, and that's what I loved about it. The filmmakers haven't pandered to what we thought we should (and perhaps feel entitled to) see, but have instead given us something that, like this version of Peter Parker himself, is both familiar, and yet completely new at the same time. It subverted my expectations whilst also satisfying those that I already had when I entered the cinema. Because of this experience, I left the film both surprised and elated, with my mind already running through what may, or may not, happen in the next installment. The Amazing Spider-man feels like it is one part of a greater story, and I, for one, eagerly await the next chapter.<br/><br/>There is a lot in The Amazing Spider-man to enjoy, for fans of Raimi's trilogy, to readers of the comics (of which I count myself as one) as well as cinema goers in general. I wont go so far as saying that there's something here for everyone, because that's just wishful thinking. What I will say is this, if you leave your ideas of what a Spider-man film should, or should not, be (or even what has been) at the door, there is a lot to savor, appreciate and even marvel at, in this interpretation of one of our most iconic characters."

","The amazing Spider-man was not so amazing after all. The story is different yet not so different from the Sam Raimi version and that's why till now I don't understand the point of rebooting it. I read some posh reviews, probably written by pretentious critics who never read a comic in their life and think that all Superhero movies should be dark and gloomy to be good . They all give this movie the thumbs up. This movie is alright, but it is nothing special. I also felt that the creators did not get the essence of Spiderman , the key message ""With great power there must also come—great responsibility!"" In this version the character did not learn from his mistakes and did not act responsibly. <br/><br/>As for the movie itself I thought the acting was sketchy, the characters undeveloped and the action lacking. The script was weak and all the cool parts were rushed. On the other hand all the unnecessary parts dragged to the extent of getting boring. Unlike Toby Maguire (I know people say I should not compare) Andrew Garfield was monotonous. I did not know if he was happy or sad, excited or scared. <br/><br/>I am not impressed, especially that a reboot should add to the story, not take from it. If I want to watch a spider-man movie I will stick to the Sam Raimi version."

","Yes, you read the title well -- The Amazing Spider-Man was the best of the superhero films I've ever seen including the Dark Knight trilogy and everything else. It's not because of the story or something like that. It has a feeling, a fantastic, heroic atmosphere which is the best I've ever felt. A true Spider-Man film which follows the plots of the comics and has better and more intense scenes like the Raimi version had. I got chills when Spider-Man first time used his web-shooters under the bridge and the final fight is epic and spectacular. . . really, an excellent film.<br/><br/>Anyway the actors were fantastic, far more better than in the 2002 version and the characters had life-like, vivid emotions and reactions. I don't think the new Spider Suit is bad, it looks cool. The Lizard was a perfect antagonist, very well played and written. Marc Webb is a really good director, James Horner is still a genius.<br/><br/>But as I wrote the main reason I like this film so much is the atmosphere, the feeling.

"elvisrivet-1","7","3","9","12 July 2012"," The Amazing Spiderman Delivers
","The Amazing Spider Man tells the story of Peter Parker a young teenager in high school who one day gets bitten by a genetically enhanced spider, he undergoes changes from this. <br/><br/>The Amazing Spider Man is one of those films where I wasn't looking forward to it at first because it was a reboot, and usually with reboots they end up being bad. When I saw the teaser for the film last year, I thought it made Spider Man look like it was going to be dark and gritty, like The Dark Knight was but this was not the case with the actual film. The Amazing Spider Man may be darker then the original Rami films, but it also has plenty of jokes in it to balance it out. <br/><br/>I think why The Amazing Spider Man mainly works for is because the story draws you in, sure its a bit of a generic story but then again so are most other movies of this genre. The film tells the story of Peter Parker and what happens to him when he gets bitten by a genetically enhanced spider and how the changes affect him, it also focuses on the relationships that Peter has with his Aunt and uncle, Gwen Stacy and her father, and Dr. Connors. This is why I think the movie focuses on so many levels, it focuses on the story first and then the action later, its about the relationships in Peter's life its about the changes Peter faces and how they affect his life. <br/><br/>The Amazing Spider Man also delivers on the action and not once during the film does the action get confusing. The only downfall for the movie is that there isn't to many action scenes, while this isn't a bad thing I still would have to liked to see a few more scenes between The Lizard and Spider Man.<br/><br/>All of the actors in the movie delivers solid performances but for me the breakout performance in the movie would have to be Andrew Garfield as Spider Man, if there was one thing the movie had going for it, it would be Garfield. Ever since I saw Garfield in The Social Network I've been a big fan of his, I think Garfield was the perfect choice to portray both Peter Parker and Spiderman because he fits the role so perfectly and delivers a great performance that stands out in the movie, I think Garfield should win an award for his performance. Emma Stone also delivered a strong performance as Gwen Stacy, she made you believe that a girl like her would fall for a nerd like Peter Parker, Emma Stone makes you believe in the relationship that her and Peter has. I would also like to point out that Rhys Ifans delivers a solid performance as Dr. Connors and The Lizard, he makes you feel for the character even though The Lizard is your typical Villain. <br/><br/>The Amazing Spider Man is the best Spider Man film yet, it delivers on everything you would expect from a Spider Man movie and make sure to stay during the end credits as there's a scene mid way through."
"matintielemans","10","3","9","12 July 2012"," Andrew Garfield's performance helps TAS to another level
","First of all I wasn't happy that Sony was going to reboot the series. But an the other hand I was relieved. The movies were great, but something wasn't right about the last spider-movies. And it was the touch that Marc Webb brought into this movie. With Webb you could character development. The characters were better developed than Raimi's characters. Especially Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy. Peter Parker was perfectly played by Andrew. No hate against McGuire. Absolutely not. But Garfield's Parker was funnier, smarter and he wasn't goofy. The level of the movie wasn't better than The Dark Knight, but it wasn't worse than the stupid F4-movies. It was certainly better than the Raimi's trilogy. The movie had a good connection with the comics and the very first love interest: Gwen Stacy. So if you're a spider-fan, go to the movie and for the not die-hard spider fans, go see the movie too."
"poohandmuffin","9","3","9","11 July 2012"," amazing indeed.
","When I first heard that Andrew Garfield was going to be the new Spider-Man, I was really interested. I had just watched The Social Network, which he was fantastic in. I didn't enjoy the original Spider-Man trilogy as much as I usually enjoyed Marvel movies, but I had high hopes for this one. Unfortunately, though, after following endless media hype regarding this movie for an entire year, I felt like I was already getting tired of this reboot. By the release date, I wasn't excited at all, just relieved that all the coverage was finally going to start dying down.<br/><br/>I have to admit, my lowered expectations probably influenced my opinion of the movie, because my friends took me to the theater today to watch it, and I was pleasantly surprised. Andrew Garfield (Peter Parker) never fails to disappoint, with all of his effortless nerdy charm. He and Emma Stone (Gwen Stacy) connected well in their scenes together, and you could tell that they were comfortable being with each other. Rhys Ifans (Curt Connors) was fantastic, and yes, his story might seem sort of silly to some, but the way Marc Webb developed his character made his motives believable to me. Denis Leary was great as a father to Gwen and a dedicated policeman. When he first appeared, though, I thought he was Willem Dafoe for a second. Sally Field and Martin Sheen bring a lot of warmth and heart to their characters, and for what little screen time he received, Irrfan Khan was spectacular.<br/><br/>A fun, well-made movie overall. Definitely recommended."

When they casted Kristen Dunst that put the nail in the coffin for that movie. I just hate her has an actress. I did watch all 3 spiderman movies. The action was good, but too far a part, the whole series turned out to be a big drama, like the walking dead series, a poor excuse to be a drama. Just sad. How did we suffer for Peter Parker running after Mary Jane on all 3 movies, how did we suffer for Mary Jane mistreated by her father and a failed actress. Ha all that agony.<br/><br/>Well i am here to tell you that this crap is all over and i am soooo glad they decided to reboot spiderman, Andrew Garfield is the perfect Peter Parker, he is cocky, he looks a tone better then Maguire, he is funny, this spiderman sort of dropped the drama and got into the action right away. OK they could have spent a bit more time with the morphing into spiderman that was very very quick, they did less character development, but i rather have that then all 3 other spiderman movies, and all that dull drama.<br/><br/>The lizard is amazing, the effects are amazing and i really hope they continue the series with all theses actors, finally we had to wait all that time for a decent spiderman movie. Way to go the reboot is far better then all that drama crying crap we been subjected too in all 3 other spiderman. Three thumbs up"
"liontamer0013","10","3","9","8 July 2012"," Watch and Enjoy
","Hands Down this was a good movie to just simply watch and enjoy. Not necessary to watch in 3-D... As a movie lover be prepared for a slow start, but as a comic book reader would know it is a ""origin story,"" but nevertheless hang in there for the good stuff, it pays off. Also, Okay... if your too caught up in ""Raimi's Smell of Flatulence"" by all means watch this movie and do your best to hate it, But Watch it. Compared and Contrasted: Way Better than the Fiasco Known as SPIDERMAN 3, Gotta Wait for part 2 to compare it and so yet Like Spiderman (2002), this movie holds it own!!! Can't wait for the Trinity soon to come. OVERALL: Action level was enough to satisfy, Dramatic impression was enough to tear-jerk me a few times, Comedic essence made me laugh a few times, Romance was enough and not too overwhelming (Love that Emma Stone By the way) and the Suspense was fantastic. So I give this movie a 10 for its enjoyment factor. Go Watch and Enjoy"
"rafecopp","5","3","9","8 July 2012"," The Mediocre Spiderman
","Off the bat, the ""amazing"" spider-man is already a problem for a pedantic brat like myself, but then again the ""mediocre"" spider-man hasn't really got the same ring to it. obviously most of the plot is the same as the first installment of the previous series which is nobodies fault. i felt that, although i have no real complaints about Andrew Garfield's performance, he did give off much more of a hipster vibe than the nerdy loser portrayed by Toby Maguire. this might have been a conscious decision made by the management to try and ""nudge"" the envelope. also when in one of the underwhelming pillow fights between lizard man and spider dude i found the quips infuriatingly annoying. so all in all i would not recommend this film"
"Robert_Escamilla","8","3","9","7 July 2012"," Marc Webb takes us back to The Amazing Spider-Man's basics.
","Actually I loved it! I think that Marc Webb, the film director, did an excellent job by getting us closer to Peter Parker, He perfectly captured the adolescent presented in the comics. He did great by taking us to the basic principles of Spider-Man presented in the comics, a young man with human conflicts like anyone.<br/><br/>Definitely not a pure action film, Marc Webb takes time to develop the characters and I think it succeeds very well. Although for children may seem a little slow.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone definitely an asset to the film, I liked more the aunt & uncle cast in this movie than in the last trilogy. The whole cast in general is great.<br/><br/>The only thing that didn't convinced me was the Lizard face, it looks more human than lizard, but I prefer this design thousand times to the Green Goblin's costume in Spider-Man 1 which had nothing to do with any outfit presented in the comics.<br/><br/>I don' t know if Marc Webb plans to show Gwen Stacy- Green Goblin's storyline in the next films, would be very interesting to see the response of the general audience who aren't familiarized to that comic storyline. <br/><br/>I found the 3D IMAX brutal and 100% recommended.<br/><br/>In short, I think a superhero movie very well made, different rhythm to the Avengers, but more than justified and definitely the best of Spider-Man."
"furkan7","4","3","9","7 July 2012"," A remake or is it just the same dish?
","Well to start off yes there are good things about this movie; like Emma Stone and maybe some of the effects but really there's a whole lot more bad than good. <br/><br/>For one thing this is the same story, yes all the actors have changed and the the main bad guy is not the green goblin and the main love interest isn't Mary Jane but the whole thing is so similar if you substituted some of the new characters with the old ones it'd would be almost exactly the same. I kept thinking this happened in the first movie the whole movie. Now people might say that the movies are bound to the comics so it's bound to be similar but from what I saw almost no creative license was used. <br/><br/>The second point is I hate it when things are just too coincidental, things in the movie are just too lucky. Like the kid he saves on the bridge just happens to be the kid of a guy who's a big shot at a construction firm, there are buildings being built all the way up the street to Ozcorp, Gwens father just happens to be the police chief type guy, or just when spiderman is about to lose his head at the end gwens father comes and saves the day, the list could go on and on. <br/><br/>I didn't really like the first 3 movies but they weren't all that bad, instead of starting the whole process all over again I think they should have spent time on making a nice script and making a forth movie with the already established people. I think the first 3 movies were move emotional and got you more attached to the characters, I for one didn't care at ALL when gwens dad died."

"nickbeiter","10","3","9","3 July 2012"," A Fresh New Feel for a Superhero Movie
","I hesitate in giving this movie a ""10"" for not being taken seriously, but it was a great film and excellent in my mind. Why so many bad reviews then? I think the expectations might have been different for many viewers.<br/><br/>This film was a fresh grounding to reality for a superhero movie. I've always wondered why the directors make superhero films feel ""different"" ... almost ""cartoony"" at times? Some might expect a 2 hour long epic battle with a spider-man character that is the most powerful ever - able to anything and everything. Instead, we see a young man, a high school teenager, struggling with all the elements of that age as well as some deep rooted personal family history. He becomes something more, given the abilities of Spiderman. The transformation is somewhat messy, and we get to see the learning curve. Integral to the transformation is his personal life, which is interwoven perfectly with his transformation into Spiderman. Peter maintains his humanity both physically and emotionally.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone have great chemistry on screen. Denis Leary is believable and does not overplay the role. Martin Sheen and Sally Field play Peter's aunt and uncle as well as anyone could. Martin Sheen especially.<br/><br/>The film doesn't feel forced like many superhero movies. It feels real as if it could actually happen, it might go down something like this. I understand many viewers consider it too slow and boring, but that may be a representation on our have-it-now society. It is not rushed, and time is taken to depict the characters in enough detail to engage the audience. Peter's reaction to his new powers as well as the saga that unfolds is both exciting and emotionally engaging. The story is similar to the first film in some key elements, but those really cannot be changed without significantly deviating from the comic. The balance of real people and super-hero action is perfect. It's not like The Avengers, but instead more of a Batman Begins. There is a lot of time spent on character development and I felt engaged and emotionally connected to the characters and the story as much as any other well written non-superhero drama.<br/><br/>I hope the public supports this type of superhero movie. I'm getting tired of garbage like the second two films in The Transformers saga. The Amazing Spiderman gives a very human and very real feel to the Spiderman franchise. Go into it expecting a great movie, not a soon-to-be-forgotten popcorn summer blockbuster. I don't think this reboot could have been done any better. This was exactly what I had hoped for and the creators delivered phenomenally."
"SamJ_3000","5","3","9","2 July 2012"," Not so amazing Spider-Man...
","I just came out of the movie theatre tonight. I feel very disappointed about the reboot of the Spider-Man movies. I don't understand why they did it if they can't do better than the Sam Raimi's movies.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield's acting was just horrible. I always felt he wasn't really there, I felt his was out of touch with the character he was incarnating. Sometimes he had no emotions on his face, or he was overacting or simply had the wrong reaction to the events. It felt like he just didn't know what to do so he did anything he liked on the spot. It completely destroyed everything for me. He never looked like a convincing nerd, or never looked like a convincing boy who is supposed to be torn apart between loving a girl and fighting justice. He had too much attitude and not enough character defining acting. They never should have choose him.<br/><br/>Then the story of this movie was not so good. It felt like the director cut corners at some point to go straight to the point, which at the end made the story unreal and a bit boring. After all, we are looking at the exact same story we looked only 10 years ago but with a couple of not so interesting differences here and there. I just don't get the point to start again the same story if it is not as good or better as the first trilogy. At least we have a new bad guy, but why didn't they just continued the trilogy with this bad guy? The action isn't so good. The bad guy is very good looking except the fact he look to much CG for me. There are nice shots here and there in the movie, but a lot of scenes are very difficult to swallow because of the reaction of the characters or the way the story evolves. The hold up scene was awful...<br/><br/>I felt like I lost my time watching a bad copy of 2002's Spider-Man."

"e-pappalettera","1","5","19","29 August 2013"," A Useless Remake. Come on there was no need for this!
","It is now almost ten years since the couple Raimi - Maguire , brought to the big screen the fifth Marvel film, Spiderman , receiving critical acclaim and box office and a worldwide success. With this remake (now they say ""reboot"" because it's cooler) , they tried to repeat these successes without succeed and now I'll explain why.<br/><br/>Let's begin to talk about the cast, in SM there were Maguire, Franco, Dunst, Simmons, Banks, and Dafoe, where rare case they chose to hire a protagonist who is not the usual handsome jock, but a normal average looking guy - capable of great interpretation, Maguire is not only a good actor, but for the role of Peter he has trained physically for over six months, this means commitment . As for the antagonist, Dafoe is certainly much better than Ifans, even though Goblin does not become as muscled as Lizard that looks like a scaled Hulk complete with a retinue and claws. In general it seems that in The Amazing Sm, they have assembled a cast that would attract people to the box office, in fact Garfield and Stone are actors who are particularly popular and fashionable lately, as well as the director that it certainly does not have many arrows in his bow.<br/><br/>As for the plot , there have been small distortions that currently seem unnecessary, like the story of the death of the parents of Peter, the lack of Bugle and Mary Jane, things that we could have also be in it if the changes would have brought narrative improvements, which unfortunately are absent. It seems that they simply wanted to overdo it by copying the idea from the new Batman of DC, where, however, Garfield is not worth a fingernail of Bale and Webb does not even deserve to replace the toilet paper of Mr.Nolan. The strange thing is that Marvel had already managed to greatly improve a character with a remake, I'm referring to Hulk and The Incredible Hulk, there it made sense to reinvent a character from scratch to make a better film than the previous with different spans, as opposed to comparing to this new Sm, where the only improvement is the technical one, and not even that much, personally I expected a lot more action scenes and fights (after all, if a person would want a dull movie you would rent the dull ' ""The horse Whisperer"", no?) .<br/><br/>The only significant innovations are the fabulous cameo by Stan Lee and the secret ending after the credits .<br/><br/>I would like to say one thing to the producers, writers , director and actors in this little Amazing Spiderman: with great power comes great responsibility, you could have made a great Film, I even went to the cinema to watch this piece of crap, and you have barely been able to reach the same level of the old film. Just awful!"
"brdlybaum","1","5","19","12 April 2013"," What an amazingly poor reboot!
","Even if you take this film as a film in it's own right it would still be a terrible film but then you can't take it as a film in it's own right as it's a reboot so you have to compare it to what has gone before. OK so lets do that. Compared to what has gone before this film is boring, tedious, long drawn out, far too long, extremely messy, <br/><br/>There is only one good scene in the whole film and it is a very short one in the school where Spiderman and The Lizard are fighting in the school and enter a classroom with a teacher in who is listening to music absolutely oblivious to the fact the two of them are fighting behind him. That is the ONLY good scene in the film and it lasts for about thirty seconds to about one minute! The one line of sarcastic wit is also said in the fight in the school<br/><br/>As much as I hate to say it because it's nice to finally see Hollywood casting an English actor (well, I say English because although born in America he was brought up in England) in a lead role that isn't the villain Andrew Garfield did not fit the role at all! But then he, like any actor, can only do the best that they can with the script that they are given and the script in this film was awful, and so was the directing which also doesn't make an actor look good on, screen none of it helped make him the right man for the job! Emma Stone dyed her hair for this role. What she should have done was dyed it for another role if she wanted to dye it so badly at all! Again, her part, like all of them was lifeless and therefore tedious to watch and in this version the character of Gwen Stacy got to know Peter Parker and Spiderman are one and the same person even though that NEVER happened in the comics as the only girlfriend so far that got to know who was under the mask was Mary- Jane Watson. Gwen's father and a child in a car also got to know who was under the mask and that should not have happened!<br/><br/>oh and I keep getting the feeling that I'm watching a parallel universe with the Marvel universe films as the Toby Maguire films were pretty much true to the comic books but this film? Almost nothing like them! <br/><br/>THIS IS TO BE CONTINUED!"

","Imagine you buy a 100 pages super hero comic book and all you read is some 'amazing' private facts about the life of Peter Parker, the guy who's going to become the amazing Spiderman. You will be really pi**ed off! The good thing with the comic book, you can stop reading and throw it in a corner where your dog can grab it later. The bad thing with the movie, you have to sit through it.<br/><br/>The problem seems to be: What to do with a $230,000,000 budget? Make just an action movie? Ohhh no, that is not enough, you have to reach the broadest target audience as possible. So your are starting to construct a plot that has everything in it: romance, love, desires, fears ... some action, but not too much, to reconcile every ingredient which makes your movie an attraction for all the boys and girls, families, whoever. How to construct an emotionally deep plot that every twilight fan-girl loves around a nerd who get's bitten by a radioactive spider and then transform into something spider-like himself and who likes to wear mesh stockings and a mask since then? You have NO chance, it MUST be full of clichés, otherwise your audience would not understand what the hell you are going to tell them. And for a $230,000,000 budget, you do not dare to copy just some lines from The Love Boat or so, Shakespeare's romeo and Juliet might be a more appropriate template.<br/><br/>The result is this ridiculous mess of a movie. If Hollywood goes on with those super super hero movies, the actors will make them self redundant. Computer animated figures are totally sufficient for portraying such one dimensional and stupid industry mainstream characters. And that could look far better than the pushover in a latex costume we have here."

Very weird - I felt as if I had walked out of the movie a number of times and missed important detail. Spiderman's relationship with the girl (in all stages), his reactions and acclimation to his new abilities, the school outcast -- just left me wondering how the screenplay got through. Thoroughly disappointing (and I usually give any superhero/mutant/etc. movie a great deal of latitude ... iow, it has to be really bad for me not to like it). On a lesser note, I was annoyed with the decision to go back to the comic book's idea of not having spiderman's web capabilities biological.

","I was really into spider-man when this first came out and was expecting big things from it though it certainly didn't deliver. <br/><br/>The movie pretty much takes Peter Parker, the unpopular science nerd, and turns him into some cool skater kid that likes to pull his pants up over his belt. They even give him gelled up hair that all the girls could die for. That is not who Parker is. Peter Parker is a great character because he's not the cool kid.

","* MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* This is an unpopular opinion, but I think this movie is excellent. Andrew Garfield is the perfect Spider-man, and Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy is also really good. The selling point of this movie is the relationship between Peter and Gwen and how well it is developed. The two stars are actually a real life couple, so their romance scenes feel 100 percent authentic. The villain, The Lizard, isn't one of the more memorable Spider-man villains in this movie, but that's fine because he's one of the few that isn't incredibly over-the-top. I also thought that the origin story was handled much better this time, and I'm glad that they re-told it. Uncle Ben's death was handled better, as well as his delivery of the Responsibility catch phrase. The effects are stunning, and I really appreciate that they took the time to show us all of Spider-man's stunts. Along with the great acting, I also love that this wasn't just another by-the-numbers MCU movie, and that the film makers decided to make this film feel special. It doesn't just feel like, oh, yeah, people have seen this kind of thing hundreds of times, let's skip to the jokes. No, it feels like 'Let's make the definitive Spider-man movie. Let's make the best Spider-man movie possible.' This is a great movie with great characters, excellent effects, a really good tone, and a good story. I love this movie."
"TheLittleSongbird","6","2","5","28 July 2014"," Spider-Man is not too amazing this time round
","That said though, from personal opinion The Amazing Spider-Man was not a bad film, or at least nowhere near as bad as has been said(again personal opinion), but it doesn't live up to its name. For me, the first two Sam Raimi Spider-Man films are better, and while Spider-Man did plod and had too many villains all but one of which were underused personally it wasn't that bad. The Amazing Spider-Man did have things to like, it is very stylishly made and has some very impressive special effects, even if the Lizard takes some getting used to. The action sequences- of which there are a lot in the second half- mostly are exciting with some cool stunts(the one exception is the climax which seemed like it was played and written too safe) and very creative use of Spider-Man's powers, and there are some parts in the story that work, the dynamic between Peter and Uncle Ben is really quite emotionally powerful, the romance between Peter and Gwen is somewhat sweet and the part where Spider-Man saves the little boy is tense and heart-felt. It was also very intriguing with the mystery of Peter's parents which was done quite well. The performances on the whole are also good, Sally Field and especially Martin Sheen are great as Aunt May and Uncle Ben, and Emma Stone is a charming and amusing Gwen. Rhys Ifans does bring some creepiness to Curt Connors/The Lizard if not the tragedy(the writing didn't help him though) and Denis Leary is delightful in how churlish he is. On the whole too there is some good chemistry between the actors. I never really warmed to Andrew Garfield though, he did seem too quirky for Peter complete with some forced humour and wasn't enough of a nerd, he wasn't a whole lot better as Spider-Man either, he had charisma but did come across as rather smug and not brooding enough for such a serious tone to the story here. Irrfan Kahn's performance and his character is little more than an extended cameo, not very much to work with and Kahn does little with it. The story does have its fair share of well-done moments but does suffer from an over-familiarity that feels like a more seriously toned rehash and uneven pacing, sluggish in the first half and while much better rushed in some of the second half. The script is never terrible nor is it ever exceptional, there are sweet and emotional moments as well as tense ones but too much of the humour is forced and it interferes with the serious tone. James Horner's score is nowhere near among his best, some of it pedestrian, some of it over-the-top, neither of which Danny Elfman's scoring had. And the film really rushed Connors'/Lizard's character arc, there was real potential for him to be a multi-layered character but here he came across as a one-dimensional villain with no real motivation. Overall, watchable but not close to being amazing. 5.5/10 Bethany Cox"

","Rebooting the Spider-Man franchise just five years after Spider-Man 3 may initially seem like a pretty pointless and unusual thing to do. However, when you take in mind the Sony-Marvel contract, which mandates Sony to make a Spider-Man movie every five years or they lose the rights over the characters, the picture becomes clearer. Originally, Spider-Man 4 was planned, but there were some creative differences between Sam Raimi and the studio, so he pulled out of the project, and Sony ultimately decided to reboot the whole franchise. Considering how awful Spider-Man 3 was, the reboot idea doesn't seem that bad anymore, but The Amazing Spider-Man doesn't offer anything new and it still feels pointless.<br/><br/>In case you don't know – the movie follows Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield), a teenager whose parents mysteriously left him when he was a young child and who now lives with his uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and aunt May (Sally Field). One day he learns of a doctor named Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans), who worked with his father, and decides to visit him at his workplace – Oscorp. There Peter gets bitten by a strange spider and soon develops spider-like abilities and uses them to become a superhero named Spider-Man. He meets his first villain when Dr. Curt Connors injects himself with mutagen chemicals and becomes the menacing Lizard.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man definitely isn't a terrible movie: the casting and the acting are great – Andrew Garfield is a very believable Spider-Man, and the always likable Emma Stone is superb as his love interest Gwen Stacy, and they have a lot of chemistry. The action sequences and the visual effects are decent: they are by no means superb, but are exciting enough for a generic superhero popcorn movie flick. And the director, Marc Webb (who never directed a big blockbuster movie before), did a satisfying job. Furthermore, the movie is darker and more brooding than Sam Raimi's trilogy (actually, the movie is more similar to Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy than to Raimi's movies), which works surprisingly well.<br/><br/>Even though The Amazing Spider-Man has some strong points, the movie utterly fails script wise. The movie spends a big chunk of its over 2 hours runtime on a origin story which the audience is already familiar with. Not only that, but all the characters in the movie are conveniently tied to one another in an absurdly naive fashion. Moreover, some scenes are ludicrous (Peter not being able to control his powers and the infamous cranes scene). Because of that, The Amazing Spider-Man can get both tedious and silly from time to time, which may severely annoy some viewers. And speaking of silly, The Lizard design could have been improved to some degree (he should at least have kept his lab coat on!). In a nutshell, The Amazing Spider-Man isn't as bad as it could have been, but it still is a pretty dull and pointless movie which offers nothing new to justify the reboot.<br/><br/>Rating: 6/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/"
"Leofwine_draca","3","2","5","16 April 2014"," Redundant from the very beginning
","I'm a bit ambivalent towards superhero films. Sure, they offer crowd-pleasing entertainment, but most of them turn into CGI monstrosities devoid of originality and wit long before the ending, and unfortunately the same thing happens with THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN. And that's without mentioning that this is an entirely redundant remake of the Sam Raimi original, which only came out about a decade ago.<br/><br/>See, I liked the Raimi trilogy of Spiderman flicks. Raimi brought his own directorial quirks to the films, making them slightly campy and a whole lot of fun. Here, it's all about earnestness, which is dull, and it quickly becomes obvious that director Marc Webb (a made-up name, surely?) has little experience of handling this kind of expensive material.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield has a knack for picking slightly irritating characters and that knack is evidence in his Peter Parker, who lacks the decency that Tobey Maguire brought to the role. The whole high school schtick is faintly embarrassing to sit through, but it gets worse about halfway through when the plot dissolves to be replaced by one CGI-laden action sequence after another. They're all silly and predictable, lacking the kind of choreography that a director like, say, Christopher Nolan, would bring to them.<br/><br/>There's little else to enjoy along the way, either. I didn't like Kristen Dunst in the Raimi trilogy, but Emma Stone is hardly better, a bland blonde bimbo and nothing more. Rhys Ifans is impossible to take seriously as the bad guy, while old-timers Martin Sheen and Sally Field have very little to work with. There's no great insight into the characters or anything like that; in fact, this is just a kid's film that anyone older than a teenager will struggle to enjoy."

Tobey Maguire was a much better Peter Parker instead of Andrew Garfield's emo character. Peter Parker has downgraded from a nerdy, yet funny person, to someone who probably listens to depressing music all day while skateboarding. <br/><br/>For the story, I was pretty disappointed. The climax of the whole movie is watching Spider-man swinging from building to building for a few minutes.<br/><br/>I did like the action scenes in the movie, but that was the only thing good to me."
"kaundamabuya","4","2","5","8 August 2013"," Sorry as excuse of a reboot just to rake in some cash.
","If you have seen the previous Spider Man then don't waste your time watching this Spider Man. It was very childish not just compared to the Sam Raimi Spider Man but just on its own to. The Spider Man is basically the same story as the previous first Spider Man with minimal changes. From my understanding Sony was set to produce Spider Man 4 with the old cast and crew returning. Sam Raimi wanted an extended release date for the film so he could get it right but Sony was set against it. Sony wanted the cash cow franchise to rake in cash early. Sam Raimi felt he would not finish in time so Sony and the director parted ways. Sony released The Amazing Spider Man on the sole intent of making money. The fans interests were last priority to them. No franchise should be rebooted that fast. When comparing the Marc Webb Spider Man and the Sami Raimi Spidr Man the Sam Raimi take was much more mature. Remember...both Spider Man takes are both modern day takes and had big budgets and access to great special effects. Thus it comes down to who could direct the better movie. Sam Raimi wins by a long shot. Tobey Maguire portrayed a much more realistic nerd than Andrew Garfield. The Sam Raimi Spider Man had bigger and more entertaining set pieces. Last is the special effects and cgi. Marc Webb's movie looked way to fake. You could tell the burning cars were fake and the Lizard character looked to cartoonish. The smoke bombs the Lizard released looked like some out of a video game."
"mggod","4","2","5","20 July 2013"," OK, but disappointing
","-Contains heavy spoilers- <br/><br/>When I saw Sam Raimi's version of Spiderman IW as amazed and fell in love with it. It gave you a feeling of how it feels to fly like Spiderman and the joy of exploring the true powers. I am not gonna compare Spiderman 2/3 with the Amazing just the first one. This Spiderman is supposed to be a superhero movie not a love movie like twilight with 10 minute action. You don't see Spiderman flying only at the end where he needed cranes to help him, which completely unnecessary as he had buildings next to him. You didn't see spider sense trigger when fighting. You don't see peter exploring and enjoying his powers a lot( there were some but not much). The fights where ridiculously bad, I mean at the bridge spidey kicks lizard and the lizards retreats, at the tunnel spidey gets scratched and he couldn't move, at the end they race each other to the top as spidey tries to put his cure in the machine. The only place where he actually fights is the school but the doesn't do much there just webs the lizards. But the one thing that hurt me the most was that they didn't put in this phrase"" WITH GREAT POWER COMES GREAT RESPONSIBILITY"" that is the code that spidey follows etc. Andrew is a good Spiderman but he doesn't fit the amazing one. You also don't see much of Spiderman's intelligence here just that he shows off with Gwen that he is smarter than her nothing more. It was too soon for the lizards as he is a powerful foe. They failed to develop Dr. Connors as he is a very dear friend who loses controls over him self but in this movie it feels like he deserves to die. They did make it originally but they deleted it which made it bad."

This is all Hollywood is now, and its not downloading thats making it bad, its the writers and money grubbing that is.

I actually wasn't much of a fan of the previous films. Although good, I found them to be just a little bit cheesy. Cheese on food, great, on movies...not so much. It was obviously an origins story, however this movie tends to be more true to the comics. They made Spiderman, who was quite frankly already loved by many, loved even more. Andrew Garfield's portrayal of the character was immense. He was witty, slick and even a bit quirky all in the right proportions. His chemistry with Emma stone was amazing, a lot better than I was expecting. Both of them worked together really well, and it was the chemistry between them and the funny actions scenes that made this the movie to watch last summer. <br/><br/>This is a late review, I actually watched it last Summer, but since then I have seen it at least four times more; I can't get enough of it and I can't wait for the sequel."

Not to mention he reminds me of Hayden Christensen, though at least Christensen is cute. <br/><br/>Why are people giving this movie such high marks? I wish I knew.

","Sorry, but this movie was horrible compared to Toby Mcguire's first Spiderman. I loved that Spiderman movie; it was funny and had a great story. In this remake, it's not funny and everything in it has been seen before. And Andrew Garfield goes around with his hair sticking up and just wasn't good casting. The way Peter Parker finds out about his super powers was no where near as good. And this movie copy cats so much from the first, like having Ben die, how he designs the spidey suit, how he gets back at the bully at school. And all of it was done worse in this film than the first one.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: I'm so glad I waited till this was on cable so I didn't pay to watch it. I recommend watching the Toby Mcguire ones and staying away from this."

","I mean, the history is obviously 'cause the movie keeps on the original Spiderman, but from other perspective. If you didn't see the others three Spiderman movies, you CAN see this one, it's like other beginning and it keeps on the history line. With that said, let's point to point. Characters: They make a good job, they're really good actors for the movie itself. About the new Mary Jane, I mean Gwen Stacy (Emma Watson), what can I say, she is just beautiful, for my, more beautiful than Kirsten Dunst, and she's an excellent actor, so is a full character, full with personality. Talking a bit to Andrew Gardfield (Peter Parker), he's not so different to Tobey Maguire as a character, I mean, they are very similar as actors. If you wanna see this movie, go ahead, you'll like it."
"FairlyAnonymous","8","2","5","13 January 2013"," I liked it more than the first Spider-man
","The Amazing Spider-man actually took me by surprise. I expected it to be mediocre seeing as how the only reason this movie was created was so that Columbia pictures could keep the rights to the Spider-man series. As disappointing as it was to hear this info I can actually say that they did good with this movie. Is it perfect? No. But I can say I liked it a bit better.<br/><br/>The first spider-man movie had issues with technology. For the time it was good and all but it hasn't aged well. The way Spider-man was portrayed in the previous films was that he was so awkward he could barely talk in complete sentences which always bugged me (no pun intended). However this new Spider-man is actually likable, is interesting, and is still awkward but in a much more realistic manner. The previous Spider-man was so awkward it was almost unbearable and unrealistic and Mary Jane always annoyed me. However in this movie Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone both do a great job. The way Peter Parker is portrayed is much better, funnier, and still serious at the same time. Gwen Stacy is also very well done though the only problem I have with her is that she is supposed to be 17... and she looks older than that.<br/><br/>The Lizard is also pretty well done in this movie. He gets enough screen-time and action to be a pretty cool villain. If there was one complaint I had with him is that I wish they would've his face look more lizard-ish. I know they are making him look like the very original Lizard but I think his face still looked a little awkward. Though the CGI is very well done on The Lizard. I also liked that they didn't make Curt Connor's really evil, just insane because of the serum. Also the fact that they didn't kill him off makes me happy. I wouldn't mind seeing him again sometime.<br/><br/>The movie's strong points is that I found the villain much more interesting that the Green Goblin and his lizard form wasn't revealed too early on. I found the characters rather likable but Uncle Ben had really stupid logic. In one scene where Peter Parker utterly embarrasses the school bully (Flash Thompson) Uncle Ben doesn't approve of it and says that Peter Parker shouldn't take ""revenge"". This was the dumbest line in the movie seeing as how Peter was proving a point that Flash Thompson isn't as tough as he thinks he is. Peter didn't hurt him, he simply embarrassed him. Another dumb thing is that a cop shoots at spider-man when he is only casually walking along. That is illegal on many levels and is dumb altogether.<br/><br/>Either way I found this movie rather enjoyable and a bit more interesting than the previous attempt at a spider-man movie. All of the issues of the last movie are actually done right such as: Gwen knowing Peter's identity early on, The Lizard doesn't die, Peter isn't awkward, and also the very last couple seconds of the movie are also very nice and changes what would've been a cliché sad ending into something a little bit more. Good movie, but not perfect."
"yungbuffwan-468-315521","3","2","5","19 December 2012"," Just a Very Bad Movie
","People can say all they want that this movie can't be compared to the original Spider-Mans, but it can and it sure as heck will. <br/><br/>The thing that makes Spider Man... well, Spider Man is his character: his noticeable ability to triumph. Sure he gets beaten down, but he ultimately triumphs.<br/><br/>However, half way through the movie I couldn't tell who the good guy was supposed to be, and the same was true for the rest of the movie. Andrew Garfield's portrayal of Spider Man featured an incredibly awkward kid turning into a real nuisance, and all of a sudden he was completely confident... WHAT? He got away with things that I wouldn't have got away with, and I'm more charming. He shot chicks in the butt, he talked police officers down, and he tried to rationalize that he was doing the right thing, when he was by no means doing it.<br/><br/>As for acting performances, I found the movie to be bad ranging to sub- par. Andrew Garfield didn't have opportunities to really give somebody a glimpse of his character and his insecurities, and he sure didn't find ways. Emma Stone's character portrayed her as a patsy little girl who would fall for stupid and terrible lines like. ""Don't make promises you can't keep."" ""But those are the best kind.""<br/><br/>Overall, my 3/10 is pretty generous, as the movie left zero inclination for high expectations for the next movie. As I have suggested, Tobey Maguire should be begged to comeback.. that is, if anyone has the balls to make any more Spider Man movies after the last two flops."

","The acting was substandard, but the writing was worse.<br/><br/>I'm a big Spiderman fan. I've watched all of the movies, I've read some of the comics and I've watched the cartoons. So, when they released the movie so soon after finishing the last movie series, I thought they must have had a really good script or great actors that would create an even better movie than the last. However, I was wrong.<br/><br/>First of all, I don't know who created the script for this film, but they should be fired. I know that the movie isn't supposed to be realistic, but the few scenes that were supposed to be realistic were not. The dialogue was completely ridiculous and the script a lot of holes in it.<br/><br/>The acting wasn't good. However, considering how bad and unrealistic the lines were, I could forgive that. It looks like this was just a movie created because someone had money to waste. They should've spent more money on a decent script writer so that it would at least be passable. If it wasn't for the fact that I was on a date, I would've walked out of the film 15 minutes after it started."
"TxMike","Null","2","5","2 December 2012"," Good movie, same general story but with a different execution.
","I like the Spider-Man movies and own DVDs of the series with Toby Mcguire. After I watched this new one, I popped in the 2002 movie to compare them back-to-back.<br/><br/>While the overall story of a high school boy, interested in photography, and being raised by his aunt and uncle, becoming Spider Man after being bitten by an engineered spider during a class field trip is the same in both movies, most everything else is different. <br/><br/>I found myself trying to guess who Mary Jane Watson was going to be, but this one has no Mary Jane Watson. Instead it has Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy, whose dad is a policeman. I like Stone, and she did fine here, but I found myself wondering why she was not MJ. <br/><br/>Andrew Garfield is the newest Spider-Man, also known as Peter Parker. He of course plays it a bit differently and I enjoyed his performance.<br/><br/>The core of this story involves a scientist who had known and worked with Peter's dad, Rhys Ifans (the absurd 'Spike' in 'Notting Hill') as Dr. Curt Connors. Somewhere along the line he has lost his right arm below the elbow, and his research seeks to use lizard DNA engineered to regenerate limbs in humans. Not everything goes as he would like and when he injects himself the arm grows, but he also turns into a giant and very vicious lizard with human speech and intelligence. He becomes the villain that Spider-Man must defeat. Their fights destroy lots of stuff!<br/><br/>Overall a fine movie, I enjoyed it."

","To start, I'm a huge spider man/marvel fan.therefore i went walking into the theater all excited and pumped up. After watching the movie i was somewhat disappointed. Then later on it thought about it and realized it was pretty bad.It all starts when he first is trying to find the guy who shot uncle Ben, this side story goes on for about 3 minutes and after not finding him us dropped completely from the story. Next in the scene where the police officers start turning into lizards you see them on the ground and changing, Then about 25 minutes later when the lizard cure is in the air, you see the policemen in the same spot and position making the part of that pointless considering they do no harm at all. another thing that disappointed me is that peter parker does things that make it so obvious that he is spider man like when he throws the football about 100 yards and bends the field goal bar. Then the one final thing that bothered me is the way the lizard looked. He did not look intimidating or even like a lizard. The one good thing about this film is that they brought the web slingers like in the comic. I would watch this movie again but i doubt i would like it as much as the first trilogy or at least the first 2 movies"
"tomgillespie2002","6","2","5","19 September 2012"," Solid re-boot that finds a deeper focus of Parker's distress
","After Sam Raimi departing from a fourth Spider-Man project, the news of a ""reboot"" of the franchise was met with cries of anger from the plebeian fanboys. Only ten years after Spider-Man (2002) was released, and five years since the debacle that was Spider-Man 3 (2007), it did seem like a project that would be a bit too soon for comfort. But as these angry diatribes filled blogs and chat rooms on the inter-web, I considered these conditions. After all, the fanboys that are so very antagonised at such things, are the same bedroom boys who lap up everything that the comic book world has to offer - including the many, many, many ""reboots"" of comic book characters over the decades by the major comic book publishers. So I asked myself, is this really such a major issue? Now that Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy has finished there will be no doubt that Warner Bros. (owners of DC comics and all of its ""contents"") will be ""rebooting"" the Batman franchise, and it seems that The Man of Steel may tread a similar path at reinvigorating a character.<br/><br/>Of course, because of the success of the Dark Knight triptych, the prerequisite focus from those idiot executives would have been that this new film will ultimately need to be ""darker"" - a tone that has been used in the media since the early '90's, but which has been actually realised in the first decade of the 21st century. I have no issue with the ""darker"" approach, but often it is simply a synonym for violence. In The Amazing Spider-Man however, story/co-screenwriter, James Vanderbilt, - whose previous Zodiac (2007) script was a revelation - has managed to instil this concept of dark into the protagonists anguish at discovering insidious science from his long-dead parents. The Spider-Man origin story is a very well-known, and well trodden story arc, but Vanderbilt (along with co-writers Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves), and director Marc Webb have dug deep into the mythos and found a deeper focus of Peter Parker's distress, and a more interesting and probable path into his arachnid genetic future.<br/><br/>Living with his aunt and uncle (Sally Field and Martin Sheen), Parker (Andrew Garfield) discovers a leather suitcase containing secret scientific papers owned by his dead father (played by Campbell Scott), a scientist working in Marvel universes science corporation, Oscorp. It's contents suggest a project involving cross-species genetics, and leads Parker to the offices where his fathers partner, Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans), whose arm was severed and he searches for a cure using reptilian genetic splicing. On his first visit, Parker is bitten by a spider (obviously), in a scene flooded with blue colour, and one that has more visual drama than the accidental approach in 2002's origin story. Parker's obsession with the science work of his father leads to an equation that solves issues with the experiment, and he offers this to Connors - an action that is later regretful. <br/><br/>In high school Peter's persona is slightly less dorky than the Tobey Maguire incarnation. He still has bully issues from the Flash Thompson character (Chris Zylka), but he is more intense, aggravated, and intelligent. His lack of knowledge of his parents demise, and his isolation gives the character more depth. Deleting the Mary-Jane and replacing with Gwen Stacey (the always electrifying Emma Stone) is a slight, but alternative change, but their relationship becomes more engrossing - and one which becomes more exquisite on discovering that her father, Captain Stacey (Denis Leary), is the police chief pursuing the spider-dude. <br/><br/>In the first major set-piece involving Spider-Man and Connors' later genetic manifestation, The Lizard, they don't actually clash, but creates a tender and beautiful moment as Spider-Man rescues a child trapped in a car dangling from the Brooklyn bridge. In this reboot, Parker never seems too reluctant to take the mask off, and offers it to the young boy as a placebo to move his terrified body into action. The father of the son later gets the opportunity to give back to the wall crawler, in another touching moment, and one that reflects the New Yorker united moments of Raimi's trilogy. <br/><br/>Of course, Parker is pushed into his crime fighting ways due to the murder of his Uncle Ben, and the screenwriters attempt to write the same message but without stating ""with great power comes great responsibility"" which is tackled rather well, if a little convoluted. Ifans' Connors is often wooden, and seems too villainous, when in fact he shouldn't be - in other words his villainous attitude does come on a bit too fast. The CGI Lizard's characterisation and face was unsatisfactory and could have done with being more fantastical than reptilian-realism. But these are minor infractions to an interesting, exciting, and character driven re-start to a franchise. I would have preferred more screen time for Stone's Gwen - Stone's comic acting is excellent, and should be used here more often (in a scene where she attempts to hide Parker in her bedroom from her father, sees this comedic acting, but could have been so much more. I actually look forward to seeing where a sequel may go, and hope that the screen writing duties go to Vanderbilt again - he certainly knows how to write characters, and since the bar for superhero movies has been set so high this year by The Dark Knight Rises and The Avengers, it is intelligent writing that the genre so dearly needs.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
"MtnsOMadness","9","2","5","21 August 2012"," Best Spider-Man Movie to date
","I am a huge fan of comic books. Thought I should get that out of the way up front.<br/><br/>I was very skeptical of this movie up front for two reasons. One is the choice of a British actor (Andrew Garfield) to play Peter Parker. Two is that I was concerned about remaking the beginning when it was done so well in the Sam Raimi version with Tobey Maguire as Peter.<br/><br/>This movie blew me away. Andrew Garfield was able to pull off the American teen accent and affectations with no problem. But to be more specific, he pulled off Peter Parker's worried, self-doubting, bad luck infused, angst ridden but light hearted teen-age attitude with great aplomb. Emma Stone played an excellent Gwen Stacy and the chemistry between Andrew and Emma was outstanding. Dr Conner / The Lizard (played by Rhys Ifans) was the second best villain to date in a Spider-Man movie beaten only by Alfred Molina's version of Doctor Octopus in Spider-man 2.<br/><br/>One of the things that really set this off from the Sam Raimi Spider-man movies was how Spider-man moved. His fights with The Lizard in the school and on top of the empire State building displayed the lightning fast reflexes and use of surroundings that Spider-Man was known for in the comic books. Another point that was more like the original Spider-Man in the comics is Spider-Man's use of homemade web-shooters instead of the biological web-shooters that were used in the Sam Raimi version. And finally, the use of Gwen Stacy as Peter's first love (and the obvious setup for the whole Gwen Stacy story over the next movie or two) is critical for the development of the Spider-Man persona as created by Stan Lee in the comic books. I would go so far as saying that the Gwen Stacy story is as important in the creation of the Spider-man persona as was the death of Uncle Ben and the loss of Peter's parents.<br/><br/>This is not to disparage the Sam Raimi Spider-Man movies because I really liked them as well (except for Spider-Man 3 which was a mish-mash of too many villains and plot lines).<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie to any fan of Spider-Man and of the comic book movie genre.<br/><br/>The Panel Votes: Cthulhu: 6 out of 10 (The villain reminded me of a Deep One which is nice but the fact that the spandex clad hero won in the end was a huge disappointment) Fuzzy Toad: 9 out of 10 (This movie is great for the young ones. There are some scenes of comic book violence and some images of the Lizard that may be too intense for some children under 8.) Mouth-Breather: 10 out of 10 (Loved this movie in all respects. Somewhat confused though because I think Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man could take Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man) Frat-Boy: 7 out of 10 (Nice action scenes. Emma Stone is hot. Not enough hot chicks and no nudity.) The Queen in Yellow: 4 out of 10 (If I never see another super hero movie it will be too soon.) Azathoth: 100 out of Pi (A twisted cacophony of flute piping fills your mind)"
"ksj870","9","2","5","20 August 2012"," An Amazingly Successful Reboot
","The Amazing Spider-Man marks the return of one of the most popular of all superheroes to the big screen, and for the most part it is a triumphant one. Director Marc Webb seems to have a great handle on the story and everything that should go along with it, while the script successfully addresses almost all the major plot points that a worthy Spider-Man film has to have.<br/><br/>The lead casting is nearly perfect. Andrew Garfield is great as both the geeky, outcast Peter Parker and his flamboyant, daredevil alter ego. Peter Parker has to be exceptionally likable and good-hearted, but somewhat flawed, basically a typical teenager who may not really be ready for the power Fate bestows upon him, and Garfield nails the part with apparent ease. Emma Stone is just as fine as Gwen Stacy, Peter's love interest. Stone makes Gwen smart, vibrant, and attractive, so much so that she captures the viewer's heart along with poor smitten Peter's. Dennis Leary is perhaps cast somewhat against type as Gwen's father, a policeman who is out to arrest the mysterious Spider-Man, but he handles the role so well that it would have been a shame for anyone else to have gotten the part. And Rhys Ifans does a great tragic turn as the reluctant villain of the story, Dr. Curt Connors, whose risky scientific adventures give birth to the monstrous Lizard.<br/><br/>The film looks terrific from beginning to end. Special effects never fail, from Spider-Man's mind-boggling feats of superhuman agility to the Lizard's bestial transformations from man to monster and back again. Action isn't quite as prevalent as one might expect—the story is heavily character-oriented, built around Peter's evolution as a person and his relationships with Gwen as well as his beloved Aunt May and Uncle Owen. But when the action does break loose, it's wild and crazy, and certainly never disappoints.<br/><br/>But still, there are a few problems, and for the record I don't think The Amazing Spider-man ever quite equals the Sam Raimi film from ten years ago. The biggest flaw is that the new movie doesn't address the problem of personal responsibility to the degree that a Spider-Man story should. Comic fans may be disappointed to learn that the immortal words ""With great power, comes great responsibility,"" are never uttered. The idea is dealt with, but a bit ambiguously, and lacks the concentrated gravitas that that simple phrase has always imparted to Spider-Man's rather tragic origin story. Less significantly, Peter's Aunt and Uncle are portrayed as a bit too young (though played by great actors, namely Sally Field and Martin Sheen), and while the Lizard is a neat villain, his grand plan seems a bit too far out, even for a comic book movie.<br/><br/>But what works about The Amazing Spider-Man outweighs what doesn't. It's an exciting story, but one made dramatically stronger by its clear affection for its characters. Evidently the first installment in what could be a trilogy of films, The Amazing Spider-Man is a welcome addition to the Spider-Man legend."
"dmhughes-448-695102","9","2","5","15 August 2012"," Spider-Man, Spider-Man, Can Be Rebooted, Oh Yes He Can!
","I was a huge fan of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy. They had great performances, amazing special effects, and really intriguing villains. It was arguably one of the best comic book film franchises ever made. I liked all the films, including Spider-Man 3. Yes, I know, a lot of people don't like it that much, but I thought despite some really corny moments, they felt like what you'd see in a comic book. The only problem is, the original trilogy felt like it was pulled out of the 1960s comic books. A lot of the dialog was corny, and can we not forget Willem Dafoe's really huge overacting? And of course the worst scene in the series: the dance number in the third film. Ugh! Even with those issues, I still thought they were good films. <br/><br/>Now we have the reboot of the Spider-Man franchise, and I have to admit, I was excited to finally see a different spin on the character. This new Spider-Man was more of a rebel; a wisecracker; a mix of the 1960s and 1990s comics. Spider-Man actually had to build web shooters, he actually used jokes that were reminiscent of the old days of comics. However, the film looked dark, and gritty, and more modern. It felt like the type of comic book movie you would see today. Did this film come out too soon after Spider-Man 3? Maybe, but I think this was still a very well done reboot. <br/><br/>The film begins with Peter Parker being left behind by his parents with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May after their home was burglarized. Jump to over a decade later, and we see Peter (played by a great Andrew Garfield) is an outcast who is picked on, but also attracts the attention of Gwen Stacy (a beautiful and talented Emma Stone), the daughter of NYPD Captain George Stacy (Dennis Leary). After discovering an old suitcase and papers of a mysterious and scientific nature that belonged to his father, Peter goes to Oscorp and meets the one-armed Dr. Curt Conners (Rhys Ifans is excellent here), a former colleague of his father's, who is trying to perfect a serum to regrow lost limbs and rejuvenate health in order to save Norman Osbourne (he's not in the film by the way). Peter is bitten by a genetically altered spider, and gains spider-like abilities and senses, but no webs (he has to build those). <br/><br/>Peter helps Conners complete the formula with reptile DNA, but this causes Peter to shirk his duties at school and at home, so he fights with Uncle Ben (the great and wise Martin Sheen). Ben is then shot down by a thug in the street, after Peter let him go at after robbing a store. Peter swears vengeance, and hunts the criminal down, but never finds him (Oh dear! It's not like the original!) Peter makes a costume and becomes the vigilante Spider-Man, and while he helps stop thugs and other criminals, Captain Stacy remains determined to hunt him down. Peter eventually reveals his identity to Gwen, and they start dating (Wow, Garfield is so much luckier with the ladies than Tobey Maguire). Meanwhile, Conners is forced to test the serum on himself to avoid having it tested on innocent civilians. He unfortunately is turned into a reptilian creature called the Lizard, and he suffers dual personality disorder (Green Goblin remind you of anything?), and decides to turn everyone in New York into lizards, so Spider-Man has to stop him. <br/><br/>I won't spoil the ending, but it's very well done, and opens itself up for sequels. Director Marc Webb, who's only other director's credit is 500 Days of Summer, did a great job creating a gritty, modern-day Spider-Man. All the actors are superb, the action is great, the special effects are amazing (especially the first-person web swinging scenes), and the story is very well done. The film may follow the original Raimi films a bit too much, but that's only a small gripe. It's clear this new universe is headed in a different direction, and hopefully we'll get to see an even better sequel. Spider-Man, I liked you in the originals, but I like this new film just as much. Only time will tell which one is better.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: 9/10"

The effects of spider man swinging through the city buildings was brilliant! and probably my favourite part of this film a long side the library background fight going behind with what looked liked Stan Lee continueing his random movie appearances. I thought the end fight scene between lizzard man and Spider man was very well done, it was supprisingly jumpy at times (from my observations of the audience reactions) honest... Overall good film, great effects and actually might look out for more comic related features in future."
"Theshapeo31","3","2","5","12 August 2012"," Now I know how people who hate The Star Wars prequels feel.....
","I give this movie *1/2 Stars Out of *****<br/><br/>OK I'm 17 and I grew up with the original Spider-Man trilogy with Toby McGuire in the role of Spider-Man, along with my parents who were big Spider-Man fans growing up and my dad had the comics and I read them and I know that this is more based off the comics than any movie in the original trilogy and is more realistic but that doesn't save the movie.<br/><br/>On to the review, I was looking forward to this movie for a while from the time I heard about a reboot I was excited and on my birthday I saw it in theaters and what I saw was FAR from satisfying. Now I knew that Andrew Garfield wouldn't be able to touch Toby as Spider-Man but I didn't expect him to be that bad. Now the story is Peter Parker is being dropped off at his aunt & uncle while his parents go off, fast forward into the future he's in high school, he's picked on like in the original trilogy and all of that, he's in love with Gwen Stacy (who was his first girlfriend in the comics) rather than Mary Jane. He sneaks into Oscorp. To see her and is bitten buy the genetically enhanced spider and gets his powers and fights crime in the city and later Dr. Curt Connors/The Lizard. That's basically the plot of the movie and here are the problems I have with it.<br/><br/>Now the acting in this movie isn't bad at all or being close to it. To me the highlight actor of the movie would be Rhys Ifans (Dr. Curt Connors/The Lizard) when you see his conversation with Peter you believe he's just an underachieving scientist who wants to learn more about reptiles, to learn their secrets on regeneration and find a way to give that same ability to humans so he tries on himself but it goes awry. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy: I love seeing on-screen not just because she's beautiful but because that Emma Stone is a good actress I loved her in flicks like: Zombieland, Superbad, & Easy A & I thought she funny when she hosted Saturday Night Live and this movie was no exception I LOVED her performance as Gwen Stacy. Martin Sheen & Sally Field as his aunt & uncle were great parental figures to Peter (especially Martin Sheen, however I didn't hear ""with great power comes great responsibility""). And last and may possibly be least is the man behind the mask Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker/Spider-Man: now as Peter despite that I liked Toby better because I grew up with him in the role, & he showed a little bit more emotion than Andrew I still think that he was almost on par with Toby as Peter but as Spider-Man I HATED him (despite the few occasional funny moments) his costume was horrible, he looked like he was CGI at times, & he couldn't shoot his own webs. Now I know that this is more based off the comics and more realistic but I thought it was cooler that Toby could shoot webs by himself and not a power glove like web shooter, and his inhuman strength was amped to over the top as scene in the bathroom scene & when he got his powers Andrew just seemed like he already knew he had powers, what to do with them & as if he wasn't surprised, Toby seemed like he was freaked out by his powers and took him sometime to get used to them. The action scenes weren't much to me to at all, in the original his fights with the Green Goblin were fun to watch, in Spider-Man 2 his fight with Doc. Oct was spectacular & in Spider-Man 3 his fights with Harry, Venom & Sandman all of those fights were great but his fight with The Lizard was just boring. Well despite the few occasional funny moments & the very keen acting for a superhero movie this is the worst movie I've seen all year. Is it the worst superhero movie? No, I still think that The Hulk of 2003 holds that prize but this is a definite second."
"edisteam","9","2","5","11 August 2012"," Really amazing
","I grew up with 3 spider man movies,which i thought they were great. At first i didn't want to see this movie because of new actor and different story. But it was just amazing. For me new actor is better in the role of spider man,and it gives him new personality that is very interesting . Story was really great ,it was not all about fight and revenge ,story got me so interested that even with out fights it would be still great movie . Only thing that is still weird is his web ,after classic spider man it is hard to imagine him like this ,but it was not so bad . At the end I think it was great ,and I am really looking forward to see next part ."
"mchollandmatthew","9","2","5","1 August 2012"," brilliant
","the Amazing Spider Man is all about the life of peter parker himself as spider man with great story action drama its quite good for all the fans. this time around Andrew Garfield plays as spider man and hes not bad he was really good and Emma stone is amazing in it as well like other actors in this.this is quite action packed and funny i found this epic but a Little sad.this is ab-it of the same movie but a few changes and spider man first girl friend played by Emma stone very well. its good to bring kids about 9 because its a wee bit graphic with the injury's and stuff.great movie 9/10 its a lot beter than all of them. also its a must see to all spidey fans"
"tavm","7","2","5","30 July 2012"," Without making too much comparisons with the previous Raimi-Maguire series, I enjoyed this version of The Amazing Spider-Man
","So 10 years after the first Spider-Man that was directed by Sam Raimi and starred Tobey Maguire and 5 years after the third and last by that team were released, we now get a reboot helmed by Marc Webb and starring Andrew Garfield as the web-slinger. This time, we get some additional background concerning Peter Parker's parents when he was a pre-teen before being left in the care of Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field). Though we once again have Ben killed by someone Peter neglected to stop earlier when he could've, the part where he initially becomes a wrestler after getting his powers doesn't happen to this version of his origin story this time. Instead of Mary Jane Watson, we get Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) who this time knows Peter's alter ego from the beginning. This is a refreshing change from having previous men behind the masks keep their secret ID from their so-called girlfriends like with Superman and Lois Lane (though it's good to know that's not the case now in the current comics) or Batman and various of his girlfriends. Compared to Green Goblin and Dr. Octopus, The Lizard (Ray Ifans) doesn't seem so threatening though he still has a dangerous vibe, just the same. Oh, and for the record, I actually prefer Gwen who's very much of a brave heroine here compared to the often-damsel-in-distress-like fate of Mary Jane. I especially like some of the comic banter between her and Parker and also her father, a police captain played by Dennis Leary. Oh, and the scenes of Spidey swinging from building to building seem more realistic here compared to Raimi's more cartoony-like actions done by CGI. Not surprised to know that actual stunt men were involved. I don't really feel like comparing whether Maguire or Garfield make the better Frendly Neighborhood Spider-Man. I just appreciate the different takes both made in portraying such a legendary superhero. I only have some minor quibbles concerning logic: When Aunt May calls Peter on cell, Parker is still in costume with his mask on, so how can she understands what he says when his voice would be a bit muffled as a result? And how come we didn't see a funeral for Uncle Ben? Okay, otherwise, I did enjoy this reboot of The Amazing Spider-Man, even without seeing it in 3-D. So, yeah, that's a recommendation. P.S. I thought the Stan Lee cameo was another hilarious one..."
"xJags","8","2","5","30 July 2012"," A re-boot that beats the Original
","In 2002, Sam Raimi brought us Spider-Man and 10 years later Marc Webb gives us The Amazing Spider-Man, and that's what the film is - Amazing.<br/><br/>Peter Parker (Garfield)was abandoned by his parents as a boy and raised by his Uncle Ben (Sheen) and Aunt May (Field). Peter is also finding his way with his first high school crush, Gwen Stacy (Stone). As Peter discovers a mysterious briefcase that belonged to his father, he begins a quest to understand his parents' disappearance - leading him directly to Oscorp and the lab of Dr. Curt Connors (Ifans), his father's former partner. As Spider-Man is set on a collision course with Connors' alter- ego, The Lizard.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield is perfect for the role of Peter Parker and does a better job with the character than his predecessor, Tobey Maguire. He adds more emotion to the character. It is amazing to see his journey and see his character evolve. His goofy and shy personality contrasts well with the intensity he brings to Spider-Man.<br/><br/>Emma Stone plays Gwen Stacy, the love interest, daughter of Captain Stacy(head of police) and intern for Dr Curt Conners. The chemistry between Garfield and Stone is adorable and its very fun to watch to couple's love story unfold. Gwen is more than a damsel in distress as opposed to Mary Jane from the past movies. Her role is quite crucial in the movie and Emma Stone was a prefect choice.<br/><br/>Rhys Ifans plays Dr. Curt Conners, the antagonist of the film, and the alter ego - The Lizard. His life's work as a Biologist studying gene mutations quickly becomes his downfall as what he thought was a cure led to his demise. Ifans is a very satisfying villain and does a great job with the role.<br/><br/>I'm not a huge Spider-Man fan but this movie managed to persuade me. I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the character or in the mood for a good hero movie.With these young talents, strong performances by the cast, great special effects, a well written and well directed film, The Amazing Spider-Man is truly... Amazing."
"pedro-amaral-couto","9","2","5","29 July 2012"," The Lizard is surely the best super villain for the first movie
","This is not the typical super heroes movie careless with the plot. For instance, instead of the obvious archenemy Green Goblin, the best super villain for the Spider Man origin movie was chosen: <br/><br/>in the comic books, the amputated scientist Curtis Connors developed a serum from a reptile to regrew his lost limb, but he became a huge humanoid lizard in the process. That's why his the easiest villain to relate to Spider Man origin (and some maybe other villains). This was essential to make almost all story events caused by good reasons instead of mere coincidences - that's very unusual in super hero movies.<br/><br/>It was made a good job to show Peter Parker learning that he should take his responsibilities, clearly evolving through his experiences, struggling with his new powers and passing by the obstacles with the help of those he helped before. Little touches to remember one of the moral messages of the movie - responsibility - made the difference. But he's not alone: all characters change with the circumstances, changing their opinions about morality and the other characters. And there was no need for them to make stupid decisions for the story progression and stupid jokes for a young audience, who prefer fights and explosions.<br/><br/>Yes, this is one the few hero movies with a good plot."
"redryan64","8","2","5","28 July 2012"," Spinning A New, Big-Screen Web
","SO NOW, WE have the conclusion of the Toby Maguire chapter of the SPIDER-MAN franchise; but not without the passing the torch to new era. One series' having lived out its life and relevancy, it finds it being superseded by another version. Indeed, leads and casts come and go; but a SUPERHERO goes on and on and on and.......<br/><br/>BEING DEFINITELY WHAT one would have to classify as being, perhaps, old lone purists, we are seldom totally satisfied with any adaptation of a Comic Strip/Comic Book character to another medium; be it Radio, Television or the Movies. This may well seem to be an obvious sort of difficulty and yet one that is unavoidable and inevitable. Yet, we (that is I) always find myself giving any super hero cinematic project the closest of my microscopic vision's scrutinies.* <br/><br/>MOST FREQUENTLY, A PRODUCTION has had more positive elements than negative; hence, we usually can learn to accept the new version; at least for what it is. For if we want to see a completely true to the original comic adaptation, we should stick to the 4 colour, printed page.<br/><br/>IN DEFENSE OF this latest celluloid Web-Slinger, we appreciate the tone that was set early on. Peter Parker is a young man with a tremendous power; which has been thrust upon him, all without his asking.** Even though he is now a truly super-powered costumed Super Hero, that does not mean that he won't be having his own lion's share of problems in his personal life.*** <br/><br/>THE PRODUCTION TEAM should be congratulated for giving the Spider-Man legend a well thought out, serious treatment; without abandoning an occasional infusion of much needed humor,""comic relief"", if you will. They do so without causing an awkward bump in the scenario; rendering it as just a normal part of life. Afyter all, if we cannot have an occasional laugh, even in the most dire situations, we would not be human.<br/><br/>IN THAT AREA, we must mention that a high spot in the film came late in the action. It was the sequence that gave Spider-Man writer/editor/co-creator, Stan Lee his traditional Hitchcockian practice of doing an on screen cameo appearance. With this scene-stealer, Stan not only made his latest in film (coming toward the end during the big fight), but also his best, most substantial and most amusing guest shot! <br/><br/>ONE POINT THAT we have to mention is the establishing of Spider-Man's web slinging abilities as being a technological augmentation; rather than being a biological mutation; as had been previously shown in the last three SPIDER-MANS. (Perhaps you find this as being just a trifle picayune, but remember, after all, we are first and foremost a Comics Puirst and Hard Line Traditionalist!)<br/><br/>THAT THE VENTURE took us into area hereto for unexplored, was both a fine plot device and an area in the life of Peter Parker/Spidey that needed to be looked at. The retro-plot provided plenty of energy to drive the story forward and will certainly figure in the plots of future Spiodey sequels.<br/><br/>WE MUST COMMEND the producer and the casting department for a fine job in casting in not only in the leads of Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone & Rhys Ifans; but also for the inclusion of Sally Field, Martin Sheen and Denis Leary in the primary supporting roles. (One knows that Father Time has been active when we have the former GIDGET and THE FLYING NUN, now portraying Aunt May!!!) <br/><br/>SO, AS FOR the report card on this THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN flick, we cannot give it an ""A""; but we don't think a definite ""B+"" is out of order.<br/><br/>NOTE: * Origins, for example, don't have to be exactly as originally written, just as long as the main elements and the spirit of the character is retained and maintained. <br/><br/>NOTE: ** Recalling the old axiom that: ""Some men are born great, some men have to acquire greatness and some men have greatness thrust upon them!"" (Do you suppose that Spidey falls into the latter category?) <br/><br/>NOTE: *** In his 1966 book, THE GREAT COMIC BOOK HEROES, cartoonist Jules Feiffer referred to Spider-Man as being ""the Woody Allen"" of the Comic Book Suoer Heroes; reasoning that just because some guy has these preternatural abilities and wears a really neat costume, that it doesn't mean that he won't have acne and problems with the females of the species!!"
"mr-khanna","9","2","5","28 July 2012"," My speed-review on Spiderman
","Sequels always has my hair standing up on its end due to the mega disappointment it dishes out to you, when you are in a particularly lascivious and enormously ravenous mode post seeing an unbelievable movie before. Only in some cases is your appetite satiated and I mean really satiated (case in point being: Nolan's Batman series). And now with this Spiderman; my hair standing on its end at the close of the movie did a mean pirouette. Boy was I happy!! I was delighted!! And never did I feel anybody could up Tobey Maguire's act as a 'bumbling geek turned mean vigilante' act with so much finesse and sass. I love underdogs but this movie makes me want to be an underdog with oodles of brio wrapped in that Grey gloomy hood on my pate which drops down time and again. Getting down to the movie review; I am going to highlight a few departures from the earlier Spiderman movie.<br/><br/>Spiderman himself: Tobey Maguire was a geek until the spider comes along literally and spins a web... he he but despite becoming a Spiderman the nerd quotient stays in good measure and keeps him harnessed within the web.. he he enough of web jokes...the only time that we see his wild and impertinent side liberated is in part 3 when he is in the garb or influence of a black suited Spiderman. Tobey was the sort of guy you sympathized with, you loved to mother, you loved to pet. I am not sure if he was a lust and drool over sort of a man despite the spider suit. He had his shortcomings and these short comings were evident and were there for all to see. No masks and all. Enter the amazing Spiderman and truly the transformation of the character of Spiderman is amazing.<br/><br/>Very frankly I was certain that the oddball in an ill fitted suit; Eduardo Saverin read Andrew Garfield ( In Social Network) could not play the role of a Spiderman with as much aplomb as his predecessor did. He literally cast a web of magic over atheists like me. This Spiderman was more easy to relate to, more aspiration evoking, had oodles of spunk and well was amazing and the transformation does not hurt both the eye and sensibilities with an overdose. The man looks infinitely more handsome than the earlier guy. Sorry Tobey! Has mettle with a keen eye for body language (do notice the head tilts, the quivering lips, the guarded, reticent body language and such other gobs of tiny details weaved beautifully into his portrayal). His costumes - the Grey hoods, the sweat shirt with a thumb hole etc.. add dimensions to the character. He revels in his prowess yet wears it as coolly as a pin badge - remember the scene where he deals with the car burglar with a saucy talk, reading something perched upside down, working nonchalantly on a rooftop, lazing on a web hammock playing games on a cell phone while expecting a certain Mr. Lizard to show up. It's this celebration of self and its capabilities which make him super cool and confident yet not cocksure since mind you there is not a hint of vanity which paints this confident facade. Clearly bring the trumpets on and everybody else move over a new heartthrob is born; British American actor Andrew Garfield; blessed with panache, a certain endearing vulnerability, an easy charm, fantastic body language, lithe body and lightning quick reflexes make him truly amazing.<br/><br/>While Kirsten Dunst played the Mary Jane part in the earlier series... she was more plain Jane than Mary Jane, I thought. Now we have Emma Stone taking over the love interest part as Gwen. I am not a huge Emma fan, I feel she is forever stuck in the Olive Pendergrast role she played in Easy A and her dialog delivery and well everything else remains the same movie after movie. The dialog delivery with a weighty jaw really doesn't work for me. But well overall she is not bad. The scene where she looks expectantly up in the Grey, dreary sky slightly inching away the umbrella from her face hoping to spot her love while at her father's funeral was particularly mesmerizing. The story is good too, lot of earlier scenes have been incorporated albeit in sync with the mood and tempo of this movie. I also loved the fact that the web that springs out is made by Spidey himself and not attributed to his bite by the power induced spider. What truly sets this edition apart is the fact that this is not Grey, it's bright... what I mean that the earlier version was very grief inducing. Can't forget Peter walking away knowing that he has lost his love. Spiderman was unable to reveal his identity until a good 2 parts while this one shows that despite the promise made to his beau's dad Peter shows every intent on breaking it... lovers across the world cheer. Also Peter has no qualms in showing his identity to everybody; he is in fact without his mask more than anything else. And our own Irfan Khan plays the role of a mean sidekick to Norman Osborn kept in the dark in this part. He looks assured and his dialog delivery had no accent, thank god for that. Also special mention for the Coldplay song; till kingdom comes which makes an appearance at the right time when there is a superbly subtle romantic interlude between Peter and his love interest. The music accompanies his joyous finding of love. What then follows is an uninhibited swinging in a grim, abandoned industrial area atop metal chains. It's like he has found his love and also himself. It's a sort of a very celebratory moment. It depicts a very gay abandon, a self release – free as one can be."
"cm_anon76","6","2","5","28 July 2012"," Spider-man-child
","Spiderman in this movie seems to be a young adult who has been coddled by his parents. He doesn't seem to be able to deal with the real world. He's like a man-child.<br/><br/>When I think of heroes, I don't think of man-childs. There were kids in this movie who were more heroic, and more mature than Spiderman. There were actually a great number of characters in this movie who were more heroic than Spiderman. <br/><br/>Spiderman might have been the lowest common denominator. I think he might have dragged some heroic characters, including his girlfriend, down to his man-child level.<br/><br/>The end result wasn't pathetic. But it was dumbed down. But I guess a dumbed-down hero is better than no hero. A dumbed-down hero can still be a sane man in an insane world, and maybe even a genius."
"ajantakadam","9","2","5","26 July 2012"," Entertainment full on
","Spiderman being my favourite superhero of all time, I had to watch the new movie even though I wasn't expecting it to be anywhere close to Tobey's trilogy I was ready for the reboot.<br/><br/>I think Andrew could have probably done a much better job at being spider-man if he studied the character a little more. I believe he failed to deliver the true character of Peter Parker which is shy and friendly, and not arrogant and confident like he's portrayed. <br/><br/>That's just about the only flaw I found in this movie. The movie was extremely entertaining and delivered everything that you would expect out of it, action, story,comedy, romance and ""the want for a sequel"".<br/><br/>The visuals are worth every penny you spend, may it be a 3D version you've seen or the normal version. The chemistry between the actors is awesome. There are moments throughout the movie which will keep you at the edge of your chair.<br/><br/>It's one of the best made reboots, can't wait for the next part"
"jacksonh0608","9","2","5","25 July 2012"," The one fans have waited for
","So I've been reading all of these bad reviews on the new Spiderman movie and I just don't get it. What's so much better about the original trilogy than this one? NOTHING!! The original trilogy has nothing on this movie. Let's break it down. In the original trilogy we have Peter Parker who is so obsessed with Mary Jane it just gets flat out creepy, Mary Jane who is the worst friend/fiancé/girlfriend/actress in New York, Harry Osborn who... Well nobody really cares about him, and this list goes on! this film is a much better adaptation of the comic book story than the original (those who disagree, sorry you didn't actually read it). The actors were perfect in their roles and the characters are so much more likable. I especially like how Andrew Garfield nailed the witty banter and smart-ass attitude that Spidey is known for! Tobey couldn't pull that off (ex. ""It's you who's out Gobby, out of your mind!"".... -_-). If you watched the TV show or READ THE COMIC then you want to see this movie. Enjoy the ride, have fun, and hang on. It is everything it needed to be."
"Radagast23","9","2","5","25 July 2012"," Forget the previous movies
","A reboot after only 5 years? Well with how bad Spider-Man 3 was, why not! This wasn't the only reason I was intrigued by The Amazing Spider-Man though - in watching each trailer that came out, it just seemed like they had gotten this one right. I had nothing against the first two Spider-Man's with Tobey Maguire, after all they they were fun and basically kicked off the comic book movie assembly line. Even so, this time around you had the feeling they had discovered how much potential the character had, and that was reason enough to go see it.<br/><br/>Plot-wise, not a ton of surprises if you saw the original Spider-Man/the cartoon as a kid. Peter Parker is a reserved genius living with his Aunt and Uncle. He is mostly bullied and ignored at school, but that starts to change we he uncovers his father's research into cross- species genetics. This leads him to visiting his dad's old company, Oscorp, where his curiosity will change his life forever<br/><br/>Overall, this movie has everything we loved about the original, as well as doing all the small stuff better. For starters, Andrew Garfield is just a better Spider-Man. He has the awkward while being charming thing down. It was also a lot more gratifying to see the science (even though it's made up) being incorporated, while in the original it was literally just ""bitten by a spider = super powers."" All the high-flying action associated with Spider-Man is still there, it's just done with a sense of confidence and creativity that makes it fresh. Emma Stone was the perfect choice for Gwen Stacey. While it was different than the ""girl next door"" story with Mary Jane/Kirsten Dunst in the old one, having Parker go for a brainy girl whose Dad is a police captain was more interesting. Choosing Dr. Curt Connors/The Lizard as the antagonist was also a great choice. While I know very little about the comics, I remember him as the conflicted character from the show. That conflict of good and evil felt much more genuine that Norman Osbourne/The Green Goblin.<br/><br/>In the end, this might be the best comic book movie there is. Now Christopher Nolan's Batman movies are my favorite, and the best movies in my mind, but in what I think a comic book movie should befun, engaging, inspirational, a touch of hokey, genuinely satisfying this is up there. Do yourself a favor and go check it out!<br/><br/>9/10"
"Fearinahandfullofdust","9","2","5","24 July 2012"," Eff Sam Raimi
","It was comically accurate, minus the major plot points that Sam Raimi already ruined. He at least makes his own web shooters, and doesn't spend an hour and a half romancing with Mary Jane. Sam Raimi turned the Spider-Man I know and love into an oversensitive douche, and this movie helps set it right somewhat. The jokes are actually funny, which is a big improvement. Not sure what Raimi was going for with the jokes in his trilogy, but they did not work. Michael Webb effectively took a dump on the desk of Sam Raimi, and I was pleased. The fighting style even measures up to the comics, with the frequent low-kicks and creative use of webbing. The only reason it does not get ten stars is that Raimi ruined a few of the best parts of the movie, without consideration for anyone who might want to make a decent movie in the future. I mean, if he had said ""With great power comes great responsibility"" and made a big deal of it, it wouldn't have flown, because we're all tired of it from the first trilogy already."
"jdkraus","8","2","5","23 July 2012"," Like a fly in a spider's web...
","Another ""Spiderman"" film? Really? Only five years after the third one? Hollywood has shown time and again of reinventing original stories, including comics, and hoping for the best. Many have failed and a few have succeeded. ""The Amazing Spiderman"" reworks the rise of Peter Parker as the super hero, vigilante. The plot is essentially the same as the 2002 release of ""Spiderman,"" but the mystery of his parents is included (though unresolved at this time) and the CGI has vastly improved. There is also a new villain and cast. <br/><br/>I personally find Tobie McGuire to be a bland actor—even as Spidey. Andrew Garfield has taken up the new mantle and does an exceptionally better job. He physically transforms himself from the sympathetic Eduardo we have seen in ""The Social Network"" into a socially awkward yet fun Peter/Spiderman. It is obvious that he is enjoying himself every minute on camera, especially when he encounters a car thief about to hijack car. As the thief pulls a knife, Spiderman cowers and says, ""Oh no! You've found my weakness. Small knives!"" Then, squishsquish-squish-squish-squish! He incarcerates the man in webs.<br/><br/>The other actors in this film are not of the same caliber as Andrew Garfield, yet they add admirable diligence to their roles. Among them is Martin Sheen as Peter's Uncle Ben, Emma Stone as Gwen Stacey (no Mary Jane this time folks), and Denis Leary as the cop destined to capture Spiderman. The film itself moves at a steady pace and covers a lot of ground, but not enough to totally satisfy me. Things are still unresolved—no doubt intentional for a sequel. Yet again, another super hero franchise has caught my attention. I am trapped like a fly in a spider's web, curiosity still getting the best of me. Like millions of others, I will have to wait for the next film to learn the untold story of Peter Parker."
"MarcusJ13","6","2","5","23 July 2012"," Familiar and contrasting at the same time
","The Amazing-Spider Man is clearly a film that wants to bring the character back to roots completely. The problem here is that the story is very familiar given how recent Sam Raimi's films were and bar a couple of characters being replaced with new ones this one feels very familiar still. The difference here is a sort of pseudo realistic approach for the character. It was never going to be a case of Spider- Man being completely realistic as he is a man bitten by a radioactive spider and given superpowers while the villain is a man who's literally turned into a giant lizard. The partly realistic approach comes from the fact that there are explanations made for the suit and the webs are not organic and are now made mechanically by Peter Parker himself. Small details in the origin remain the same such as Uncle Ben, but the film does feel fresh. We do not actually see Spider-Man until a long while into the film and while this is not an unusual tactic for superhero films it simply felt like this may have been better suited to a TV series format as it paved the way for a massive change in shift once the villain storyline in particular got going. Action wise, the film looks amazing. There is great weight to the action scenes and there does feel like tension. All the actors did a good job with a special mention for Andrew Garfield in the title role. He managed to bring back the wit of Spider-Man in a very good way and I felt as if he delivered it well. At least I didn't find him annoying in the way he could have been. All in all the film is enjoyable, it does not blow you away however with more action it could have done. But it provided sterling entertainment and actually made the effort to tell a story without over indulging."
"Trwen","9","2","5","21 July 2012"," More of a Bad-Ass Spiderman
","After watching the movie last night with my gf, i could not help but think of how great Garfield was in the role of Peter Parker and Spiderman. To me, he has the package. What i liked most was how his interpretation was very close to the comics and the cartoons that i saw when i was a kid. <br/><br/>I understand that there are many critics out there saying that it isn't as good as the original. But in my opinion, nothing is as good as the first of anything!! Why? Quite simply because it is the Original. The power of the first impression of anything is as powerful as Coca Cola is better than Pepsi (Coke was first). And to me, that is the luck that Spider Man 1 will always have. Therefore, spiderman 1 is great on it's own right, but so is this!<br/><br/>I am very fond of the character development in this film, as i am in all films that i watch. I hate action movies when you don't truly understand the core of a character, and in this one. It is in far greater depth.<br/><br/>I liked how Peter Parker was still a shy kid when it comes to the girl, but at least has more courage to do something and step up. I liked how she knew his identity from early on. <br/><br/>The only negative for me was how Peter did not catch the guy that killed his uncle, and also that he took off his mask way too much.

","Like many people, I like to look up a movies review before going out to watch it with my mates to see if its any good. I usually get a good understanding from the users' comments and reactions to judge if the movie is worthwhile. Now as a movie buff, I do pay attention to many aspects of a movie such as the directing, editing, screenplay, dialog, and acting and make my decision on whether or not the movie is good on these criteria. Taking into consideration the movie is in fact a reboot, I understand there are a avid fans of the Raimi version that do not see the need for a retelling of an origin story again, and may feel the need to look down on Marc Webb's work. I was around 6 when the original trilogy began and I did enjoy it at the time but looking back at it now I just cant stand Parkers obsessive need to scream ""Mary Jane"" at the climax of every movie, or the fact that web shoots out of Spiderman's wrist and he never seems to get injured after a fight with bad guys. <br/><br/>Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight definitely raised the bar for all superhero movies with its realistic approach to the genre. The Amazing Spiderman does try to mimic it in a way but doesn't copy it outright as I read one review state. Marc Webb incredibly intertwines a darker, more realistic Spiderman with a teenage Peter Parker (who is portrayed outstandingly by Andrew Garfield) struggling his way through high school and all its obstacles. Peter is in fact an intelligent student as we see throughout the film who does eventually create the web shooters (part of this realistic approach I mentioned before) which also stays truer to the comic book. Whereas Raimi's Parker was supposed to be a geek with all his good grades, we were never made aware of his intellect on screen (except him actually attending class) nor his hero-esc characteristics before the spider bite. Webb's Parker on the other hand displays his intellect many times throughout the film and displays his courage while attempting to help a student from being bullied. I found Andrew Garfield's portrayal of Parker'a emotional journey outstanding. He continued to surprise me throughout the movie with his awkward charm and his representation of a teenager. Emma stone too deserves an applaud for her portrayal of Gwen Stacy as an actress who didn't just play a damsel in distress(MARRRRY JANNNE!!!) and actually aided the protagonist when he just had too much going on. Another shout out to Martin Sheen for his amazing acting (no matter how short it was), he definitely is the emotional backbone to this story and does an incredible job as Uncle Ben. <br/><br/>Other than the ""Amazing"" acting in the movie (see what I did there) the directing and editing where top notch too. The POV shots definitely were the most impressive aspect of the directing and I could not help myself drool a little watching climax of the movie. Spiderman's realism comes into play as he is in fact a spider(MAN)and damage takes its toll. Also the fact that Peter frequently gets bruising on his face after a fight with a bad guy or a certain lizard does make it effectively plausible. The fight scenes are choreographed extremely well and Spiderman's movement does in fact resemble that of a spider (who would have guessed Spiderman fights like a spider). This equality in action, character development, an emotional story is what makes this so Amazing. I felt myself feeling for these characters because of the their incredible ability to involve me in their story.<br/><br/>The reviews I read before going to watch the movie said that there wasn't really any reason to watch the same movie twice, and that it wasn't really worth it, but I could not believe how wrong they were after watching the movie. Sure, Raimi did a good Spiderman trilogy that explored the origins well. Personally, I think Webb started an ""Amazing"" Spiderman trilogy that explored the origins even better with all its extra content. ""If"" the series had continued on into a 4th I don't think it would have met the audiences expectations; as the third one proved. The all new characters are perfectly cast in their respective roles (Andrew Garfield even reminds me of the 1994 cartoon series that came on Fox Kids...That's how GOOD he is!!). For anyone having doubts on watching a reboot of Spiderman I strongly advise you to go and enjoy this new and improved Spidey before coming to any conclusion. For those who haven't seen the original I can guarantee that you will love it, no matter what sort of movies you like. <br/><br/>The culmination of great acting, story and directing lead to a movie that I feel is true to its name: Amazing!"

","Hollywood is sorta like a big factory building widgets(movies) and they have a certain quota to produce. These remakes are an attempt to fill their quota without much effort. No need to be creative! Just take a movie, any movie, add some new actors to it and voila! What a pile of horse manure. This movie should never have been made. The fight scenes are boring, the part where the construction workers all turn their cranes in certain direction to help a half dead spider man get back to fighting the lizard and save the girl was just so sappy it made me want to hurl. I read all the old Peter Parker(Spider Man) comics when I grew up and the Toby Macquire portrayal is more in line with the comic books. This movie made no sense whatsoever. Here is this mad doctor trying to find a way to make people stronger, and he's been looking for it for 40 years and all Peter has to do is wander into one of the doctors lab's filled with spiders and get bit and he's turned into Spider Man. In 40 years the mad scientist didn't get bit once....mmmm. Also the Lizard turned a whole bunch of police officers into lizards, why didn't they attack Spiderman as well. And what is the point in the Spiderman mask if he is telling every second person who he is. Hollywood and the whole movie industry doesn't value it's own work. Movies that should never be remade because they are works of art are redone for the sake of widget production quota's. There are countless great untold stories waiting to be turned into movies, but Hollywood chooses the easy way out. I gave this movie a 5 only because is did have it's moments."

","When director Sam Raimi stepped down as director of the Spider-Man movie franchise, Sony Pictures and Marvel Studios decided to revamp the film series and take it to a brand new direction. With a new director, new cast and crew, a new story and into ten years forward after the first film, the question was, ""what's the worst that could happen""? In fact, by the way I see it, nothing.<br/><br/>Watching The Amazing Spider Man is like seeing an old friend with old stories and new ones to tell. Connect one story to another, put them together and you get one fully-fleshed story in a new perspective. <br/><br/>There are changes from the first three films with having no Mary Jane, no J.Jonah Jameson and no Norman Osborne {although he's mentioned a little in this film}. But it is possible to watch this satisfying super reboot without having memories from the 2002 original. <br/><br/>Since his parents' death in a plane crash, Peter Parker {now played by Andrew Garfield} has long lived with Uncle Ben {Martin Sheen} and Aunt May {Sally Field}. In high school, he has a crush on Gwen Stacy {Emma Stone} and also, he's a target for bully Flash Thompson {Chris Zylka}.<br/><br/>One day, he discovers a suitcase with papers that belongs to his dad. Peter decides to finds out the secrets of his scientist father. To do that, he goes to dad's old job at OsCorp to investigate. While there, he goes into a modified spider lab. But one of the spiders bites Peter. Soon, weird things begin to happen as Peter discovers spider-like powers.<br/><br/>Then, one night, tragedy strikes as Uncle Ben is killed by a thief that Peter saw at a grocery store. Peter then decides to take action, so – first with a mask, then the spider costume- he tries to find his father's killer. But the police headed by Gwen's father {Denis Leary} thinks that Peter is a criminal trying to stop thieves. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, Peter's dad's former partner, Dr. Curt Connors {Rhys Ifans} is trying to regenerate limbs based on Lizard DNA. He tries to do the experiment on his left limb himself, but soon it makes him grow into a lizard. Peter -who is then now called Spider-Man- soon suspects that Connors is the lizard and he decides to find an antidote before The Lizard turns New York City into a land of non-human species.<br/><br/>Director Mark Webb {500 Days of Summer} and screenwriters James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves {Harry Potter film series} makes this reboot stand tall on its own two feet. They take the time well spent in the movie to develop on the story and they handle it well. They even beat a cliché from the original film series in the near end by not having Gwen being trapped by the villain while he fights with Spider-Man. <br/><br/>The film even shares some humor when Spider-Man is playing a game on his phone while waiting for The Lizard and when during a fight at school with The Lizard and Spider-Man, a school librarian {played by Marvel comics founder Stan Lee} is listening to some music and never sees and minds the fight.<br/><br/>Garfield inherits Tobey Maguire's role and he makes it his own. He put his own spin on the character and turns it into an electrifying, cool web.<br/><br/>Stone is radiant and delightful both on the outside and in the inside as Gwen Stacy.<br/><br/>Even though the actors are both past college age, Garfield and Stone take their high school characters seriously. The sparks on their romance fly here on screen as on off screen in real life.<br/><br/>Ifans is dynamic and sinister as both the large Lizard and the left limbless Connors. <br/><br/>Leary's strong policeman role makes a connection with the real life to the issue of having no real superheroes.<br/><br/>Field and Sheen hold their roles very well, respectively as May and Ben.<br/><br/>The camera work by John Schwartzman gives a remarkable scope to the flying and action sequences and makes the 3D version of the film worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>The special effects by Sony Pictures Imageworks does serve the story and succeeds in not having too much of it. <br/><br/>James Horner's score makes a fine and modest effort of not copying Danny Elfman's score from the original. <br/><br/>The film's moral is about finding about whom you are and what you're really made of. We all connect to that with Peter because we know who we all are not on the outside, but on the inside. <br/><br/>This is a perfect example of what a live-up-to-the-hype, powerful summer blockbuster should be. Please stay for the credits for a bonus scene. Trust me. You're gonna get ready for a sequel.<br/><br/>Rating: ***1/2<br/><br/>Parent Advice: Rated PG-13 for sequences of action and violence. Suitable for age 11 and up, if they don't mind the rating."

","Finished watching the Amazing Spiderman and i am pleased to say that the film actually works despite revisiting the previous plot points contributed from the previous films.<br/><br/>This film brilliantly captures the essence of the Spiderman story, a story that is fueled by emotional content rather then continues action scenes. The emotional concepts are contributed marvelously(yes pun intended)from the lead actors Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone.<br/><br/>While no doubt many will criticize the similarity to the previous films there are still many subtle differences, such as the characteristics of 'Garfield's Parker' to 'Maguire's Parker', Maguire captured quite effortlessly the sense of innocence that inhabits Peter Parker, however he could not capture the arrogance (quite evident in spiderman 3), this is where Garfield interpretation soars, Garfield performance creates the perfect balance between the emotional,arrogant and humorous characteristics which are fundamentals to Peter Parker/Spiderman character.<br/><br/>Emma stone also deserve praise for her performance, she embodies the character of Gwen Stacey in expertly fashion, conveying a character that that demands importance rather than being constructed for 'eye candy'. I don't want to degrade the previous films because I am quite fond of them but there is no denying Emma stones Gwen Stacy excels over Kirsten Dunst Mary Jane.<br/><br/>Yes there is also plenty of action and some quite captivating set pieces especially the fight in the high school, however it seems Webb has, in a sense, put the action secondary (despite the inevitable climax) which is a perfect choice because the entertainment exceeds from the effortlessly chemistry shared between Garfield and Stone.<br/><br/>Webb has successfully created a great film where we actually care about the characters. Maybe I suffer a sense of nostalgia as the previous Spiderman films are a treasured memory of my cinema experience, it was still captivating to watch the story unfold again.<br/><br/>The tracks have been set for the sequel, where now the writers can (hopefully) create a unique take on the spidey universe and rather then following the clichéd sequel degrader of going 'big', but rather keep the emotional investment they have created in this film."

"davidchisholm","8","2","5","12 July 2012"," A Dark Reboot: Spiderman Begins!
","I think the discovery of Peter's emerging powers is better handled this time around than in Sam Raimi's original film - Peter starts out with his hands sticking to everything and everyone - has uncontrollable webbing in which he has to create web shooters and has uncontrollable strengh which causes him to break things with little effort. like in the comics and original film a personal tragedy compels Peter to become a dedicated crime fighter while donning a costume. Meanwhile Doc Connors undergoes a transformation of his own after being pressured by a shady Oscorp employee he's forced to inject himself with his reptile serum that regenerates his arm but also transforms him into the nasty Lizard. I thought this film was well done. I enjoyed Sam Raimi's Spiderman films on a different level. Raimi's films seemed to have a more brighter atmosphere and used a lot of New York locales while Director Marc Webb goes for a more darker atmosphere and grittier side of New York. It's clear this film has a lower budget than the previous instalments. Andrew Garfield's portrayal was effective. He gave Pete/Spiderman an attitude and sense of humour. He could tap into the character's dark side better than Tobey Maguire did when donned the black symbiont for spider-man 3. Emma Stone does and excellent job as smart and resourceful love interest Gwen Stacy who is far more interesting than Kirsten Dunst's MJ Watson (or B.D. Howard's Gwen of Spiderman 3). She's definitely not the damsel in distress type. Rys Ifhan's Doc Connors is low key and somewhat creepy. Then again he is a mad scientist. The special effects on the Lizard are not up to par with part 3's Sandman and Venom but works on a ""B"" movie level. Denis Leary has some good moments as Gwen's police chief dad and veteran stars Martin Sheen and Sally Field are just fine as Peter's aunt and uncle. Overall a good comic book movie."
"Marc_Action","7","2","5","11 July 2012"," The Reboot is ""Amazing""
","I was never a fan of the Spider-Man Trilogy that debuted 10 years ago starring Toby McGuire, Kirsten Dunst, Norman Osborn, and James Franco. So when I learned a quick reboot was coming down the pipes I was somewhat on the fence about it. On one hand, I was eager to see if director Marc Webb could pull it off any better. On the other hand, I wasn't optimistic that any reboot this soon (and with some of the same production team members) would be able to let go of the roots planted by Sam Raimi's movies. I'm glad to say that I was wrong. I liked The Amazing Spider-Man. Was it a slam-dunk? No, but it succeeded in my book in besting the previous Spider-Man movies and blazing its own path. This movie succeeds because Raimi kept things simple. He didn't try to ""out do"" the previous trilogy and he had a solid cast in place along with nice special effects. So, in the theme of this film, I'm going to keep this review simple. <br/><br/>Here's what worked: 1. The Cast - Who could ask for a better cast? Andrew Garfield looks much more at home in the role as Spidey than Maguire did. But like Maguire, Spider-Man is sure to make him a household name. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy does a great job. She has a much greater ""on-screen"" presence than Dunst did as Mary Jane Watson, and she's prettier too! The chemistry between the two young stars is so hot and natural. I wouldn't be surprised if these two started dating in real life. And what can I say, both Martin Sheen and Sally Fields were great in this movie as the Parkers, but Sheen stole the show as Uncle Ben. Denis Leary gave a solid perform as Captain George Stacy of the NYPD and Gwen's father, and Rhys Ifan's performance as Dr. Curt Connors aka The Lizard was quite chilling. <br/><br/>2. Special effects (minus 3D) - Overall, the special effects were very good, and the Lizard villain, although obviously CG, still looked life-like and was not overly done. (He had a grin so very reminiscent of Heather Leadger's Joker in The Dark Knight (2008). Was it a rip-off? Nope, I actually like it.) 3. Simple, simple, simple. As I said before, the director kept it simple with this film. The main characters are all well-rounded and likable - even the Dr. Curt Connors, and nothing here is overly done. Note - the train ride home after Peter gains his powers is classic!!! <br/><br/>Here's what didn't work: 1. 3D Application - Overall I liked the special effects but really, the application of 3D in this film was seriously lacking. They could have shot this film conventionally and it wouldn't have made much difference. I saw more 3D effects in the 60-second previews that preceded the movie than I did in the actual movie. <br/><br/>2. Storyline/Plot - It's great that they changed up a lot of elements to ""try"" to make this movie stand apart from its predecessors, but there were a few things that were problematic for me and the plot was still anything but fresh. First off, the previews and the intro make it seem as if the movie will go deep into Peter's background and what happened to his parents. Well, it disappointed on that part. While I do like that things were simple, I think maybe his parent's story/sub-plot was a little too simple. In my opinion, their story only serves as a vehicle to set up Peter's spider bite. After that, they don't talk much about his folks, and we don't ever get resolution to what happened to them. What we did learn up to that point where Peter was bitten was just not very compelling. I guess they are saving something for the sequels to come, maybe? Secondly, the villain and chief antagonist in this film, the Lizard aka Dr. Curt Connors, reminds me too much of Dr. Otto Octavius aka Doc Ock from Spider-Man 2 (2004) with their Jackal & Hyde personalities and strikingly similar, twisted agendas. The Lizard's agenda also cuts too close to Magneto's agenda in the first X-Men film (2000). Plus what happens to Dr. Rajit Ratha, Dr. Connors evil boss? He clearly had malevolent intentions with Dr. Connors new drug but after being saved by Spidey from an attack by the Lizard, he is never seen in the film again. I also can't believe filmmakers are still using the ""high school bully gets his butt kicked by super hero that used to be a dork"" sub-plot (although one of the handsomest dorks I've ever seen). It's way past old and makes you think these people don't have a creative bone left in their bodies.<br/><br/>Go see the movie, despite a stale plot with holes bigger than a basketball, the charm of the characters and decent special effects make up for it. Just don't get too excited about it being in 3D, you'll hardly notice."

","This film is highly recommended.<br/><br/>""Amazing"" is such an overused adjective that rarely is in sync with its subject. The Amazing Kreskin...The Amazing Race...Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat...The Amazing Colossal Man...The Amazing Colossal Woman. Never achieving its own sense of greatness, the word attains a self-congratulatory smugness and usually leads to disappointment. And now we have The Amazing Spiderman, yet another trendy remake of a comic book superhero, a re-boot of this film trilogy that is barely a decade old!<br/><br/>Now, The Age of the Comic Book Hero Movie may seem like the latest fad, but it's been with us for years, although their emergence feels all too frequent due to the many misfires and hyperbole. These fantasy action blockbusters occur with such regularity that it's far easier to count the films that aren't from that genre than to observe the glut of fanboy extravaganzas that take up space in today's movie theaters.<br/><br/>( Yes, I do fondly remember, somewhere back in the fifties, between double features and sitting in the fourth row of the Palace Theater, being one of those very young and easily gullible movie fans, watching a national yo-yo competition after that first feature, as kid after kid would walk up on that stage to ""amaze"" the audience with tricks like Walking the Dog, Boingy Boing, and The Sleeper. ( I, on the other hand, being so uncoordinated, was lucky to get this spinning toy back up the string into my wet waiting palm! ) And then...we waited for the main event, the second feature to appear on the big screen: Superman and the Mole People ( starring George Reeves with his strings attached ) as our superhero conquered the enemies by actually flying in the air amid the squeals and shouts of all the neighbor boys in that crowded movie house. But I digress....)<br/><br/>The young audience of today is much more savvy and the expensive budget lavished on special effects are superior to those visible invisible wires attached to our superheroes that we chose to ignore as children. But the thrill is still the same for youngsters and, nowadays, oldsters alike. Which finally brings us full circle to our main event, The Amazing Spiderman, an entertaining and special film that takes its legend seriously and its source as gospel. It's popcorn entertainment alright, but with some degree of sophistication and unexpected joy. This time they got it right and The Amazing Spiderman, illogic withstanding, is one of the best action films of the summer!<br/><br/>I won't belabor the plot of the film as we have seen it all before, although there are some clever minor changes. Let's just say Peter Parker gets bit by that radioactive, or biologically engineered, spider and adapts to his life as misunderstood webbed crusader, meeting various nemeses and fighting against the forces of evil. The film truly takes flight in its early scenes of Spidey's self-discovery of his new strength and agility in these introductory phases. ( A delightful subway sequences uses humor and CGI to reinforce the elements of awe and wonder simultaneously as Parker's initiation into superhero mode begins. )<br/><br/>Some differences from the original: a new love interest, namely Gwen Stacy ( Emma Stone ), a new villain, The Lizard a.k.a. Dr. Curt Connors ( very well played by Rhys Ifan ), and, of course, a new actor in the title role, smashingly played Andrew Garfield. These additions help make this Spiderman 4.0 all the more enjoyable. High praise goes to the film's director, Marc Webb, who wisely invests in the characters and their dilemmas before much superhero action takes place. This makes many of the later scenes have more dramatic clout. The screenplay by James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent, and Steve Kloves adds plenty of subtle humor in its exchanges between the two lovers and creates an interesting conflicted villain who is not just the persona of evil. It is so refreshing that the director and screenwriters actually take the time to delve into the backgrounds of the characters involved before going into the fancy aerial acrobatic maneuvers and sci-fi plotting <br/><br/>They realize the human story is as important as the theatrics. It is the relationship of Peter and Gwen that elevates the film to an entirely different level from most ordinary comic book hero films. Although Stone and Garfield are too old for their teenage roles, they play off each other so well. Stone brings to her role a charm and intelligence that beguiles the audience. Garfield, pardon the pun, is a Marvel as Spiderman. This talented actor plays him as a rebel with a cause, a modern day James Dean in uniform. Garfield captures the pent-up energies of an adolescent loner with his gawky posturing and nervous tics. His ability to convey sensitivity and inner turmoil, plus his good looks, define this role to the max.<br/><br/>I would be amiss if I did not point out that here are some glaring inconsistencies throughout The Amazing Spiderman, who, I might add, is even a more ""amazing"" fashion designer with his seamless removable mask and sewing skills. Some minor villains and future plot complications are introduced and then disappear into that dark night. Photographed with a breathtaking fluidity by John Schwartzman, the action set pieces are exciting and well staged, with wonderful visual effects, but the climactic showdown defies logic and goes on too long. <br/><br/>The Amazing Spiderman definitely lives up to its own hype. It may not meet the ""amazing"" standard of excellence but it is a marvelous Marvel for us to behold. No strings attached.

"zardoz-13","7","2","5","10 July 2012"," The Dark Spider Rises
","Sony Pictures has ignored the old adage: ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."" Five years ago, the studio canceled the fourth installment in the Toby Maguire ""Spider-man"" franchise with original director Sam Raimi at the helm. Sony cited escalating production costs as justification for abandoning the series. Now, not only has Sony rebooted it with a different director and a different pair of leads, but also the studio has retooled it with a darker screenplay. You could call it ""The Dark Spider Arises"" because the filmmakers are channeling ""Batman"" in this entry. Unfortunately, ""The Amazing Spider-man"" isn't as amazing as the original ""Spider-man."" ""(5oo) Days of Summer"" director Marc Webb struggles with two problems: a lackluster villain straight out of a bad B-movie chiller and a drawn-out running time. Essentially, ""The Losers"" scenarist James Vanderbilt, original ""Spider-man 2"" scribe Alvin Sargent, and ""Harry Potter"" penman Steve Kloves have kept intact most of the best parts of the original. Dare they depart from the canon? Happily, they've have retained the radioactive spider bite, the confrontation with obnoxious Flash, and the marvelous web-slinging training sequences. Webb and his writers have put into effect some interesting changes. Ostensibly, except for a single close-up on a stack of newspapers, they have omitted the Daily Bugle newspaper. This time around they show Uncle Ben's murder in graphic detail, an event that occurred off-screen in the original. Further, they have made the heroic Peter Parker a lot smarter than he was in Toby Maguire's incarnation. <br/><br/>Along the way they have forged a few surprises, particularly with Peter's other romantic interest; Gwen Stacy has replaced Mary Jane Watson. Peter contends with new antagonists both natural and supernatural. The most prominent villain is Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans), while the second is Gwen's father, New York Police Department Captain Stacy (Denis Leary) who abhors vigilante interlopers and has nothing but contempt for Spidey. Unfortunately, the film stretches itself perilously thin in the final quarter hour into a 136 minute running time. Actor Rhys Ifans' maimed scientist villain is seamlessly mutated into a giant green lizard, but he lacks half of the ferocity that Maguire's adversaries provided him with in director Sam Raimi's trilogy. The Green Goblin was a lively, audacious adversary, but The Lizard is rather dreary. The special effects are terrific as is the cinematography. Although he is 28 years old, British actor Andrew Garfield looks more believable as a skinny teenager than Toby Maguire. Indeed, he would be fantastic as Norman Bates if Hollywood ever reboots the Hitchcock classic. <br/><br/>Several scenes stand out in ""The Amazing Spider-Man."" The scene on the Williamsburg Bridge when Connors mutates into the Lizard is one of the best, with the nimble Spidey compelled to save multiple characters. The most memorable is a little boy stuck in an SUV. What makes this instance so significant is that our hero identifies himself as Spider-Man to a grateful father (C. Thomas Howell) after he has rescued his son. When our hero rushes off to warn Captain Stacy about the malicious machinations of Dr. Connors, Stacy reacts with disbelief because Connors is Gwen's mentor. The scene where Spidey tests his new found abilities to leap and lung is reminiscent of Kevin Bacon's dance antics in the original ""Footloose.""<br/><br/>Martin Sheen is good as Peter's uncle, but he cannot eclipse Cliff Robertson in the Tobey Maguire origin. Gwen learns about Peter's alter-ego Spider-Man when he shows up battered at her room in a New York high-rise apartment. The chief difference here between the Tobey Maguire ""Spider-Man"" and Garfield's is that Gwen and he don't kiss with our hero dangling upside-down. One of my chief complaints about this slick reboot is the scene between Peter Parker and Flash. After Peter acquires his mysterious powers at Oscorp, he humiliates Flash on the basketball court and is summoned to the principal's office. Later, Uncle Ben reprimands our hero for wanting a little payback. Stan Lee shows up for his usual cameo. This time around he is in the high school library wearing head phones while the Lizard and Spidey tangle with each other."

","I didn't really feel an emotion connection with this movie. I just wasn't getting the impression that the Peter Parker character was that vulnerable before the transformation and afterwards Andrew Garfield still looked too lanky to be a convincing Spiderman. The famous ""with great power comes great responsibility"" quote wasn't even scripted in. That was too much of a deviation from the original comic book story.<br/><br/>Also there should have been more mention of the financial pressures faced by Aunt May after Uncle Ben's death. That would have really tugged on some heart strings.<br/><br/>There was was good visual special effects. But I think the voice of the lizard still sounded to human. The lizard also looked too much like a gorilla with scales, nothing like the comic book which looks more reptilian."

","Okay, well, going in I really had my doubts about this movie. I had enjoyed the previous Sam Raimi/ Tobey Maguire/ Kirsten Dust ""Spider-Man"" films (even the largely maligned ""Spider-Man 3"" (2007) was not without it's appeal) and I felt it was pretty redundant to retell Spidey's origins just ten years after they were depicted in the massively successful ""Spider-Man"" (2002).<br/><br/>However, I was pleasantly surprised. The origin story, while it covers all the familiar bases (nerdy teenager Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is bitten by a genetically modified spider and develops super-powers, his beloved Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) is shot in a street robbery convincing Peter to become a super-hero, he develops his powers by trial and error and eventually assumes his Spider-man identity), is dealt with in more detail than in the previous film version and it is different enough so that it still feels fresh. The film's principal villain, Doctor Curt Connors (aka The Lizard) is well portrayed by Rhys Ifans and Emma Stone makes for an engaging love interest, even if she is not really given enough to do. Andrew Garfield is great as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, giving a lanky agility to the role. His Peter Parker is much less of a nerd than Tobey Maguire's version, and feels closer to the character in the comic-books.<br/><br/>The special effects are pretty impressive and it all looks great in 3D and IMAX."
"mia09","7","2","5","8 July 2012"," My review
","Honestly? I went in to see this with low expectations. I did not think it was a good idea to remake a movie less then ten years after the original but that's just me I guess , there seemed to be a big hype about it and I was dragged along by my friends regardless. So last night I went to see it in a fairly 'out of the times' cinema, which left me with no other option but to see it in 2d. I would have liked to see it in 3d as the trailer for it portrayed the 3d as a promising factor to the movie, but I got over that fairly quickly. ) <br/><br/>Andrew Garfield wore the role of Peter Parker almost flawlessly. It suited him to the tee. As well as getting most girls hearts to flip over by his edgy yet soft look, he probably made some men quiver with jealousy in their seats if they saw the look on most of their girlfriends faces. <br/><br/>My main problem with the characters was Emma Stone as 'Gwen Stacy' . I mean I love Emma Stone as an actress herself and she did a very good job don't get me wrong but , what happened to Mary Jane! Maybe its just me but Mary Jane was a much more lovable character then Gwen Stacy. <br/><br/>When it comes to the character of The Lizard / Dr. Curt Connors (played by Rhys Ifans) he was done well enough. I thought he as a lot less threatening then the past villains of the spider man movies but I thought he was lacking character.<br/><br/>Another problem I had with this movie was spidery's suit. The web didn't come out of his fingers. It came out of this metal thing attached to his suit. The fudge? <br/><br/>I thought the movie was a lot more child friendly then the last ones. The whole movie also seemed to take a little bit of a bypass when it came to the way it was done in the old movies. What I'm trying to say here is , it was a lot less comic like. <br/><br/>Anyway over all I thought it was a pretty good movie with a good story line. Also I thought the director Marc Webb (How Ironic ) did a very good job."

","Being a big fan of the previous franchise, I held high expectations heading into the theater for The Amazing Spider-Man. I have to admit that those expectations were met by an exceptional cast and well written storyline. Andrew Garfield is the ideal selection for Peter Parker and Emma Stone was very good in her role as Gwen Stacy. The two should be able to carry the film trilogy with ease. Although most of the storyline feels repetitive given that we are only five years removed from Spider-Man 3, this trilogy will look at Parker's development with Gwen rather than Mary Jane, and will also look at the past of Parker's parents and how it impacts Peter's life. These storyline developments were engaging and enjoyable to watch in the movie so credit to the film's writers with that. Lastly, the action in the movie was very entertaining and The Lizard was a relentless villain that added to the movie's consistent entertainment. An excellent remake overall that sets a strong foundation for what should be a great franchise."
"faisal_khatib","7","2","5","8 July 2012"," It won't blow you away, but it'll keep you entertained for those two hours.
","Disclaimer: I am a Tobey McGuire fan. I liked the first two spider man films and found the third installment atrociously bad (i.e. story wise). A reboot five years later did not make sense especially since the whole idea behind it seemed inclined towards making it a 3D extravaganza. Also, isn't the Lizard a second class villain?<br/><br/>Peter Parker (Max Charles) aged four is playing a game of hide n seek with his father Richard Parker (Campbell Scott) when he discovers his dad's study room in a mess. Realizing that there was a break-in, Richard Parker and his wife Mary Parker (Embeth Davidtz) leave Peter at his Aunt May (Sally Field) and Uncle Ben's (Martin Sheen) house while trying to flee an unknown (to us) enemy. Fast forward and Peter (Andrew Garfield) is all grown up into a nerdy college student who's got a passion for photography, science and his crush Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). Stumbling on his father's old briefcase, he finds a photo of him with a colleague named Dr. Curtis Connors (Rhys Ifans) along with some secret documents. Sneaking his way into pharmaceutical company named Oscorp; Peter impresses Connors, eludes his crush and gets bitten by a genetically modified spider. And, we all know what happens next.<br/><br/>As evident, 'The Amazing Spider Man' is an origin story where we revisit the college years of Peter and his transformation into your friendly neighborhood hero Spider Man. It was the year 2002 when Sam Raimi introduced us to the Web slinging franchise. With Marc Webb at the helm this time, he had some pretty big shoes to fill just a decade later.<br/><br/>With a story more inclined towards the comic book, Webb managed to bring something different in comparison. More time is spent showing the teenage angst of Peter as he stumbles through his new found abilities such that you tend to prefer Peter over Spider Man. This favor-ability dually also lies with Andrew Garfield's brilliant act. He embodies the role of Peter with natural, genuine charm ranging from being a typical teenager to a tentative lover, a volatile nephew or a faltering hero. As Spider Man, he fails to blow you away as he lacks the screen presence you expect from a superhero. <br/><br/>Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy was a huge improvement as a love interest. There was no screaming 'damsel in distress' moments that had become such an integral part of the previous trilogy. You instead get some smartness and humor with bucket loads of chemistry between her and Andrew which does become one high key of the film.<br/><br/>The Jekyll and Hyde combo of Dr. Connors and The Lizard is a mixed bag of good human presence and bad reptile representation. Rhys Ifans is good as Dr. Connors and his transformation to the dark side seemed promising. Unfortunately apart from some in your face 'jumpy' scenes, the design of the Lizard was disappointing especially that humanoid face.<br/><br/>Denis Leary as Gwen's father Captain Stacy was good as the authoritative police figure without any over the top attics. Veteran actors Martin Sheen and Sally Field were well cast and were good in their lovable warm interpretation of the characters. Irrfan Khan as Norman Osborn's minion Rajit Ratha was wasted.<br/><br/>With lots of web slinging action, it's hard to go wrong with 3D. Fortunately 3D was not overly used with it being limited to the action scenes only. Cinematography and camera work was brilliant and the soundtrack went along perfectly. Screenplay and those witty dialogues were spot on. I really like the comic book touch of inane wisecracks during action scenes from Spiderman. Talking about the action scenes, they might not be 'The Avengers' level of awesome, but are fun to watch nonetheless.<br/><br/>CGI was substandard to say the least; something you don't expect from a big budget summer film. A little investigation leads us to the culprits, i.e. Sony Pictures Imageworks who were behind the eye-sore 'The Green Lantern'. Some of the plots (spider suit for example) seemed rushed and unexplained while some of them were just unnecessary placed into the script to lead to something more dramatic. And, even though the story is well paced, a running time of 136mins does push it a little far.<br/><br/>It clearly helped cast good actors when the idea of rebooting this franchise popped up. The Amazing Spider Man is an enjoyable and a somewhat refreshing take on the story already told a decade ago. It won't blow you away, but it'll keep you entertained for those two hours."
"ghost_dog86","6","2","5","7 July 2012"," His only weakness is the ladies.
","Entertaining, but very unimpressive, the Spider-Man franchise reboot ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" may only be interesting for anybody under the age of ten. Working with an average script (containing too many one liners for my taste) Marc Webb directs this version with a CGI first mentality, which does become overwhelmingly distracting over time. In Webb's version, Spider-Manwell, if you don't know the story of Spider-Man by now then you probably have a life and aren't going to see this version anyway; therefore, I'm not going to waste ink explaining it to you now. So, if you are familiar with the 2002 version, the only elements that differ in this latest version are as follows: scenes which develop more of an origin story dealing with Peter Parkers parents, Peter Parker's relationship with Gwen Stacy (as it was in the original comic) and Spider-Man (played by Andrew Garfield) and his battle against one of the lamest villains in the series: Dr. Curt Conners aka The Lizard (who isn't even wearing the signature white lab coat). I will say this, if you are expecting a darker remake, you will be sorely disappointed. If anything Raimi's version was darker and this one is much more kid friendly. So let's get to the point; does the heavy CGI and the slightly revamped storyline set ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" apart as one of the best summer super hero films in recent years? No, not really. Simply stated, as a Marvel superhero film, it falls somewhere under ""The Avengers"" or ""Iron Man"", but still ranks higher than the catastrophe that was ""Captain America: The First Avenger"".<br/><br/>OK, so this isn't so bad, in fact it was more or less entertaining throughout, due to some funny bits of dialogue and engaging performances from the entire ensemble. The problem here, which will resonate time and time again in the minds of anyone who sees ""The Amazing Spider-Man"", is how this reboot isn't on the same level as the 2002 version, and furthermore doesn't even attempt to set itself apart from that version, as a good reboot should. I hate to constantly be comparing this version to Raimi's 2002 version, because I'd rather review this title on its own merits, BUT since ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is only ten years removed from a far too similar version (and only five years removed from ""Spider-Man 3""), I would be pretty naive to even attempt to avoid comparisons to ""Spider-Man"". So, let me get this comparison thing over with now: 1. Toby Maguire (Seabiscuit) plays a better (nerdier looking) Spider-Man than Andrew Garfield (even though Garfield is remarkably believable as a teenager).<br/><br/>2. Sam Raimi's vision compared to Marc Webb's by the numbers, CGI driven (befitting a Green Lantern sequel) film, was truly the sign of a more accomplished director who wanted to do something different with the beloved Spider-Man character. In short, Webb's version looks like the old one, and Raimi's looks like the revamped, more stylized, reboot.<br/><br/>3. The witty writing style of David Koepp (Mission: Impossible, Angels and Demons) definitely was a huge factor in bringing the 2002 version out of the cartoonish television realm. As for the playful screenplay, which really brought ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" back down to a more child-friendly level, written by the team of James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves, while does tell a more accurate story, doesn't contain the same level of life Koepp's script had (I don't know how else to say it).<br/><br/>The fact is that the only real improvement from ""Spider-Man"" to ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is the performance of Emma Stone playing Gwen Stacy, which is a substantial improvement over Kirsten Dunst (Marie Antoinette) as Mary Jane Watson. So, there you have it, 2002's ""Spider-Man"" was an all around better version and I challenge anyone to argue against anything I've just said.<br/><br/>Side Note: The problem with rebooting an immensely successful franchise not a decade afterwards, is that unless it is remade to be so drastically different in story or tone (aka what Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight series did for the Batman legacy) it will always be seen as a disappointment or simply unnecessary. In fact, the way this film plays out, a strong argument could be made that the ONLY REASON a new Spider-Man film was made at all (and so soon) was because Sam Raimi's speculated ""Spider-Man 4"" catastrophically fell apart a few years ago.<br/><br/>Final Thought: While I do commend these filmmakers for attempting to bring forth a Spider-Man remake whose story is almost entirely built off of the ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" comic books (a storyline all but ignored in the Raimi's trilogy) I still don't believe that that is a strong enough reason as to why this reboot/remake needed to be made, or watched (by anybody not into superhero films) for that matter. Also to make things worse, there is no need to stay for the teaser after the final credits roll, as it's one of the most disappointing and confusing since the inception of the superhero end credit teasers.<br/><br/>Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

"lilmandecicco","9","2","5","7 July 2012"," Every decision leads to a consequence
","The Amazing Spider-man isn't supposed to be a reboot to the previous films. It's supposed to reinvent the original comic book story of spider-man and it succeeded.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie is telling about the rise up from normal loser Peter Parker to new mind set Peter Parker. Peter (Andrew Garfield) has a normal life filled with a bully, a passion of photography, and a long time crush. All of this changes when he helps his Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) clean up the flooded basement. It just so happens that when Peter was a child and when his parents left him at his Aunt and Uncles that his dad had his Uncle hide his briefcase filled with secret documents. Peter finds the documents in the basement buried and he searches through the bag only to find clues from his (now dead) fathers past. He finds out from his uncle that his father had an associate and a best friend who was trying to find a way to enhance human capacity of strength and life.<br/><br/>Peter makes his way to Oscorp where Dr. Curtis Connors (Rhys Ifans) works at. Peter ends up impressing the doc enough that the doc lets Peter into his house after he tells him that he's Richard Parker's son. Peter figures out the algorithm that will lead to curing any weakness in every body. Peter ends up getting bitten in Oscorp by the way by a genetically enhanced spider and that is how he gets his powers but it's not like he just instantly knows how to use them. There's a subway (accidental) fight that proves Peter doesn't know yet how to use them. After changing into a whole different personality and being distant from his Aunt and Uncle he ends up getting his uncle shot. He feels so bad about his uncles death that he makes a mask and goes out into the streets to find his killer. He ends up realizing his destiny to become the city's protector. Doctor Connors is then told through that week that his experiments are being shut down and terminated. So the doc experiments on himself in hopes of mutating his lost arm back. He succeeds....with a price. He overdoses and thus creates the lizard.<br/><br/>My favorite scene through the movie is (spoiler!) when Peter gets shot in the leg after the captain orders SWAT to hold fire and one of the SWAT members hesitate. Then Peter, bleeding out, tries to climb up a building up to the roof. There was a scene before that part where Peter saves a little boy from a burning car. You have to know that little extra sentence because that little boys father just so happens to be a construction worker. He tells every one of his coworkers to help Spidey out with getting from the roof of that building to Oscorp by swinging off of their cranes. Peter figures out that they're trying to help him and in slow motion he runs on the roof towards the ledge cueing the heroic music and jumps in hopes of swinging off of his webs on the cranes toward Oscorp.<br/><br/>This movie may be a remake but it is hands down the better first part of the Spider-man movies than the actual first Spider-man movie."
"Bruce722","9","2","5","7 July 2012"," Great but could've been epic:
","This was an outstanding movie and, in my opinion, better than the Spider-Man of a decade ago. I enjoy the way Andrew Garfield portrays the Peter Parker character much more than Toby McGuire. He is not such a dweeb, is more charismatic, wittier, and just a better actor in general. And thank you to whoever decided to use Emma Stone as the romantic/love interest. Not only is she one of the best young actresses in Hollywood but she is absolutely stunning. Much more believable for the role of the beautiful ""damsel in distress"" than Kirsten Dunst. I'm sorry but I am not a fan of Dunst and don't understand why people find her attractive. I also though the rest of the cast was great. Denis Leary and Martin Sheen almost stole the show. The director also made the physics more realistic. With the exception of a football bending a goal post in half, the physics felt more authentic throughout, not only the combat but also just the gliding through the city shooting out webs. I also liked the plot development. I had a friend mention how they prolonged the ""origin"" too much for his tastes but I actually enjoyed that a lot. If they are making this into a trilogy, there's plenty of time for Spider-Man moments but you can never come back and capture the beginning stages of the superhero and the person behind the mask. Ultimately, the only thing that held this movie back for me was that it felt like we've seen it before. Other than some minor alterations to the story and obviously different actors, this was very similar to the one a decade ago and more than anything, it felt like the older one. I thought it was better but not by much, mainly because it had the same overall feel and tone. I would've much rather had them take the Spider-Man story they had here and made it a little darker and more intense and dramatic. There is plenty of potential there but they don't take advantage of it. Instead, you essentially have yet another little kid/teenager superhero movie. Out of all of the superhero movies being made, it's definitely the least mature of them and that holds it back for me. Give Christopher Nolan this story and he'll make it amazing."

","As a person who constantly yearns for new ideas, new stories, and new adventures, I found myself questioning my own morals in this film. When I look at the movies that have come out this year and are soon to come out, I see one word - unoriginal -- The Hobbit, The Dark Knight Rises, Les Miserables, Rock of Ages, Skyfall, The Hunger Games, and The Avengers. The last two have broken into the top fifteen US box office champions of all time! It's amazing how books, redo's, and sequels can be so wildly successful and yet so disconnected to originality.<br/><br/>Tonight, I witnessed something beautiful and magnificent beyond belief however. I saw how two wonderful actors - Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone - could turn an extremely overdone and unnecessary reboot into something more lovely than any previous version. <br/><br/>This is a completely original take on an overused classic tale, and it is solely due to the power of the main two actors. I don't know how to thank both of them enough. Expect your first Oscar nominations to both of you this year.<br/><br/>To the Amazing Spider-Man and Gwen. My heart goes forever out to you <3"
"maneckk-414-209658","7","2","5","6 July 2012"," An amazingly intelligent Spiderman
","Amazing Spiderman is well ... definitely amazing in its special effects, art direction and Andrew Garfield's characterization. My generation has grown up on the Spiderman cartoon which used to be aired on the only Doordarshan channel every Sunday evening. In anticipation for the movie to start I was humming the song, ""Spiderman Spiderman, does whatever a spider can, spins a web any size, catches thieves just like flies ..."" when my confused son told me stop. I say he was confused because first, I was singing this ancient song and second, he was expecting to see Tobey Maguire and was not sure if Andrew Garfield was the real one. Coming back to the movie, the amazing Spiderman is different from the ""original"" Spiderman. The amazing Spiderman takes the same path as the original story where Peter Parker is the school geek bullied by jocks and has a huge crush on one of the prettiest girls on campus. The more visible changes are, introduction of Peter's parents (which actually explains his inclination to science), the absence of Mary Jane and her being replaced by Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), the loudmouthed editor of Daily Bugle J. Jonah Jameson is missing & even though Uncle Ben is murdered by a fleeing burglar, the background is slightly different. The biggest metamorphosis from the original however happens due to Peter Parker's (Andrew Garfield) characterization. Andrew Garfield is way cooler than Tobey Maguire; he definitely has more attitude, even when he is being bullied or speaking to his girlfriend's dad. He is intelligent and not just a product of destiny (actually works on a machine to enhance his web's strength and slinging mechanism). And, he is much more human, the black eyes & wounds on his face are proof enough that he gets hurt while fighting a much stronger enemy. Peter Parker as a character is strong in his hooded jersey and does not beg for sympathy from the viewer, but at times I felt he was too detached and lacked emotional content. At time it seemed he hardly cared about secrecy and was more like a show off which definitely increased his appeal. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy is a welcome change with her pretty face and subtle sarcasm; looks very promising and complements Andrew Garfield with great chemistry. Denis Leary as Captain Stacy gives an impactful performance as police captain and father of an intelligent girl dating Spiderman. We have our very own Irrfan Khan as Rajit Ratha running Oscorp in a no nonsense role, but fails to make an impact and seem a little stiff in his dialogue delivery. The one handed Dr. Curt Connors played by Rhys Ifan is believable and cunning but as a villain The Lizard is just plain repulsive & huge (Green Goblin from the original can kick his ass anytime). Marc Webb's (known for 500 Days of summer) direction is commendable, though I can't help but feel that he was chosen to direct a web-slinging adventure more so because of his last name. Another strong character which made a statement for me (more so because I am an architect) was the Oscorp Headquarter building with its ultra modern systems (like a really cool touch screen access control lock). Standing right in the heart of Manhattan (New York) the imposing building form signifies the power of a company like Oscorp. In the climax sequence it definitely seems to be the jewel on the crown of Manhattan's skyline especially in the 3-D version when the camera moves over the needle of the building. That was one of the best city shots I have ever seen in a movie. Though I still miss the original Spiderman, the current day superhero is more believable, intelligent, stronger at the same time human. At the end of it my son asked me question which made me think. He said, ""Papa why did the good doctor uncle become a bad lizard"", making me wonder that we all have good and bad sides to our personality. After all there are no bad people, just bad situations."
"hunterhayes49","9","2","5","5 July 2012"," The Re-Boot We Deserved, But Not The One We Needed Right Now
","I've heard the statement, ""Better than it has the right to be"" regarding this movie. In a sense, I agree with this. Is it early to be revamping such an incredibly successful franchise that had no reason of being changed? Sure. However, as a stand-alone film this is a nice entry to the Spider-Man universe. I was apprehensive about a year ago regarding this film. Hell, even three or four months ago I wasn't sure. But, being a big Spidey fan, I decided to check it out. I sat amidst the cheering fans, foaming at the mouth for the midnight premiere, decked out in Spidey attire. It brought out a child-like sense of enthusiasm, surrounded by a theater packed with people just as apprehensive, yet supportive as I.<br/><br/>After walking out of the theater, I couldn't quite pin my thoughts on it. I had to let it sit for a couple of days before I could dole out my full review on this film. With that said, my general consensus regarding this film has remained. I really liked it. It's not perfect, by any means. But for some reason, this movie impressed me a lot. I think for the most part the casting with this was spot on; Garfield does a good job in separating his Peter Parker from what we've seen in the past. Emma Stone is great, as usual, playing Gwen Stacy. Garfield and Stone have pretty good chemistry on screen, and it plays out well for their respective characters.<br/><br/>I've tried not to let myself be swayed by other's opinions towards this film, but that's difficult considering how polarizing this film seems to be. It's not the ""Untold Story"" it was advertised to be, but rather the beginning to a story that will span over three films, at least. This change came, reportedly, late in editing due to negative reaction to the changes to Peter's origin story. The film still hints strongly at an underlying story with Peter's parents, from his father's involvement with Oscorp to the spider's the engineered, which indirectly give Peter his powers. It's clear something else is at play, something far more elaborate.<br/><br/>The story itself is pretty well balanced in regards to how things happen. Peter is left by his parents, then later indirectly finds his father's briefcase. It contains an equation, along with other goodies, that could help the cross-breeding project he and Dr. Curt Connors had been working on. Peter finds it and goes to Oscorp to find some answers, but instead impresses Dr. Connors, gets bitten by a Spider and is forced to leave. He comes back to Dr. Connors with a working equation to help his research, and more information is revealed about his parents. This equation leads to Peter accidentally creating the Lizard, a villain he has to stop. Peter is essentially left in the dark about his father's involvement with Oscorp, and why they left him. Developments towards his parents will undoubtedly continue, spanning the rest of the series. That pretty much sums up the ""Untold"" part.<br/><br/>The rest of the film plays out pretty closely to what any fan has seen from Spider-Man before. While the re-boot may not have been necessary, it's a pretty damn good one. The future is promising for our beloved Web Slinger, he's in good hands."
"lilizzy","9","2","5","5 July 2012"," I thought it was very well done.
","When I watched the first three Spiderman movies I was very disappointed with the writing and when I heard that they were already rebooting the Spiderman series I prepared myself for a new train wreck similar to the third movie from the last series. So when I stepped into the theatre and saw one of my most favourite films of 2012 I was a bit surprised.<br/><br/>The writing was great and everything that happened in the film made sense unlike the last three movies. The acting was also amazing and the emotions displayed by the actors were real. I think that Andrew Garfield played a great Peter Parker and Emma Stone Was fantastic as Gwen Stacy. I heard the C.G. in this movie was bad but I found it quite good and it never made me lose focus on what was happening.<br/><br/>I think that the only downside to this film is its length. It was somewhat boring at parts but overall it was interesting and action packed! I really loved this film and I suggest you go see it."
"JBlueNote","8","2","5","3 July 2012"," Truly ""Amazing"" Reboot
","Let's see if I can use the adjective in this movie's title until the very end of this review. <br/><br/>Well that movie was just....phenomenal. I really enjoyed this one and to be honest going in, I didn't think I was going to from what I saw from its previews. The story, I felt, was closer to the comics than the other 3 previous movies were, and I barely read them. Andrew Garfield did an excellent job as Peter Parker/Spiderman. I'm still undecided on if he did a better job than Tobey Maguire, but he was about just as good. Emma Stone did awesome as Gwen Stacy and still had me having, and probably many others, the biggest crush for her. The only flaws I kind of had with it was that instead of using the webbers from his own hands like in the comics, this version of Spider-Man had to use these techno-gadget like ones that I'm still confused on how they worked exactly. I also did kind of feel like there would be more fights between the main villain and the protagonist, but I somehow it still fulfilled me. Of course the ending was a cliffhanger, and like the Marvel movies nowadays, there were clues to the upcoming sequel (if there will be one). I'd definitely recommend this movie if you're ready for a new type Spider-Man. Just like I said about going in not having high expectations for this movie, I felt really ""amazed"" leaving this movie. If I were to rate it, I'd give it a 7.8/10."
"jaguiar313","7","2","5","3 July 2012"," A flawed film elevated by Garfield and a terrific last act.
","I liked Raimi's Spider-man movies, especially the first two. So, I was a bit apprehensive about The Amazing Spider-Man but, went in to this reboot with an open mind. And while there are problems here and the film has flaws, it also has great potential and Andrew Garfield does a terrific job delivering a fresh take on Peter Parker/Spidey. Since my biggest problem was with the retelling of the origin, that bodes well for the next movie if done right. The problem I had with the origin is not that it is done differently but, to be honest, I don't think it really clicked. It seemed clunky and awkward and it just didn't grab me. They were trying to bring together elements concerning Parker's father and Peter himself into the main story and it seemed a bit forced, it didn't drag me in. Another part of the origin that didn't work for me was his relationship with his Uncle Ben. As Uncle Ben is also an important part of Peter's transformation, their relationship needed to be stronger and I never got a sense of how important they were to each other. One of the reasons is, I felt that the usually terrific Martin Sheen was miscast here. He just doesn't give Ben the charm and quiet strength that Cliff Robertson brought in the Raimi trilogy that made his importance to Peter believable. Their relationship isn't given much screen time and It never strongly establishes their bond. Sally Field's Aunt May fairs better although, once the plot is in full swing, she doesn't get to do more then look concerned as Peter comes home at odd hours with some battle scars from his superhero activities. The film really doesn't come together and really start to work till Parker begins to establish himself as Spider-Man and his relationship with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) starts to form. Here director Marc Webb (A guy named Webb directs a Spider-Man movie, how's that for a happy accident.) really brings it together and delivers. Garfield and Stone are great together and have a great chemistry. Stone is far more interesting then Dunst as Mary Jane and makes a far better match for Peter and a far spunkier heroine who doesn't stand on the sidelines waiting to be captured by the villain of the week. Gwen gives Peter a much needed emotional positivity in his troubled life and it's easy to believe that she gives him the strength to be a true hero and much more then just a wisecracking vigilante. Not that that stage isn't fun too. Rhys Ifans is fine as the noble Dr. Curt Connors whose quest to better the lives of the handicapped, including himself, leads to his emergence as the Lizard. Connors could have been a bit more threatening to a degree but, it worked for me that his core intentions were still good despite being twisted by the Lizard's rage and the maddening effects of the serum. He wants to turn us all into lizards with the best of intentions. And his CGI alter ego was impressive and came across as a dangerous foe for our freshman superhero. The numerous confrontations between the two were well done and escalated nicely till the big finale which really soars and Webb surprises us with how well he presented the action. And let us not forget a really good turn by Denis Leary as Gwen's dad, Captain Stacy. He has minimal screen time but, gives us a well rounded characterization that adds importance and weight to the scenes he's in. This is what Sheen failed to do for me, was make an impression and add depth to the story in the few scenes he was in. And I have always liked Sheen. So in conclusion, after a weak and somewhat clunky first act, the movie comes together and gives us what we came for. Andrew Garfield shines as the troubled yet brilliant Peter Parker and successfully takes an awkward teen and transforms him into a noble hero and gives us a fresh new take on a familiar character that we can't wait to see more of. There was spectacular action and drama and at the core a strong relation ship between Peter and Gwen that we also want to see more of. So, while Amazing Spider-Man is a flawed film, it's potential for the future of this new direction has us anticipating what comes next now that the characters and their possible directions are established. Bring it on!... and stay during the credits folks!"
"mindingthemint","8","2","5","29 June 2012"," Different, Witty, Classy ........but lacks somewhat emotionally
","Well, This movie surely has a charm of its own & has the potential to be one of the biggest blockbusters this year. The reboot has been made very cleverly to make audience feel a complete different watching experience. Mark Webb's spider-man is witty, thoughtful, he does not take everything too seriously while Sam Raimi's spider-man was intense, dreamy about Marry Jane (MJ), basically he seemed like a poor guy who had nobody to help. At least the portrayal of the character was like that but in Mark Webb's version he seems more confident & cool.<br/><br/>Despite all that has been said, it looks like the makers of this film has deliberately chosen to diverge from plot situations that were present in the former version. In fact it had helped in building of characters but here, TAS(the amazing spider-man)lacks in this aspect. Moreover, it also lacks in the background score. I would not say that it should have been made in exact same way Raimi had made it but TAS is weak in its emotional quotient. Forgive me for comparing it to Raimi's version over and over again but Raimi's less than 2 hrs long film was more dramatic than this more than 2 hrs long film. Although TAS preserves spider-man's integrity and has the full potential to be made into a franchise.<br/><br/>This movie(TAS) was a lot fast paced and therefore it didn't give too much time to audiences to sit back and relate to the characters. But, a big thumbs up for its wittiness, humor, CGI, action. What it lacks is emotion which was a result of avoidance of using basic plot details for the fear of being compared to 2002 Spider-man. So, watch this movie. It will surely surprise you at times but don't go with a certain mindset. Also, This movie does't have a conventional ending which i liked the most. Spider-man comic fans will surely like The Amazing Spiderman over Spider-man as this version is more close to the comics strictly in terms of the character Spiderman that is usually shown."
"Alise_shenle","5","4","14","2 July 2012"," Not so amazing spiderman
","Let's see, I like my action movies fast and furious like any other guy. I even had fun watching movies like Transformers and MI4 for the cool fighting and stuff. But for superhero movies, one should choose selectively. The hero should have values that you agree with, and that is why I only watch Spiderman and Batman movies. Good things first. Uncle Ben was amazing, humorous and strict. Aunt May was fine as Peter was not supposed to be as close to her as Uncle Ben anyway--that was something the previous Spiderman movies didn't do. I'm glad they made her less important here. Also, there is no cliché ""With great power comes great responsibility"" line here, which is good as Uncle Ben was not the one who originally said it. I also liked that the camera focused on small details such as tiny lizards everywhere. Sadly, why was Gwen a perfectly well-adjusted teenager? She's not supposed to have a mother and brothers. Also, Flash was actually half-way decent--Peter became the jerk instead, showing off (in front of paint brush girl at the basketball game). I get that Spidey was quite sarcastic and quipey, but his alter-ego Peter was supposed to keep that in check. He's the nerd that has all the comebacks, but he's too nice to say it. Well Garfield is as far away from nice as the Earth is from the sun, he was more like the violent abusive guy who breaks glass doors. He didn't even have a reason to be that angry. Furthermore, Garfield's version of Spiderman is petty and childish. Why the heck would he not chase after the bad guy just because the cashier did not allow him to buy MILK?! It's only MILK and 2 FREAKING CENTS. The real spiderman should not be so petty and selfish and immature. That was the straw that broke the camel's back. Disappointingly, I see no trace of the ""rumoured"" hot and fiery chemistry between Garfield and Stone. Stone is quite pretty as Gwen, but Garfield was a stammering, incoherent and horny mess. All he wanted to do was kiss Gwen, and why the hell did he even tell her who he is? Why would he trust her so easily when they just started talking like a week ago? If you want to watch cool moves, really funny dialogues, then just watch. But if you want something deeper, something about the inner psyche of Spiderman, plus believable romance between leads, then you shouldn't watch this movie. I walked out half an hour earlier because it's just not that interesting. Peter always wins, blah blah blah, you don't even feel any tension, unlike the past movies where Peter is the underdog."
"Siddharth550","7","4","14","30 June 2012"," The Amazing Spiderman is ""AMAZING""
","If u want to enjoy the movie, plz don't compare the movie with the last one. This plot is strong. The technology used is Amazing. 3D effects are fabulous. The new technique of shooting with RED's Epic camera has proved its worth. The film justifies its strong budget of $215 million. The idea of those ""Web Shooters"" is Interesting though. Mark Webb has done a gr8 job. Emma Stone is Gorgeous and stunning as ever. Rhys Ifans is extraordinary. One more thing to note is the ""conversion of Dr.Connors into Lizard is one of the best things in the movie. Other actors like Irrfan Khan, Martin Sheen has proved their worth. These were the good things about the movie. On the other hand, i.e. on the negative side, Andrew Garfield is not as impressive as Tobey Maguire. the marketing that says ""the movie reveals lots of secrets about spidy"". It does but not that gr8. Still the plot, performances and Effects are very strong which over overshadows all those negative things. Overall the film is a must watch. To me it is one of the best entertainers of the year. i would give it 8 of 10."
"kwgtoh","2","5","20","9 July 2012"," Better off making Spiderman 4 than making a lousy reboot.
","I can't believe they decided to reboot spiderman and make him crap. Spidey has always been different because he is the anti-hero. He is always placed between a rock and a hard place where no one decision is right and everything he could possibly do is wrong on all counts and it will come back to haunt him sooner or later.<br/><br/>His villains are always desperate men pushed into a corner and come out fighting. After watching the show you'll be left wondering if things could turn out better for everybody. The original series by Ramni made me feel sorry for Dr Ock, sand man and even the green goblin.<br/><br/>I never felt anything for the lizard who seems to be a generic super villain who's lost his mind. Spidey has lost his gift of gab and is never witty nor funny. He doesn't fight using his brains despite being out-muscled by the lizard. He never faces any important life-changing decisions like Tobey's spidey did on the bridge in spiderman 1.<br/><br/>The movie was too long and slow in between, too much time was spent trying to show the love interest between PP and GS. Unfortunately their lines were cheesy and lame. It does seem like the writers didn't know spiderman or love.<br/><br/>Uncle Ben dying is a BIG thing in spiderman's life. Uncle Ben was the one who made spiderman promise to take on responsibility to do the right thing. Yet only 5 minutes was spent on Uncle Ben's death and there was never anything said to spidey that would shape spidey's character.<br/><br/>I'd rather they made Spiderman 4. Spiderman 3 wasn't good but it was more true to Spiderman's character than this reboot where spiderman has lost his soul. This movie will only appeal to those who do not know Spiderman from the comics. It is nothing more than another superhero movie.<br/><br/>I hope it flops at the box office. Ramni's Spiderman has lots of issues and deviations but it still features a Spiderman and villains that are true to their comic book selves and what the original writers made them out to be. This movie is a cheap assed attempt to cash in on the Spiderman brand.<br/><br/>2/10 stars only because Emma Stone was a true star in this movie."
"seandevine619","9","4","15","4 July 2012"," Brilliant action film with a lot of Emotion
","Saw this film last night on the first showing, and I loved every minute of it. I went into the film excited and did not come out disappointed. With a very strong cast and great director the Amazing Spider-man mixes emotion and action extremely well. Andrew Garfield is a perfect choice for Peter Parker/ Spider-man and he brings a whole new style to the character which was very well received. Emma Stone is a great female lead and brings Gwen Stacy to life the way she was meant to have been. The rest of the cast also bring strong performances and make us believe these characters are real. The story plays out well although there is some plot holes e.g the uncle Ben murder story is dropped very quickly and the lizard is not given enough screen time. Other than that the plot is brilliant and brings something new to the origin story. Some reviews have complained that there were no stand out scenes like the first spider-man but i have to disagree. the scene were Dr. Connor's arm grows back is well done as is the Lizard transformation. One scene in particular stood out to me and it was the Crane scene. It was beautifully done and quite emotional as all of New York teamed together to provide a clear path for Spider-man in his time of need. The uncle Ben death is also played out far better than in Spider-man 1 and shows Peter dealing with it in a different way. the action sequences may have been short but were beautifully played out and the last 40 seconds of the film really highlight Spider-mans agility and powers. This movie may not be a game changer but it certainly out does the first 3."
"midget_man44","9","4","15","4 July 2012"," Spiderman is back! A must see film.
","This film is really great. It made me like Spiderman again after the disgrace of the other Spiderman movies. This new launch of Spiderman really holds true to the the Amazing Spiderman comic books which makes for a great film. Andrew Garfield is also a great Spiderman, he is not dorky like Tobey Maguire and fits the Spiderman character perfectly. Emma Stone is also brilliant as Gwen Stacy. The movie does contain a lot of CGI but again it is a superhero movie so it wouldn't be possible without CGI. However unlike most other movies the CGI in this film is perfect. It really makes you feel like the characters are real. Definitely a must see!"

","I can't take credit for the summary--my oldest daughter said that when we left the theater after seeing ""The Amazing Spider-Man"". That's because with all the many, many super-hero movies out in recent years, this one loses a bit of something--especially since there are clearly better films of its genre (such as ""Iron Man"" and ""The Avengers""). It's decent but there are better products out there.<br/><br/>First, let's talk about what I loved. The CGI was incredible and for the first time it really looks like Spider-Man is flying. It's very seamless and looks brilliant. Also, the Spider-Man costume and movements are all great.<br/><br/>What I thought was lacking in the film. It's ALL CGI and special effects--and nothing much more. The characters and dialog just didn't seem all that important. And because of this, it's spectacular to watch but nothing more....nothing. And, while I think about it, why, oh why didn't they include THE most important line in any Spider-Man film--Uncle Ben's line ""With great power comes great responsibility""?! It is the perfect summation of who the character is and according to Stan Lee it is Spider-Man...so why is it missing?!"

"adlakhaaman","8","3","10","29 June 2012"," The Amazing Spiderman..Worth the wait. Worth the excitement.
","Right, so I have been anxiously waiting for the release of this movie since the first trailer hit the internet. Being a Spidey fan since I was about 4, The idea of a new Spiderman movie after 5 long years of waiting since the last one in 2007 (Spiderman) made me quite happy. After just watching the movie I can safely say that it in my mind it beats it's prequels in every aspect. The story dwells into the life of an average teenager Peter Parker who is keen on unsolving the mystery of his parents disappearance, which if you recall was never mentioned in the Spiderman trilogy of 2002 (correct me if I'm wrong). This leads to the introduction of Dr. Connors played by Rhys Ifans as a colleague of Peter Parker's father. The character is portrayed brilliantly by Rhys and probably made the movie worthwhile. Emma Stone, who inherits the role of Gwen Stacy does a much better job than Kirsten Dunst (Mary Jane) at being the love interest of Parker. However the only drawback for me in this movie would have to be the fact that there was in my mind a lack of Spiderman scenes, overshadowed by Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy in conversation. While enjoyable,a few more action scenes would have done it justice. But I definitely enjoyed this movie and would not mind watching it a second time while it stays in cinemas."

Although there just a couple of scenes which leave you thinking what was the point of all that and leave some groaning but if you are a long time comic fan then this is a must see with the Dark knight Rises release getting closer i would see it fast as the hype will die down come July 20th to conclude the amazing spider-man is a must see for one reason AMAZING STORY and no random character drop ins and also Martin sheen"

"jamestheklein","1","4","16","22 January 2013"," The fourth best Spiderman film out there.
","The trailers made this film look like a first-person Spiderman game. I expected as much just to show off the 3D. I wasn't expecting much going into it, Spiderman is my absolute least favourite superhero after all, but thought there was no way it could be as bad as Spiderman 3! Oh how wrong I was.<br/><br/>I hate Kirsten Dunst in the other trilogy. I find Tobey to be annoying. But given the choice, I will watch one of their films over this, any day of the week.<br/><br/>I was bored the entire time. There was no coherent plot. I mean sure, a nerdy teen gets bitten by a spider, has Uncle Ben killed and becomes Spiderman, a vigilante who then gets involved with a mediocre arch- villain. But each of those things seemed to be taken from completely separate (and very crap) films, and sewn together in an attempt to make another film.<br/><br/>Peter Parker is meant to be some kind of social outcast, but he just comes across as a giant pervert, taking candid photos of his attractive schoolmates. He is meant to be some kind of genius, but the opposite is shown. He designed a wonderful gadget that locks his door closed, but he had to shut the door with his hand first, then go back across the room to push the special lock button. It is just very pointless and contrived. Don't even get me started on his preferred choice of internet search engine. I understand that I am meant to suspend belief, watching a film about a boy with spider powers who fights a lizard man. But I will not believe that any self respecting nerd will use Bing. <br/><br/>He then sneaks into a supposedly high security building, that uses ID with no photos, and gets bitten by a spider. After this he wakes up on the subway because a bum rests a beer bottle on his forehead, and a drip of water lands on him. He jumps onto the ceiling and then kicks everyone's butts. He somehow has these amazing fighting skills, and super strength. These are witnesses. He then goes to school where he uses his reflexes to humiliate the bully, and then smash a basketball hoop. Yet no-one is curious.<br/><br/>Martin Sheen gives him what for and then sets the scene for his murder. One of the worst things watching the film is that you know Sheen will die. Angsty teen then gets his Uncle killed and proceeds to try and hunt down the murderer for a half hour. He does not succeed. He then argues with his girlfriend's dad, who is the police chief, tells lovergirl he is Spiderman, then stumbles into a fight with the lizard dude.<br/><br/>Lizard man is the doctor who suddenly goes from wanting to grow his arm back, to realizing that humans are doomed and should be evolved into lizards themselves, in the space of about five minutes. He plans to release the virus he created (with Spiderman's help) into the air, failing to realize that Emma Stone can create an antidote in about 5 minutes.<br/><br/>The whole thing is just pointless, disjointed, and not worth watching. I had low expectations going into it, but was somehow still disappointed."
"BatteryDiamond","10","4","16","4 July 2012"," Spiderman is Amazing
","Okay, firstly this film far exceeded my expectations, 'Fantastic' is the best word to describe it. Now the fandom comment is out of the way, I'll get on with the review. When the trailers for The Amazing Spiderman' were first shown, I'll admit I thought 'what was that? A new trailer for the previously released Mirrors Edge video game?' It seemed to be that they had ripped off the FPS view of the game and turned it into a film replacing the Mirrors Edge character with Spiderman, along with all of the game play footage. This was disappointing, were Marvel becoming so creatively bankrupt that they needed to steel ideas from elsewhere? Boy was I wrong, the whole point was for the 3D version of the film, throwing you into a FPS view of Spiderman's perspective would give some people motion sickness, they did it very well.<br/><br/>In my opinion; Andrew Garfield was ideal for the role of Peter Parker, his awkward smiles, messy hair, even his build were correct for the role. I read GQ Magazines interview with him before watching the film and he commented on how Peter Parker was a role model for him when growing up in that he was bullied the same way the character was. I didn't believe a word of this when reading it as it could all have been just a publicity stunt but again he proved me wrong with an excellent performance.<br/><br/>Emma Stone brought life to Gwen Stacy as she does with most of her characters; she provided an adequate distraction from Spiderman's acrobatics and arrogance especially seeing she looked even more attractive than usual with her bleach blonde hair.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this film a lot more than the previous Spiderman films, mainly because they stuck to the comic books development providing Peter with the web slinging devices on his wrists rather than the silk glands he develops after being bitten in the previous ones. Personally I thought the suit looked better than previously too, it seemed more realistic like it was made of some kind of alien material rather than it looking like a morph suit as in the old films.<br/><br/>-Minor Spoilers- Getting onto the Villain, the relationship between Peter and Dr. Connors was similar to Peter and Doc Oc's relationship in Spiderman 2. They share a business relationship where they talk about some form of miracle science before the antagonist looses his mind, turns into an idealistic nut job and tries to destroy New York using the science they talked about. In this case Dr. Connors tries to regrow a lost arm by splicing lizard DNA into his own in the hope that his arm will grow back in the same way that a lizard's tail will. It works, with the minor side effect that he turns into the very creatively named, Lizard. Lizard then goes onto think that humans are puny, pathetic, feeble creatures and that everyone should be a giant schizophrenic reptile and then goes about attempting to do so. Foiled in his plans, and having been administered an antidote he saves Spiderman from certain death and is put behind bars.<br/><br/>Action wise I've already mentioned the excellent 3D animation with the POV of Spiderman but overall, the acrobatics were more fluid and more exciting to watch than in the previous films with Peter finding ever more creative ways to use his webs. Marc Webb has obviously sat down and read a lot of the comics as inspiration; this is obvious from the way the characters behave.<br/><br/>To sum up, The Amazing Spiderman lives up to it's title as it is amazing. It is action packed, crammed with comedy, manages to be heartwarming and at points, nearly makes you cry. Brilliantly done, highly recommended and I will definitely be seeing it a second time."
"lukewakeman44","9","2","6","13 October 2013"," Best one yet
","Personally I find this the best spider-man yet. Firstly this one actually includes a storyline which actually follows the comics; unlike Raimi's trilogy. I have nothing against Raimi's trilogy, except the third which was cr*p. However I find the plot of this film far superior to the original spider-man. It is more detailed, loyal to the comic and intriguing. The only thing that stops this film from getting it a 10 is that the action is very limited and could've been much better. Another reason for this film being superior is the cast: I find Andrew Garfield a much better and likable character than Toby Macguire in the original. And Emma Stone plays a much better role as Gwen Stacey than Kirsten Dunst did as Mary Jane, contributing to the fact that this film is more enjoyable to watch. It's not perfect. But it's the best yet and shows positive signs of things to come."
"DonestDons","10","2","6","21 February 2013"," Great Acting/Directing/Composer/Score/Soundtrack/Drama
","I was extremely pleased with this adaptation of Spiderman. First off, and not necessarily foremost, Andrew Garfield is a much more dramatic actor then Toby Maguire. Of course all the credit cant belong to Garfeild, but also the director and composer, and in Maguires defense he can really only work with what the director gives him to work with, however I still hold Garfield superior as an actor. The building blocks were laid from the get go in order to build an understanding and emotional connection of Peters unresolved conflicts. An emotional connection was established between the viewers and characters resulting in real drama. The comic relief was tasteful, kept to a minimum, and for what i can recall, no cheesiness. The Score and soundtrack I thought was phenomenal. I have read that some think there was not enough action and used that as a bases of their dis-satisfaction. A great movie needs more than non-stop action and special effects. It needs believable characters and emotion. It needs a good story and good acting/directing along with a good score to serve as something of a backbone for the feeling and drama of a movie as well as what the characters are going through. If one puts to much action in a movie, there is less space for more important components that contribute to a great movie. The last Spiderman franchise I think i watched the first one a couple times and the second one once, and was not interested in watching the third so I didn't. I didn't believe the Toby Maguire Spiderman. The new one made a believer out of me. This movie blew me away and met a lot of the criteria that i hold important in a movie. I greatly look forward to the next two installments."
"WyattBe3","9","2","6","31 December 2012"," Best Spidey Yet! (Major Spoilers!)
","This movie is one of the best Spider-Man films ever made. Since 2002, when the first Spider-Man movie came out, I was surprised. I liked Tobey Maguire's performance as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, but I found that he did a well Peter Parker than just being an amazing Spidey. What I saw from Andrew Garfield's performance, I was blown away. It felt like that Spider-Man is in the real world. And I loved the chemistry between Peter and Gwen, at which Emma Stone did a wonderful performance. But the one thing that I most recently loved is the casting. I mean Andrew did an amazing job as Peter/Spidey and Emma Stone made Gwen look so innocent and sweet but feisty. And Rhys Ifans did a prestigious job as the Lizard/Dr. Connors. And Denis Leary did an amazing job. I also like the way when Sony wants to give a link about Peter's parents because they actually happen to be the untold story. Everybody says, ""There is no untold story! It's just the origin again!"" Well, to prove you wrong, the untold story is about how Peter became an orphan and how he moved to Uncle Ben and Aunt May's. SPOILERS AHEAD!: In the scene when Gwen is leading the tour of interns, in the hologram of the tree of life, a rhino shown that could be an easter egg to one of Spidey's baddies (Rhino aka Alex O'Hirn). Also, in the end when Spidey does his final swing (like what they did with the Raimi films), he goes through an alley that reveals a yellow and red bottom pants that could be a reference to Shocker (Herman Schultz) and an open window reveals doves which could be a reference to Vulture (I don't know why)and there was a cloud silhouette also covering up the moon shows a reference to Mysterio and there was a lightning rod that could be a reference to Electro. Also when you hear a rattling sound and the screen slows down, right in front of Spidey happens to be the Washington Bridge, where Gwen gets killed by The Green Goblin! By the way, i still think this a good spidey movie. So 9/10"
"jboothmillard","6","2","6","19 December 2012"," The Amazing Spider-Man
","I was very skeptical when I heard that they were not making the next sequel in the Spider-Man saga, but they were starting the whole series together entirely, no more Sam Raimi, Tobey Maguire or Mary Jane Watson, a whole new reboot, supposedly to fit in with a future Avengers Assemble film, but I had to see it, from director Marc Webb (500 Days of Summer). Basically as a child Peter Parker (The Social Network's Andrew Garfield) was abandoned by his parents who went on a business trip with unknown details and never came back when their plane crashed, and he lives as an outcast high school teenager with his Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field). He is trying to find out more about himself and his parents, and he has crush on beautiful student Gwen Stacy (The Help's Emma Stone) who is going out with bully Flash Thompson (Chris Zylka), and following clues in a suitcase that belonged to his father he goes to the company he worked for, which coincidentally Gwen works at as well. Peter sneaks into pharmaceutical company Oscorp and gets the opportunity also to meet Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans), who has an arm missing and is trying to develop a cure for terminally ill head of the company, Norman Osborne, and more specifically a serum that can restore limbs, like a lizard when it loses its tail. In the laboratory Peter finds a place his father most likely worked, where genetically enhanced spiders are inside a facility, and looking inside he manages to get himself covered in a bunch of spiders, and brushing most of them off he is unaware of one remaining and he is bitten on the back of the neck. After some time he has gained superhuman abilities such as increased strength, the ability to stick to horizontal and vertical surfaces, super speed, and a heightened sense of danger, and after practising these newfound skills he also finds a formula code of his father's that is key to the serum experiment and eventually creates a successful prototype that restores the missing limb of a three-legged mouse. Returning home Peter has a bad argument with Uncle Ben and Aunt May, and when Ben goes out to look for him he notices a robbery going on at a grocery store, and trying to stop him he ends up being shot and killed by thief, Peter finds him and is too late to save him, so he starts building on his idea, in order to find the guilty man, to create an alter ago. Catching many criminals along the way in vigilante acts one time he sees a poster for a blue and red wrestler, and he gets the idea to create a spandex based suit based on the patterns of a blue and red spider, and he creates wrist canisters to squirt strong biocable strands like the web of a spider, and eventually he reveals he is the vigilante being searched for to Gwen, and they kiss. Rajit Ratha (Irrfan Khan) is demanding after the success with the mouse that the serum should go to human trials immediately, and after initially refusing Dr. Connors tests it on himself hoping to grow back his missing arm, waking up from the affects he is overjoyed to see his arm grown back, but all the sudden a bad side effect reaction occurs and he has turned himself into a giant mutated lizard creature. Connors as this creature, called The Lizard, goes rampaging and finds Ratha on the Williamsburg Bridge where he throws cars over the side, but Peter as the vigilante, eventually calling himself Spider-Man saves the man and many other citizens with his strength and specially developed webbing, but Captain George Stacy (Denis Leary) still sees Spider-Man as some threat. Trying to find the Lizard, who he knows is Dr. Connors, Peter searches the sewers where he retreated with a camera to catch an image of him, but after a fight the Lizard finds out Spider-Man's identity and finds Peter in his Midtown Science High School, and the police meanwhile are on a manhunt for both Spider-Man and the Lizard after this incident. Seeking revenge Dr. Connors intends to disperse his serum all over the city, but Gwen has developed a cure based on Peter's coding discovery, and Captain Stacy discovers Spider-Man's identity also when he is cornered at one point, and he lets him escape to save Gwen trapped in Oscorp, and to replace the serum with the antidote. Before being cured by the antidote Connors returns to human form, but he did manage to mortally wound Captain Stacy, but before he dies Peter promises him he will stay away from Gwen to protect her from any more danger, and he tells Gwen that he cannot see her anymore, but of course Peter admits not all promises can be kept. Also starring Campbell Scott as Richard Parker, Embeth Davidtz as Mary Parker and Stan Lee as School Librarian. British actor Garfield proves to be actually a good choice to be both Peter Parker and the superhero Spider-Man, with his witty personality, maybe not so much naivety and the right amount of humour and moodiness, Stone is nice as the new love interest for the hero, and Ifans is creepy when he becomes the villain of the piece. The origins of Peter Parker and the original comic book version of Spider-Man, where he made his webbing rather than it shooting from his wrists, is suitable, the story has everything connect well, and the action sequences with splendid special effects are engaging, it is not as charming and lacks something that the Sam Raimi version does, but it is an entertaining fantasy adventure. Good!"

","Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield did an excellent job! Great acting between both of them and they actually show some chemistry to each other. And I can sense them as 'real' people! When Andrew cried, I could feel it, and when they were together, I can sense their teenage love feeling to each other. They are also very cute couple too. I never really like the old spiderman cast! Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst didn't have much chemistry together really. I truly hope that they will have a second movie as Amazing Spiderman 2!

","I've no idea why they remade this. Probably because someone had loads of unsold spider man toys in a warehouse somewhere and needed to start shifting them. I didn't really fancy this film to begin with but I decided to take my son to see it, and the hype that was surrounding the 3D of this film got my interest. But as usual with a Hollywood blockbuster I was left totally disappointed. The characters are just totally unbelievable. I am to believe that a 17 year old high school student is also a top scientist in Oscorp? I know its based on a comic but if I went on a tour of a huge corporations' laboratories and the tour guide was some 17 year old kid I would think that they must be pretty hard up for staff. It's just a movie thing I know but nobody in films like this look like kids. The high school was full obviously of grown men and women students. But lets just forget that and be wow'd by the 3D action sequences. The 3D was crap. Yes sure you could tell it was layered etc, but for a film that was supposedly a masterclass in 3D movie making I was unimpressed. If this is the best 3D can do I will save my money from now on and just see the 2D version. Overall it was just not that good. The characters were lame, the story was lame and the 3D wasn't anything special. Not looking forward to the squeal."

","Does The Amazing Spider-Man disappoint? Not while you're watching it for the first time because it keeps you entertained. But this is a generic superhero film. There's nothing here to really get excited about. The screenplay was written by three people and the director is Marc Webb (500 Days Of Summer), but their efforts don't impress. Webb was not the right man for this project. He does include his neat directorial style but in this film it's uninspired. It's clear that the people involved made this film just to make money because it's uninspired on all fronts. Webb did not get along very well with the actors. With better direction Andrew Garfield may have been able to carry this film but on his own he doesn't have the chops. I understand what he tried to do with his character, though in a role which makes Peter Parker seem truly selfish his acting bits weren't beneficial. Even the supporting cast were not good. I guess I can only praise Emma Stone because she looked good and because she tried. But just like with every other actor here her performance was just passable. On the acting front there's nothing to discuss in this film. Rhys Ifans as Dr. Curt Connors, the villain of the picture, isn't memorable. When he's the Lizard, however, he is sometimes genuinely frightening. The CGI and the action too are disappointing for the most part. In conclusion, The Amazing Spider-Man is just passable. It's flawed, which is especially noticeable on second viewing, and I don't recommend seeing it."

Even if its played by a whole different set of actors.<br/><br/>I guess its down to my expectations before the movie - i was expecting the remake to be darker and true to life - just like what Nolan did to Batman, or Daniel Craig as the new 007. But if you darken spidey abit then it will not work, cause how can you darken a nerdy Peter Parker? Remember Toby being taken over by that oily alien in Spidey 3? Doesn't work, mate.

","""With great power, comes great responsibility."" These are the words not uttered by Uncle Ben in this movie. Anyone who has been a Spider-man fan since before the first movies knows these words are the very foundation that makes Spider-man the hero he is. <br/><br/>Though Amazing Spider-Man does a good job portraying The Lizard, The movie fails to use the characters properly. We get very little witty banter from Spidey. The movie fails to show why Gwen and Peter is nearly a better couple than Peter and Mary-Jane. In the comics Captain Stacey figured out on his own that Pete was Spider-Man. <br/><br/>Gwen Stacey in the comics was Pete's first true love, yet in this movie they rush the relationship so much the viewer does not understand how much this relationship means to Peter and the eventual character development of Spider-Man. Captain Stacey's character also served for something more in the comics. When Captain Stacy was killed by Doc Ock in the comics he told Peter it was his job to take care of Gwen, which meant more when Green Goblin killed Gwen.<br/><br/>Spider-man's character is unique because the character himself is surrounded by misery, yet he still finds the desire to press. Though he has every right to say enough is enough and give up, his moral compass comes back to those words that continue to ring true in his mind, ""with great power, comes great responsibility."" I think that's the part of the Spider-man magic Sony has yet to understand. Until they do, they will never produce an amazing Spider-Man story."

","THIS REVIEW DOES CONTAIN SPOILERS..<br/><br/>I'm not a comic book fan boy, but I was a mixture of disappointed and amused at some of the weak unrealistic point of the new Spiderman movie.<br/><br/>My whines:<br/><br/><ul><li>Where's Jonah Jameson? Peter's ""photog"" career? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Emma Stone / Gwen Stacey - in high school, but has full access and is the right hand woman for a major technology / chemical firm? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I'm sorry - Emma Stone (who is 23?) along would most of the characters do NOT look like they're in high school. I think the decision to have Peter be in high school was to somehow have him appeal to a younger demographic, but I just found it completely silly. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Why does Peter insist on showing off his true identity to everyone within 5 minutes of meeting them? Then, he tries to hide it while there are a million people with mobile phone cameras around him. We're supposed to believe that he simply goes back to school as a high school student at the end? Even stupidity like he hangs his camera (one of the two photography references), but it's got his name, address, social security number, etc. sitting on it. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>He gets beat up badly in front of a million people by the big school bully with no repercussions. Then, he ""teases"" the school bully and slam dunks the ball in a way that Michael Jordan would be impressed. The result is that his father is forced to come in and he has to perform community service. No offers to play for the Knicks? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Spiderman seems to get beat up much more easily in this movie. He's shot by a policeman in full flight, then shot again as he runs away -- both times taking him down. Meanwhile, the lizard gets machine gunned and heals in seconds. I don't think they decided how truly ""powerful"" this new Spidey was supposed to be. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Weird introduction of Peter's father/mother, but really never explains what happens to them -- I guess that's for a future movie. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The ""villain"" was intended to have a likable, but flawed personality. He's got one arm, he's smart, but not as smart as Peter's dad. And his big plan (outside of trying to get his arm back) is to turn everyone in the city into lizards too? Why? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Why do the lizards all follow the guy in the sewer? Is he some sort of pied piper of the lizards? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>These people all barely know each other for almost all of Peter's life. Then within 1 week, Peter meets Emma Stone's character who not only works for his dead father's business partner, but whose father is the captain of the police force. Oh, with some weird future tie to Oscorp which will be Peter's future best friend, father is the Green Goblin, etc. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Peter, who is supposed to be a nerd suddenly is beating up the school bully, slam dunking baskets, oh and catches a football one handed and throws it so hard that he BENDS the goal post... But, nobody thinks twice about and it. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>In a weird purist move, they went back to Peter's ""web shooters"" being technology he needs to wear vs. ""built in to his powers"". They seem sort of bulky, but he's wearing them around when he's not in costume. You don't think someone would ""see"" those bulky web shooters on his wrist? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I also wonder (as with most of the Spiderman movies) that as he flies around shooting this highly indestructible web all over the place, how much he's polluting NYC! Who is cleaning up all these wires he's leaving all over the place.. :) </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I didn't quite get the ending either. Peter promises Gwen's dad that he won't see Gwen any more. Then he ignores her, doesn't support her through the funeral, then she sort of figures out that her father told him not to see her.. And then, he decides that he's just going to ignore that promise at the end anyway. Ha, ha, fade to black.</li></ul><br/><br/>Wow, that was a lot of whining on my part.. <br/><br/>I saw the movie in a 3D Imax theater and (outside of the 45 minutes of previews), the experience was great. The action was ""realistic"" and the 3D technology has become very good. <br/><br/>So, I give the overall story 1.5/4 stars (definitely not as strong as Avengers, previous Batman flicks, X-Men, etc.), the actors 2.5/4 stars, and the action 3/4 stars.. I hope the new Batman movie is better."
"mzrazberri","1","2","6","10 July 2012"," Heavily Disappointed
","First off I will say something that everyone already knows is obvious, this film will be forever compared to the first three by Raimi, it is impossible to not draw comparisons between the two. Pros of new movie: Good Cast, more True to the Comics, good CGI (MINUS, the CGI for the lizard which was pretty horrendous considering it's the year 2012) Cons: Story flow, unanswered questions, ""secret"" identity not so secret, the new suit, the movie score, clichés,etc. <br/><br/>Going into this film I had very Luke warm expectations, but deep down I WANTED to be proved wrong, I hoped that this movie would deliver and amaze me more than I had expected. Something happened I didn't think would, I left more disappointed than I thought I would have (which is saying a lot).<br/><br/>For one, the first half of the movie moved way too slow for me, I found myself growing bored, rolling my eyes, and keep looking at the time on my phone. In the first spider-man movie, everything happens at a pace where it is impossible to lose interest. It takes about an hour it seems for what happened in the first 20 minutes of the first spider-man movie. Not only that but watching this film made me realize just how smooth the storyline moved pacing wise in the first film. I found myself asking..the way they set up the situations in this movie, why did Peter follow the path he did? He wanted to track down his uncles killer right? He falls through a roof that just so happens to have a mask painted on a wall inside and he decides he needs a mask...okay yes, but why the sudden jump to the spidey suit? A design he seemed to randomly pull out of his ass/ the air...it just didn't seem natural or right to me.<br/><br/>One thing they advertised about this new movie was the origin story and finding out more about Peter's parents, but no more information is given within the movie that we didn't already conclude from what we saw in the trailers. So the extra 20-30 minutes of ""exposition"" in the beginning of the movie seemed absolutely pointless in retrospect. They definitely should have cut that down. <br/><br/>The way that Uncle Ben was murdered in this movie seemed like it was quickly slapped together in pre-production. It made me say wow, really? That was lame...and I thought the way Uncle Ben reacted in that situation made him look like kind of an idiot..no wonder he got shot. The flow from Uncle Ben's death and to the rage and revengeful nature of peter parker seemed much more epic and exciting in the first film! In this one there's about two scenes in-between that slowed things down a bit more. I know the differences are big to try to not make the movies too similar, but there had to have been a better way.<br/><br/>Next, the snarky comments of Spiderman were funny to a point, but the scene with the car burglar and police I found myself growing annoyed with Spider-man when his comments made him seem annoying, full of him self, a show-off, and ultimately...an asshole. When the police come while he's running his mouth to the burglar, the police come and he just keeps running his mouth to the cops too being a wise-ass. Then he runs from the cops and ""woooo's!"" as he's swinging...and *cue heroic music*...the music was sooooooooo mis-fit in this scene. <br/><br/>Anyways, I could go on on with more detail but my review will turn up being a 20 page essay. Couple more things: One of the main things about these super hero movies is identity, especially with peter...however I feel like Peter exposed himself to more people in this one film within 20 minutes than Peter did in all three Raimi films (minus the train scene in spider-man 2...but still, in that case he did not do it on purpose). Garfield was constantly taking off his mask, exposed his identity to his love interest almost right away...there was no build up for that. <br/><br/>So much more can be said, but I am running out of space...a lot of the other disappointed reviews that pick on more issues I also had with this film."
"aswinpaul","5","2","6","10 July 2012"," Highly Overrated
","OK, What's all the hype about<br/><br/>I went to see the amazing spider man yesterday with my little brother and I have to say that It is highly overrated. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie and all but I was promised something spectacular. If i had to compare this version to the 2002 version, I would say that the latter was better. The movie is filled with spectacular special effects, but it has no panache. <br/><br/>First of all I was promised a funny witty and... well funnier spider man. Andrew Garfield has the look's of a modern day Peter Parker, but I wouldn't say he was the best man for the role. No offense or anything, I personally love Andrew Garfield but I Honestly think that his portrayal of spider man was horrible. I mean the guy isn't even that funny. But anything would be better than a another Toby Maguier mishap.<br/><br/>Secondly, I expected a better looking lizard than a 8 foot bald dude with no snout. I mean where's the snout, a lizard has to have a snout.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the movie is stars out so slow. Peter Parker doesn't even get bit until the first 45 minutes of the movie is over. Even after that,it takes him another thirty minutes for him to figure out his powers. This is one of the things that I found that made the 2002 version spider man better than this one. The action sequences don't even start until the third quarter of this movie.<br/><br/>My little brother enjoyed it tremendously though. But for me this movie is just a little more than average.The 3D effects are spectacular but it doesn't compensate for he fact that this movie doesn't have the kick one would expect from a Spider man movie.The talents of Emma Stone and Rhys Ifans save this movie from going into an abyss of low ratings.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 5 out of 10. An average spider man"
"skyohsky","6","2","6","9 July 2012"," Quite a cool and new Peter Parker but not quite a Peter Parker
","The Amazing Spider-Man is not the movie that I had expected at all. Yes of course I wanted Spider-Man 4 or something with Tobey as a Spider-Man and Kirsten Dunst in it. They made the Spider-Man series look so good and classic except for the Spider-Man 3 which could not go with the flow of the former two prequels. In this movie, Emma Stone looked like Andrew Garfield's older sister. She looked amazing and did good job though.<br/><br/>When I heard about it first months ago, I wasn't even interested at all. Then before its release I watched the trailer on you-tube and some scenes of the movie (car thief and the basketball scene to be precise). I had some urge to watch it and got curious, well at least for the special effects and for the whole newness of it; my hate for somebody's effort at overwriting the original Spider-Man was still there and it is still there. There are some scenes which are quite amazing and quite a treat to watch but again there are many scenes that reminded as if you are watching a spoof movie. One particular scene reminded me of that famous scene from the movie Psycho. It seems a deliberate attempt but it felt odd. And probably spoof film makers will find a lot to spoof.<br/><br/>Spider-Man is my favorite superhero. I always in a way relate to Peter Parker, the older Peter Parker of Spider-Man series; this one felt a lot different, not in a bad sense though but it feels the older one was more a Peter Parker than this one. But it's definitely new and people like watching new. However people may criticize it, at least Spider-Man fans will watch it anyway. I'm happy that I watched it and might even watch it once again to reconsider my doubts. Like I said there are a lot of downsides, it's got its good sides as well."

","I've been a Spider-man fan my whole life. The whole deal, comics, action figures - you name it. So, needless to say, I generally disliked Raimi's movies. The first was sub-par, the second slightly better, the third nightmarishly horrific. I went into this movie knowing that they had put the Lizard as part of the origin story and I was prepared to dislike it. <br/><br/>The Lizard has never been a great villain - along the lines of sandman and the vulture. But they nailed him in this movie. It worked. Rhys Ifans was perfect.<br/><br/>Gwen Stacie has always concerned me as a character for movies, because her death in the comics was always so tragic, but considering this is a new universe, they could have her live so it might still work. Emma Stone played her well.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield was incredible.<br/><br/>The story worked. There were some issues, but they were so inconsequential it's not even worth bringing up.<br/><br/>What I'm trying to say is if you are a true Spider-man fan, and you have become slightly afraid of Spider-man movies because of how terrible they've been in the past - this one is safe. You won't hate it, you may even enjoy it."
"DubhDoo","7","2","6","9 July 2012"," A reboot elevated by great performances and strong direction
","Around two and a half years ago I heard the announcement of a Spiderman reboot; my initial reaction was less-than-enthusiastic - ""too soon...what's the point?"", I thought; but after the disappointing mess that was Spiderman 3, I realised that maybe it might not be so bad after all. I found Marc Webb to an unusual but interesting choice, but aside from that, everything seemed to come together nicely for the film's production; the perfect casting and even my delightful joy at the faithful inclusion of Gwen Stacy and Peter's homemade web-shooters. However having thoroughly enjoyed the first of Raimi's and loved the sheer brilliance of the second, I still remained somewhat worried about how this early reboot would pan out. Thankfully, even if unnecessary (I suspect Sony just made it to keep the rights) it turned out better than expected.<br/><br/>Much of the pure enjoyment of this film stems from the wonderful casting of Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone as Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy respectively. Their scenes together are a particular pleasure to watch; their beautiful chemistry and the manner their lines spark off each other convey the awkwardness of youth to the effect where it left me smiling widely. They are undoubtedly the heart of the film; its beating centre which provides the film with life and emotion. They charm, we root. After being so great in Never Let Me Go and The Social Network, Garfield does not disappoint; doing a wonderful job of making the dual role his own, proving that he is indeed one of the most capable and talented actors under 30 today. Stone continues to impress after a line of great performances, working marvellously alongside Garfield. A scene between her and Dennis Leary concerning cocoa (really) provides one of the film's best comic beats. It is thanks to these performances that nothing in the film feels forced or out-of- character.<br/><br/>It's pretty much a fact that Spiderman has a poor back catalogue when it comes to villainy; and when the lizard was first announced as the chief antagonist, I felt he'd be at odds with the film's promised ""realism"" and even feared he may turn out worse than the Power Rangers reject that was the Green Goblin in Raimi's first, yet Rhys Ifans, oddly refusing to betray his Welsh accent, delivers a strong performance as Curt Connors, if not the Lizard. He proves to be quite likable for the film's first half, and even though the seeds of tragedy are there for his metamorphosis, his inevitable transformation was somewhat rushed, which never allows them come to poignant fruition. The Lizard does indeed look ridiculous and it almost, but doesn't quite work.<br/><br/>""The untold story"", the publicity proclaimed; maybe next time, fellas, because of course, they are similarities to Raimi's first chapter; the basics are all there - high school, love interest, Flash, Uncle Ben, the cheap mask, etc. But thanks to assured direction and brilliant casting (Martin Sheen as Uncle Ben!), it somehow manages to be exciting and emotional, even if not entirely new. James Horner's score was nowhere near as memorable as Elfman's though.<br/><br/>This is a superhero film slightly odd in the fact that it is just as good at portraying human relationships than sweeping set-pieces, not that the action is inherently bad, it is mildly enjoyable, but some of the tender character moments are the film's true highlights, elevating it wonderfully. I was genuinely surprised by the fact that I liked it; it was a fairly enjoyable comic book film with strong emotional resonance. Yet, while easily better than Spiderman 3, and even better than the first, Spiderman 2 is still the amazing Spiderman."

","This was the first movie that showed the true heart of Spiderman. I loved that the movie featured a plot and was not just carried by special effects. I have always loved Spiderman as he is not a womanizer and he tends to have strong morals. I have been a fan since I was a small child and have been reading the comics off on for over 15 years. I admit that the story line that this movie was based on was written before I was born, still I enjoyed it all the same. I have read that the plot is different than the comic books but comics are always being revised. The main thing is that Spiderman is actually portrayed the right way this time! I took my 9 year old and she loved it except for the kissing scenes. Which I would expect any kid to hate. The actors were way better than the previous Spiderman movies. A must see for true fans. If you are just looking for mindless action sequences this film is probably not for you. I am a chick but I am insulted by those who call this a chick flick just because it has a few kissing scenes. All the superhero films have kissing scenes. Grow up!"
"ketgup83","6","2","6","8 July 2012"," ""With great power, comes great responsibility "" is clearly missing !!!
","The Amazing Spiderman , a reboot on Spiderman franchises, was disappointing with nothing much to offer except for few good fight scenes and eye catching visual effects.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spiderman takes you to the actual origin of what really happened before Peter Parkar turned into a web slinging hero for the New York City.<br/><br/>Director Marc Webb(500 days of summer) does a decent job of re-booting the series showing the disappearance of Peter Parker's parents and what led him to become a Spiderman. But a bountiful of comparison will definitely come across from the fans who have already seen the scenario in Sam Raimi's version. First of all , the questions comes to my mind was why they decided to reboot , considering it got released just after 5 years.. they could have continued with Sam Raimi and Tobey Maguire ? Can it been even called a reboot , considering we have seen this before , right ? As I mentioned , the comparisons will definitely happen and I loved Raimi's version. I think he gave more weight-age to the story , character development, more fun-loving and Tobey Maguire was more charming than Andrew Garfield as Spiderman , frankly speaking. I did not understand few scenes here .. if Peter gained strength after bitten by a spider, his eyesight should also become strong, where as he is wearing specks even after becoming Spiderman... the character of Mary Jane and Harry Osborn is also missing here, the story of his parents missing is still clueless. May be all these will be answered in the next chapter for which we have to wait. Gosh, how many spiderman movies they are gonna make... in my opinion, they should have continued the next series. However , on the positive note - the visual effects are mind blowing coupled with fight sequences between Spiderman and the Lizard in the college was high-octane. Screenplay is tight. Camera-work is just getting better and better with each film. The famous dialogue "" With great power, comes great responsibility "" is missing. Andrew Garfield was just about OK as Peter Parker , I felt Tobey Maguire did better job. Emma Stone was not upto the mark. Rhys Ifans was impressive as Dr. Curt Connors but frankly speaking the character of Lizard was more funny rather than scary. Irffan Khan was there for few minutes.<br/><br/>I had a high expectations from ""The Amazing Spiderman"" after knowing how was it originated but did not find any difference from Raimi's version.

","This reboot has been under a lot of pressure since announcement, most of which are not very objective. The main concern is that it has only been 5 years since the last spider movie, therefore it is clearly too soon to reboot the campaign with a whole new set.<br/><br/>Let's face it, the previous 3 spider-man movies weren't so good, the script were in the level of last decade's superhero movies where stuff like Xmen and Wolverine were acceptable; they were mostly the result of lots of studio's money + some 3rd rate director and writers + experiments with CG to see how far they could go. There were not even an attempt to take some character development into consideration until the Batman Begin. <br/><br/>The only cherishable elements from the original 3 were some of the swing CG shots and Danny Elfman's music. Until now, the final swing sequences with his orchestra behind still gives goose bumps. <br/><br/>Now this talented young man came along, Andrew Garfield, an unpretentious natural actor. His remarkable performance in the Social Network and Never Let Me Go established personalities based on his ability to handle inner twist and struggle while expressing it without trying too hard. His version of Peter Parker gave a very nice first impression, an impression got even better as the movie progressed. <br/><br/>The fighting sequences are the best in this movie. It's just so hard to impress the audience nowadays, unless you give something extraordinary. You gotta have the WoW factor like Inception's Paris sequence to hold people's attention. The fighting sequences in this one are beautifully executed, especially the animation and editing. The 3D animation of spider-man often subtly mimicking the spider movement in very fast paced cuts, and each change of position is complimented by cleverly set camera angle then smoothly edited together. A few well placed first person shots really made the motion come alive. <br/><br/>Performance is good, both the lead and support actors are solid performers who can properly deliver a line. Masters like Martin Sheen and Sally Field need no introduction; Rhys Ifans brought his very tasty accent with a touch of his Welsh tongue, which made every syllable memorable. <br/><br/>Well, there are some plot holes, it wouldn't be a Hollywood movie if there weren't any. But not too terrible, not like Prometheus! How did Dr. Conners moved all his very delicate equipment in the sewer with no help and just one arm? Nevermind, he's a big lizard! They also had to show the American flag in a heroic way, they just had to do it. In spiderman3 there were a shot where the hero briefly stops in front of a flag before hopping off, and I almost fell off my chair in the cinema – it was shameless! Now at least this one wasn't that bad. It's NYC and the civilian heroes shed their blood during 911, so we shouldn't be too cynical while the movie maker decided they deserve some applause. <br/><br/>Disappointment – the music. It's really, really bad! It literally felt like one tune, which sounded as if composed for some independent documentary, inappropriate for most of the scenarios, got used over and over and over. it was neither a good tune nor nicely arranged. I hated it with a passion so I looked it up and realized it made sense that James Horner gave birth to the score. This guy once had a few nice melodies in his head back in the 90s, unfortunately he used them up in 'Legend of Fall', 'BraveHeart' and 'Titanic', that was it. In 'A Beautiful Mind' you could feel the desperation, and when it came to 'Troy' that was just constipation. Since you can't use bagpipe to portrait a modern time NYC scenario, the whole attempt was pathetic. Hopefully soon someone will remix the new visual with Danny Elfman's tune and put on Youtube, so when watching and enjoying the climax of the swings, we don't have to suffer from Horner's impotence. <br/><br/>Overall it was a great pleasure to sit through the 136 minutes. Being the one main member missing from the Avengers, the little spider did just as well on his own."

","Where do I begin on this reboot of spider man? well at first I was really looking forward to this because I was hoping they were going to follow the comic book correctly which in most cases they did such as in the original movie spider man shoots a web out of his hand but now using an electronic device.<br/><br/>The 3D was a big let down because most of this move I could even take my 3D glasses off and watch it normally.<br/><br/>I thought the whole beginning of this was great but just felt a bit slow but maybe that's because it's a reboot who knows.<br/><br/>The visual effects of this movie were incredible which I was most expecting anyway and like most people would agree but parts of this movie really irritated me because of how badly the script was put together. For one *SPOILER* when those cranes were neatly lined up for spider man but wait, how would they know spider man would come that way into the building?. secondly *SPOILER* when Dr. curt said to peter that he gave them the week off, but then later on Gwen sets the fire alarm to get all the workers out the building.<br/><br/>But overall of this movie had great effects. I can't this an incredible rating but if there is going to be another spider man I'm sure it will be better but for now this one did not live up to its expectations."
"CamMan618","8","2","6","8 July 2012"," Absolutely better than the first Spider Man
","Before I say why this was better, let me say that I DID enjoy the first Spider-Man trilogy, a lot.<br/><br/>I loved this movie because it goes so deep into Peter Parker.<br/><br/>The relationship between him and Gwen is great, and its very real. I loved the ending, where (*SPOILER*) he said that promises that can't be kept are the best kind, basically hinting to Gwen that he wanted to be with her regardless of him being Spider-Man. I loved that.<br/><br/>While I am not a huge fan of The Lizard, I thought they did a pretty good job with using him as a villain. I'm not sure why, I just liked it.<br/><br/>I give this an 8 because I was not WOWed by it (like The Dark Knight). Although I very much did enjoy it."

","The Amazing Spider-Man doubles as a captivating dramatic ensemble, and a thrilling action-adventure story. Purists of the Spider-Man genre will be delighted with this work of art.<br/><br/>The inimitable tale of Spider-Man gets retold with poignancy; it's a masterful recount of the agony and wonder which brings this legendary Marvel superhero to life. The anguish that our hero labors through is palpable and his journey to manhood is fraught with difficulty.<br/><br/>Spider-Man is every bit the model of youthful exuberance and boyish fascination. Spidey oozes appeal in this pulse-pounding escapade through New York City. The script focuses almost exclusively on the pain that young Peter Parker endures and the growth and development of his character is sublime.<br/><br/>The journey of Spider-Man is explored in detail, at a pace that truly appeals to mature theater-goers.

"the-timelord-victorious","6","2","6","8 July 2012"," Enjoyable but extremely redundant.
","I have to admit after seeing the trailers and publicity for this movie, I wasn't exactly hyped for it. Although, once the reviews came in I actually thought to myself ""Actualy, this could be quite good. Enjoyable anyway."" I was half right. It was very enjoyable, but the main problem with this film is, it just feels completely and utterly redundant.<br/><br/>You see, i'm in the minority who actually does rather like the first 3. Well, I say 'first 3'. I thought the third was atrociously bad, but I can watch the first two and still be rather entertained. When it was confirmed that the franchise would be rebooted though, I immediately thought ""This is far too early for a reboot, it's too soon, it just feels like they're trying to cash in on the darker rebooted superhero movies."" and that's pretty much exactly what they've done. The entire plot just feels like a rehash from 10 years ago, just told differently. If this was the first Spider-Man film in 15 years or something, you know, just enough to time to let the last trilogy settle, then I wouldn't really have a problem with it. But it just feels really unnecessary. Then there's the whole thing about this movie being 'The Untold Story', which after the credits roll, still remains untold. There's virtually nothing learnt about the death of Parkers parents. It's just used as a way to bring Lizard into it.<br/><br/>If they just made this 'Spider-Man 4' and didn't bother with the whole reboot thing, it would've had more time to expand on the death of his parents, and actually bring some form of mystery into it, then it would've probably been a very good film. It's like they tried to do a 'Batman Begins' and lost their nerve 20 minutes in and turned it into another Spiderman film and not something new and interesting.<br/><br/>Oh, and by the way, the 3D is awful. I really wanted a 2D showing but 3D was the only one available. I'm not exaggerating when I say this, but I sat with the glasses off for most of the film and it made no difference. I'm not a fan of 3D anyway, but it does give a sense of... joy when something flies out the screen at you, as bad and pointless as it is. With this it just felt that I was sitting watching a 2D film with glasses on.<br/><br/>The thing is though, I did enjoy it. It was a good waste of a few hours, but there's nothing really original in it. Although the cast was great. I honestly did find Andrew Garfield marvellous. He's definitely so much better in the role than Toby Maguire, and really did bring some sense of danger and menace to it. The thing with Garfied is, is that he has this great screen presence and can carry a movie totally on his own. He's brought so much believability and realism to it, that you can't help but be taken in by his performance. Although, I enjoyed the scenes with Peter more than I did with Spider-Man. Even though I found this movie really redundant, I did feel that Garfield was definitely the strongest aspect of it, and despite my feelings on this movie, part of me really is looking forward to the next one, mainly because of Garfields performance and how uplifting the ending is.<br/><br/>Overall a good waste of a few hours. Very nice performances and a good cast, but at the end of the day, just a pointless rehash."
"S_Craig_Zahler","6","2","6","6 July 2012"," better spider-man, better action and weaker peter parker = slightly better spider-man movie overall
","actual rating 6.25.<br/><br/>this is slightly higher than the 6 i would give the second raimi spider-man movie, which is the best of that first bunch.<br/><br/>garfield supplies us with too much acting and emoting, as he did in 'never let me go.' he is capable, but needs to be reined in, as he was in 'the social network.' he's too fidgety, too dewy-eyed and too angry, though likely he was directed this way. fine, but not as naturally likable as was toby maguire in this same role not too long ago.<br/><br/>contrarily, the spider-man stuff is significantly better handled than in the other movies. it's nice to see that the guy running around in the suit...is a guy running around in a suit, not a weightless computer generated creation that has no personality. and when it is computer generated (which doesn't seem often), it meshes very well with the actual performer. the quipping/smart remarks during the fights work better than i would have expected and there are some smart moments--- the making of the motion sensitive web and the collusion of the crane operators are both pretty sharp ideas that are well presented. although the reversion of peter parker's web shooters to their original idea is different (and in line with the comic) it actually makes less sense in a movie that is trying deal more with the genetic side of parker's abilities. maybe this was done to differentiate it more from the raimi film?<br/><br/>like many people, after countless versions of the origin--- in comics (the original, ultimate s-m) in the previous raimi movie and also on stage, i am tied of the origin story and wish the filmmakers eschewed giving it to us again. still, a fine comic book movie."

","The Amazing Spiderman was visually very beautiful. What was really wonderful is how well they stuck to the actual comic story line. The actors in this installment are far more believable in their rolls vs. the cast of Spiderman.(IE Tobey and Kristen) The bad on this movie was the whole back story. The other spiderman movies had established a back story for the character. some minor differences would have to be spelled out but this could have been completed in less time than what they used. The whole front end of the movie moved pretty slowly. The last half of the movie however was most excellent. I would like to see another installment of The Amazing Spiderman now that the pain of back story's has been completed. (fingers crossed)"
"npoddar05","5","2","6","6 July 2012"," This web is not strong enough to hold you...
","The next generation Spidey is here to save the world from a scientist turned evil !! Does it excites you ? Not anymore right ! Neither The Amazing Spiderman has got anything new to offer you. Though Andrew Garfield plays great as a new Peter Parker/Spiderman, but director Marc Webb failed to keep up the same adrenaline level the way Sam Raimi did.<br/><br/>The movie starts with the childhood of Peter when his parents leave him to his uncle Ben and aunt May when they found themselves in some bad consequences. Peter wants to know the reason behind his parents sudden disappearance which leads him to meet his father's old time friend Dr. Curt Connors, who is working on cross genetic breeding with lizard DNA which (very obvious) later becomes the reason behind his turning into evil Dr. Lizard. However, the secret of Peter's parents has not been disclosed completely and kept for future movies in the series.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spiderman is reboot of the Spidey series based on 2nd generation of Stan Lee's Spiderman, who does not exerts spider web naturally from his wrist the way old Spiderman use to do. Instead, the new Spidey goes with the idea of web shooters around his wrist which was actually the part of original Spiderman comics. The only thing Peter got from the bite of radioactive spider is super active alert sense. <br/><br/>The thing which The Amazing Spiderman really lacked is something dark and serious stuff like Batman and Iron Man series. Movie goers are now no more interested in exact comical adaptation. Audience is much matured because of the bars raised by movies like The Dark Knight. Moreover, after watching the blockbuster The Avengers, which is the assembly of six superheroes, released in same current year , new Spidey shows no charm to keep you spellbound in his new web.<br/><br/>The only best thing about The Amazing Spiderman is the choice of Andrew Garfield as the new Peter Parker/Spiderman. Andrew has done a great job and has proved himself to be the perfect next generation Spidey but, the movie revolves more around Peter Parker's life rather than Spiderman. Moreover, neither Uncle Ben and Aunt May have not shown strong influence on Peter's life nor Uncle Ben has uttered the infamous line ""With great power comes with great responsibility"" in the whole movie. However, Andrew's Peter Parker is smart and witty unlike Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker (who was dull and sad most of the time in first two installment of previous series). Andrew doesn't disappoints you, however, we hope he will improve with the series to do the Tobey act of Spiderman 3. Still you would agree with director Marc Webb's words, ""You will love Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker.""<br/><br/>Overall you can enjoy only if you do erase the sweet memories of the previous Spiderman series and watch it with no high expectations."
"muthuchakkara","3","2","6","6 July 2012"," It stands up to its name...
","The Amazing Spider Man was a movie that I felt was truly amazing. For starters on the movie, Andrew Garfield is WAY better than Tobey Maguire in the movie! He looks and feels young! I felt that this movie was much darker than the last 3 movies of Spider Man. Many people I saw have said that the 3D in this movie is very bad, but when I saw the movie, the 3D was much better than few of the last movies I saw. There are some scenes where Spidey swings on to your face! The movie, being dark, also became scary with the uprising spooky music. Garfield acted well, and so did Emma Stone. Stone was Gwen Stacy in the movie, and after watching this movie, I feel that I prefer Gwen to Mary Jane, the heroine of the last 3 movies. The villain was The Lizard a.k.a Curtis Connors, who I felt contributed in making the movie pretty dark. The story line is much different than the last movies, with lots of scenes filling you with curiosity. Apart from these plus points, there was something in the movie that I felt was weird,such as the part where Spidey is in the public and no one notices him, and how Peter shows his powers without his mask and no one gives it a second thought. Keeping these aside, the movie is just perfect, and I recommend it to everyone."
"judywalker2","5","2","6","5 July 2012"," Another mediocre marvel movie
","Saw this Spiderman reboot because my daughters were interested. Frankly I had enough with Spidey III. Probably that was because I never could get into Tobey McQuire as Peter Parker nor Kristen Dunst as annoying Mary Jane. Of course this Spiderman was suppose to be different, darker, like Batman (which by the way worked for the first movie and only worked for the second because of the brilliant acting of the Late Heath Ledger). Well it was darker and gave somewhat more of an emotional impact but that was only when we saw Peter Parker. Unfortunately the Spidey bits were the same old web-slinger, endless fight, guy getting hurt nonsense. I do have to say that I liked this new guy better than McQuire. I also think the banter between Martin Sheen (who I miss in movies) and Sally Fields was nice but poor Sally was at a disadvantage and I really didn't care for her as Aunt Mae. The villain was okay and Dennis Leary is always great. I also have to say that Emma Stone got luck, as they didn't give her the stupid female role, Gwen was actually smart, yeah.<br/><br/>Now here's the *Spoiler Alert* and I have never written a Spoiler in my life but I am just sick and tired of Spidey having to reveal himself. He's suppose to have a secret identity people, well if he let's everyone know who he is it's no longer a secret. So can we just cute it out already.<br/><br/>It is a movie that will make big money for a few days and be quickly forgotten like most of the summer films. But we know that they'll do a sequel now don't we."
"perpetuallybadhaircut","9","2","6","4 July 2012"," Loved Every Minute Of It: Corny, Action-Packed, Even Sappy At Times
","Amazing indeed. They certainly made the right choice for the role of Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield, an extremely under-appreciated actor) and Summer-Sweetheart Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy. You can't help but love the quirky and awkward chemistry these two have, it gives it that romantic flare that every superhero movie requires for some reason. We start out with a young Peter Parker and his parents who mysteriously vanish for some secretive reason and leave him in the hands of his uncle and aunt. As he grows up, he's the obvious, B-Grade awkward teenager who enjoys riding a skateboard and taking pictures with his old, vintage camera. He's got an an obvious crush on one Gwen Stacy, who's different from Mary Jane in ways that make you root for these two more as a power- couple. She's blonde so you know she's hot, but she wears her it in a ponytail and with straight-across bangs so you know she's a classy, hands-off kind of girl. Peter Parker is less of an outsider in this one and more of a loner. He'a smart and sassy enough to have friends, he just chooses not to. In this reboot, Peter Parker is an effortless genius, chatting it up with soon-to-be-villain as he tries to learn more about his father by talking to this scientist who used to be his father's colleague. Curt Conners is his name, and he's bent on regenerating his arm using lizard DNA. Then they totally lose you and go all scientific, spouting nonsense about algorithms and such until they come up with a formula to regenerate limbs. The formula though has an adverse side-affect that turns you into a monstrous dinosaur-like creature. Soon Connors becomes addicted to the power and tries to destroy the city, blah blah blah, romance brewing, blah blah blah. It's classic superhero flick. So why do I love it so much? I didn't much care for ""The Avengers"", only so many one-liners can be packed into a non- comedy, and on top of that have an over-enthusiastic battle scene, but this movie did a great job choosing Emma Stone for her role. We know Emma from ""Easy A"" where she proves she's got the chops for comedy, she's able to a character in this movie without having to have a shtick. Her plucky personality and sun-kissed hair is side-kick gold, and she manages to help out a lot in the end, but it's not so distracting where she's the damsel in distress, unlike Mary Jane who's best assets were complaining and her torso during the kissing-in-the-rain scene. Gwen Stacy likes Peter for Peter, while Mary Jane likes Peter for Spider Man ""and I guess Peter too"". Andrew Garfield is a great choice for Spider Man. His personality is less over bearing, and his natural flow for things brings more likability than Tobey Maguire ever did. Garfield can joke, while also being serious enough to not ugly-cry so bad it becomes an Internet meme sensation (Tobey Maguire's ugly-cry, Google it). The two stars together are so cute and quirky, it's less forced upon because it's not like the nerd has to beat anyone up or anything like that to get the girl, it happens cuz it happens. The movie of course has that typical Marvel superhero way of making a movie. They care more about audience appeal than they do critic appeal. This movie, however, manages to do both for me. I see it as an enjoyable film, the quirky jokes and one-liners don't bother me because it's less over-bearing. I remember good things rather than being reminded of them. Sure, sometimes the jokes are cheesy, but this movie isn't meant to be taken so seriously. I sometimes detest those Marvel superhero movies for that, but this was a really good crowd-pleaser. The drama in the movie is also not so overbearing so that you forget this is supposed to be an enjoyable movie, but it's good enough so you know this movie's not a total joke. The actors can be serious when they want to, and deliver a better-than-expected performance. And I did enjoy it, the action scenes were riveting, but of course there's that cliché villain who starts out normal, but goes mad because he can't get enough power. It all comes together nicely, and by far surpasses the originals. I can't wait to see Andrew Garfield in the sequels, which you can count on being. Andrew Garfield is the real summer star, much better than butterface Channing Tatum being the constant center of attention, Garfield really deserves it. The only reason it's only a 9 and not a 10 is because of the lack of value it's needs to be an incredible film. It doesn't want to be taken too seriously, like any Nolan DC superhero movie, it wants to be a fan-favorite, and it achieves that on pure likability. It may not be incredible, but it sure is amazing."

I've seen people say the movie went too fast at some points like when he made his costume choice. Toby magurie did three sketches and appeared in a amazingly made costume, what did he use to make that?????

"lekkerinmevel","8","2","6","1 July 2012"," Webb of Spider-Man doesn't go full throttle
","It's hard for me to write a good review about a movie for which I'm highly anticipated for. I'm a fan of Spider-Man, watched the cartoons when I was just a kid, love the previous Spider-Man movies and today I went to see the Amazing Spider-Man.<br/><br/>I found the final version somewhere between Great and Amazing. Usually with stories starting with origins it takes time to get into the superhero bit.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield plays a heck of a Peter Parker, and I also loved the bits of humor when he's Spider-Man, that I kinda missed on the Raimi-movies. And his growing relationship with Gwen Stacy is nice to see.<br/><br/>The downside of the Amazing Spider-Man are the action sequences, which I found very short in my opinion. Also, the impact of Uncle Ben's death was less present as in the Raimi-version, it felt rushed. As you all know, it's his death that changes Peter into Spider-Man... With great power comes great responsibility. Peter realizes later that into the movie.<br/><br/>Another downside is I felt there were parts missing. The scene on the bridge where he 'catches' cars with his webs... You only see him do that once, but when you get the overall picture, there are multiple cars hanging on a thread. Things like that make me feel parts are missing, which is a shame in an action sequence. There's also another thing in the final act which has to do with gas and a SWAT team.<br/><br/>An upside was I felt the rush during his web slinging, which were really great. Also, the realistic style of the movie also feels good.<br/><br/>I couldn't believe at first, but I found Peter's abilities to use his wits at science quite believable.<br/><br/>We can expect a sequel in 2014, and I hope that Part 2 goes full throttle, because I felt that director Marc Webb was holding the brakes in this one. I'm also intrigued about what's to come about Peter's parents, because of what we saw is just a tip of the iceberg (I read somewhere that they're gonna delve deeper into that in the sequel).<br/><br/>Still, I give this movie an 8 for the realistic style, the story and how they portrayed Spider-Man's personality, and the score by James Horner."

","Having thoroughly enjoyed the spiderman trilogy, I had been really looking forward to this latest addition to the franchise, but was sorely disappointed. I hated it. The character development was practically non-existent. The film had barely any tension for me. After 90 mins I could barely keep my eyes open it was so dull, including the action scenes. The guy who did a review on this must have been watching a different film. What I loved about the spiderman trilogy was that each film built upon the last, to my mind getting better and better - the action AND the plot and characters. By the time spiderman came to fight the Lizard in this film I wanted spiderman to lose so there wouldn't be a sequel. The forgettable actor who played spiderman (can't remember his name) was 2 dimensional and dull, as was every other character in the film. The lizard had the kindest face I've ever seen on an arch villain. What ashame he didn't kill spiderman. I spent £10 on the DVD and gave it away immediately to a charity shop. My advice to you - try BEFORE you buy. I so wish I had."
"Twilek_fi","2","4","17","27 October 2012"," The not-so-Amazing Spider-Man (by Sony Filmmaking Committee)
","Sony had to start the production of a new Spider-Man movie a few years after SM3 lest they lose the rights to Marvel Studios. Since Sam Raimi was probably reluctant to put up with Sony's micromanagement like on SM3, and since actors' salaries were likely to be heftier for SM4, Sony used all of these as a fine excuse to ""reboot"" the series.<br/><br/>While SM3 wasn't as good as the preceding installments, rebooting had no artistic justification. Raimi deserved at least one more shot to correct the ship. However, more cynical reasons are at play here, as I've said above. They've (Sony) obviously got a lot more micromanageable crew now (at least for the moment), and the result is TASM, a film ""by committee"" if there ever was one.<br/><br/>TASM's struggles for a justified existence and its own identity shine through from its every pore. TASM doesn't know what it wants to be, so opts to just throw everything at the wall in the hopes that something will stick. But, alas, nothing really sticks: TASM is neither epic nor intimate; neither energetic popcorn fun nor deep; neither surprising nor rock-assured; etc. I could go on and on.<br/><br/>All of this might not be the result of a ""screenplay"" as such, but simply the result of market research fed through a few ""sure"" screen writing algorithms, or heck, even a roulette. :D TASM tries especially to catch two recent commercial lightnings in a bottle: the ""dangerous"" emo teen love drama of Twilight and the grim & gritty superhero approach of The Dark Knight. Since neither is really the bread & butter of the Spidey-verse, it causes a malfunctioning mixture, and crucially, even the traditional Spidey elements (lighthearted fun & epic action) fall flat on their face here. There is simply nothing to chew on here. TASM is a pastiche of things that ""should"" work simply because they have been commercially attractive elsewhere. The Sony Filmmaking Committee wanted to have their cake and eat it too, by bringing these alien elements into the world of Spidey. Luckily, context-sensitivity still outs hacks and cynics with quite the aplomb.<br/><br/>TASM is indeed tonally all over the place: it can shift from a technological thriller, corporate espionage, emo teen love drama, slapstick farce, ""gritty"" action, CSI-style mystery solving to family quarrels (of which there are far too many) within minutes and without a hint of subtlety or smoothness of transition or even any stylistically justified logic. TASM is a jarring hodgepodge that on top takes itself way too seriously. Even when it tries to be intentionally funny (emphasis on TRYING, REALLY HARD) it only manages to be unintentionally funny. Yes, even for whatever jokes there were, I laughed AT the movie, not with it.<br/><br/>So, could the aptly named director Webb salvage TASM at least somewhat with strong performances from his actors? Unfortunately, no. Only Emma Stone is showing any kind of subtlety or restraint (ironically she is given very little to work with). Everyone else is ACTING as if their lives depended on it, making performances feel awkward, forced and stilted. Sure, the stilted characterizations of everyone are a get-go - handicap provided by the ""screenplay"", but Webb is unable to make things seem more natural. Worse, he seems to play straight into even the most heavy-handed scenes written into the so-called screenplay.<br/><br/>For example, in a scene of extreme improbabilities and idiocies, a few-hours-ago - spider-bitten (the iconic spider-bite - scene was infinitely worse here than in the original comic canon) Peter Parker SLEEPS on a subway ride, AT NIGHT. I really needn't write more about this scene, but let's make things clear: nobody who isn't under the influence sleeps on a subway ride, ever. The reason should be quite evident to anyone who has ever taken a subway ride. Plus, if you are in the danger of falling asleep, you use another method of transportation. But let us continue with the scene: a man who isn't drunk or drugged places a beer bottle on Peter's head (!). Why? Who knows? And apparently this isn't enough to wake Peter up - that happens only when a condensed droplet rolls from the bottle's surface to Peter's forehead. What follows is an embarrassingly ham-fisted attempt at physical/slapstick comedy as Peter, with the help of his new spider-powers, haphazardly and unwittingly rips clothes off a woman and beats up several guys. These characters, never seen before or after, don't bother filing a report to the police. Why? Again: who knows? Maybe these things just tend to happen in this ""grounded"" verse! Even in a movie full of idiotic screen writing, this completely nonsensical scene is possibly the worst offender of them all. While some other, equally cringeworthy scenes are plentiful in this movie, at least they have an impact on the plot. The subway ride scene, however, doesn't have this ""luxury"": improbable and idiotic things happen, yet without any real consequence whatsoever. There, a scene. Now, can I be a screenwriter?<br/><br/>Poor reviews from TASM's test screenings led to chaotic re-edits in an attempt to salvage the picture. All early-to-mid marketing became narratively void since that phase still promised an ""untold story"". Maybe the ""untold story"" marketing phrase should have included the subtitle ""subject to a test screening"", heh heh.<br/><br/>1 star for overall quality + 1 star out of pity for (some of) the actors = 2 stars overall."

","I am going to start right out with a negative yell and say that the first scene that had a ""good taste gland"" impact on me was when Peter helped Dr. Connors with an experiment (somewhere in the first half of the movie) just by pushing a button one more time than his mentor, thus showing his genius mind behind the raw athletic animal vigilante that is Spiderman and proving his ""science"" skills to Connors that looked to be very impressed by his pupil's performance in what others may think requires years of study and experience to succeed in. It was disturbing. Made me write this 5 line phrase. Since that I started to notice all the cheesy scenes that were actually ripping me apart from the tragic psychological identity of Spiderman's Character provided by the Animated Series and comic books since I was a little boy. Truth be told, The Dark Knight trilogy (I'm pretty sure I'm going to like the third movie) boosted my standards several levels up in what is now the Hollywood comic book interpretation wave. Also, this movie was supposed to be the chosen one and bring balance to the force that was thrown towards darkness by the last Spiderman interpretation of the 21st century. But it was not. We may have to wait for the next one. A new hope... These inappropriate puns are saying (what we all know) in an aggressive way that, in the end, this film will not be as epic in the next 5-10 years. It's a question you can answer right away about any film you see: ""Will it be a reference?"". And the answer in this case: ""It could have been better"". BTW - The raw conclusion: By the King Kong scene, pretty much everyone knows Peter Parker is Spiderman."
"JC_Ride","5","1","2","22 May 2020"," Mediocre is the word that best describes this...
","I was originally intending to give this movie a 6 or a 7. So i rewatched it and.. I settled on a 5. Damm, this was slightly worse than i remembered. Ok so this movie has some nice stuff doing for it, and some not so nice stuff going for it. First let's adress the fact that Sony decided to reboot Spiderman... 5 whole years after the previous iteration ended. So in comes Andrew Garfield and I live the guy and he makes an amazing Spiderman. Spidey in this movie is great, I feel like he's much more true to the comics and his humour is characteristic of him (though I despise that god awful suit they gave him). And he actually has web shooters now so that's nice! However, as great as Spidey is, Peter Parker is not done correctly. Andrew looks like a male model, the guy is cool, skates, is super smart, has friends.. he doesn't even get bullied! Just cause he's smart that doesn't make him a dork! Plus stealing an ID and laughing when the rightful owner gets kicked out.. that's a villain thing to do man! Other than that, I also like the romance, It's not annoying and there's chemistry between Gwen and Peter. Acting is fine, cinematography is fine and pacing is good and at the time introducing Peter's parents to the mix was an interesting thing to do (it failed miserably thanks to the sequel but oh well). Some nice fight scenes to, especially the one in the library. But that's where the good stuff ends. The rest is just... boring. The villain is.. ok. He is an interesting one and has a connection to Peter, but his plan is literally to turn the world into lizard people... also thanks for leaving a bunch of expository dialogue on the computer of your *secret* lab. Plus he looks.. bad. And i hate how he finds out who Peter is cause his camera had *property of Peter Parker* on it. Like cmon man! The whole uncle ben dying thing is just what we saw in 2002 bit with slightly different dialogue and the subway scene has more cuts than a Liam Nelson movie. This movie would be much better if it just wasn't so boring at times. 5.5/10. I'm being harsh but I just find this movie as one of those that you watch, enjoy a bit and then forget you ever saw. But hey at least it's better than the sequel!"

","Spider-man is back after Rahimi's trilogy. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are some excellent leads, though Andrew Garfield is a little too ""cool"" to be the nerd Spiderman really is. Therefore, I do not fully believe in him as a nerd. Likewise, The Lizard is not quite as exciting as the antagonist, and unfortunately we only get small hints for Harry Osborne. There is probably a plan for him to join the 2's. The action scenes themselves are not even bad, but miss that something is at stake, because it does not feel that way. The film also does not fully comply with the rules that it sets for itself in relation to the start of the film where he gets his skills. Sometimes Peter Parker can hold onto everything, other times he can't at all, etc. Andrew Garfield, surprisingly, does most of his own stunts, which is pretty cool, while The Lizard isn't very pretty animated. (Legacy effects)<br/><br/>All in all, it's a movie that reboots Spiderman but doesn't feel like there's anything at stake."
"fernandoschiavi","8","1","2","10 April 2020"," A new director and an interesting vision for the franchise, with a cast unquestionable, and with well done and exciting action scenes, it's opened a space for future sequels
","It is undeniable that Spider-Man is one of the most popular and beloved Marvel world. Since its emergence in the early 60s, its creators, Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, with the idealized characteristics make more humanized among other comics characters of the same era. With the various impasses, Columbia Pictures chose to dispense with Sam Raimi and decided to reboot the franchise from the beginning, showing Peter Parker in high school, being bitten and learning to be Spider-Man. The studio called Marc Webb and the screenplay was written by James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves, based on a story by James Vanderbilt. Vanderbilt had the thriller Zodiac (2007) directed by David Fincher as their most outstanding work so far, Sargent has had experience in the Spider-Man franchise was scripted as the second and third films of the hero, and Kloves was responsible for almost all adaptations of the Harry Potter books to theaters. In this new script would be the villain Dr. Kurt Connors / Lizard, who was present in the three previous films, played by Dylan Baker, but always as an extra. Marc Webb also wanted to give greater prominence to the story involving the parents of Peter Parker. Finally, it would be the first film involving the hero also released in 3D format.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield - who had been prominent in The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (2009) Terry Gilliam and The Social Network (2010) David Fincher - was chosen as the new Peter Parker / Spider-Man after being released that several actors were quoted to interpret the character. Josh Hutcherson, Jamie Bell, Michael Angarano, Alden Ehrenreich, Aaron Johnson, Logan Lerman and Anton Yelchin were some of these names. Here it is for the role of Gwen Stacy were listed Mia Wasikowska, Teresa Palmer, Diana Agron, Emma Roberts, Imogen Poots, Lindsay Lohan, Lily Collins, Ophelia Lovibond, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Georgina Haig and Dominique McElligott Hilary Duff, but in the end was Emma Stone, one of the highlights in recent years in Hollywood in films like Zombieland (2009), Easy A (2010) and Crazy, Stupid, Love. (2011), which was chosen to live The First girlfriend of Peter Parker. Here it is to live the villainous Lizard, Rhys Ifans British overcame the likes of Michael Fassbender and Christoph Waltz, winning the role. With a generous budget of about $ 220 million, filming finally began in December 2010 in various locations in the state of California, as Immanuel Presbyterian Church, St. John Bosco High School, and Taft High School in Los Angeles, and Also in New York.<br/><br/>Marc Webb made some changes in his version, trying to make Peter Parker more realistic, we can say that this film uses assumptions similar to what Christopher Nolan did his hundred Batman Begins. The saga of a teenage Peter Parker more (even if you compare with Tobey Maguire who completed 37 years at the time of release of this film) is much more conducive to further exploration humorous superhero school and uncles home. Beyond the humor, you can also highlight the mood changes relevant to age, rage and conflicts arising from their newfound identity.<br/><br/>The producers clearly more humanized the character, and the proof is that Peter Parker has more prominence than Spider-Man. Webb wanted to drive something more grounded in reality and it affecting the emotion of the scenes, the physical action and the clothes. Hence we have a deepening relationships of the characters, further exploration of the past of Peter with his parents, and a more paupável that it develops its technological apparatus, behaves, and is inspired to produce their clothing hero. The paths traced are less based on Steve Ditko world and probably closer visually and more influenced by the Ultimate universe, but also quite a world of our own creation. The director also made other changes in this new version, like the fact that Peter skating and taking the traditional glasses Peter Parker in many scenes, giving contact lenses to the boy. In fact, since the character was created by Stan Lee, moved very concept of the ""nerd"" in recent decades, and these changes are incorporated in the current reality and understandable. The most important story was kept as Peter being a kid excluded and lonely by choice, being hard to get close to him because it has been abandoned and did not want that to happen again.<br/><br/>Another change is a greater emphasis on the genius of Peter. In this film we see their direct participation in the creation of the formula that gives the appearance of villain - what planet infect an entire city making them become reptiles - in addition to equipment scattered his room as the lock on the door, and especially in creating the web-slinger as soon as he decides to fight crime with the alter-ego Spider-Man - though here he uses material from Oscorp to enable your weapon / means of locomotion. Many fans criticized the release of Sam Raimi in which the webs leave directly from their hands as a result of genetic change occurred by the bite of the spider, as here, the webs are created by a device invented by Peter, following the history of comics and highlighting the genius of the young. Another most striking feature is the sense of humor of Spider-Man, which as in the comics, every time he encountered his enemies and villains possessed a mood much more acidic and fun. Bringing to the present day, it is as if Peter was the anonymity of the internet into that uniform and could be more sarcastic.<br/><br/>Known peo photography work on director Michael Bay movies like The Rock (1995), Armageddon (1998) and Pearl Harbor (2001) and other blockbusters like Night at the Museum 2 (2009) and The Green Hornet (2011) John Schwartzman probably realize your best work to portray the most realistic and dramatic side desired by Marc Webb. Schwartzman was facing the challenge to film entirely in 3D without any conversion, putting the viewer in the place of Spiderman in action scenes. All outdoor scenes and capture the most dangerous side of New York, a darker side and dark city.<br/><br/>Even the indoor scenes, whether in home environments uncles Peter at school Midtown, in the sewers of New York or within the laboratories of Oscorp, the climate darker and bluish scenes amplify the threat of the villain or villains of the city. It is important to say that not all the footage actually occurred in New York, as some outdoor scenes and studio also occurred in Los Angeles.
The production designer of the late J. Michael Riva - also responsible for the first two films in the franchise Iron Man - does a great job of riding the school where Peter studied by giving the modern technological environment in Oscorp laboratories by dangerous sets of sewage, and creativity in building every room in the house of his uncles Ben and May, especially in Peter's room, where we see several of his idols, tastes and passions, from his love of science and inventions (which lead to the creation of the trigger webs, but not fluid in web itself, the work of his father), his passion for photography and even your taste in movies and series, with ""Rear Window"" and ""Community"" gaining places on their wall.<br/><br/>More than essential in action movies, the soundtrack is composed by this time 2 time Oscar winner James Horner. Responsible for soundtracks to films like Titanic (1997), A Beautiful Mind (2001), House of Sand and Fog (2003), The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas (2008) and Avatar (2009), Horner easily transforms the work into something grand and exciting, even bringing strong remnants of his compositions for ""Titanic"", helps create moments of excitement and tension. Even being a soundtrack of personality and very versatile, is lower than the track from Danny Elfman in the first two films of Sam Raimi.<br/><br/>Marc Webb confirms the intention of leaving everything including the real consequences of the actions of Peter. Peter actually shows quite bruised after fights, and his movement resembles the practice of ""le parkour"", with action poses referring directly to the stage character designed by Todd McFarlane. Adding to the mood during the fighting, the Spider is nicer than shown in the versions of Sam Raimi. The action scenes are also very well directed and realistic as the scene of the discovery of the powers in the subway, darkest death of Uncle Ben, the development of powers skate tricks, all the fights with Spider Lizard in the sewer, in high school and Oscorp tower. The presentation of the interior of the laboratories of Oscorp and Gwen's house, as well as the dialogues are very positive overall. The famous scene from the film Sam Raimi's kiss with Peter and Mary Jane upside-reversed, is replaced by the scene in which Peter grabs Gwen to the web and pulls on the balcony of his apartment building.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man had the challenge of proving its existence being launched just 10 years ago the original film and 5 years of the end of the first trilogy, and managed to justify their existence. With a new director and an interesting vision for the franchise, with a cast unquestionable, with a technical finesse evident and well done and exciting action scenes, the franchise is renewed and open space for future sequels. A top notch entertainment and more faithful to the comics than with a longer expected expansion of this universe and this without the weight until the release of this new version, the expectation is even better future films."
"jayjaycee","6","1","2","14 February 2020"," Obligation over choice
","""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a 2012 comic book adaptation directed by Marc Webb starring Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone. As many of my longtime followers may know, the annual rewatch of this flick is part of my Valentine's Day tradition. ""Why exactly this one?"" some of you may ask legitimately. I'll tell you. I started this ritual when I was around thirteen years old and this film was one of my all time favourites. So, I said to myself, you either gonna have a date on the day of love or watch Spider-Man instead. What am I to say? For the past several years it has always been the adventure of the arachnid avenger and I gave this old DVD more spins than any spintop I have ever owned. Cupid hasn't been the best shooter in my case, so that's the way it is. First of all, I wanna make it clear that my personal taste in cinema has absolutely changed since then and that this film definitely isn't one of the greatest ever. You know, it's still not bad though. As someone born around the new millennium, I happen to have grown up with every single interpretation of the most famous web slinger. Maguire was the man during my childhood years, Garfield was there when I was in my early teen years and Holland is there now that I have reached maturity (at least, by law). So, I can actually enjoy every adaptation of the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. I gotta admit though that I now realize some definite flaws. The most indisputable problem of this flick is that it's obviously spinning it's web around the foundation of the Raimi trilogy instead of building something original in the first place. There are countless stories in the comic books it could have adapted in a way never seen before, but it rather insisted on following the same pattern and sometimes using the same scenes with only mildly changed dialogue. This is where it really shows that it's a reboot rather than an all new adaptation. Aside from these decisions that were probably mostly made by Avi Arad, the director Marc Webb who was literally born for this job (at least, by name) did decent work. He managed well to direct a magnificent cast that consists of academy award winners and nominees. Even though Garfield and Stone are slightly too old to portray high school teenagers (this has always been a problem for the casting directors when it comes to casting them) they still looked wonderful in their respective roles and, in the case of the first, acted superbly in the context of the format. Also, I'd like to point out the atmospheric score of James Horner that is hands down the best aspect of this flick. The screenplay shows both greatness and debacles. First, it's cool that they finally brought The Lizard to the big screen with actually impressive CGI. I've never seen a Lizard speaking with such a prominent English accent before, so that's an achievement. Second, the chemistry between the protagonists is so lovely and some scenes had surprisingly well written dialogue (the dinner discussion!) and the new style of the suit is amazing (pun intended) too. So is the action in the fight sequences that finally contain new camera angles and shots that use the power of swinging for the first time. This innovation is apparently ignored by the most and definitely needs to be appreciated more! Well, but let's get to the negative aspects as well: The film is basically too long with a runtime of more than two hours while one third consists of the origin story that we've all been knowing about and that was at times recreated scene by scene from Raimi's features. Also, the whole ""responsibility"" aspect was altered into something less inspiring and only used as a side theme that never fully reached its whole potential in the story. Additionally, what's the point of building up this whole ""obligation over choice"" symbolism only to destroy and negate it with the last lines? It's undeniably a dumb decision, even if it means that Gwen and Peter can become a couple in the obviously set up sequel. Oh, the immense disrespect to Captain Stacy whose last wish was that his daughter would be left out of it ... Well, we all know how that ends eventually. All in all, this extended Sony advertisment in a Marvel adaptation is a decent fun nevertheless. I'm probably a bit biased, but not that much. It's nice mindless fun for in between and although it's not remembered or appreciated in the pop culture, definitely played a significant role in the history of the hero's films. It's highly influenced by Sam Raimi and suffers from the lack of originality, but remains a childhood pleasure. I'm not sure if I'm gonna revisit it ever again. Let's hope I have a date on Valentine's Day next year. Otherwise, you all know where I'm gonna swing by."

","Following in the wake of the ream of comic heroe movies that DC and Marvel have been promoting, this film is just one more, and addresses, as it has been done before in the cinema, the iconic figure of Spider-Man, a one of the most remarkable and famous cartoon heroes ever. He has originated, at least, one trilogy (around 2000) and has now been recycled to make a few more movies, and a few million dollars in profits.<br/><br/>This movie, like many others, tells how teenager Peter Parker became Spider-Man, with all the moral and psychological conflicts associated with such a radical transformation. However, we have seen this so many times that it was difficult to show anything substantially better without changing the character's story, which would be sacrilegious. So the movie just shows what we already know, selects a powerful villain from the long list of enemies the character has accumulated over decades of comics, and gives us the decisive confrontation between them.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield is a decent Peter Parker, but I confess he hasn't always convinced me. He has some annoying face movements, but he does what he needs to do. Emma Stone looked a lot better to me, but this wasn't the movie for her to shine. So she just made a good romantic match, having a good chemistry with Garfield. Rhys Ifans is equally good as a villain. Martin Sheen and Denis Leary also did well.<br/><br/>The film is directed by Marc Webb, who seems to have done a decent job. The problem is that he didn't bet as much as he should on creating a good story and developing characters and the work of the actors. The concern was, from the beginning, CGI and visual and sound effects. And, in fact, on this issue, the movie is excellent. It's a visual show from start to finish, with sweeping New York views, great costumes and photography and immense camera movement, which gives a feeling of speed and agility to Spider-Man, who flies and jumps like never before. Soundtrack is also excellent, as epic as you'd expect in such a movie.<br/><br/>I think the movie loses a little compared to other movies with other characters. It is not a movie that stays in memory, or can be said to be grand or excellent. Good dialogues are missing, a handful of more complex and developed characters, a more interesting and less trite story. It's a good and entertaining movie, has good production values, good actors and is visually spectacular, but that's basically it."

Actually that's not true. I liked his Spider-Man. It was his Peter Parker that I didn't like.<br/><br/>It's the same for just about any hero out there. They are in essence playing two roles. The role when they put on the mask the tights, and the role in their secret identity.<br/><br/>Some have done a good job of balancing the two, others not so much. And as much as I rag on Tobey McGuire's rendition of the same character he at least did a good job in portraying both. Andrew Garfield didn't. As I said his Spider-Man was good. He had that quippy nature that Spider-Man has but lacked the nerdiness that Peter Parker is supposed to have. After all, Spider-Man is what allows Peter Parker to be who he wants to be. It gives him confidence. But Andrew Garfield's performance is that of a skater bro. Not a popular one but one who's trying to act cool all the time.<br/><br/>That's not Peter Parker. And since the second movie didn't do all that well they scrapped him for another version that most people agree is a step up."

","'The Amazing Spider-Man (2012)' promises the 'untold story' and yet gives us largely the same origin as before, oddly borrowing some specific elements that surely wouldn't be included if they hadn't been in the '2002' incarnation, while removing most of the connecting tissue between the events and thus severely reducing their impact. Peter Parker - here, a skate-boarding hipster who's idea of awkward is to talk too much but always manage to say the right thing - is bitten by a random spider, that isn't set up as being genetically modified, while visiting a lab. Within a couple of scenes, he is crawling about the walls with ease. It's almost like they couldn't be bothered to retell the origin story and so decided to rush through it, making the entire endeavour rather redundant as it's almost assumed you've seen the prior trilogy anyway. Even when the web-slinging action starts - which is well done for the most part and compounded by some believable visual effects - you just don't care.

","After the incredible success of the ""original"" Spiderman series (now known as ""the Tobey Maguire one""), director Sam Raimi & Sony could not agree on a fourth addition to that franchise. As such, Sony decided to dump Raimi and reboot the series again despite the very short time frame. While this movie will almost certainly rack up huge profits at the box office over the summer months, its utter lack of heart and anything original/interesting will eventually become known and be its undoing.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" reboots the Spiderman franchise with Andrew Garfield as the title character and Emma Stone as Peter Parker's teenage crush Gwen Stacy. Also along for the ride is Rhys Ifans as a scientist working to perfect inter-species DNA mixing, which of course sets the stage for the battle between Spidey & The Lizard.<br/><br/>There are so many things wrong with this movie that it is actually just easier to go over them in list form:<br/><br/>-The main problem is that the direction from Marc Webb and thus the overall tone of the film is just wrong. It tries to be a high school drama, action/adventure romp, ""Dark Knight""-style hero film, and even a part goofy comedy all at once. It fails at all of these aspects because it just doesn't establish an identity. Whereas ""Dark Knight"" works because it is so visceral and the original Spidey flicks work because they are more playful and light (like reading a comic book versus a graphic novel), this one falls squarely in the ""muddled middle"". -Andrew Garfield is a great actor, but his character is written so wildly inconsistent that it is literally laughable at times. There is no believe character progression or development whatsoever. One minute he is a goofy teenager, the next a brooding soul, and the next a punk, changing between the three for seemingly no reason at all. -This is too soon after ""Spiderman 3"", plain and simple. The first 45 minutes are so get tedious because, well, we already saw this stuff not so long ago. I can completely see what Sony was trying to do, but it just should not have been done. As previously mentioned, it will make a ton of money (at least at first) but inevitably suck the life out of the franchise. -Finally, there are also some scenes in this film that will almost make you laugh out loud as to their ridiculousness. Maguire's Spidey always teetered on the edge of dramatic/campy, but this time it descends into stupidity. You never know what you are going to get from scene to scene.<br/><br/>The only bright point of the experience: Emma Stone's performance as Gwen. Despite the fact that she is terribly miscast as a high school student, Stone gives her character at least some charm. It is more than can be said for anything or anybody else in the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" was one of the biggest letdowns I have ever experienced in the cinema. For me, it is closer to 1.5 stars on the ranking scale. In a Hollywood era where superhero movies rule right now, this one is a complete and utter dud."

"NJRocker091188","9","1","2","29 April 2014"," ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" at its best.
","""The Amazing Spider-Man"" under the direction of Marc Webb is not an excellent movie, nor is it better than the originals. However, it is a good movie. <br/><br/>Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Rhys Ifans, Denis Leary, Martin Sheen, and Sally Field all give good performances.Garfield as Peter Parker/Spider-Man shows us a very different take with his character.In the movie he seems to be more along the lines of a really smart teen rather than just a nerdy geek. Peter is not a geek, he is just very smart, and is also a high school teen rebel. He also shows us a sassier punk like Spider-Man, giving the audience a very different take vs Maguire's Spider-Man. Toby Maguire was a great Peter Parker but, lacked a little in the alter ego of Spider-Man. Emma Stone shows us a strong and smart Gwen Stacy when compared to May-Jane as the ""I need you to protect me"" type of girl. Gwen does not come across this way. She can handle herself. She does not need Spider-Man to come save her, and she takes part in helping Spider-Man save the city. <br/><br/>Mr. Ifans not only makes a great Connors, he also makes a great mad scientist. He wants to live in a world without weakness and wants to give his experimental formula to everyone on his own terms by force. His goal is to cure every one of their weaknesses. Connors just fails to realize that people should have the right to choose for themselves. Dennis Leary shows us a good hard working cop and father that just wants to do what he believes is best for not only the city of New York but, his family as well. Mr. Sheen makes for a great Uncle Ben and also shows us the father figure we known him to be. Martian Sheen also got a lot more screen time than Cliff Robertson did in ""Spider-Man"" And finally, Sally Field gives us your typical concerned mother even though she is really Peter's Aunt. She does yell at Peter a lot. Not because she is mean.She just wants to let in on Peter's life, and to be able to be there for him and guide him along the way. Any Mom would be that way about their kids. <br/><br/>Aside from the actors and actresses involved in this film, the movie also gives us some background of the Parker family such as what might have happened to Peter's parents other than they died. Although we do not get a conclusion to this part of the story, there is a post credit scene that indicates there will be more to come in the next two films to follow. The only things this filmed lacked a little in was that ""wow"" feeling that one would get with the action scenes that look place, and of course an epic score. Other than what it lacked in, the movie did not rush any of the characters. Each character gets a well-rounded amount of screen time. The story is also carefully developed and makes for a great drama a long with a nice mix of rumor. Parts of the film do feel rushed but, the movie in general is still well developed. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" at its best."
"twingle93","3","1","2","16 May 2013"," Biggest Problem of the Film: Peter Parker is a jerk.
","Despite what some reviewers have said, this Peter is not likable or heroic in the slightest. Say what you want about Toby McGuire's Spider-Man at least he acted like a hero, and was only ever this bad when he was under the influence of the black suit or was under a lot of stress; and even then he was apologetic afterward. Andrew Garfield's Parker appears to be this way all the time. The very first thing we see him do is steal an intern's id badge causing some poor guy to be hauled away. Next we learn that he is stalking Gwen Stacy, and has her picture on his desktop (yeah, that's not creepy). He meets with Kurt Connors, solving his conundrum by just memorizing his father's formula and then taking credit for it. After gaining superpowers, he becomes arrogant and immediately uses them to humiliate some bullies and athletes in high school. Even when he's fighting crime, it's only to find his uncle's killer, and then he sadistically taunts and humiliates the car thief and insults the cop on the scene. The car thief isn't attacking him, he's trying to get away and Peter just keeps taunting and cracking jokes. He's a jerk to Gwen Stacy's father when he invites him to diner, and he's a jerk in every scene with Aunt May and Uncle Ben. When the lizard is loose, the only reason he is after Connors is because ""I created him,"" so he's just fixing something that he screwed up, and it's out of guilt that he's doing it. And lastly he says he makes an oath to a dying man, and once he's dead, because he's in lust with Gwen Stacy, he's says he's actually relishing breaking his promise to her dead father. Also he might even be stealing crates of industrial strength spider-web because I doubt someone like Peter has the spare money to order something expensive like that in bulk. For a character who's whole character is based around responsibility, Peter goes out of his way to be completely irresponsible in every scene he's in. I mean there's being a Chaotic Good Lovable Rogue which is how the Spider-Man in the comics in sometimes portrayed, and then there is being an Chaotic Neutral, selfish irresponsible, egotistical, sadistic anti hero, which this how he portrayed in this film. Maybe this one is based on the Ultimate Spider-Man comic, which I didn't read. Maybe it's because he's angsty because he's going through puberty or because of his parents' deaths, but he's a jerk when he's not angry or irritated."
"thirteenprime","8","1","2","15 May 2013"," Terrific, After a Bit
","I watched this on Starz in two shots because I found the first 45 minutes or so to be not very good. It was acceptable, but I just wasn't anxious to endure another slog through the origin of Spider- Man. After the film gets through that bit, though, it gets much better. Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker absolutely nails this character, bringing to the role a kind of vulnerability Tobey Maguire never quite pulled off. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy is awfully cute and does well here, but she appears to be at least five years too old to be in high school, and I'm afraid I found that distracting.<br/><br/>The POV shots of Spider-Man web-slinging his way through Manhattan are astonishing. Visually, this film is a triumph. I'm glad I finally caught up to it and will look forward to the next one."
"justaREDherring","8","1","2","14 May 2013"," A brilliant resurrection.
","A new lease on life for one of the most popular comic book characters of all time. Spider-Man 3, starring Tobey Macguire, could not have been the dismal end of this great marvel hero, and luckily for fans all over the world, it wasn't. I love this film. It rebirthed the origin story of Spider-Man, staying truer to the comic and introducing the wonderful Emma Stone as Gwen Stacey. I understand there are some people out there that aren't a fan of this movie and I know if someone held the first trilogy dearly that the retelling of uncle Ben's death would be a crushing blow, but see the first trilogy, in my opinion, was very, very disappointing. It was a downward spiral that we could only look on at in dismay as it single handedly flushed itself down the toilet. But we're not here to talk about that. Lets get back to the good stuff. Andrew Garfield. He breathed new life into Peter Parker and a unique eccentric glow to the character. He was quirky and a little bit weird in the most endearing way. You can't help but like him and want him to win. And he also has fun while doing it. He is effortlessly Spiderman, and hey, let's be honest, he's not bad to look at. This movie had humour the first Spiderman missed. And I'm trying not to keep coming back to the original but it's hard when it is essentially a remake. Garfield and Stone's pairing kept it fresh with amazing chemistry (it helps that they're dating) and hilarious ad-libs. Probably the best Stan Lee cameo in all of the Marvel movies. Visually engaging, uniquely directed and a super hero musical score worthy of the title. It made me laugh, made me cry, and satisfied my need to see incredible special effects and an attractive man in spandex. I don't know if it's good enough to join the ranks of the Avengers (and associated) films, but it certainly brought Spiderman back from the dead.<br/><br/>Check out my other reviews at consider-this.weebly.com"
"alanrayford","7","1","2","6 January 2013"," Amazing is more like the third word I'd use.
","Physically, Andrew Garfield makes for a much better Web Head than Tobey Maguire or Nicholas Hammond. He looks the part in a way requiring no imagination. Emma Stone is a perfect match for Gwen Stacy's likeness, even though her look has remained frozen in the late 60's to early 70's. Martin Sheen and Sally Fields did Ben and May Parker justice and stand as this films one, truly flawless asset. Due to them, the Parkers were shown in a light that not only outdid the previous films, but managed to surpass over 50 years of comic-book continuity. There was also far less of a CGI Spiderman than in previous installments, which added a certain tactile element to the main character. Lastly, Spiderman's smart mouth was in full effect with some genuine zingers. Now, so you were warned, it's all downhill from here.<br/><br/>To me, it was painfully obvious TASM was written almost entirely by committee. And each voice it featured seemed to conflict with another voice. There are simply too many plot holes, inaccuracies, omissions, WTF moments and pacing issues for this to be otherwise. <br/><br/>Some of the gaps were manageable. Why did the receptionist believe Parker to be Hispanic? No one noticed Parker, in civvies, swing from the top of a high rise and down to the sidewalk in broad daylight? How is it Gwen Stacy, a high school intern, seemingly had executive level clearance at Oscorp? What was with Parker's camera setup in the sewers, since he was not yet in the business of shilling photos? Now, with the small potatoes out of the way, it's time for the biggies. <br/><br/>What happened to Mr. Ratha (Irrfan Khan)? He seemed important. But, during the second act, he disappeared without explanation. After his incident as the Lizard, Connors is walking through the sewers and smells Peter Parker's scent, right around where Spiderman clocked him. Why didn't he remember that? When Pete went to Connors' to ask about reptiles, and saw that mutated mouse, why did he let Connor's walk away? The Lizard mutates a SWAT team into lizard men. Why didn't they go on the rampage? Why weren't they even mentioned? After Parker dispersed the cure are we supposed to believe everyone infected was instantly cured? Like the Lizard, wouldn't many of those who were mutated have gone underground? Also, wouldn't the cure have also affected Spidey? He's not reptilian, but he's still a human mutate. So a ""gene cleanser"" having no effect on him at all is odd. Then, there are the inaccuracies.<br/><br/>Half the time, Spiderman was either swinging into walls or into traffic. Other times, he had no problem swinging like a pro. The Lizard got the drop on Spiderman in the sewers, but shouldn't Pete's spider sense have gone off? Also, shouldn't it have gone off when he went to Connor's after the encounter on the bridge? Anyone else notice how Spiderman couldn't really crawl up walls? He did a lot of grabbing, pulling, pushing and jumping. But it was all far more parkour than wallcrawling. Then, towards the end, Peter was dangling from Oscorp Towers as though he can't adhere to vertical surfaces and actually had to be pulled up.<br/><br/>Parker also got his ass kicked on a regular basis, despite being strong enough to single-handedly hold a car in midair. He didn't seem capable of hurting the Lizard. Matter of fact, had it not been for the intervention of others, Parker would've been shredded. The NYPD kicked Parker's butt too, even going as far as to unmask him. Given Spidey's propensity for adhesion, the mask coming off shouldn't have happened. The only people Parker seemed able to handle were lowly street muggers. But, when they got together, he ended up running from them. Oh, and all of the mentioned events either take place after dark or underground. So expect an otherwise colorful and vibrant character to feel quite muted by shadows. <br/><br/>Then there are the WTF moments. Parker shows up Flash Thompson by jumping 20 feet in the air to slamdunk a b-ball? Parker catches a football and throws it with enough force to bend a goalpost? Come on. For some reason, it was also decided Parker would rock a skateboard. Who the hell Tony Hawks it down a crowded school hallway anymore? Lastly is the pacing. <br/><br/>Despite appearances, this is a plodding film. In 2002, Parker had been bitten by the spider, gotten powers, trounced the bully, suffered the death of his uncle and was in full costume at around 30 minutes. TASM stretches the same material out to over an hour, and little of it is handled smoothly. So, if your threshold for repetition is low, prepare to suffer. Contrarily, the romance between Peter and Gwen is rushed. In two days they go from being tangentially aware of each other to being madly in-love. Even for teenagers, that's too fast. Yet Parker was sharing his secrets and going to Gwen to get patched up, although she had no medical training, in little to no time. <br/><br/>There are a lot of careless problems here that could've, that should've been fixed, but were ignored. It feels like all Sony cared about was getting this into theaters (to retain the license) between the release of the Avengers and TDKR (to maximize earnings) instead of making a coherent film. For this, The Amazing Spiderman is merely passable. It's better than Green Lantern or 2003's Hulk, but it's not the next great Spiderman film. In all honesty, it doesn't quite break even with Spiderman 3."

","This is a colourful film that appeals to all ages, its light, its funny and its got lots of action.The director Marc Webb hasn't necessarily tried to make a summer blockbuster, this is a strong slice of spider man and is unique from other superhero films. Some of the action sequences were a bit goofy, and the story line changed little from raimi's first spider man, but this is a lot more enjoyable.Some things have changed from the original spider man to the modern day one,obviously time has moved on so the styles have changed, he has a skateboard, earphones and hoods that make him more like the modern day spider man. Except from the main character,there is little character development ,this film is also less realistic in what would happen in the story,but in the end it is a superhero movie!This film isn't too dark or heavy so don't expect a amazing flawless piece of work,but I'm excited for the sequel and hope to see more of this universe."
"davijorn","7","1","2","8 December 2012"," Better Than The First
","I watched this movie on DVD, and with high expectations because of recommendations from my friends. While I have to admit that some aspects were disappointing, I was satisfied with the overall quality of this movie. <br/><br/>One of the high points of this movie was that character of the hero, Peter Parker. This movie emphasizes his intelligence and interest in science, while the other movies seemed to ignore this. Parker's ability to invent his own web shooters demonstrates this intelligence (it also appeals to fans of the comic books, which never gave Spider-Man organic webbing). However, it isn't surprising that the old Spider-Man couldn't invent his own spider web, as he was too busy taking flattering pictures of himself. This movie also makes Spider-Man more likable by making him more of a hero, and more of a rebel at the same time. The new Spidey is actually motivated to risk his life for reasons other than the bad guy kidnapping his girlfriend. Even his girlfriend is more heroic (she actually risks her life for him for a change!). The new Spider-Man is also a more realistic teenager: he's sarcastic, independent, and not a pathetic rule-abider like the old guy (the most rebellious thing the old Spidey did was dye his hair and snap his fingers at the ladies).<br/><br/>I also liked that this movie provides a lot more context to explain Spider-Man's existence and background than the older movies did. Since most people already know that Spider-Man got his powers from getting bit by a spider, it makes sense that the movie should tell us something new.<br/><br/>The worst fault of this movie is its occasional lack of originality. There is a bit of overlap from the original movie and although this is unavoidable, it causes a lot of confusion. Some scenes have essentially the same old idea, but are placed in a different setting, which comes off as lazy. <br/><br/>There is also a little bit too much similarity between this movie and the Dark Knight. Spider-Man isn't supposed to be ""the hero New York deserved, not the one it needed"", so there is no reason to try and cross the two heroes. <br/><br/>In conclusion, The Amazing Spider-Man is a decent movie (but not necessarily all that amazing). If you have already seen the others, it is still worthwhile to watch this one, especially if you are a fan of the comic books. It is definitely an improvement over the original, but it will still remind viewers of the original several times. If this were the first Spider-Man movie, I would rate it 8/10, but I am taking one mark off due to some of the annoying overlap of the original."
"sushzjen","8","1","2","3 December 2012"," Beginning of a new era
","First of all let me tell you that this is not a complete story of ""The amazing spider man"". Its just the beginning. So you all need to be patient to know all your answers to the unsolved questions in the sequels.<br/><br/>Coming to this movie, this is most probably the best explained story of peter parker right from the point the got super powers. This first part of the film focuses on Peter learning to use spider power. And we see early days of spider man wearing civil dresses with a mask.<br/><br/>The second part focuses the major battle between the spider man and the antagonist. <br/><br/>Best thing about the film is that they tell you a story of parker much elaborately which is not liked by the people who went to the hall to see spider man 4. Guys this is the beginning of a new story not just a new episode to the existing story.<br/><br/>It has perfect emotions as the previous films lacked. The concern of *uncle and aunt for their nephew. *Loving couples *Father daughter<br/><br/>These emotions were very well shown.thats what makes this spider man movie a more matured one rather than just a fight between good and evil.<br/><br/>As I told earlier its a incomplete story suggesting a much anticipated sequel.<br/><br/>This is a very good movie to watch with family and friends and you'll have a great time. And remember..... Its not Spider Man 4. Its a new Series. Much better!"
"JoshuaHarryMurphy","6","1","2","30 November 2012"," A Good Start To The New Series, But It Has It's Problems (SPOILERS)
","I think firstly it's my duty to say that I haven't seen Sam Raimi's Spidey trilogy fully and completely. As a matter of fact the only film I have seen from that trilogy is about a third of the first one when it was broadcast on ITV2 some 8 or so years ago. As you can probably gather, if an 8 year old me had no interest in the series, then I do have doubts about its credentials. However; I'm not one to hold grudges against films, and I'm sure I'll revisit the series a few years down the line. What I'm trying to say to you is I popped my cherry (metaphorically I assure you, I'm a 16 year old male,) on the Spidey franchise with Marc Webb's 'The Amazing-Spider Man.' Overall, I found the film enjoyable and entertaining, but did have problems that kept it reaching the same high mark for superhero films that 'The Avengers', also out this year, has set.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly the best thing about this film is the performances from the two leads in the film, Andrew Garfield (Peter Parker / Spider-Man) and Emma Stone (Gwen Stacey). It's fair to say that Garfield's performance is not close to surpassing his incredible role as Eduardo in 'The Social Network', but that is certainly not a criticism. His performance is well-rounded, believable, and his ability to play adolescent so perfectly is certainly one of the best in the business right now. Similarly, Emma Stone is again very believable and the pair has a certain dynamic, an on screen connection, which is incredibly satisfying for the audience to watch as the narrative progresses.<br/><br/>The films plot at times does seem to be somewhat formulaic, but the very nature of the Spidey franchise means that some conventions must be followed: i.e. fans would be outraged if the scene in which Peter Parker gains his special abilities via a spider bite isn't shown, or if Peter doesn't have a love interest throughout the film. Despite these conventions, it's ultimately the films plot that is its greatest downfall: it's littered with unanswered and unmentioned plot strings. For instance, (SPOILER) Peter's chase for his uncle's killer is completely left unanswered mid-way through the film, and a shot is shown of the NYPD officers (SPOILER) being covered in slime created by 'The Lizard' which turns people into 'Lizard People.' There is simply one shot of the officers being covered in this slime, and what follows isn't developed whatsoever. Damn, they even have the guts to show the officers transforming back into humans after (SPOILER) Spidery sprays an antidote across the city. Not only does the plot make the film not cohesive and often bewildering for the audience, it undoes the work by Garfield and Stone of making the film so believable for the audience.<br/><br/>The film is visually acceptable. The ending set piece is satisfactory visually, and the audience get just the right amount of POV web-swinging shots to leave them satisfied and not left with motion sickness. The effects on the villain of the film (The Lizard) are often quite plain and standard, but never become a big issue for the film. What does however; is the character himself. The villain, played by Rhys Ifans is simply not interesting and well developed as he should be to become genuine threat to Spider-Man. All we have to look at in comparison is 'The Joker' and 'Bane' in Christopher Nolan's 'Dark Knight' trilogy to see how lacking this villain really is. This comparison may be unjustified, but that's the nature of what superhero films are becoming nowadays - a well respected genre which is starting to release outstanding films on a yearly basis, and although 'The Amazing-Spider Man' does have many positives, Spidey doesn't quite live up to the standard of other superhero films over the past decade.<br/><br/>3/5."

It's not perfect. In my opinion Spider-Man movies often have ridiculously hard to swallow villains and this one is no exception.<br/><br/>Having said that I thought it was an interesting portrayal of Perter Parker.If you pay attention you'll get why he acts the way he does and that it's caused by the small things happening at the moment but by the larger underlying problem which is pretty clearly spelled out.<br/><br/>Movies like anything else are a matter of taste.

"eshwarmail","4","1","2","15 November 2012"," Insensitive, undercooked and unnecessary. Better watch the original again
","There should have been a real epiphany of a tremendous script to be even considered for a reboot of successful trilogy which ended not too long ago. The story doesn't waver much from the original, special effects look the same though it left me in awe the first time around, and the dialogues that seem to be later imposed over the action sequences felt terrible. I became an admirer of Marc Webb for his stupendous '(500) days of summer', but this one came out extremely underwhelming with an uncooked script and an inconsistent screenplay.<br/><br/>Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is left in the care of his Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field) when his parents die. He is the same semi-nerd, gets bullied in school and invisible with the girls. When he comes across his father's research by accident, he decides to pay a visit to his father's old friend Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans). Dr. Connors is currently experimenting on cross species genetics in an attempt make limbs regrow using the DNA of a lizard. When Parker is bitten by a Spider when he accidentally steps into a chamber full of them, he senses something is not 'right' with him.<br/><br/>It is too difficult and too recent to judge this movie on its own without referring to its predecessor. There really was no sense in rebooting the franchise with the material in hand for any artistic value. Marc Webb even blundered in his strength - romance and screenplay though Emma Stone does an excellent Gwen Stacy to keep it floating compared to an equally brilliant and slightly dark MJ by Kirsten Dunst. Andrew Garfield could have made a better Peter Parker but crushed by the insensitive handling of the moments on his reaction to the suddenness of the super power. Martin Sheen was an excellent inclusion who adds tremendous value to Uncle Ben's character. There is no sense of surprise by any character except for Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy when they realize Peter Parker is Spider-man which was baffling.<br/><br/>Insensitive, undercooked and unnecessary.

","I resisted seeing this film for the longest time for two reasons. One, I refuse to encourage or financially validate the remaking trend in Hollywood. Two, the trailer made it look like a Twilight rip-off. But, after being told by two different theaters in one night that the late night showings for Man with the Iron Fist had been canceled, I finally decided to shell out a buck twenty at a redbox for a rental. <br/><br/>It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. It was basically a fan service film dedicated to everything that wasn't present in the first three films. First the good changes - Peter Parker is no longer a chronic whiner and as Spider-Man, he is a jokester which adds all the lightheartedness this film needs. Denis Leary nails his performance as Captain Stacy.<br/><br/>The rest of the changes was mediocre to flatulent. The worst being the automatic vaccine dispensing computer that took less than 8 minutes to make a completely untested vaccine for a biological compound that specifically targets lizard-based (not spider-based... that's important) genetic mutations. <br/><br/>Granted, in any science fiction film you have to make machines do magical things. I mean that's why they call it Science Fiction. There's just so much that's unnecessarily silly and it really depends on your personal ability to suspend disbelief. So go see it and make the choice for yourself."

","I hate to admit this but I watched this movie and caught myself quietly cheering, 'Toby! – Toby! – Toby!' Alas Andrew Garfield did a fine and I was cheering for his version of Spiderman as well. Did he do as well as Toby – I won't tell – and that is not fare. My feelings on Martin Sheen and Sally Field are all over the board – both are great actors in their own rights – but tend to wear their political affiliations on their sleeves like arm-bands. That being said, I am surprised that there wasn't any in-your-face-and-not-so-hidden-hidden message in the movie. Well I guess there actually were some. Let's see there was an anti-science - anti-business themebut that is the definition of a 'safe' bad guy. The evil big bad scientist or businessman – phew – as long as real criminals are not offended – we are just plain swell. Oops, sorry, back to the movie. The special effects were very well done, but did not override the storylinetoo much. The actors all did a good job and the story did keep my interest. I would recommend this movie – highly."

Shallowness We never really get inside the character's heads and most of the dramatic scenes (with Uncle Ben giving advice, dying etc.) are shallow and uninvolved - merely doing lip-service to the events (""oh, yeah, and this happened as well and we should make a scene out of it"").<br/><br/>2. Villain The villain was a shallow shell and ultimately very uninteresting.<br/><br/>3. Aunt May She seemed to have something to do up until Uncle Ben died, but then she really did not do anything else but stand around. We didn't even see her grieve properly. So, shallow again.<br/><br/>4. Bad love story The movie was long, but still failed to tell us how Peter fell in love with Gwen. Certainly he stuttered around her a lot, but they never seemed to actually talk about anything or make a real connection."
"mochmochmoch","5","1","2","12 August 2012"," Too blockbuster
","I really feel for Andrew Garfield because he really does love spiderman and I like the concept about Peter Parker's first love. <br/><br/>But Seriously? Dorky, Geeky introvert Peter Parker is awesome at standing up to bullies, interspecies Science, Photography, handsome and designing then making his own kickass suit. He's too normal, too brave and perfect. In fact this spiderman was cocky, obnoxious and overconfident in his first vigilante attempts.<br/><br/>The beauty of Peter Parker is the fact that he is dorky, nerdy and introverted. He's suppose to be the underdog that becomes a brave hero. Especially in the beginning when he's finding himself. It'd be nicer if Peter can't stay true to his marvel character he was still that character that started off lanky, clumsy, awkward who loves all the dorky stuff like mario, WOW, halo and COD. His family matters most to him. That he can't talk to girls. His first time catching a bad guy he's so unsure of himself that the awkward moments are just hilarious. Like a really adorable sad puppy that surprises himself by starting the mythology of being somebody out of place in the world that grows into their skin.<br/><br/>Why couldn't they have made the story about betty brant first, His first love which, first love stories are always the most powerful and tragic. Then make Gwen into an even more gut wrenching tragic story. Because the Gwen story is probably his most tragic relationship where she hates him for killing her dad but can't leave him because she loves him, pulls a gun on him when she find out his secret. Pressures him to marry her but he's too guilty then accidentally kills her when he tries to save her. This story could have been so much more. The Gwen story should've made the audience cry. Their relationship should've been a crazy gut wrenching sick relationship where you really wish that they could be together and they're almost soulmates and they really love each other like crazy but everything about their relationship gets so sick and twisted you just know that the audience knows they can't. That's the tragedy of Gwen Stacy and that's movie I would've created. Where their whole relationship is, I want that person but I just can't no matter how much i want them I can't be with them from the very start with a lot of magnetism. And the audience really wants to root for something they know can't happen and the thought of Gwen breaks their heart.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spiderman wasn't that, its just a summer blockbuster movie. Where any story wasn't pushed hard enough except towards the mythology of his father. The visuals are nice I just wish they had a true nerd create the story of this film. They started it with gwen but I wish it was a lot stronger where you could really feel for them where you're left super sad fo them"
"jibalis","8","1","2","4 August 2012"," So... Unfamiliar?
","This movie was one of two movies which for me was worth seeing in cinema this year (other one is ""Skyfall""). Spider-man is by far my favorite superhero, so I had high expectations for this movie... But they didn't paid off as I hoped... Firstly everyone claimed this movie to be much closer to the comic books than Raimi's Spider-man. So it made me even more excited about this. But truth was different. Peter went to school with skateboard,he wore contacts at the beginning of movie and most importantly - aunt May had brown hair. That's just wrong. And Peter didn't worked for Daily Bugle as freelance photographer. And they even changed origins of Peter getting his powers. So Suddenly mid through movie I realized it's actually hard for me to believe I'm actually watching Spider-man. Plot also seemed pretty simple and unattractive. From the trailer it seemed that Spider-man in this movie will be humorous and funny like in comics. But the only funny spidey scene was that one shown in trailer with car thief. And I also didn't like that in the end (major spoilers here) Lizard was caught and put in jail. I thought that Lizard was in the first movie, so Spider-man can cure him and leave Connors secret identity as lizard in secret and then in later movies Connors could help him like in comics. Because in comics Connors was actually the good guy and couldn't control himself as Lizard. Now for things what I liked. Emma's Stone's was amazing as Gwen Stacy. She really was perfect for this role. Andrew's Garfield's performance was pretty well too. Stan Lee's cameo was the best I've ever seen. And there were some good scenes like Peter fighting some random dudes in the metro and I actually really enjoyed how thug, who killed Ben, stole cash from shop and passed Peter his milk. It was really cool. So in conclusion... Somehow this movie didn't seemed too good for me. Maybe it's just because I have really related to Raimi's trilogy and I just love Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker. Maybe with time I'll suit to Garfield as Peter Parker and'll be able to watch Webb's work in another light..."
"ladyfalcon001","7","1","2","27 July 2012"," How much is too much?
","Again, in my opinion this is another movie that should not have been made. I love super hero movies, especially Spiderman. I really enjoyed the older movies with Toby. Now a new hero and it all just seemed to go toes up for me. I did not enjoy this movie. I really hate remakes and extensions of movies unless they stay close to the original and carry off the heart of the original movie, like Pirates of the Caribbean, like Spiderman 2 and 3 with Toby. They did not feel like a new movie, they were an extension of the one we loved. Some movies are just done to death and the changes in actors just seems to sour things for you. I think this is what happened with this movie for me. It becomes a completely different beast then the original. I am no way saying this movie was bad. It was a good movie, it just ruined the whole Spiderman hero for me."
"jamvetzal","9","1","2","25 July 2012"," Spiderfan pleased with spider-man
","First off I'd like to say a lot of reviews here are missing points or focusing on way wrong things or must be still butt-hurt and scared about it being a reboot because as a pretty big spider-man fan, seen every show (most episodes of some, all episodes on the 90's and onwards) watched every movie several times, played almost every game (that n64 one ruled) and have digital copies of every single issue. Spiderman is my morally compass, I often stop and ask myself when faced with a challenge or adversity, what would spider-man do? So when I say I loved this film, know that it's coming from a pretty passionate fan. And now I'll get on with it. Basically I found this movie felt like the first 2, but done better to more what spider-man is like in the comics and Andrew did a great job as spider-man/Peter and was way more convincing visually as a nerdy teenager. The acting was all around good, effects were great (especially loved how good lizard looked) and from what I read the director wanted to use as little cgi as possible and one of the results of this was filming somebody actually swinging and followed him with a specially rigged camera, which looked great in the movie. The story may actually be the weakest part but largely just because a lot about his parents was left in the air, however what they didn't answer is suppose to carry on into the next film. And with every adaptation ones changes, for the most part I prefer this over the first movie. Web shooters are awesome and he never actually does catch the guy that killed Ben which is different but I like how they transitioned spider-man originally starting the crime fighting just solely to catch (and probably kill) the guy that killed his uncle to stopping lizard. There was a big change in the origin with him never starting as an entertainer (though it is sort of included to be the inspiration for the mask) where in the comics it was TV and wrestling, he was already a celebrity by the time he started crime fighting which you're probably realizing now they already greatly downplayed his entertainer career from being a lengthy exploit to a 2 minute fight, too falling into a ring from the roof. This was all good IMO.<br/><br/>Next is the villain, I've read some complaints about lizard's appearance and motivations being less than reputable quality but lizard looked very much like that (face wise in particular) in his first appearance, while the plot of wanting to turn the whole city into lizards, well he's tried it at least once for sure so no stretch there from source. As for his motivations, he's a mutated giant lizard, he pretty much went insane and animalistic while maintaining his intelligence and parts of himself, that's the bloody point of the character, he attacks Manhattan trying to make everyone better because Connors in him is a good guy trying to do good, but he attacks the city because he is the lizard and has suffered mentally from the changes, when somebody deteriorates mentally you don't really need a logical explanation (no he wasn't really helping people or making them better but he thought he was) and this is made quite obvious through the movie even going as far as him like immediately having this ""oh sh!t"" moment about what he did immediately after saving peter's life which was immediately after he was cured and no longer had the lizard eating at his mind. I'd also like to note I was very impressed with the combat also, very, very acrobatic and filled with witty remarks which vividly reminded me of spidey from the comics. The spider- sense was well done too and shown a lot more and if I remember correctly during the training scene it shows him using it to web swing (which is made almost entirely possible by his spider sense) All and all I'm happy with it and will likely consider it my favourite (have to re-watch 2 to be sure) with the only real disappointment being the backlash I've read on this film and that lizard (while cool) isn't one of spidey's all time greats"
"joshua-halstead","7","1","2","20 July 2012"," Decent
","What can I say? It's a Spider-Man reboot. Let's face it, no matter how cool he is, Spider-Man is just not the kind of hero who has a masterpiece movie, he's the kind of superhero that has a movie full of special effects, pretty girls, cheap gags, and one-liners. Andrew Garfeild showed potential, and was amusing to watch, and the always amazing Emma Stone was fabulous as ever. Honestly the story was decent, the acting was decent, the writing was decent. So what can I say besides that it was decent. It was fun, and that's really all Spider-Man can be. Was it as good as the Toby Macguire films? No, not even close. But it is a fun film,with action, suspense, romance, science, and humor. It is moderately clean, providing a superhero film that all ages can enjoy. Like I said though, it's Spider-Man, people who watch it expecting a masterpiece are going to be let down, it just isn't, and no matter how hard people try, Spider-Man will never be a masterpiece, it's what it always has been action, effects, heart, and pretty girls. So watch it, it's fun and pretty cool, but don't expect anything special."
"mat-mcnaughton-254-33257","7","1","2","20 July 2012"," Unoriginal but enjoyable.
","Ah, reboots. I kinda saw this coming, but I didn't expect it to basically ignore the previous franchise. You don't need to tell the entire origin story again; just give us the basics. Garfield is /definitely/ not able to pull off being a high-schooler, but this doesn't take away from the movie. Emma Stone may not be at her most attractiveness, but she and Garfield have wonderful chemistry. Much better than Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst failed to have.<br/><br/>The Lizard is also an improvement on the previous villains. I could actually understand and somewhat sympathize with him, though I felt that the ending was just the CGI team showing off their talents. It has a few slow parts, but noting a bathroom break can't fix."
"ticket_for_one","7","1","2","19 July 2012"," Welcome back Spidey!
","Much has been made of this reboot. Personally I welcomed it because Spider-Man 3 was such an atrocity. Sam Raimi is a great director, but ran out of ideas when it came to final instalment of his trilogy. 5 years have passed and we welcome a new Spider-Man in form of Andrew Garfield. We also welcome Marc Webb (no pun intended) as director. As most reboots go, it is an origin story and we all know the story of Peter Parker and how he became Spider-Man. We all know of the tragedy responsible for making him the superhero we all know he is. Andrew Garfield is a great fit as Spider-Man. Not only is he capable of the physical aspects of the role, he also handles himself emotionally too. He is a taller Spider -Man but that's something you should really overlook, because his performance makes him worthy of donning the red and blue suit. More so than Maguire you ask? Yes, I think so.<br/><br/>First starters the nerdy Peter Parker has now been put to bed and a cooler version has surfaced in the form of Andrew Garfield. Garfield looks a lot like the John Romita Jr version of Peter Parker. Not only that, I believed he was Spider-Man. The Spider-Man wisecracks we all know and love are delivered perfectly by Garfield. On top of that, he looks the part. He just does! The Amazing Spider-Man has a lot of emotion and drama to it. Not saying that the previous movies didn't have any heartfelt moments. But this adaptation seemed more realistic, more believable with it's character interactions. I could feel and understand Peter's pain. His parents leaving him with his Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field) at such a young age and not knowing why, is primarily the reason why the Peter behaves like such an outcast. No friends, just the family he has left. His Uncle Ben is the father figure but not his real father. And the scenes between the Garfield and Sheen are very good. I was waiting for the 'with great power' speech. But it was delivered differently from how we would normally here it. Sheen is great in this, as is Sally Field as Aunt May. Both really do a wonderful job playing Uncle and Aunt. I'd go as far as to say it was even inspired casting. Both actors have a warm quality to them which makes them utterly believable in their roles. Even when Uncle Ben dies (I didn't cry by the way) you feel it. And credit to Webb for not stylising or glamorising the Uncle Ben death scene. It's a pivotal moment in the film, and I thought it was handled very well.<br/><br/>When Gwen Stacy makes her appearance, Peter is love struck and the two eventually become more than friends. Emma Stone is superb as Stacy and adds more life to the character than Bryce Dallas Howard ever did in Spider-Man 3. Rhys Ifans as Curt Connors aka The Lizard was OK. I saw nothing wonderful or unique about what he did with the part. Just a man who was struggling to come to terms with losing one of his arms. The fact character isn't American like the comics makes even less sense than why Ifans was cast. He was just about passable and I cared little for his character. Dennis Leary fairs a little better as Gwen Stacy's police captain father, but again like Ifans adds no meat to his character. Both actors are no more than passengers in this. Visual effects are great. Spider-Man web swinging through the city almost looks like a person was swinging through the Manhattan skyscrapers. A massive improvement on previous Spider-Man movies, which in comparison to this, look weirdly dated. Battle scenes between The Lizard and Spider-Man are well choreographed and well filmed. No shaky cam, just solid action scenes showing you everything from beginning to end. All three encounters between The Lizard and Spider-Man are the highlights of this film. <br/><br/>However, the Lizard looks awful. The creature design for The Lizard borders on amateurish and Ifans' voice over as The Lizard was absolutely rubbish. Why didn't they make him look and sound more menacing? The Lizard looked as if he had been affected by Joker gas. Even when showing anger, he seemed to have this permanent smile across his face. Scenes of real tension were ruined whenever The Lizard opened his mouth. A growl or a roar would've sufficed. His voice for The Lizard would've been perfect for a Saturday morning kids show. Here, it only annoys and because of that I couldn't take The Lizard seriously as an antagonist. Also this film drags and drags. Stacy eventually becomes aware of Peter's secret. But to see how their relationship develops is dry and tedious. The script on the other hand, does just enough to keep you engaged.<br/><br/>Webb's direction is fine especially during the action set pieces. Whether he'll be like Raimi and be around for the two sequels remains to be seen. It's a 3 out of 5 star movie which makes it worth watching but for me, not a repeat watch in the cinema. Though I recommend you purchase this on Blu-Ray and DVD. It's a must for extras. The villain was poor, the plot is hardly original but great visual effects fight scenes, and good performances from Sheen and Garfield save this from being a two star movie. Doesn't belong in the Superhero Hall of Fame, but it's a good superhero movie.<br/><br/>Good to have you back Spidey!"

"rich-899","7","1","2","15 July 2012"," Definitely the more amazing Spiderman
","Before the movie was even released at the cinema, it was seen as a huge risk to even reboot Spiderman after the relatively successful Trilogy prior to The Amazing Spiderman. That said it, seems to have been a risk to be thankful of.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spiderman begins with a brief overview of Peter Parker's background and his parents. Setting the scene for Peter as a person and his beliefs. This can be expanded to really what sets this film apart from Raimi's Spiderman, in that the character development is in my opinion a lot more in-depth and intriguing with the main characters, than in Raimi's. You get to see Peter Parker grow into Spiderman once he acquires his abilities and for example, you get to see Dr Connors reasoning for doing the experiments he is doing with genetics. You got to see Peter Parkers detective skills, intelligence, and inner wars with his own beliefs all build up to who he wanted to be as Spiderman. Garfield, Stone and Ifans gave awesome performances, such that you wished the director to add on a few extra minutes onto some of the emotional scenes and tone down some of the action scenes.<br/><br/>I feel the action is very levelled. There are moments where you feel it almost goes over the top, and moments where you yearn for there to be more than what is actually given. However, they fitted into the film well and were also settings for some of the more humorous moments, something else this film produced fairly often with ease. I would say that some of the sequences were slightly effected when watching it in 3D as I seemed to find it got blurry.<br/><br/>Overall I believe The Amazing Spiderman beats Raimi's Spiderman, and lays solid ground work for future films. It built Spiderman up and looked at what it takes for Peter Parker to balance being a superhero and being human, rather than someone with complete spider abilities."
"lilsoccergirl9","7","1","2","15 July 2012"," The So-So Spiderman
","With everyone going gaga over this movie I guess I expected something more. To me, it was just another average day at the movies when seeing The Amazing Spider-Man and I don't think I will ever understand the hype. <br/><br/>First of all, ""the untold story"" I'm assuming is code word for ""retelling the same origin story with a few tweaks."" Sure there's a new love interest in the form of Gwen Stacy, played by Emma Stone, and Peter goes to High School instead of working for the Daily Bugle, but other than that it is the same story you saw in the original 2002 Spider-Man directed by Sam Raimi. <br/><br/>I will give the movie credit where it is due, the acting was very good. Despite my scepticism, Andrew Garfield proved to be an excellent Spider-Man and Peter Parker (although I still find it hard to believe someone that good looking was an outcast in school... just saying.)Spider-man is more comical and charismatic in this film than in all three prior films combined. However, Tobey Maguire will always embody Spider-Man for me in a way I don't think Andrew Garfield could ever touch. I've always enjoyed Emma Stone as an actress and she does play Gwen Stacy well, It's just that I found Gwen Stacy superfluous in that, she does nothing of genuine consequence other than creating the mixture which I'm sure someone else could have done. I understand that the movie needs a love interest, I just wish she would have been more involved. Their romance was uncomfortable for me. I know they're awkward teens but do they have to be THAT awkward?<br/><br/>Visually this film is stunning and is one of the few films I've seen where the 3D actually added something to the film. I also enjoyed the fact that Peter got visibly wounded, making his fight scenes more tense as you felt there was the real possibility of death. The ""shadow"" of Norman Osbourne over the film was also interesting. You never see him but you know he is waiting in the corners, creating a eerie tone whenever he is mentioned. However, the plot is nothing special, nor is the villain. The film promises to discuss the disappearance of Peter's parents but, after their departure within the first five minutes,they are never really mentioned again. In the end, The Amazing Spider-Man turns out to be just So-So."
"chancey-23","8","1","2","14 July 2012"," Good, but not great rendering of Spider-Man
","I was in my first year of school when the first Spider-Man film from 2002 was released. Since then, it has remained to be one of my favorite superhero films. The second one only got better, but the third just stank from start to finish. Coming off of that, a re-boot seemed to be the only way to go, but of course they made it too early. It's only been ten years since the first from 2002. That's my main complaint: the film decides to retell the origin story when I'm sure most of the audience remembers the first film. Aside from that, the acting is surprisingly good, the villain is pretty good, and the action doesn't disappoint. Just a couple dumb moments, otherwise a welcome re-boot that makes me want to see more, but please make it better."
"ryanmoriarity","6","1","2","13 July 2012"," Good, but not great.
","So I just got back from the movie, having expectations moderately high. I watched the commercial, saying it is, ""The Top Movie in the World"". That gave me some mixed messages I couldn't really comprehend. <br/><br/>I really liked Andrew Garfield when he played the role of Eduardo Saverin in The Social Network, so I was pleased to hear that he'd take on his first lead role. But with this, I was a bit disappointed. <br/><br/>PROS -It was more like the original comics -The fighting effects were well done<br/><br/>CONS -Garfield was too caught up in Peter Parker's attitude -The story jumped sometimes <br/><br/>There really isn't much to say about the film. I'm not saying it is terrible! I enjoyed most of it. But I don't see the real point of this recreation from the Tobey MacGuire series. But yes, it is an improvement in directing, but not the acting."
"raisleygordon","Null","1","2","13 July 2012"," Great movie, but was there really any need for a remake?
","If you love, or even just like Spider-Man, and enjoy action, TASM will give you your money's worth. My only quibble is that Andrew Garfield is no Tobey Maguire, and Emma Stone is no Kirsten Dunst. They're a bit shallow in an otherwise entertaining film. But did this really need to be remade, or was this merely a substitute for the abandoned Spider-Man 4? I would have liked to have seen another sequel, but then again, a sequel would have been the same story anyway, so it wouldn't have made any difference. Even though I enjoyed watching the evil lizard, which is put to good use, it's nothing special. Since Peter Parker's aunt and uncle are secondary to the plot, they really aren't necessary (Sally Field's just here for the money) After all, the movie is about Spider-Man himself (and versus the villain), and mostly his love interest, but not his family. <br/><br/>*** out of ****"
"Han_Always_Shoots_First","7","1","2","10 July 2012"," The Amazing Peter Parker
","As a reader of comics, I enjoy - and am used to - seeing new creative teams bringing a new vision for iconic characters, but rebooting the Spider-Man franchise a mere five years after Raimi's Spider-Man 3 was released, just felt too soon. By now we know the story of Peter Parker being bitten by a radioactive spider, quite well. Heck, we know it very well! Granted, Raimi's films had a camp tone to them, but it took its characters very seriously. It was this delicate blend that helped create a timelessness to those films, whereas TASM is obviously trying to be 'of its time'. For this reason I fear that in years to come TASM will still live in the shadow of the Raimi films.<br/><br/>That said, the first half of the film is a powerful drama on its own merit. 'Spider-Man' aside, the Parker household has enough emotional depth and warmth you quickly find yourself caring for these characters - credit due to a wonderful cast who delivered great performances. Garfield in particular delivers a performance of the frustrated teenager on the verge of young adulthood perfectly.<br/><br/>Webb's debut film, 500 Days of Summer, showed that he knows how to capture the emotional highs and lows of relationships flawlessly, and he's done so again with TASM. The film shines brightest when focused on its leads, Garfield and Stone. Their chemistry in undeniable and leaves you begging for more.<br/><br/>For a film trying to appeal to modern audiences, visually - it works. Delivering a style edging between the richness of 'Batman Begins' and the glitz 'n glamour of 'Kick Ass'; however, never quite reaching the heights of either.<br/><br/>At times, TASM feels tied down by its predecessor. The action is solid, but fails to offer the level of excitement and spectacle crafted in the Spider-Man 2 fight scenes between Spidey and Doc Ock. It also lacks memorable visual narratives as seen in the previous films, and so nothing really stays with you; for instance, Spider-Man 2 manages to sum up the inner conflict of the hero by having Spider-Man's mask torn in two, showing one half as the determined masked hero and the other as the vulnerable Peter Parker - a strong, thoughtful image; something sorely missing in this film. Apart from an inspired Stan Lee cameo, which shows the artistic ingenuity and endearing humour of Webb, as seen in 500 Days, there's not really any 'wow' moments, which is disappointing considering the film is call The Amazing Spider-Man.<br/><br/>The trailer promised 'the untold story', referring to Peter's father; however, what we get is the introduction to the untold story. The mysteries surrounding Peter's father and his work are the main drive which sets the story in motion, only for it to come to a complete halt and not be mentioned for the entire second half of the film. It isn't until a sequel baiting, mid-credit scene that this plot is picked up again. Fortunately, they've set up the players well and created a Spider-Man world I look forward to see expanded upon, so a sequel is more than welcome. And in turn, it isn't frustrating that there's 'sequel bait' littered throughout.<br/><br/>Although the spectacle of The Amazing Spider-Man is enjoyable but somewhat underwhelming, the film makes up for its shortcomings with its tremendous cast and weighty emotional punch - which is unsurpassed by previous Marvel films. Ultimately, as a standalone film TASM is quite forgettable, and now has to rely on its sequels to deliver the goods in order for this new series to become relevant.<br/><br/>Rating: 7/10 as 6/10 seems too low"

","The biggest glaring issue ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" falls to is the inconsistency of its special effects: despite getting glammed-up by the Hollywood treatment, the film's CGI waxes and wanes from sleek and stylish action sequences to Windows 98-generated goofiness. It's a small crack in this movie's rather impressive visual exoskeleton, but one that is majorly detrimental to some of the fight scenes and larger set pieces. Still, it doesn't take away too much from what this film is all about: incredibly digestible entertainment value. This is the Spider-Man adventure Stan Lee certainly wants us to see, and the one we as audiences have been waiting for. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" serves up exactly what every summer moviegoer seeks: a film that combines the best parts of the franchise's campy melodrama, honest ideals, and web- slinging fun.

","THIS REVIEW IS AIMED AT READERS WHO HAVE ALREADY SEEN THE MOVIE AND ARE CURIOUS ABOUT OTHERS OPINIONS, NOT PEOPLE TRYING TO SEE WHETHER THE AMAZING SPIDER MAN IS WORTH YOUR TIME AND MONEY. SPOILER: IT'S NOT!!<br/><br/>Despite my unfavorable opinion of this movie, I'm going to start off with what I liked about The Amazing Spider-man. First off, as far as visuals go, this movie was well directed. The first person shots, segments of spidey web slinging around the city, and some cool action parts like where spidey dodges those cops bullets at point blank range, are pretty much the only things I enjoyed about the amazing spider man. I'll say this once, all the crazy good special effects and cool spider- man action in the world can't carry a movie, especially a movie with an extremely inconsistent and tensionless tone and a completely redundant feel like The Amazing Spider-man. <br/><br/>My biggest problem with this movie is that it covered the same plot points as The Original Spider-man, but did it all in a much less clever and memorable way. Did Spider-man really need to be re-booted? Did the new film really do enough to distinguish itself from itself predecessor and add any layers of emotional depth or intelligence to the origin story? My personal opinion is that what it did do to distinguish itself inevitably flawed the movie beyond repair.<br/><br/>Lets start with the tone of the movie. The makers said they wanted to bring more realism and a darker more 'dark knight' like tone to the spider-man reboot. But at the same time they brought in a more comic- book-esque sense of humor to the spider-man character(often times spidey would remind me of the live action teenaged mutant ninja turtles)let's get this straight: Batman is batman and his character is inherently more compatible with a darker tone and the spider-man from the comic books(which is the one the makers were trying to bring to the film) doesn't mesh well at all with this type of tone. This is what kept me from getting emotionally invested at all in the movie and what kept the whole thing from working. <br/><br/>The villain is portrayed by a great actor, but isn't given any well written dialogue or any really interesting form of character development. He wants to turn everyone else in the city into a lizards.....because he wants to strengthen humanity and eradicate all weakness....and all this his motivations are exposed through him talking to a camera...I just never felt the characters plight or his motivation if anything getting even with the corporate A-holes who screwed him would have made better character motivation..... oh, and he talks to himself and hears voices in his head(William Dafoe's green goblin anyone?)And at least the green goblin had an intensity to his character, a certain craziness and determination. You kind of feared what he would do next because he's a crazy technological mastermind.. Doctor Conners turns into a 7 foot lizard and throws stuff around and chases spiderman....LAME. Was the whole 'turn everyone into a lizard with my machine' scheme really best suited for that type of villain?<br/><br/>The original spider man felt...original. In the original, peter was screwed out of thousands of dollars by a greedy wrestling manager and then let the thief get away out of revenge..you could feel the regret and pain in tobey maguires spider man as his uncle ben died before his eyes and called out his name with his dying breathes. In the reboot, peter's moral compass ran eschew over a bottle of chocolate milk -_- and Uncle Ben moronically tried to grab the thiefs dropped gun out of some 'delusion of grandeur'impulse and got shot. The original Uncle Ben was confronted by the thief and was shot when he refused to accomplice him. Which Uncle Ben do you like better? I like Martin Sheen and Sally Field but they were miscasted. And what was up with that voicemail from Uncle Ben at the end? ""So come on home Peter, because you're my hero. Let me just talk about things that are only in context at the end of the movie when I'm dead and not at all while I'm actually saying them."" LAME. SO LAME. This whole movie felt like a huge waste of time for me and for everyone involved in making it. This is no refreshing or clever new take on the origin story. It's a huge mess that looks good."
"raghavrao89","4","1","2","6 July 2012"," Not a worthwhile watch
","It's never an easy job for a director who's trying to make a movie out of a legendary comic book franchise. It's harder still when you're trying to reboot an already successful movie franchise based on this comic book character. So I'd like to give Marc Webb the benefit of the doubt and assume that it was a total misunderstanding of the concept of Spiderman rather than a lack of talent on his part that led to this movie being an utter disappointment (Though another plausible explanation could be that he might've been inebriated throughout the shooting and post production of the movie).<br/><br/>To be fair to Webb, one can't say he didn't try. He has tried deviating from the original plot line of the Spiderman comics to avoid predictability and monotony in this movie (he even borders on changing some facts that are sacrosanct to the franchise). However, he seems to have absolutely no clue as to the target audience of this movie as well as their intellectual capacity. The story has some gaping plot holes and the character development (especially spidey's) lacks a lot of the elements that made spiderman one of the most popular underdogs in the marvel universe.<br/><br/>Spiderman was popular with the masses because of his humble background (that people could relate to) and the raging battle between conflicting emotions that constantly raged in his mind (quite akin to Tobey McGuire's portrayal of a PMSing woman in spiderman's body). The only emotion that's been portrayed in this movie is when he tells his girl friend that he likes to kiss her.<br/><br/>There's not much to complain about the acting, but each character in the story as well as their influence on the leads is so poorly defined that the audience barely has a chance to connect with them. There's no way of feeling the bond between Peter and his uncle and aunt and absolutely no portrayal of how much of a downtrodden geek Parker happens to be. Also, one of the most crucial characters in the franchise has been completely cut out of the story, much like Peeves the poltergeist was cut out of Harry Potter. Note to the director – J.Jonah Jameson is far from expendable. Spend less time explaining how the costume was designed and work a little extra on helping your audience understand the characters (also – get a bigger budget so you can afford a Jameson)<br/><br/>The plot of the movie was so weak it would've but a Kamal R Khan movie to shame. The same old story of a good guy going bad by accident and going around terrorizing people for the most ridiculous of reasons. Why the villain would painstakingly create a 3D walkthrough explaining his glorious plot to any and all passers by in his secret hideout is well beyond my understanding. I feel that the drunken monkey on Columbia's payroll that suggested this scene is quite overpaid.<br/><br/>The fight scenes and climax in the movie as well as the pathetic attempts at infusing comedy into these didn't do much for the cause either. There's not a single scene in the movie that registers as impressive to the viewer – least of all the one with the cranes. So, if you're watching this movie just for the 3D experience, don't! It's not stereoscopic and is absolutely worthless.<br/><br/>So, to sum things up – here's what you can expect from 'The Amazing Spiderman':<br/><br/>Pros <br/><br/>Most theatres today are air-conditioned. <br/><br/>You can try getting to first base during the kissing scenes in the movie. <br/><br/>Some theatres have tasty, overpriced snacks and comfortable seats. <br/><br/>Not at all risky for people with heart problems.<br/><br/>The last scene with a web shooting straight for your head makes you welcome the feeling of impending doom with open arms and is worth 0.01% of the money you spent. <br/><br/>You help the producers recover the money spent on the movie so that they can continue living their extravagant lifestyles. Good karma keeps your circle positive.<br/><br/>Still a better love story than Twilight. <br/><br/>Cons <br/><br/>You can't un-watch the movie after it's over.<br/><br/>Emma Stone isn't half as hot as Kirsten Dunst was in the earlier spider man.<br/><br/>Your girlfriend might fall in love with Andrew Garfield (consider this a pro if she's currently in love with Edward Cullen).<br/><br/>Worthless 3D, laughable plot – not appealing to kids or adults (I'm a bit of both), mediocre acting and pathetic overall package.<br/><br/>The game on the movie (which is friggin awesome) isn't offered at a discount to those who made the mistake of watching it.<br/><br/>Your mother's going to ask you to clean your room after seeing how neat and tidy the sewers in the movie were (I'm not joking – they've got freshwater springs in there – talk about attention to detail).<br/><br/>Hope this helps you decide whether you want to catch the movie at the box office, buy the DVD (yeah right!), or illegally download the movie via torrents (Which is very wrong and something I would seriously recommend against. Remember – with great download speeds comes great responsibility!)."

","So you think they would kept the story going after Spider-Man 3 well thanks to the bad reviews Sony and Marvel decided on a Reboot, Big Mistake.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man retells how Peter Parker Becomes Spider-Man after the death of his Uncle.<br/><br/>But it clearly was poorly cast with Andrew Garfield a no body as Spider-Man my only guess is that he bribed the casting director for the role because he was so awful that I wanted to turn off the movie from the get go.<br/><br/>Emma Stone plays Gwen Stacy, the new love interest of Peter Parker I can't think of anything to say about her performance I mean her character was pretty boring.<br/><br/>What really sets me off about this film is that while the Lizard is one of my favorite Spider-man villains they really wronged him in this film making him look like a Dinosaur wannabe with boring C G I effects.<br/><br/>The acting in the film is forced to say the least nothing worth a single reward nor should it.<br/><br/>Plus there are far too many gore scenes from this film and it was unneeded so that pretty much ruin the film for me.<br/><br/>The writing is so bad that I should have turn off the film from the start because I could have wrote a story better than this.<br/><br/>So this film was unneeded and was a awful idea to reboot the series all because of one film, Curse you Spider man 3 for forcing Sony and Marvel to reboot this series with a terrible actor.<br/><br/>I wouldn't even recommend it for a rental.<br/><br/>I give The Amazing Spider-Man a 1 out of 10."
"bora_mustafa","1","4","18","20 November 2014"," And I thought Spiderman 3 was bad!!!
","This has got to be the worst Spiderman film I have ever seen, nothing about this film is worthwhile and I will admit to say that I was looking forward to it. I have been a Spiderman fan all my life and I appreciated the early Spiderman films by Nicholas Hammond, yes they were cheesy and campy but it was still entertaining.<br/><br/>Then we had the excellent Sam Raimi Spiderman films, not only was Tobey Maguire an excellent choice for Spiderman but he looked and acted just like Peter Parker would. The first and in particular the second movie defined the hero that Spiderman is and yes while the third film was bloated it was still entertaining to watch.<br/><br/>Now onto The Amazing Spiderman, truth to be told I had no problem with Andrew Garfield replacing Maguire, the same can be said about Emma Stone replacing Kirsten Dunst, however the film itself doesn't feel like a Spiderman movie. The first half hour is basically about Peter Parker's deceased parents, however we don't get a conclusion as to what happen to them, the story just disappears. Most importantly though Garfield's Peter Parker is totally off the mark, he shouts at his Uncle Ben and Aunt May, spends most of his time on his skateboard and only seems interested in dating Gwen Stacy. Heck, even the scene where Uncle Ben dies felt totally wrong.<br/><br/>I know this is just based on a comic book but at least keep it to the source material, what happen to the famous line ""with great power comes great responsibility"" I just could not connect with this version of Peter Parker at all and it doesn't get any better when he puts on the suit either. As far as Dr Connors goes, I think Rhys Ifans was reasonable as the doctor but once he becomes the Lizard, any credibility he has is thrown out the window, obviously a villain such as the Lizard is not going to look realistic but the CGI here is unbelievably bad.<br/><br/>On a happier note, it was good to see Martin Sheen and Sally Field as Uncle Ben and Aunt May respectively. Dennis Leary as Captain Stacy was not too bad either. Again, I am sad to say that this Spiderman film is not worth watching, I watched it once and I won't be watching it again, in fact now would be a good time to revisit Sam Raimi's Spiderman films again.<br/><br/>If I can think of one good thing to say about this Spiderman movie, it would be the web shooters which were pretty cool (and faithful to the comics) but then that's not saying much about the overall movie itself."

","Worst Spider-Man ever!!! The main actor does not fit the role of any superhero. Everyone who watched this movie truly wondered how He get this role??? The only thing that pulls the film - it's special effects, but even here there is much to grow. Just really did not like the idea of ​​devices on hand that produce webs. Every screen writing course not new. You'll feel all the time that you know what will happen next. This is the case when you are going to the movies - an easy way to feel that you are predictor.

","I am giving this 1 for effort of the actors and expense went to. This is the worst movie I have seen for a long time. It has no heart, I have seen 20 second commercials that have affected me more. In fact, I found it an insult to the viewer. Who would actually recommend this? You would have to be born in 85 or over. This is basically Superman but extremely bad. The main actor is not suited to it, which is number 1 requirement of this superhero movie. I thought it was an art-house movie about something awful not a big budget chain in the first 10 minutes. Him turning into a spider is gross, being in high school and getting nervous around girls is ludicrous. Make a stand against this sort of production. Studio - do not repeat or muck up any other worthy franchises."

Age groups below 18 prevail and the sooner we admit it, the less money we will spend in fancy Twilight-ish garbages like this.<br/><br/>There must be something like a disease upon all producers - script writers - directors.

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","8","3","12","4 July 2012"," Will cause a proper debate between those who prefer this, and those who love the prior trilogy
","Peter is a typical high-school student, if a little nerdy. He is bullied, but unlike the Maguire version, you like him, relate to him, and he's not just awkward and quiet all the time. He has a crush on Gwen(who is not just ""the girl the lead will end up with"", she has a vital role, personality, and she's incredibly charming and beautiful), and she may just like him, too... and you believe that, because she's slightly geeky, herself(and the relationship between them is part of the emotional core that is the film's greatest strength... you really get into this, never bored because of how much you care, and it leaves an impact on you; it's a drama where the protagonist happens to be a costumed superhero, not the other way around). Their puppy love is endearing, and I defy any young straight male to not fall for her. One day, because of his inherent stupidity(...yeah, this is a bit more of a teenage-y take on the material, and it is dumbed down... the car thief uses a gadget to break into the vehicle(in the trailer, the one that also lets you one that in this, the wit of the titular hero is actually present, and *funny*), which doesn't contradict his intelligence(hey, he's a kid!), he's bitten by a Scienced-Up spider. He gets to figure out his powers, and soon becomes a masked vigilante(for an actual reason, in this one). Dr. Connors is a kind man who wants to help those who have lost limbs or the like(including himself), and he becomes The Lizard from splicing animal DNA with that of reptiles... and... turns completely evil, which is a bit unfortunate, as it would be more interesting with a tragic villain. What he lacks in shades of grey he makes up for in being freaking terrifying. He provides the scariest and most tense moments in all four films(I suppose the old ones didn't really try for that), and the fact that he's clearly *smart*, not just ""an animal"", really seals the deal(and they give him a nice, expressive, monstrous face). He will have to be stopped, but Spider-Man has to be careful, as George Stacy, captain of the corps, has sent the police(oh yeah, they exist in this universe! You know, the Raimi ones had me forgetting that...) to arrest him(goes against the comics? Sure, however, it creates tenable conflict, makes sense and really brings forth this, another of the strong characters). This is a more realistic approach, and thus it gets to be dark. The origin is retold, and it is less mature than the 2004 sequel(remake of the first one? Nah, it takes some of the scenes and expands upon them). Uncle Ben and Aunt May are real people, and clearly an old married couple. This doesn't really get goofy. The mystery leaves us hanging, for better or worse. This is well-paced. The action is excellent, very tight, we feel the blows, and it has the elements we'd want - webbings, swinging(we've seen that before, but this is the only one where there is a sequence of it that is genuinely powerful), mid-air fighting and heroics(something that we see come naturally, over time, to Parker, not just ""well, if I were in a graphic novel, I'd save people, so why not!""). FX are amazing, pun intended. The 3D is admittedly barely present, and frankly, if you want to save the extra expense, you're not missing anything by just watching a regular version. There is a lot of bloody violence(really pushing the PG-13 rating), disturbing content, and a little moderate language in this. I recommend this very much to any fan of the source, of this genre, of those involved and even those who liked the other flicks. 8/10"

Jonah Jameson. the Wrestling fight... but then those elements have been covered by the first installments. But overall this is one of the best Comic Book movies (true to the Comic Book roots) I have seen. This Spiderman and more so this Peter Parker is how I always imagined these Characters.

"Tcarts76","6","2","7","19 October 2012"," Nothing to set it apart from the 2002 movie
","I give this movie a 6. Frankly I was hoping for something much better. I was hoping for something that would really make this movie different from the franchise started in 2002. Something that would really make it worth watching since it's only been 5 years since a Spiderman movie came out. Well you know what they say about wishes, and hopes don't you? You can hope in one hand and take a number 2 in the other hand, and see which one fills up first. Yeah, nothing new or great here.<br/><br/>I guess you could say the story line is a tad different. They put Peter Parker's (Andrew Garfield) parents into the story. They also got rid of Mary Jane, in favor of a new love interest, Gwen (Emma Stone). They also remade Peter as a smart, loner, social outcast type (You know, like one of those kids that just might bring a gun to school), instead of just the nerdy geek with a camera.<br/><br/>Everyone knows the rest of the story by now. A socially awkward boy that lives with his aunt and uncle, gets bit by genetically experimental spider which gives him incredible spider like abilities. His uncle gets killed and he decides to avenge his death, and become a vigilante super hero. In the end Peter has to choose between being a super hero and being with the girl he loves.<br/><br/>I thought that maybe one reason they made this film so shortly after the last Toby Maguire trilogy (2002, 2004, 2007) might be to take a darker more sinister, and less corny version ala the Dark Knight franchise. While this one may have hinted that they wanted to go there in a few scenes it just never does. It still stays pretty corny. If you are going to make a film like this , Please have something original to offer and go for it. This movie to me looks and feels as though it was one of the last 3 films, but with different faces.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield really adds and brings nothing, and I would say that both him and Tobey Maguire did an equally poor job. Ditching Kirsten Dunst was a good move as she is one of the most overrated actresses in Hollywood, and Emma Stone was probably the best actor in this whole movie so clearing out Mary Jane didn't hinder it. The CGI was overdone and that is one of the pet peeves I have with almost all movies these days.<br/><br/>In the end this movie was completely unnecessary, especially when there was a trilogy put out just 5 years ago. Sounds to me like the studio just wanted to pull one over on us and make a quick buck. This movie looks and feels like everybody involved with the previous movies just threw it together with some out takes of the last ones, and there is nothing to distinguish it as anything any better or worse.<br/><br/>I give it a 6, watchable, but it has nothing really different from the older 3 movies. If you want to watch a great, original, super hero movie, leave this one until you have exhausted all the others and rent Kick-Ass (2010) instead, and keep your eyes open for Kick-Ass 2 in June 2013.<br/><br/>Like my reviews, Hate em?

","Wow, at first I thought it was going to be just another generic reboot of Spider-man, but I was totally blown away with the script, timing, humor, acting, and special effects were perfect. Bravo to the actors and filmmakers!! I loved it! I feel this version of Spider-man is more to the comic than the Sam Raimi's version because Peter Parker is supposed to be kind of a nerdy, bookworm science geek besides a photographer. Also, the fact that Peter Parker now uses a device for his web (like the comic) instead of the web coming out of his skin (like the Sam Raimi's version) makes more sense now because he's slowly perfecting his craft. Plus he uses his technical skills he's learned from researching to build his costume seems more believable. Besides the costume design, Spider-man's personality again seems closer to the comic because he tries to be sarcastic and also is being human as well. He gets hurt where as Tobey as Spider-man seems to have superhuman strength without really having to struggle much (except with the villains). Andrew as Spider-man however seems realistic. There was a scene in the movie where he allows himself to be shown without the mask and he takes off his mask to prove to a kid whose scared that he is only human. I feel this is what Spider-man movie should've been instead of a sappy, cheezy, Spider-man storyline Sam Raimi directed, not that I didn't enjoy Sam Saimi's version of spider-man, but it wasn't as deep or sophisticated. <br/><br/>Last thing I would like to mention is that there are those ignorant morons who don't know the Spider-man comic books and criticizing the cast that it's nothing but a simple reboot. Even though Peter Parker's love interest isn't Mary Jane, Gwen Stacy IS Spider-man's first love interest before MJ in the comics, and Gwen's father's death IS correct (and I have that comic, it's worth a lot of money) because he dies in the comic as well! They need to understand the comic before criticizing the characters...read the darn comic, tired of this!!!"

","This movie is not only the best Spider-Man movie I've seen, but maybe even the best movie I've ever seen, mostly because it blew my mind, and it reached far over the top of my expectations. The music is even better and far more emotional than the trilogy's. The effects are top-notch. I could barely see, when there were special effects in it. The relationship between Gwen and Peter made me smile. !!SPOILER!! And I cried when Uncle Ben died. I didn't cry in the 2002 one, because Toby's cry was a little bit funny, and I didn't see it as a overly sad moment, because I couldn't take the movie seriously. The thing with the untold story sounds pretty interesting. Many people complained about the secret not being revealed in the movie.I know, that they mentioned the untold story would be revealed, but I think, that more details would be revealed in the next couple of movies. And some details were actually explained in this movie. For instance, we get to hear, why Peters dad suddenly stopped the project about curing. That's one brick in the puzzle. More would be revealed in the next movies. The only complain I have, is Sony. Sony kept an eye over Marc, when he made the movie, to make sure he didn't make the movie too much Spider-Man 2002-ish. If it wasn't for Sony, this movie could actually have been much better. Sony, I just wanna say, that when it's a reboot, you basically start from scratch, so it means, that you should not compare it to the other trilogy!!! It's a reboot. Deal with it. Well, at least it is the best movie I've seen. And the ending of the movie (Final swing) is the best scene in movie history! The slow-mo effects, the emotion, the positions, the everything!<br/><br/>This is a movie, I'll never forget."

The Amazing Spiderman is the reboot of Sony's acclaimed spiderman movies, and in my opinion, they created a new peak for the movies. Sam Raimi's spiderman flicks were good at points but going back to see them, they are now just very silly and stupid. The Amazing Spiderman is a very spectacular interpretation of the comics. Even though the producers took from a few other comic series, this spiderman flick did stay true to the comics and left me crying of happiness in the end. The story of how Peter Parker is yes, retold but in the true way. Where he makes the web-shooters! (Not where he can freaking shoot unrealistic webs out of his wrists! Like What the heck!) Which is kind of rushed in ways, but I think is necessary because of the ""oh I get it"" factors that come from the quick shots. Other than that the movie is very well timed and edited. The cast is AMAZING!! Andrew Garfield plays a great Spiderman. All of the twitches and random, qwerky, little things that he does just add to making him a great Peter Parker. Peter Parker is a geek, an outcast, a nerd! I expect the actors to portray that well and thats exactly what Andrew did. Also as Spiderman he makes great smart-a remarks and shows off the strength and sheer skill of Spiderman perfectly. Emma Stone plays a wonderful Gwen Satcy and actually has brains as a character unlike the Sam Raimi movies. All aroudn this movie is great! I'd give it six gazillion thumbs up if I had that many thumbs, hope this review helps and I hope all of you readers make the right decision in choosing to see this movie!!"
"ron-fernandez-pittsburgh","5","2","7","17 July 2012"," Good remake...but
","This is a good re-make or re tread of the original SPIDERMAN. Why the re-make I'm not sure, but there several differences and some good casting, although ANDREW GARFIELD wasn't all that great and EMMA STONE was hard to understand because of her almost whisper of a voice. Is something wrong with her? For those who never saw the original should see this one for some amazing effects and 3-D does work for this one. Good to see SALLY FIELD on the big screen again and not looking none to good which is very realistic. Actually I know this is a cartoon of sorts, two things bothered me. How did the scientist set up a lair with computers, electricity etc. in a sewer????? No one noticed him taking all those items down there and how could anyone possibly have done that?? OK..A cartoon. Secondly, the hallway and several classrooms were destroyed by the fight with the Liazard and Spiderman. At the end when they're back in school, everything looks completely untouched!!!!! No way could the damage have been fixed in a few days time. OK..it's a cartoon!!"
"suroorzehra","3","2","7","16 July 2012"," What a waste
","Where do I begin. After growing up with spider man cartoons & watching the first three films starring Dunst & Maguire one tends to fall in love with the whole concept of boy being bitten, getting the woman of his dreams & fighting crime until happily ever after. This film however was a major disappointment. Every aspect of this film from the script to the acting & direction lacked credibility. The new kid on the block, Andrew Garfield hardly knows how to act. The story line is very predictable. The worst part was that the hero doesn't even get the girl. I was unfortunate to watch it in the theatre & that too in 3D. There were hardly any 3D effects. Film makers will go to any extent to squeeze out money from our pockets. <br/><br/>My verdict 3/10"
"BharatSamra","7","2","7","9 July 2012"," Enjoyable nostalgia
","It proves problematic analysing this film without comparing it and Sam Raimi's 2002 approach to the same character. These similarities and differences are both detrimental and admirable to Marc Webb's picture.<br/><br/>As one of 2012's most anticipated films, 'The Amazing Spider-Man' suffers greatly from it consciousness. Excuse the pun, but the tone during the 136 minutes a certain 'Spidey-sense' about itself; knowledgeable of its existence as a reboot, and not a new trilogy. The unfortunate consequences of this are within the nostalgic narrative, which we all remember from a decade ago. Not only does this film follow the original story, but it's aware of it, causing the evolution of Spider-Man to be rushed as if the director is saying, ""you've seen it before, let's just swing through this part of the story"". There is more to see from this series, reportedly, at least a trilogy, though the first of three could have been condensed into the opening title sequence, as the formulaic story has already been tested once before in cinema by Raimi. Nevertheless, the love story between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacey presents itself as more convincing than what we saw from Raimi's films with Mary-Jane Watson. Our female love interest (portrayed by Emma Stone) actually provides the plot with some importance, and does not need to be saved by our hero in the climax as her predecessor (Kirsten Dunst) repeatedly did in all three of Raimi's pictures. In its entirety, the film feels as if it is an introduction to a story, the blurb of your favourite novel, forgotten, because you enjoyed what followed so much more.<br/><br/>The angle taken by Webb and the cast can be applauded. The choreography, characterisation and dialogue have successfully adapted to the approach of having Peter Parker becoming Spider-Man whilst still in high school. Andrew Garfield portrays the character as arrogant, rebellious and at time reckless, in both personality and acrobatic style (give credit to his stunt doubles also), hugely contrasting from what we saw from Tobey Maguire. Both actors provide various memorable qualities to the comic book hero, contrastingly so, meaning preference between the two is no clear choice, simply down to opinion. There are a number of factors to consider when selecting a winner. On one hand, 'The Amazing Spider-Man' explores the origin story of the character which is yet to be completely revealed, leaving the anticipation for fans for future sequels. Furthermore, we encounter a far superior romance story between Gwen Stacey and Peter Parker so in terms to Spider-Man's humanity, Garfield's interpretation wins out. However, Maguire simply fits the costume better, and makes for a better Spider-Man. We can contribute much this to his voice and the CGI of the character used by studio. Furthermore, the actually story of Spider-Man just does not feel very heroic this time around. The suit itself though with a warm home- made approach to it, bluntly worded does not look as good as in Raimi's series. Though we shouldn't necessarily judge a hero by his mask right? Well depending on what the mask represents. Any suit, whether it is Captain America's, Batman's or Spider-Man's should be a symbol for what these characters believe in, yet this film explores the use of the suit in a continuous quest for vengeance by the character, consequently signifying less of an American hero as we saw from Raimi. Webbing together what exactly this means; Garfield wins the Peter Parker award, while Maguire wins the Spider-Man trophy, resulting in my personal favouritism leaning towards Maguire.<br/><br/>""Who am I?"" The primary theme of identity is highly emphasised by Webb, as the character attempts to deal with a variety of relatable human and superhero problems. He never really does find himself within the film, yet indicates a certain growth in character because of the adversity he faces, often from his own hubris, making him a tragic hero who is required to fathom that ''with great power, comes great responsibility"".<br/><br/>There are certainly aspects of this film that are an evident improvement from what Raimi did. Conversely, many components that I adored in the previous series are severely missed, making it intricate to establish a definite preference between the two. The music in this reboot is a satisfactory bungalow when up against the Empire State that was the score by Danny Elfman in the first two Spider-Man films, and Christopher Young in the third. No disrespect to James Horner whose contribution to 'The Amazing Spider-Man's' score is excellent, but with the will to compare, it's like a butter knife to a gun fight. <br/><br/>I do not wish to bore those reading, as endless comparisons between the two and analysis of the stand alone film could provoke me to write a dissertation of needless proportions. Therefore, I will conclude by stating my comprehension of this review's bias, due to my obsession with the comic book hero, I almost refrained from observing its many imperfections. However, after watching it three times already I felt I have identified 'The Amazing Spider-Man' as a motion picture that had great potential to reboot an already successful film franchise. Was it necessary for Webb to reboot? Yes! I feel that he has introduced a new story for Peter Parker/Spider-Man that was not considered by Raimi. The execution may not have been perfect, yet this instalment does provide a great sense of well performed humour, action and emotion that perhaps is only existent due to the 50 year anniversary of Stan Lee's and Marvel's most successful character. This highly enjoyable reboot will hopefully instigate a more original story is subsequent sequels. 6/10 is perhaps too critical of Webb's work, yet the almost identical narrative to 2002 is this film's biggest downfall, as our villain in Dr. Curtis Connors/The Lizard acquires indistinguishable motives to that of Norman Osborn as the Green Goblin. It is Marvelous nonetheless, to see that the adored character Spider-Man has yet to spin his last Webb in cinema."
"onur-gunduru","4","2","7","9 July 2012"," Someone Please Let Christopher Nolan to Takeover!
","This is my third disappointment with the spider series. Can't say it is really a waste of time but it is far from being a good one. I certainly hope for someone to takeover this project/series & do it like what Christopher Nolan did to Batman series.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen the latest two Batman movies buy/rent the DVDs right away & see it for yourself. These movies have a taste. This is what spider-man fails to deliver. It tries gives you another perspective about Peter Parker which is over-dramatized by Andrew Garfield. I believe he is a poor choice for Peter Parker, however, still far better than Tobey Maguire.<br/><br/>If you have a minute for spidey, please share this with your friends. Let Christopher Nolan to takeover!"
"loco_73","Null","2","7","8 July 2012"," There Is Nothing Amazing About This Spiderman!!!!
","""The Amazing Spiderman"" is a thoroughly unnecessary and quite pedestrian re-boot of a re-boot. Was this movie really necessary? No of course not, but in the dwindling days of Hollywood's ability to create new, original and imaginative movies, this is what passes for an ""original"" idea.<br/><br/>While re-makes are not something new, Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man"" re-boot franchise is only a few years old, and DID NOT warrant yet another franchise, as I said, a re-boot of a re-boot.<br/><br/>People will point to the ""Batman"" franchise as an example. Still, there are some differences there, after Tim Burton's first two exciting entries, Joel Schumacher managed to water down and destroy the ""Batman"" franchise. Christopher Nolan took Batman and gave the Dark Knight his own spin and interpretation, making him much darker and more menacing, straddling the fine line between villain and hero. So I understood the rationale for doing that, besides Nolan delivered two excellent movies so far ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight"". We'll see what ""The Dark Knight Rises"" will be like.<br/><br/>Personally I never liked Spidermans as a superhero, frankly he's just not that exciting, a guy who sticks to walls and shoots thread out of his wrists...the same goes for Superman, not to keen on him either. There is no sense of danger, of conflict emanating from these characters, and most of the popular superheroes, be they Marvel or DC etc. ""Batman"" is the only one that I find intriguing (from the popular ones), he himself does not have superpowers of his own, yet he has such a classic design, one that can make him look as a superhero but also a masked vigilante at the same time. With Batman you never really know where you stand...is he good or bad? <br/><br/>For these reasons, I prefer the more complicated characters like ""Blade"", ""Spawn"" and ""The Punisher"". I did not like Raimi's movies, nor this one. I'd rather choose movies like ""Sin City"", ""The Crow"", ""300"", ""V-For Vendetta"" and ""Watchmen"" than any of the Spiderman ones.<br/><br/>I know that I'm probably in the minority here, but I did not think that this movie was necessary in any way, shape or form, nor did I think that it was a particularly good movie to begin with! The only difference I could think of between Raimi's movies and this one, is the fact that Raimi's Spiderman's web was natural and he shot it from his wrists, while Webb's Spiderman uses cartridges to shoot his load (LOL)...other than that...pretty much nothing....just a bland and predictable movie..."
"hjanjua","5","2","7","7 July 2012"," Weak Story, Weak Spiderman, Why Reboot
","I am huge marvel fan but I think this is the weakest marvel movie I have seen in last 3-4 years. Movie is lacking passion and energy. Story is weak and Andrew Garfield was very cocky and weak. First of all let me start with some concrete statistics, I really don't understand why marvel has rebooted the series in first place, the original spider man (1,2, and 3) rank in first top 25 ""All-Time USA Box office"" list<br/><br/>12. Spider-Man (2002) $403,706,375 <br/><br/>17. Spider-Man 2 (2004) $373,377,893<br/><br/>23. Spider-Man 3 (2007) $336,530,303<br/><br/>Looking at these numbers, all movies did well, and I don't see a problem continuing with same spider man and then further continue the series.<br/><br/>Talking about ""Amazing Spider Man"" story was very choppy and rushed, director has left a lot questions unanswered:<br/><br/>-What was the role of Indian actor Irfan Khan in the movie? Is he the villain in ""ASM 2""? He left with the vial from the Oscorp building. What happened to it? <br/><br/>-Super hero's are meant to be stronger not weaker but all action in this movie was defense, no offense from spider man.<br/><br/>-Why spider man WEBS/WEBBING were coming out from electronic device in his arm? Why?, spider man based on the comic should have those coming out of hands. <br/><br/>-When the police officers got attacked by ""THE LIZARD"" and they were exposed to ""REPTILE MIX GREEN GAS "" all were supposed to become lizards  why they were not giving hard time to Spiderman when he was fighting ""The Lizard / Dr. Curt Connors "" in the end of the movie.<br/><br/>I think over all movie was disappointment from my point of view. I hope Webb can pull a better movie next time."

","i gave this movie a chance and i will give it a five out of ten. not at all like the comics not even a little bit, the whole cross species experimentation threw me off, so pretty much every villain sounds like they are going to cross species some animal. what mysterio is going to have gold fish DNA thats why he wheres the fish bowl on his head. James Vanderbilt should be ashamed that he even wrote this atrocity. none of the movie made me chuckle or feel sad i was just﻿ like o man he dead. Sony you should be ashamed if you make a reboot do it right do not half the job put a hundred and ten percent into what you think will sell. why does peter have a skateboard he's suppose to be nerdy not a punk rocker. and peter parker also has that old camera with film in it yet he has a touch screen phone what is the reason behind that at least make him have a digital camera new day and age. i've been a spider-man fan all my life and i know witty comments that spider-man would say not some actor who mellows out all the comments. the movie did not make me move at the edge of my seat to see what happens next and the action scenes were to dulled out. when i watch action scenes i wanna feel like i am right there across the way seeing them fight but i felt like i was just in the movies watching a boring back and forth fight scene. what's the next one going to have Norman Osborn find a goblin from lord of the rings or some fantasy world to cross species with to make the green goblin, wow just wow not even a good wow"

","This movie will probably surprise a lot of people who were obviously scorned by Spiderman 3. granted, this new take has nothing to do with the past series. at a pretty moderate pace, Spiderman doesn't dwell too long on the origin we alllll know too well but it does put a slightly more in-depth look at how things came to be. the story line is solid though there are times where it seems as if some scenes were skipped or rushed, the action needless to say was ""amazing"". very creative uses of web-slinging throughout and clear shots of the battles made for a great treat. its pretty clear why the sequel was already greenlit well before this even dropped. all should enjoy the ride, if not for the action itself then for the on-screen chemistry brought well by Stone and Garfield."
"user-332-522384","8","2","7","3 July 2012"," i liked the previous franchise more
","Tobey Maguire's Spider-man last came out in 2007.Just 5 years on and we have a reboot.The old franchise earned close to $2.5 billion from the 3 films.Now in 2012 we have Andrew Garfield's Spider-man.Even though the 3 films achieved a lot of commercial success,seeing movies like Avengers and Iron man earning a lot of money(about $1.5 billion for The Avengers) Sony decided to reboot the franchise.Why? Earning easy money most probably.Even though this is a reboot people are going to compare the 2 franchises.Well,Which of the franchise looks good? I will go with the former one though its still early considering the Amazing Spider-man is just 1 movie old.<br/><br/>Lets get to the story. Peter Parker(Andrew Garfield) lives with his aunt May(Sally Field) and uncle Ben(Martin Sheen).His parents had died mysteriously when he was a child.Peter is shown as a nerdy guy who is not really famous in school.He is often bullied at school at the behest of Flash Thompson.All this is similar to the previous franchise.One day in his basement Peter comes across his father's briefcase.He comes across a photograph which shows his father's then partner Curt Conners (Rhys Ifans).He gets to know that his father was researching on cross genetics at Oscorp.Wanting to learn more about his father he meets him.It is at Oscorp that he is bitten by a genetically modified spider that transforms him into Spider-man.Curt Conners has his own problems.He has lost one of his arms and Rajit Ratha(Irrfan Khan) is putting pressure on him to complete his research quickly.With the help of Parker he is able to perfect it but side effects take its toll on him transforming him into the lizard.Now it is up-to Spider-man to save the city from 'The Lizard'.<br/><br/>Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) plays Parker's love interest in the film and I feel her character is well written as compared to Mary Jane in the previous films.Her father is the captain of the police and at times appears to be the second villain in the movie.<br/><br/>When I first got to know that Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone were going to be play the lead in this film I was quite excited. I liked Garfield as Eduardo Saverin in the highly acclaimed film 'The Social Network' and Emma Stone well, how could you not like her after so many good films she has done already.Andrew Garfield was good in this movie but I feel that his character as Peter Parker wasn't written well.His sudden transformation into Spider-man and well getting a hold of his powers was poorly written.The villain didn't have a strong presence in the film as Dr Octavious or say the Green Goblin (he isn't there till the interval in the film).I think his character could have been explored a lot more.Irrfan Khan marks the Indian presence in the film.Marc Webb said that he plays an important role in the film while Irrfan said that it is a really small role.Its up to the viewers to decide how good was his role.There are many changes that have taken place in the new Spider- man.Unlike the previous films here the Spider-man needs to make his own webs to swing around the city.This film has its own moments though.The scene in the subway is quite hilarious and the scene with Flash at the basketball court is quite funny as well.The action sequences are 'amazing'.The scene where Spider-man saves the child on the bridge is well written.The romance between Peter and Gwen for some would be the highlight of the film.The 3D effects tend to lower the value of this film.At times the movie appears to dark for our liking.<br/><br/>I am not saying this a bad film but the fact that the previous franchise had ended just 5 years back made you have higher expectations from the new one.I would prefer you watch this film in 2D.I would call this movie a one time watch.<br/><br/>PS if you do go on to watch this film, wait till the credits are rolled for the post credit scene which gives the hint about the possible villain of the sequel<br/><br/>My Rating 7.5/10"
"pushparaj_samant","6","2","7","2 July 2012"," Not an amazing spiderman flick
","This movie was not creative in terms of writing which I feel everyone was expecting of the Spiderman Franchise especially after the Spiderman 3 love story. There were loop holes in the plot and the director hasn't given enough time for the story to develop like e.g. All Peter parker had to do is take his fathers formula remember and give it to Connors and without verifying the formula in anyway Connors decides to put it in the system or even how Peter starts discovering his powers(Seriously in a train doing all that stupid stuff). How immature was that? More focus is on the high end animation and graphics which was truly amazing.Good break for Emma Stone as she was refreshingly good in the movie. Andrew Garfield looked lost all over the movie. Also I am still wondering in one scene why those lizards started going in the direction of Dr Connors experimental location."
"attraction-0910","10","2","7","1 July 2012"," Amazing is not enough to describe this mind blowing movie.
","Actually this movie is much better than the previous ones (but i must admit spider-man 2 by Sam raimi is good). This time spidey is much agile and faster. It has everything..perfect swing effects and the depiction is really awesome. Parker and Gwen share a very good chemistry. It takes us to a new level of emotions, thrill, action..everything. Spidey's sense of humour is very good just like the comic one. Character Dr. Conners played by Rhy Ifans is quite ironic. He is a good man who made a wrong decision and attacks Peter many times. But, all goes well in the end. The swing and webbing shown at the end is awesome and we can hope for a sequel. I hope that you guys will like the movie very much. Guys go for it, its really awesome. I appreciate the work of Mark Webb. Its best to Watch it in 3d for amazing swing and action effects. And yes Andrew Garfield did a superb fab job."
"akash-karekar","7","2","7","1 July 2012"," A must watch
","When Columbia Pictures and Marvel Studios announced in 2010 that they were rebooting the Spiderman series with a new cast and crew, critics as well as the fans were skeptical whether a revamp to the commercially successful trilogy would actually work. But as it turns out 'The Amazing Spider-man' has had the highest opening for a Hollywood film in India, even surpassing the other Marvel Studios movie, 'The Avengers'.<br/><br/>So does the version of the Spiderman by Mark Webb match that of the director of the previous 3 movies by Sam Raimi? Yes it does, in fact better in certain cases.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield astonishes us by a refreshingly original approach to the character of The Spider-man. For starters, he doesn't play the shy, nerdish guy which was played by Tobey Maguire. It was Garfield's childhood dream to play the Spider-man, and it clearly shows in the movie where he effortlessly shows us a more intriguing, interesting version of the superhero. <br/><br/>Emma Stone plays Gwen Stacy, the love interest of Peter Parker and not Mary Jane, unlike in the previous movies. She does a decent job, and the love affair between them is more appealing and less annoying, which was the case between Maguire and Dunst. There is a very sizzling chemistry between Emma and Garfield, the real life couple look great together on-screen as well. The first half of the story is almost the same as the original Spider- man of 2002, with more emphasis being given on the story of how Peter got separated from his parents. Peter learns Oscorp Labs hired his dad's former associate, Dr. Curt Connors, whom Peter hopes has knowledge about his parents. But Connors (Rhys Ifans) is doing strange things with science, developing a reptile serum to regrow his missing arm, and one of his steroidal spiders bites Peter. Connors later turn into a giant lizard with voice and mind of a man. But however, he is not a terrifying villain as in case of the earlier movies. Also there are not many mind -numbing fight sequences in the movie, however the excellent graphics and CGI make up for it. Irrfan Khan is a let down, who speaks with a strange accent in the 2-3 minutes of his screen time.<br/><br/>There are many funny scenes in the movie, like the one in which he falls on his knees and begs mercy from the thief, or the one in which he is lying upside down on the wall of his bedroom. The movie is a slight let down on the emotional front, as Raimi does a better job at handling the subject. All in all, the movie is definitely worth a watch. For all those who would rather download the movie on torrent and watch it, I would definitely suggest to have the theatrical experience of the movie. For all Marvel Comics fans, don't miss the cameo of Stan Lee, where he plays a librarian oblivious to the fight between Spider-Man and the Lizard happening behind him. And of course, typical of all Marvel movies, there is an after-credits scene, promising a sequel to the movie."
"phaneendrakumar","6","2","7","29 June 2012"," Decent enough...
","I had a chance to watch The Amazing Spider-Man today. It is a decent movie by all means, but I couldn't understand the decision by the studio to reboot the near perfect series about the same super hero.<br/><br/>Since, this is a review of the present film, I will stick to this movie and try not to compare this with the older one starring Tobey Maguire as Spider Man.<br/><br/>The movie depicts Spider-man as more human than a superhero. Peter Parker is just another kid, who's parents are missing since the time he remembers. He treats his guardians like dirt making the character believable. The scene where he starts playing the ""Bounce"" game on his mobile while waiting for the villain to appear is epic. Marc Webb, as the director hit goldmine with respect to the character building.<br/><br/>The villain is not believable though.<br/><br/>The visuals are very good. Again, Marc's insistence on not using the CGI for aerial shots of the Spider-Man in favor of using stunt men physically swinging worked wonders. The whole effort put in shows on the screen. 3D adds more depth to the visuals.<br/><br/>The final showdown between the Spider-Man and Lizard, however is the downside of the film. The whole story is predictable and after all this, at least the climax had to be extra-ordinary.<br/><br/>Over all, the movie is a decent fare, if seen in the 3D format. And watching Martin Sheen on screen was a treat."

","I wasn't expecting much from this movie based on the previous three Spider-man movies. I had been hoping for a reboot of the franchise ever since I had seen the first Spider-Man movie 10 years earlier.<br/><br/>This movie gives us a Spider-Man that's much more true to the original comics. I wasn't at all surprised when Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man wasn't considered for inclusion in The Avengers. The previous three movies did nothing to boost his career, but I can expect to see a lot more from Andrew Garfield in the coming years and I would love to see him in the sequel to The Avengers. Emma Stone also manages to outshine Kirsten 'Dunce' as the love interest, but in all fairness, that's not terribly difficult for such a sub-par actress like Kirsten.<br/><br/>Even if this story had been done before, it certainly hadn't been given the respectful treatment that it had in this film. The 3D is this movie could hardly have been done any better. The common denominator in all the bad reviews, besides the fact that they were apparently written by 12 year-olds (seriously, read some of them) is that people simply didn't like the villain, therefore they complain about the CGI to try to give themselves credibility.<br/><br/>This is on track to be the movie of the year and not The Avengers."

","I don't know if a cast of big-name actors can save the very odd re-adaptation of the classic tale 'Great Gatsby' starring Tobey Maguire, and I don't know if the beloved big-budget 'Bourne' franchise can be successfully resurrected without its lead man Matt Damon or mastermind Paul Greengrass, but I do know that 'The Amazing Spider-Man' is perfectly able to achieve greatness in either respect.<br/><br/>It's almost a freedom exclusive to superhero movies, that one superhero can be played by multiple actors over time, and the franchise's popularity never slumps. Fans are in love with the comic-book character first, and the actor who plays him second. Tobey Maguire's reign as Spider-Man ended 5 years ago, as did the story as we knew it, so this latest entry would best be regarded as the beginning of an entirely separate franchise. It's a do-over, a fresh start, a lapse back to the origins of Spider-Man and how Peter Parker came to be, and Andrew Garfield does great work filling the role. Calling the shots this time around is one-time film director Marc Webb, whose feature length debut, 2009's '(500) Days of Summer' may not have prepared him for blockbuster-sized action films, but made him generally well-versed in shaping characters and spinning a love story (which carries almost as much importance as the action in a movie like Spider-Man).<br/><br/>While this revisited chapter of the web-slinging hero touches on a lot of the same obvious plot points – a geeky teen with an elusive past constantly bullied in school, looks to take vengeance on the untimely death of his uncle, and with a chip on his shoulder and a spider bite on his neck, gains superhuman powers, bestowing upon him the charge of protecting New York City – this Spidey story delves deeper into Peter Parker's past and does a better job at explaining why things are as they are. With a new leading man, a new love interest, a new villain, and a more telling back-story, it is difficult to see it as anything but different.<br/><br/>Rhys Ifans (playing Dr. Curt Connors, a mad scientist turned angry mutant lizard) described this film as a more realistic (barring his character's transformation) and less fantastical depiction of the story than the other Spidey films were, and there are many examples supporting that claim. For one instance, while the spider bite gives Peter Parker superhuman strength and amazing athleticism, his web-spinning ability is the result of a special device that he invented. In the Raimi films, firing strings of webbing from his wrists is just something that Parker was suddenly able to do, without a thought or rationalization given to where it came from or how it was possible. That is not to say that it was a bad thing or that this new film is any more plausible. It was just one of the things that Webb decided was important to clear up, making his film adaptation slightly more unique.<br/><br/>I do prefer Webb's vision, though some scenes were still utterly cringing and corny; particularly those involving the school bully aptly named ""Flash."" That said, I can't help but think that these scenes were done intentionally for comedic purposes, filling the void in J.K. Simmons' absence; in which case these were necessary and effective. A hilarious and crowd-pleasing cameo by Stan Lee tops off the fun, comedic side to the story. Still, nothing in this film was nearly as peculiar or horrifyingly corny as Maguire's evil alter-ego's slick dance routine in Raimi's Spider-Man 3. That was just weird, and frankly a little embarrassing.<br/><br/>The remarkably talented A-list supporting cast (including Martin Sheen and Sally Field) to rising stars Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone gives this remake an original feel in itself. The casting, in both leading and supporting roles, was spot-on. While Garfield's youthful facial features and far leaner build may not necessarily make him the obvious choice to play the part of Spider-Man, after seeing him in action he was undoubtedly the RIGHT choice. He's natural in the part, and plays the character more loosely and freely than in the previous 3 films, which makes him come across as a more likable superhero.<br/><br/>Playing opposite Garfield is the beautiful and blonde Emma Stone, playing Peter Parker's rock and support system, Gwen Stacy. Stone's character is a refreshing portrayal of a strong female lead, level-headed, sturdy and able to stand on her own two feet. She can take care of herself, and does not need a man, or a hero, to whisk her away. The character strays far from Kirsten Dunst's Mary-Jane, a clumsier, emotionally conflicted and clichéd damsel in distress. Garfield and Stone are expectedly well-matched, becoming far more evident when their intimacy and strong on-screen chemistry had carried beyond their movie scenes and into real life, which speaks to what Ifans was saying about the authenticity of the film.<br/><br/>'The Amazing Spider-Man' is a great reboot for the franchise, and it is most definitely worth the cost of a ticket, even in 3-D. The film is showing 'Amazing' success at the box office, and rightfully so. A new face and a new visionary was what the studio needed to freshen up the franchise, and liven up the big-screen."
"MadameGeorge","8","3","14","4 July 2012"," A Delightful Web
","I was slightly hesitant to watch the Amazing Spiderman, having grown up with the idea that Tobey Maguire was the boy wonder. I was happily surprised, however, that I spent the money and time with a Spiderman for a new generation. Some argue that not enough time has passed between the Amazing Spiderman and Spiderman 3 (which I thought was awful), but I beg to differ. At the rate at which information travels, how social networking shapes the daily lives of all around the world, and when CGI changes the way we watch film, a Spiderman for 2012 is a welcomed addition to Marvel.<br/><br/>While the story is similar to that of Spiderman 1- the story is based upon the comic book tale of Peter Parker for crying out-loud and so will be the same- I found that what made the Amazing Spiderman amazing was the fresh, tender face of Andrew Garfield. It may seem strange to think of Spiderman as tender, but above anything else this movie offers- action, love, revenge, responsibility- it offers a reality check for all those out there who think that being a superhuman offers the best of both worlds. Garfield makes Spiderman more than a mask, more than a super-human who fights for what is right. Garfield as Spiderman struggles to find his way and demonstrates that it is not always easy to find the right path and stay on it. Life, ultimately will get in the way of whatever and whoever you decide to be and how the Amazing Spiderman deals with living a life of secrets and power, is what makes this film soar.<br/><br/>There are a few cheese-filled scenes that slowed the film down, but overall they did not alter the theme of the movie. Emma Stone was brilliant, as always and casting her alongside Garfield was simply one of the best matches I have seen in a long time. Rhys Ifans was a likable villain, which is something that must happen in superhero films these days. No longer is being bad 'just because' a characterization, the villain (whether Voldemort or even the Joker from the Dark Knight) has to have justification for being evil because just as being good is defined by choices, so is being bad.<br/><br/>Ifans seeks to be change who he is and uses science as the way to reach his goal. His experiment backfires and he is left changed in more ways than one and the last half of the film focuses on the results of mixing unknown science with human desire. <br/><br/>Throughout the Amazing Spiderman is this idea that wanting something and changing who you are do not always yield greatness. Peter Paker struggles with his new identity and powers, just as Dr.Curt Conners must accept his fate. The interaction between the two characters is, in the beginning genuine and so it makes the fallout from their alter-egos all the more interesting. The struggle of whether or not being different is a blessing or a curse is flushed out, as well as the loneliness that often follows the cost of greatness. <br/><br/>The CGI and music are acceptable, a misplaced Coldplay song through me off a little, but I like any movie that plays the Shins. The action scenes with the instrumentals was lacking, loud piano cords do not a scene suspenseful. <br/><br/>If the future of superhero films is telling the tale of why superheros are not so different from the rest of us, the future of superheros is bright indeed."
"Thomasamills","9","3","14","4 July 2012"," Marvel takes on 'Batman Begins'
","t really is the ultimate superhero summer. 'The Avengers' blew audiences away back in May and 'The Dark Knight Rises' is just around the corner. For now though we have the re telling of one of the most popular superheroes in the comic book and film universe, Spider-Man. <br/><br/>After the 'Batman' films collapsed with Joel Schumacher's 'Batman and Robin', it took around 10 years for Christopher Nolan the rise the caped crusader from the ashes and give us two of the greatest superhero films Hollywood has seen. Whilst many critics are comparing this new Spider- Man film with the Sam Raimi film's, I do think that 'Batman Begins' is a more relevant comparison. The bad news is that 'The Amazing Spider-Man' isn't as good as 'Batman Begins', but is still a lot of fun.<br/><br/>It was just over 10 years ago when Sam Raimi directed 'Spider-Man' and Toby Maguire was wearing the tights. Whilst I really enjoyed the first two 'Spider-Man films, I hated 'Spider-Man 3'. Watching Peter Parker walk down the street in slow motion to cheesy music whilst flicking his long fringe was the moment when the franchise fell apart. It was reported that 'Spider-Man 4' was going to be made, but the script fell through, and to be honest I don't know how they could have followed the train wreck that was 'Spider-Man' 3. So now we have the reboot to the franchise which is meant to be Marvel's 'Batman Begins'.<br/><br/>We all know the story, Peter Parker (played by English actor and star of David Fincher's 'The Social Network', Andrew Garfield) who is the loner of his high school and viewed as the geek by his class mates. When he is bitten by a radio active spider, he gains unique powers and becomes Spider-Man. The film sticks to the original comic book material and we encounter Parker's first love interest, Gwen Stacy, (played by Garfield's real life girlfriend Emma Stone) and Spider-Man's first villain, The Lizard (played by Rhys Ifans).<br/><br/>The film does two things very different to it's predecessors, it has much darker and has more fun with the characters. When Toby Maguire was Parker, we knew he was smart because he wore glasses. With Garfield, Director Marc Webb ((500) Day's of Summer) actually shows us Parker playing with his experiments and bringing that quirky personalty of the comic book character through to moments when Parker is wearing the mask. Where as the previous Spider-Man was serious when he was fighting crooks and thief's, this new Spider-Man seems to have more fun with his powers and the audience enjoy watching him joke around with the bad guys. The look and tone of the film is darker and I felt very strong connections with the characters. In particular Parker's relationship with his Aunt May and Uncle Ban (Sally Field and Martin Sheen).<br/><br/>Marc Webb has also solved a problem to a lot superhero films today. When we watch 'Iron Man' we see Robert Downy Jr as Tony Stark and a special effect flying through the air when he is Iron Man. Webb understands that the audience have to go along with the belief that we are watching the same character in the suite who is also out the suite. Webb's solution is removing the mask. Many of the film's biggest set pieces involve Garfield in the suite without the mask. Personally, I thought this worked wonderfully and my connection with the character wasn't lost during times when Spider-Man is struggling or is in pain.<br/><br/>All the characters all well written, although I thought that the story behind The Lizard could have had a bit more time spent on as it was as interesting as Spider-Man's story.One other problem is the build up to the film's release. The amount of posters and trailers that told me as I was going to find out Spider-Man's biggest secret. I still left the cinema wanting to know this secret, however a clip after the credits could lead on to the squeal where I'm sure more will be revealed. The 3D is at it's best when our hero is swinging through the buildings of New York. Apart from that, there is really no reason for the film to be in 3D.<br/><br/>'The Amazing Spider-Man' is a solid reboot for the franchise and whilst it never swings to the heights of my initial reactions to 'Batman Begins', it's still a one of the most enjoyable entries into the superhero film genre. Amazing by name and amazing by nature. You do not want to miss this!"
"kaspergordon","1","8","57","23 October 2012"," Soulless
","I'm more or less disgusted by the fact that this piece of incoherent plot-hole-riddled and bad acted soulless piece of dumb 3d eye candy for the masses can get a 7.5. The movie has no atmosphere or moods, no character-development, no pay-offs, and some of the most random pacing I've ever seen. It just seems like it's a greedy attempt to keep cashing in on the Spider-Man franchise and nothing more. Even tough the Sam Raimi trilogy had it's flaws, were a bit cheesy and the third movie had a bunch of awkward scenes to say the least, these movies at least had heart, personalty, pacing and steady direction - a comparison with them to this piece of saddening emptiness would feel like the Godfather trilogy compared to Colors. And with a budget with over 225 million dollars the effects where only mediocre - I've seen movies with under half the budget with way more impressive CGI and action sequences.<br/><br/>And what was up with the emo/punker/skater spiked-haired and butt-hurt-faced Peter Parker? In the comics he starts out as a quiet nerd and an outsider (which Sam Raimi at least kept faithful to), instead they suddenly change him into this smart-ass teenage hipster rebel with about as much of an interesting personalty as a glass of air. In the original his nerdy and shy nature also made his crush on Mary Jane seem a lot more human and made you care and cheer for him, since she was way more unattainable for him, since she didn't knew about is secrets - in this movie he gets with her before the second act and reveals his secret to her before the third - in the original trilogy this theme kept on going to the end of the second movie.<br/><br/>But what bothers me the most is just how stupid it is. Like Spider-Man cap keep on fighting a huge lizard-man with the strength of an elephant, even though he slams him into everything and throws him trough several bookcases and walls (which under normal circumstances would destroy the person before the wall - or at least both), but this hardly makes Spider-Man break sweat or loose stamina, and after-wards he rushes into town and swings acrobatically around and fights cops like he barely got a scratch from his recent encounter with the evil reptile-man, but as soon he is just strafed with a bullet on his leg, he is hardly even able to move, swing or run, like the bullet was made made of Anti-Spider-Man metal, while the sinister crocodile-mans punishment was mere sparring. But of course Spider-Man gets all of his strength and powers back as soon he just sprays his wound with a bit of his old web. And I'm not even going to go into the the little kids dad and his crane-driving buddies and how they managed to coordinate all the constructor-cranes in the town in like 3 minutes to show Spider-Man they loved him. The movie is just full of in-logical and cheesy stuff like this, which just is insulting to anyone who thinks while they're watching a film.<br/><br/>To me this movie is as insulting like something like The Phantom Menace or Transformers 3.."
"thefranchise418","9","2","8","7 July 2012"," 'The Amazing Spider-Man' (My Mini Review)
","I just finished watching, 'The Amazing Spider-Man'. I was going to write a long review, but I changed my mind. I'll just say I watched it on IMAX & 3D and it was an enjoyable experience. Watching Spider-Man swing around and climb walls was bad ass. The problem I have with 3D glasses though, is I've always felt it looks a bit to dark for my taste. That said, if you are a fan of 3D movies I highly recommend watching it this way. As far as the film itself, it was a great reboot. I won't sit here and tell you that it was better then Tobey Maguire's version because the original was magical. I mean, who could forget Chad Krueger's ""Hero"" music video and everything else that came from that movie? ""With great power comes great responsibility"". Come on! It doesn't get any better then that. I could watch that movie 100 times and still love it. However, I have to give credit to some improvements that the reboot did. I like Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy. Emma doesn't annoy me like Kristen Dunst. She has chemistry with Andrew Garfield who plays the new Spider-Man. When she smiles, she makes me smile and I like that. In fact I'm at the movies thinking, ""I want her as my girlfriend"". I also think that Peter Parker wasn't as nerdy this time around, so he was more believable. Again, I'm not going to write a 20 page review. I will just say that I enjoyed it. If the original was a 10 then this would be like a 9 and that's not taking anything away from it because I DID love it and I'll see it again. I think this version has a bit more back story, but not to much. The debate of which Spider-Man is better will be talked about, but in the end it all comes down to the creators. Both Spidey's were portrayed different and each actor did great in his role. It's like people that continue to debate which is the better Joker. Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger. BOTH were awesome! It just comes down to how you like your character to be portrayed. One is more light-hearted and one is all dark and serious. The Lizard was a cool villain. The action scenes kicked ass. Its f*cking Spider-Man. How can it not be cool? I love Spider-Man. I grew up watching all the cartoons and even the 70's TV show that had cool pimp music as the opening theme song. Again, I could say so much more, just go watch it and enjoy it and stay for one extra scene during the credits. That is all."
"elliot-413-161742","8","2","8","4 July 2012"," The new era of the spider man
","I have been a spider man fan for over 30 years now, and one of my very first memories was watching the spider man TV series from the late 70's with Nicholas Hammond, which i still love till today, so i was obviously overjoyed when the Sam raimi film came out in 2002, which i thought was fantastic, then spideman 2 came, which unusually was much, much better than the first film, the the 3rd which was OK, but not a patch on the others, i thought that Tobey Maguire was good in the role, but looking back the whole tone of the first 3 films felt a little bit detached from reality like some sort of surreal world, where the colours, dialogue and interaction between characters seemed unreal,<br/><br/>So, when i heard about the amazing spider man coming out as a reboot i was skeptical like a lot of people, although i was never negative towards the film because it was like, spider man! So i have watched the film for the first time just yesterday and i can say i thought it was excellent, in some areas vastly superior to the other 3 films<br/><br/>I do agree with some other reviewers in that some of the important scenes are rushed ie: uncle Ben's death and the making of the suit, and i must admit i didn't like the cgi lizard at all, my personal opinion is that filmmakers should use more make up techniques in creating special effects, and use the cgi as an enhancement but not go to crazy with it,<br/><br/>I thought that Andrew Garfield was perfect as peter parker/spider man, and although he is 28 he easily passes for 18ish, the other actors/actresses were excellent in their roles too, yes there was a lot of the love story element in this film, but i expected that<br/><br/>The one aspect of this film where i thought i surpassed the other films was spider mans powers and the action/swinging scenes, <br/><br/>In spider man (2002) he just seems to shoot his web anywhere, attach to something and fly away with absolute ease, and i always disliked that, a lot of the action in the first 3 films seemed very ""inhuman"" <br/><br/>in my mind spider mans powers where that he could climb/stick to walls/surfaces and had incredible agility/jumping ability,speed and a sixth sense (spider sense) and he did have the web shooters in the origin so i am glad they stayed true to that, <br/><br/>But after all these powers had developed, it is easy to forget that spider man is still a human being, he can be cut, shot, hurt or killed like anyone else, and that is what i liked about this film, as after a night out on the town as spider man it would show him injured, exhausted and battered, which again, even though he has all these powers he is still human and gets hurt and tired<br/><br/>The swinging scenes i thought were the best part, the swinging is made to look very, very hard, which it would be I'm sure in reality, even with spider mans vastly increased agility and speed, i liked the way he sometime misses with the web, and crashes into buildings etc and has to climb and drag himself up the side of a building to get another good vantage point to swing off again,<br/><br/>one of the best scenes for me was when spider man got shot by a cop in trying to get to the oscorp building, this obviously almost disabling him as it naturally would, crashing into a building, just about managing to climb to the top, sealing his would with his webbing, and then deperately trying to run while limping to get enough speed to web off the edge of the building to save the city, again to me this seemed more ""real"", remember he is spider man and not superman!<br/><br/>So in summary i thought that spideys powers seemed more ""realistic"" that the other films, yes there were parts of the film that could have been done a lot better with a 200 million budget, there were some continuity issues, and as i said before i didn't like the cgi lizard at all, Andrew Garfield is the best spider man by a mile, although i did like Tobey also, some important scenes were rushed and some not so important scenes were dragged out, all of that aside it was an excellent re-boot"
"aki-dhar26-780-912938","7","2","8","3 July 2012"," At least they told us where the webs come from.
","Went to watch this movie with mild expectations, and to tell you honestly, it didn't disappoint me. I didn't go there hoping another Dark Knight to happen, and make me drown in its enigma for a month. The Amazing Spider Man seemed a more matured film, than its predecessors first part was. Many little things, were given a proper finish. Watchin the first movie I always wondered,where the hell he kept all this web in his body? Why from the first day itself Peter has suck control over all his moves and web swinging? And most importantly, why Peter never leaves his idealistic super heroism. All these loop holes seemed to be filled here. Getting to the plot. Its more about how Peter becomes a super hero from a spider bitten super powerful teenager. All other subplots support the movie rather well. Here are some PROS:<br/><br/>1. Movie focused on Peter's Past(Although his parent's death was still kept misty, probably for the successor film)<br/><br/>2. The characters, I mean all of them right from Peter( Andrew Garfield), Gwen(Emma Stone), Aunt May(Sally Field), Uncle Ben(Martin Sheen) to the school bully Flash(Chris Zylka) were much more real and more logical, and not some characters from the ideal world, where good and evil are perfectly good and evil. <br/><br/>3. Peter's conversion into a super hero comes from self realization and with lots of practice.<br/><br/>4. Many small scenes, like Spider man giving his mask to a child he's rescuing from a burning car, to give him some confidence, Spider man making a web inside the sewer lines to find the whereabouts of the villain Rhys Ifans(The Lizard / Dr. Curt Connors ), much like a real spider does were much logical and matured.<br/><br/>5. The fights were much more true to the natural physics.<br/><br/>6. Last but not he least, they replaced Kirsten Dunst with Emma Stone. <br/><br/>CONS:<br/><br/>1. How will you react if someone just wakes up from a sleep, jumps to the ceiling and just sticks there. That reaction doesn't come from anyone who sees this in the movie. This legacy has followed here form the previous series.<br/><br/>2. Director ignore many logical and points of common sense. There are many. Like the intern student being thrown out from the building who's ID peter had stole. I mean who does that without proper inquiry. Peter throws a football that hits the steel goal post, which just bend. Mr.Director, forgets that no matter how powerfully the ball hits a steel pole, the pole can't be bend, on the contrary the ball could have burst. <br/><br/>3. The Lizard, when converts to Dr.Connors at the very end, seems to be converted to a good person, when it was clearly shown in the middle of the movie that Dr.Connar's himself decides to do all that stuff, not the Lizard. Self consciousness comes, but how come that fast?<br/><br/>Considering the CONS were far more less dominant, it becomes a nice adventure ride, who's sequel will I be waiting for. Definite one time watch on a big screen, specially in 3D.<br/><br/>ENJOY..!!!"

","With the recent revisions of Marvel Superheroes by Marvel Studios, I've been happily entertained. I loved Captain America, Thor, Iron Man 1 & 2 (haven't seen 3, yet), and especially Avengers. X-Men First Class was pretty good, but not great. The Amazing Spider-Man was certainly lacking in pretty much everything, save for CGI/special effects.<br/><br/>Yes, the CGI/special effects were awesome... I would argue that they improved these effects from Spider-Man (2002). However... that did little to save it from being a horribly disappointing movie.<br/><br/>When I watched this, I was expecting something of excellence, like the previous movies I mentioned. Something true to the origin, something that would get fan approval, and something with character development and an exceptional story. This is, after all, Marvel's bread-and-butter - besides X-Men/Wolverine, of course.<br/><br/>So... I waited with baited breath and continued to wait... and continued to be disappointed. Lo' and behold - there was no character development. The characters weren't even believable... Peter Parker the nerdy, accomplished skateboarder? Really? Peter Parker the woman's man? Sneaking up to his girlfriend's bedroom via the fire-escape? Really? Peter Parker? I'm sorry, but no.<br/><br/>The plot/storyline was shallow and paled in comparison to Spider-Man (2002). I watched Spider-Man (2002) just the other night, and again, I was blown away... just as I was when it first arrived on the Silver Screen. I was so blown away back then that I saw it five different times in the theater. Even the music was paltry. In 2002, you were enticed with a Danny Elfman theme that just blew you away and prepared you for ensuing awesomeness. What did you have for this one? James Horner not even trying.<br/><br/>I'm greatly disappointed by this mess. Tobey McGuire? Believable. Andrew Garfield? Not so much. The same could be said for each actor via a side- by-side comparison for both movies. A sadly and horribly disappointing new direction for Spider-Man.

"StevePulaski","7","3","15","4 July 2012"," Webb's webs are artificial, yet are they more real?
","The looming question many people should have when entering The Amazing Spider-Man is was it justified to reboot a series that's original film turns ten this very year? Entering the film and hearing about it throughout the course of the past two years, I thought the idea was undeniably foolish. A reboot's purpose, in my eyes, is to introduce a character audiences have likely forgotten about, or have not been properly acquainted with. The recent Captain America film was justified by two reasons; the upcoming Avengers film and the fact that audiences are likely not wholly familiar with his story.<br/><br/>Today, even after seeing The Amazing Spider-Man, I believe the idea of starting a whole new series is a foolish idea with only money in mind. I fear that this review will quickly turn into a list, as I am planning to compare/contrast this with Raimi's original Spider-Man film, a rarely credited, well done superhero film.<br/><br/>As far the story goes, the idea hasn't changed too much, but the Green Goblin has been traded for ""The Lizard"" and the love interest is no longer Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane but Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy. The origin-story of Peter Parker hasn't changed much either. After going to a genetics laboratory, sneaking in for that matter, he is bitten on the neck by a spider and starts to encounter strange symptoms, beginning with catlike reflexes and, finally, with sticky hands and the ability to leap and jump higher than imaginable.<br/><br/>After Parker's uncle is shot and killed (played by Martin Sheen in a very convincing role), he decides to use his powers for defending New York City from crime and scum. On the side, he frequently visits Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans), an Oscorp scientist who worked with Parker's dad for numerous years. Connors has ambition to create a regeneration serum to give him his right arm back, but when something goes horribly wrong, he becomes ""The Lizard,"" an evil, menacing creature, who serves as the story's main villain.<br/><br/>Parker, played by Andrew Garfield, is still his geeky self, but it has been reduced quite a bit from Raimi's effort. The original Spider-Man had Peter Parker tripping on his own shoelaces. Here, Garfield makes the character noticeably an outcast, but doesn't hammer in the idea that the character is rather soft. When it comes down to Tobey Maguire or Andrew Garfield, while both actors never cease to impress me with their choice of roles or on-screen presence, I was still more sold on Maguire, who had the role down to a tune. Garfield is a very talented actor, and I think he has many things here to rebound off of, such as Emma Stone's memorable charisma and personality, yet I feel he provides almost too much confidence to a character who is supposed to be rather unassuming. The comic book character was easily identifiable if you were an outcast, but Garfield gives his role to much of a hybrid-appearance.<br/><br/>As far as confidence goes, the film has quite a lot of it. It is stylishly put together, memorably crafted, and very, very dark. The original film incorporated many primary colors and flashy action sequences to remind us of the panels of a comic book. Director Mark Webb makes this an inevitably more stylistic piece, by adding more darkness to the picture and to the story of Parker himself. He projects the character's struggle and agony in a believable way, and this was something Raimi's installment neglected. Some scenes of battle and peril go on for too long here, but one scene, on a bridge during one of the first main Lizard fight scenes, is incredibly moving and touching.<br/><br/>There are times when Webb's direction and the screenplay, written by James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent, and Steve Kloves, is pleasantly patient, yet there are times when it's rushed and impatient. Part of the problem is there is so much to handle when making a ""Spider-Man"" film. Even Raimi's original had some trouble with pacing. The problem is you're trying to breathlessly juggle an immense amount of truly meaningful characters, subplots, and instances that some of them go a tad underdeveloped. Take for example the love story between Peter and Gwen, a welcomed addition to the story. Although the romance is sweet and good-natured, the love story involving Peter and Mary Jane played much better, mainly because of the sincere and open discussions they had along the way. There is so much going on with this film that the love story seems rather traditional at times. Not to mention, it is noticeable that the story of Dr. Connors was somewhat undermined to incorporate more scenes of action and romance.<br/><br/>I stand by my views when it comes to The Amazing Spider-Man's purpose of existence, which is slim and rather unnecessary. The story is all too familiar, and will be for the next few decades seeing as we now have two franchises, one in its early stages, about the same character with relatively the same line of events. Raimi's film was the first feature film about the character, and after twenty-five years in development hell, it was refreshing and welcoming to be shown a hero of such depth and charm. While I say this, I can recognize that the film is aesthetically pleasing, visually enjoyable, and acted with gratitude and satisfaction. I too admire Marc Webb's direction, which in just a matter of three years went from sentimental indie romance to lightning fast blockbuster.<br/><br/>Starring: Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Rhys Ifans, Denis Leary, Campbell Scott, Irrfan Khan, Martin Sheen, Sally Field, and Chris Zylka. Directed by: Marc Webb."

His parents inexplicably abandon him at his aunt and uncles one night when he's a child, and the mystery of their disappearance still haunts him. He's a bit of a social outcast at school, and he is picked on pretty mercilessly as a result. He's also got a crush on Gwen Stacy, but never has the guts to say anything to her about it. But a trip to the Oscorp building while searching for answers to his parent's disappearance is about to change Peter's life forever.<br/><br/>While this is both a remake and a reboot for the franchise, rest assured that the cast and direction breathe new life into this familiar story. Marc Webb's direction is skillful and patient, and never rushes through the quiet moments that really inform who these people are. The result is a cast of characters that are very real and act on real emotions. As much as these movies are about the spectacle, they also have to exist within the boundaries of a human story. This is what gives superhero stories resonance and meaning, and Webb makes his time count.<br/><br/>When Webb isn't actually telling a story within a superhero movie, he's setting up some impressive action sequences. One where Spiderman is rescuing a boy from a car that has fallen off a bridge is particularly breathtaking. The POV moments while swinging through the city are pretty cool, albeit a little unnecessary. Webb also uses the hero's abilities in some new and intriguing ways that I won't spoil.<br/><br/>I was excited from day one to hear that Andrew Garfield was chosen to play Peter/Spiderman, and he never once disappoints here. He's appropriately vulnerable and sarcastic without the mask, and overly confident when shrouded in his anonymity. Emma Stone also does an excellent job as his love interest, Gwen. Their chemistry is palpable, and their moments on screen are very natural. Rhys Ifans as Dr. Connors/The Lizard does a decent enough job as the villain. The character is written well, and he makes a more than adequate first test for Spiderman. It's easy to empathize with his mad scientist ways given his predicament, at least before he goes insane with power that is. Rounding out the cast are Denis Leary as Captain Stacy, who happens to be Gwen's father, and Sally Field and Martin Sheen are charming as always as Aunt May and Uncle Ben.<br/><br/>Given the original series is only about 10 years old, it seemed like an odd idea at first that Columbia Pictures would seek to reboot their franchise. From what I understand it had to do with the studio maintaining the character rights from being bought out, but the story changes depending on what you read. And despite the fair number of hiccups in part 3, Raimi's trilogy is still a great addition to the superhero movie lexicon. The Amazing Spiderman doesn't have as many problems as part 3, but what's there is pretty noticeable because of how good the rest of the movie is. The design of the lizard leaves something to be desired, the promises of the ""untold story"" of Spiderman being told in the trailers is largely a lie, and the movie itself features some pretty glaring plot holes. <br/><br/>But by the end of the movie I didn't really care. Garfield and Stone's performances are miles above those of Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst, and I was completely invested in their romance rather than laughing at it. The action is thrilling and emotionally driven without being contrived, and the visuals are top notch. The Amazing Spiderman is above average summer fare, and sets up some fun territory to be explored in the sequels to come.<br/><br/>Follow me on Twitter @Mrhuffsmyfather http://about.me/cory.huff3897"
"woralo","8","3","15","30 June 2012"," The big differences and what's that about topic
","I've been a fan of the spider man series since I was a kid, and I know most of what happens, though some things are different in the movies than they are in the movies.<br/><br/>/** Things I think are different First of I believe in the television series spidey goes into a free fighting competition and there he encounters his uncles killer, correct me if I'm wrong. Also his uncle doesn't get killed right away after Peter doesn't do the right thing; putting him away for his crimes. Nevertheless the out coming is the same, his uncle dies because he didn't do the right thing as the words are said in several episodes in the comic series. <br/><br/>What I also missed big time in the movie is the one and utmost important quote from uncle Ben. This is the one thing every spider man fan will have imprinted into his mind and it's ""With great power, comes great responsibility"" either I missed this or it wasn't in the movie, which should have been, because thought it was obvious this was meant by the words spoken, it wasn't literally there as I can recall? There were the quotes from his uncle which did inspire him, but not that one. <br/><br/>Also his aunt seemed pretty young, but this could be due to the fact that this movie was also based on the beginning of the time line, however in the television series Peter's aunt already seemed quite old from the beginning. <br/><br/>One other thing is Peter revealing his identity, I know in the series he reveals his identity to Gwen, that's known, but I don't know about her dad, and even if he did, it's pretty darn fast in just a couple of weeks. I believe in the series the only one knowing is Gwen, and his aunt not knowing for a fact but being pretty sure, whereas Mary Jane struggles between her relationship between spider man and Peter, because she doesn't know they are the same, but she loves both I think. Maybe a villain or two also know his identity but not sure there. <br/><br/>Also the lizard has a pretty common human looking face in the movies whereas in the series he has pretty much a lizard face and I don't know about his morphing abilities from human to lizard. <br/><br/>Another thing I couldn't place was the time setting. At first I thought it was based around the 90's because of Parkers camera, which seemed a little old school however in the rest of the movie new age science played a pretty big role, so I am still wonder what the intended time space in the movie was. <br/><br/>One more thing. In the movie at about the end of it we see flash wearing a spider man t-shirt, which I think wouldn't have happened in the series. I thought of flash as an anti spider man person, never to wear a pro spidey t-shirt.<br/><br/>*//<br/><br/>//* Review All in all I have to say I really enjoyed this spider man movie. I always thought the previous spider man movies to be a little weak and lack some sort of emotion. With this movie I really felt every single emotion there was. I really felt it when Ben died. It hit me, and the relationship between spidey and Gwen was so emotional, though I always felt more for Gwen than for Mary even in the series. His relation with Gwen is much more passionate. Mary Jane seems more like a subject to spidey whereas Gwen seems like a fiery lover with her own capabilities, and this was reflected very well in the movie.<br/><br/>Also the part where the crane operators moves their cranes to support spidey was really cool. We did miss out on the great spidey hating Jameson, but I guess that is something for the sequels. <br/><br/>Nevertheless I thought it was a great movie and surpassed the earlier spider man movies by miles. I liked Tobey, but this guy just did a better job even though the skateboarding part brought Peter totally out of character comparing to the series. <br/><br/>*//<br/><br/>Point of the post.<br/><br/>Eventually Gwen creates the antidote/serum to get the lizard man back to his original form, but what confuses me is the fact that I think this serum should have also canceled out sideman's powers, seeing that it turns a person back to his or her original form. So shouldn't spider man have lost his powers there aswel? <br/><br/>After the antiserum explosion spider man and lizard fall down to the side of the building and lizard helps spider man get back up to the building, this is where I thought that spidey indeed lost his powers, because he seemed to need lizards hands to climb back onto the building, because if he did have powers he would have just climbed back up himself right? But then at the end of the movie we still see he has his powers, so what's going on there? Did he re infuse his powers somehow, or didn't he lose his powers and was the antidote/serum just fixed on the lizard serum, but then again why couldn't he climb the building by himself? This is the most confusing part for me. <br/><br/>I work as a cinema operator and I see lots and lots of movies coming by every year, but just a few really grasp my attention and this was one of them. Kudos for this spider man movie. It was really great!"
"Eightiesjunkie","1","3","16","20 June 2015"," Same old song and dance
","Call me a Tobey Maguire/Sam Raimi fan-boy all you want, but at least Sam Raimi had a lot of love and respect for the character! Clearly no one had any when they were making these two God-awful movies! To begin with, I've been a fan of Spider-Man pretty much all my life, and to call THIS a Spider-Man movie is like calling a pile of dog vomit ""abstract art""! What I've come to realize, is that that these movies were just poorly put together so that Sony could hold onto to the rights to Spider-Man, and squeeze out whatever money that the character could make for them. I would usually start out a review with things I liked about the film, but that's the problem, there weren't any! I couldn't stand Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker/Spider-Man! To me, he came off as a giant douche, and not at all like the shy, awkward, but lovable character was in the comics! Martin Sheen and Sally Field were okay as Uncle Ben and Aunt May. The problem is however, that they're barely used! That's right, Uncle Ben and Aunt May, arguably the most important characters in the Spider-Man mythology, ARE JUST BACKGROUND CHARACTERS!! Not to mention, the phrase: ""With great power comes great responsibility."" is heard nowhere in the film. Emma Stone's ""Gwen Stacy"" has no depth to her character. She's just Peter's Girlfriend and eye candy. As for ""The Lizard"" he plans on turning everyone in New York into Lizards. Why? Just because. I'm not even gonna go into the plot, because aside from a few tweaks here and there, it's the exact same plot from Sam Raimi's first Spider-Man movie. I was hoping for so much more from this film, I'd hoped that by starting anew, that Sony would break new ground with Spider-Man. Unfortunately, all I got was the same old story with a new coat of paint slapped on it. This movie was a huge disappointment, but the biggest disappointment would be it's sequel. (Review coming soon!)"

","I went to see this in the theater and I can't remember feeling more disappointed or ripped off. They took spiderman from a likable hero and made him a selfish emo stalker who looked more like they type that would bring a gun to school and start shooting. Not one likable character to root for. The music sucked compared to Danny elfmans original score. garfield as spiderman is like putting a silk hat on a pig, I found myself rooting for lizard. The writers and directors must have come out of the ghetto? I will say this at least I didn't waste the money on seeing #2. I just hope these losers won't bring venom into part 3 and ruin him too.

","Obviously I haven't read the 966 reviews so far and I don't have to, but I will probably read the ones with the funniest title.<br/><br/>Anyway back to the movie....waita minute, what movie ? No I did not see the entire movie I switched it off right on the second boyfriend girlfriend scene, where Peter Parker is stuttering for 5 minutes in front of a blonde girl.<br/><br/>That's not a Spiderman movie. It's a DVD for kids. The reason why I switched it off and the reason why this review is incomplete. The stuttering babyman. <br/><br/>""Oh, Andy loved geology"" no wait...<br/><br/>I thought in my time I would get to see a good super hero movie. I was wrong so far. Dosens of Marvel movies, Batman/Superman movies....horrible horrible casting and directors. Also the past Spiderman movies were far better for my taste and patience.<br/><br/>The best thing I saw in this movie is Martin Sheen's father role. He is kinda old but he does deliver excellent straight up acting, free from any cgi and soundtrack back-up. You can hear this man talk and you know from his first words that you have to say ""yes sir"" at the end of his talk. It doesn't matter what he is saying to you. <br/><br/>Anyway to close this wonderful review for this kid's movie, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is over 25 years old, a serious comic book collector, an old fan or to any true spidey fans around the globe. I'm sure many hard work has gone into this movie by a lot o talented people, but this doesn't mean anything if every super hero movie is worst than the last one to most of the viewers.<br/><br/>Thank you for reading."

","A mushy script and an abomination of a story makes this the worst sequel of the last 25 years. Everything is wrong with this movie so there's no point in writing a list. Whoever read this screenplay and thought that this would appeal to anyone over nine years old should be banished from movie making for life. It's as if the producers had a meeting and took all the best parts of super hero movies... and burned them! There's a reason why Sally Field doesn't do movies and she shows off those reasons admirably in this filth. I'm a life long fan of Denis Leary but I'm watching his next professional move very closely. Is he going to perform a Steve Martin on his fans?"

","Spider-Man is funny again! And he's just a kid from New York. And he made his web-slingers. Its a good story. Its fun. As a comic book reader, I'm used to characters getting updated. I mean, if you want the original Hulk he'd be gray with bowl cut. This is a movie that captures the spirit of the character for a modern audience. Could there be more Green Goblin, HobGoblin, Hobgoblin 2, Vermin, Kraven, and eventually an opening for the return of Mary Jane? Some great stories are waiting. Will SpiderMan get to meet Dr. Strange? I hope so!<br/><br/>This movie has a Spider-Man that could get in a fight with DareDevil, poke fun at Iron Man, and save the Multi-verse with Dr. Strange. Unfortunately, thanks to multiple studios owning the rights and being unlikely to negotiate, they will never benefit from the ""soap opera"" cross over that makes comic books so good at selling more comic books."
"peprd6","10","3","16","4 July 2012"," Brilliant reboot.
","Just because its a reboot to a trilogy that just came 10 years ago doesn't mean its going to suck horribly. As a matter of fact, this film was better than the original. Unlike the original, many things in this film are true to the comics, such as Gwen Stacy being Spiderman's first girlfriend, Spiderman having webshooters to shoot web off his wrist, and taking throughout the high school setting. If you're new to this and know about Raimi's Spiderman trilogy, you will find huge differences that were made to be closer to the comics. You won't have Mary Jane as the first girlfriend or Spiderman shooting web organically. Now, onto the film, this film has perhaps some of the best performances in comic book movies. Andrew Garfield ate as both Peter Parker and Spiderman, and I thought he was better than Tobey Maguire. Emma Stone, Rhys Ifans and Denis Leary's acting were fantastic and brilliant. The chemistry between Gwen and Peter is so natural and cute, more than the chemistry between Peter and Mary Jane in the original Spiderman. As for the plot, its a better origin story. Although the villain was a bit weak, I felt the Lizard is more interesting than Raimi's Green Goblin. That's all I've got to say, I would recommend this film to you. I gave it 10 stars out of 10."
"ivo-cobra8","1","2","9","19 October 2015"," Finally an reboot origin story to Spider-Man which is better than the original!
","The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) A reboot of the original Sam Raimi Spider-Man movies that I think is miles better than the Original was. Here you get the real story. The Amazing Spider-Man was fantastic and delivered everything I hoped it would. I am sorry people but I love this film more than I love Spider-Man (2002) Sam Raimi's Original film. This is my second favorite best film of The Spidey franchise. I don't care what anyone says I think this is the original origin story than Sam Raimi's Original films. Sam Raimi's Spider-Man is like Tim Burton's Batman. Marc Web's The Amazing Spider-Man is like Christopher's Nolan Batman Begins (2005). There isn't any difference This film is pretty good is actually better than the original but not better than Spider-Man 2 (2004) is. <br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man"" tells the story of Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield), an outcast high schooler who was abandoned by his parents as a boy, leaving him to be raised by his Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field). When Peter finds a mysterious briefcase that belonged to his father, he begins a quest to understand his parents' disappearance, leading him directly to Oscorp and the lab of Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans), his father's former partner. As Spider-Man is set on a collision course with Connors' alter-ego, The Lizard, Peter will make life-altering decisions to use his powers and shape his destiny to become a hero.<br/><br/>I love the facts that Spider-Man did not killed anybody in this film. Like Peter saved that guy,falling off the roof. Peter was still in a high school, he was brilliant and a genius and not some emo nerd random dude like he was in Spider-Man. The origins of Gwen Stacy and Peter Parker a reviled. This film has more heart than Sam Raimi's film ever had. I love that Peter did not stalked Gwen like some obsessed person like Sam Raimi's Spider-Man did to Mary Jane. He saved that kid including all the cars falling from the bridge. The CGI was great it wasn't bad. The only problem with the film I have is that Peter confess Gwen his secret that shouldn't happened, but I just realized that was written on comic books. Gwen Stacy played by Emma Stone was brilliant and I love her in this flick. I love that Parker saved whole New York from giant Lizard. Sam Raimi's Spider-Man did not do that. This is a real super hero for me. And yes I love this film, it grew on me and It is my favorite super hero film and the film isn't dark at all. <br/><br/>Martin Sheen as Ben Parker did a fantastic job as Peter's uncle and Sally Filed as Aunt May Parker was awesome she portrayed the character by the comic book. I love how Peter Parker turn in to a vigilante to an ultimate hero. He has more heart in this film than Tobey Maguire has. Yes I am saying that. I admit it I didn't like the first time this film I saw and I wrote a hateful review 3.years ago, but after I kept watching this film on Blu-ray the film just really grew on me. Andrew Garfield did portrayed perfect Peter Parker/Spider-Man and did a wonderful job as Spider-Man ultimately superhero. <br/><br/>I've always been a huge Spider-Man fan, so seeing this movie was an absolute must for me. I'll admit, I was also a bit reluctant to see it, since Sam Raimi's trilogy did such an impressive job telling the story of the web-swinging superhero. Nevertheless, I ended up seeing ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" on opening day, and I couldn't have been any more pleased with the results. Andrew Garfield was the perfect choice to play Peter Parker, as were Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy and Rhys Ifans as Dr. Curt Connors (The Lizard). Garfield and Stone's on-screen chemistry, in particular, blew me away with how genuine and real it felt. As for the action sequences, don't even get me started. The state-of-the-art visual effects, combined with James Horner's epic score, kept me on the edge of my seat almost the entire time. Don't get me wrong, while this film definitely gets a lot of things right, it isn't perfect. The script lacks some of the charisma and soul that the original flicks had. Plus, the dramatic scenes frequently feel darker and more self-serious than they need to be. But in the end, I can't deny the fact that I had an awesome time with ""The Amazing Spider-Man"". It was fun, fast-paced, and full of energy. It may not have reached the same heights as the original Spidey movies, but for what it was, it more than delivered. I definitely recommend this film for any hardcore superhero fan. Personally, I can't wait to see where the franchise goes from here! <br/><br/>Peter Parker is going back to high school in The Amazing Spider-Man as a teenager dealing with both contemporary human problems and amazing super-human crises.After Peter Parker is bitten by a genetically altered spider, he gains newfound, spider-like powers and ventures out to solve the mystery of his parent's mysterious death.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man is a 2012 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man and sharing the title of the character's longest-running comic book of the same name. It is the fourth theatrical Spider-Man film produced by Columbia Pictures and Marvel Entertainment, and a reboot of Sam Raimi's 2002–07 trilogy preceding it.<br/><br/>I love this film and is my favorite best Spider-Man flick alongside with Spider-Man 2 (2004)! <br/><br/>10/10 Score: A+ Studio: Columbia Pictures, Marvel Entertainment, Laura Ziskin Productions Starring Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Sally Field, Michael Sheen, Dennis Leary, Campbell Scott, Rhys Ifans Director: Marc Webb Producers: Avi Arad, Matt Tolmach, Laura Ziskin Screenplay: James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent, Steve Kloves Rated: PG-13 Running Time 2 Hrs. 16 Mins.

"The_Film_Cricket","Null","2","9","3 July 2012"," A re-boot probably wasn't necessary, but the film is better than you might think.
","Walking into The Amazing Spider-Man, my heart wasn't exactly filled with enthusiasm. Why, I thought, do we really need a fourth Spider-Man movie only ten years after the original? When the movie was over, I wasn't any closer to an answer, but I was filled with gratitude for the effort. This is a different kind of movie than any of Sam Raimi pictures, it is darker, earthier and has – I'll admit it – a better leading man.<br/><br/>The best contribution that this installment makes is that it tries to find a tone of reality as a base so that the fantastical stuff seems more astounding when it occurs. This isn't a fourth Spider-Man movie, but a reboot, a do-over that does what it does very well. Here is a movie that explores what it might really be like for a guy to gain superpowers through a genetically-altered spider. This isn't a jokey film, nor is it cartoonish. Based on its darker tone, I think it is trying to do for Spider-Man what Batman Begins did for Batman. It doesn't succeed nearly as well, but the result is still a very entertaining movie.<br/><br/>The storyline of the movie is already familiar. It follows Peter's story in much the same way as Sam Raimi's popular 2002 film, but with much more focus and maturity. Peter, we learn, is the son of a genetic scientist who died in a plane crash along with Peter's mother. Raised by his Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and his Aunt May (Sally Field), Peter is no more or less ordinary than a thousand other kids his age. He's skinny, lanky and socially awkward. That's clear enough when he stumbles through trying to ask out his pretty classmate Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). Digging through some of his dad's old things, Peter comes across some old documents which reveal that his dad was heavily involved in genetic research that would fuse human DNA with animals with the possibility of curing disease. Curious, he sneaks to the lab where his father worked, a forbidding skyscraper planted in the heart of Manhattan. There he meet his dad's old partner Curtis Conners (Rhys Ifans) who is working on a formula involving lizard DNA that might be able to re-grow severed limbs. While in the lab, of course, Peter is bitten by a spider and later exhibits some very strange symptoms. His hands, for example, stick to anything and everything. Also, he is lightning-fast and impossibly strong.<br/><br/>The best scenes in the movie involve Peter discovering his new powers, especially when he is accosted by thugs on the subway and angers one of the crooks when his sticky hands tear the blouse off of the man's girlfriend. Armed with these new powers, Peter goes on a quest of vengeance after his uncle is killed by a robber in a crime that Peter himself inadvertently causes when he doesn't act quickly enough. That causes some collateral damage that forces him to realize that with great power . . . well, you know.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Dr. Conners' experiment to re-grow his severed arm using the DNA of a lizard goes horribly wrong (DNA experiments in the movies NEVER bring good news). The drug reacts with his system and turns the good doctor into a 12-foot lizard hell-bent on unleashing a gas into the populace that will turn the citizens of New York into his unholy minions.<br/><br/>All of this just sounds like, more or less, a walkthrough of most every other superhero movie, but what is new here is that the movie tries to take this ridiculous material and treat it with a degree of seriousness. It handles the action scenes in a way that have gravity and don't feel like just special effects overplayed on a backdrop. The movie is evenly-paced, and spends time developing the characters so that we know what's at stake during those scenes. And they are quite good, none better than a scene early in the film in which Spider-Man has to save a young boy from a burning car that is hanging off the Williamsburg Bridge, trying to talk the kid into climbing up out of the back of the car.<br/><br/>Central to the movie's success is the new leading man, Andrew Garfield, an actor that I have noticed before in fleeting glances in pictures like The Social Network, and Lions for Lambs. Here he plays Peter Parker as a lonely kid with an under-bit smile and a believable awkwardness. He's a good looking kid, but he's no Adonis. We could easily believe that he is in high school and his slouching manner leads us to believe the during a scene in which he tries to strike up a conversation with a girl, stuttering and mumbling and laughing at just the right moments. Garfield is more ordinary than Toby Maguire, much more down-to-earth and – I thought – much more believable.<br/><br/>I appreciated so much of The Amazing Spider-Man that it is unfair to carp about the details that didn't work. Yes, the villain seems a little stiff, and the film boils down to a standard action climax, but there are so many good things here that you find yourself willing to overlook them.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man was directed by the ironically-named Marc Webb. What he has created here is a film that isn't content to just be a brand name, but is a well-made and very worthwhile entertainment. As I said, it seems that his approach is to make as much sense out of Spiderman as Chris Nolan did out of Batman. Making a film that good would be a sight to see. Webb doesn't completely succeed but I appreciate the film that he has made.<br/><br/>Note: There is no cookie at the end of the credits."

","Ten years ago, Spiderman came to the silver screen when Sam Raimi directed the web slinger with Tobey Maguire and Kirstin Dunst in the lead roles of Peter Parker and Mary Jane. Ten years later and three Spiderman movies in the book, a reboot is released starring Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone and directed by Marc Webb. It isn't that the first three Spiderman movies were the worst ever. In fact, Spiderman 2 is one of my all-time favorite superhero movies. The fact was between contract negotiations failing and a new direction being sought that the best move was to reboot the entire franchise.<br/><br/>They may have been wrong.<br/><br/>And it really hurts me to say this. Because, in reality, The Amazing Spider-Man is a really decent film. It is entertaining, visually fun, and well acted and directed. Unfortunately, it is a movie we have seen before and a story we completely know.<br/><br/>You have seen the first Spiderman and you probably knew the story before that. Nerdy boy gets bit by a spider, becomes a strong and instinctive crime fighter, loses his uncle, tries to hunt down the killer, and ends up fighting an even scarier foe all while trying to win the heart of a girl. This is both the plot and format of Spiderman and The Amazing Spider-Man, which is not the fault of the latter, but keeps you from experiencing this film fully. The fact is, if I was 12 and had never seen Spiderman, I would have loved this moviebut neither are reality and it kept me from really enjoying the film.<br/><br/>To read the full review (IMDb form too short) visit: http://custodianfilmcritic.com/the- amazing-spider-man/"

","Before I watched this movie, I had enjoyed plenty of reviews calling it terrible, and seen plenty of people online mock it for being the worst version of Spider-Man out there. I also noticed that some people liked it. When I put the Netflix DVD into the DVD player, I was hoping that at the very least it would be mediocre. Sadly, it was not. <br/><br/>Story - This movie is ridiculously contrived, full of scenes and subplots that make little sense. Its uninteresting and generic. The only genuine enjoyment that I found in this movie is from one or two scenes that were actually good. One or two scenes in a 2hour+ movie. Other than those, I spent the runtime laughing at how bad the movie was. If you aren't the kind of person who can find enjoyment in laughing at how bad a movie can be, then you will be bored watching this abysmal iteration of Spider-Man.<br/><br/>Characters - I don't really blame the actors for their terrible performances. With the dialogue they are given, it would take the greatest actors on the planet to make it work. The words they say are cringey and unrealistic. Few instances of banter actually work (there is like one scene where Spider-Man is messing around with a criminal and it is honestly enjoyable. Doesn't save the movie though). Every time the movie tries to deliver on some kind of emotion, it fails miserably. I was laughing at the pure stupidity at what is Uncle Ben's death scene.<br/><br/>Effects/Action - How is it that the effects in Spider-Man (2002) which came out ten years before this one had better effects? Simple answer, this movie is over-reliant on CGI. The great thing about having characters that wear masks that conceal their entire faces is that at any point you can swap out the actor for a stunt man who can do the trick so that the scene looks as real as possible. For some reason, the people who made this movie decided against that and just used CG for most of the fight scenes. There are some bits with Spider-Man that look ok, but The Lizard looks so bad its not even funny. I wouldn't care as much about the effects if the characters were entertaining or the situations were well-written, but they aren't. <br/><br/>Sound Design - Its ok, but the music choices suck. <br/><br/>I don't really have anything else to say about this movie. Its not worth watching except maybe on a so-bad-that-its-good level. It does get pretty boring and there's only so much hilarity to be found in unrealistic plot contrivances. If you're a fan of Spider-Man, this movie will make you mad and/or make you appreciate the other versions of him even more. Other than a few exceptions, I would not recommend this movie."

","Once again we get the origin story of Peter Parker becoming the Spider-Man. Once again we get Gwen Stacy, though this time its a substantial character (something that even I'll say, as one of a handful of big fans, was a problem in Spider-Man 3). Once again we get a scientist who meddles too much into his own business and finds that what it changes him into is a living nightmare. And once again we have a teenager who can throw out the occasional quip - though Garfield's Parker is more jerkish in some of his comments than Maguire ever was - while taking out the bad guys, whomever they are. Oh, and of course we get to see (spoiler? no, not a spoiler, screw you, this is 50+ years old now) Uncle Ben dies. Derp.<br/><br/>As I recall from watching this movie, the (must qualify here) first 'reboot/remake' of the Spider-Man franchise from Sony, on DVD right after it came out - I skipped it in theaters, probably I was too busy working that summer or something, I can't remember - is that this wasn't any crime against humanity, and it was probably more watchable and understood its world a little better than, say, Trank's Fantastic Four or the majority of something like Batman v Superman). Webb, pun intended, does a competent job with the character stuff involving Garfield and Stone, albeit I'd rather see them as a couple in a totally different film, so that one can excuse the action from being rote.<br/><br/>At the same time, this also solidified my belief that, if movies last this long, we can go another, oh, 55/60 years before needing another Uncle Ben death scene again. Or, for that matter, Peter Parker in a skateboarding slo-mo shot. It's too same-old to stand-out from the pack, but full of too much personality to be a train-wreck or a fun disaster. It's a perfectly eh-OK-ish blockbuster, and despite this rating and a lot of game supporting players (Sally Field, Irfan Khan, Rhys Ifans... got paid I guess). I'll never see it again intentionally."

","The Amazing Spider-Man is one of those films which your nostalgia prevents you from liking. There are a few positives to this film, such as the chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, some of the fight scenes and Garfield's Spidey was a fresh take on the character, although somewhat lacking.<br/><br/>What bogs this film down for me is the fact that this is just the first Spider-Man again. There are scenes which are practically copied from the first, such as Peter taking pictures of Gwen. He then gets bitten by the spider and finds out he has his powers by easily beating someone up. The villain of this film is, again, a scientist Peter admires but then has his funding pulled, so performs his experiment on himself and kills those who took away his funding. Oh, the villain is also green.<br/><br/>Uncle Ben is shot again because of Peter's incompetence and this leads to one of my biggest gripes with the film: Peter Parker doesn't fight crime because of the responsibility he feels over his Uncle's murder, he fights crime to seek revenge for Ben which completely undermines the character. This is why it annoys me when people call him the 'Definitive Spider-Man' when all he does is spout lame jokes at the wrong times. His revenge plot is also forgotten about halfway into the movie and never picked up again, it takes the video game for the sequel to resolve that thread.<br/><br/>In terms of the film's score, there is not much to rave about, it does what it needs to do and nothing more. It's disappointing considering we had Danny Elfman's score for the previous films which managed to be fun while also emotional when it needed to be. It also had memorable motifs which I just can't pinpoint in The Amazing Spider-Man Overall, this film is a competent reboot and does what it needs to keep the franchise afloat (until The Amazing Spider-Man 2 at least, which forced them to give creative control back to Marvel)."

Why this franchise is being rebooted is a big question since the original series began in 2002. However, Marc Webb does a decent job at breathing new life into the franchise. The screenplay follows the same previous outing yet it still works. Andrew Garfield plays teenage Peter Parker whose parents disappear in the film's opening leaving him with a trusty aunt and uncle. The uncle will be accidentally shot by an escaping mugger. Parker searches for answers regarding his parents and seeks answers from his father's science partner. When he is bitten by a spider at the lab he develops the ability to spin webs and conflict crime. Emma Stone plays Gwen Stacy, classmate of Parker's who also works in the lab where he came in contact with the spider. Rhys Ifans plays Dr. Curt Connors who was partnered with Parker's father. He has one arm and aims to recreate another. His efforts lead to his transformation into the Lizard, a monstrous villain aiming to transforms all society into lizard people. Martin Sheen and Sally Field play Parker's supportive aunt and uncle who shelter him from facts regarding his father. The principal actors are spot on with their performances but supporting roles, including the aunt, uncle and Gwen's police captain father are all somewhat conventional.

That accident, fatal or not, is just plain banal and yet it is the transformation of a human into a spider. That's nice, delicately done, empathetic, attractive. That boy becomes adorable after that transformation in which he recuperates what his father had been researching about.<br/><br/>Unluckily he gives away a formula he should never have given away and that is nearly the end of the world, and this time no epiphany, just a plain apocalypse.

She knows the difference between a real lover and an impotent rapist and you can imagine when her father, a cop mind you, intervene in this sexy love affair that was perfectly safe and back covered to put an end to it.<br/><br/>The end is thus nicely sad since the poor spider will live alone, like all spiders, and his mate will have to go her own way where all kinds of janitors are making sure there are no spiders nor cobwebs in the corners of our minds.<br/><br/>The special effects are funny and disquieting at times but the film has a certain beauty in its brutality.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"

","Marvel wipe the slate clean to reboot their Spiderman franchise after the dreadful mess that was Sam Raimi's Spiderman 3. This time around, it is Andrew Garfield playing teenager Peter Parker, who develops incredible spider powers—super strength, acrobatic skills and the ability to climb sheer walls—after being bitten by a genetically modified arachnid. When his Uncle Ben is shot and killed by a convenience store thief, Parker builds himself a pair of neat-o web-slinging devices, makes a natty outfit, and goes looking for the murderer. Meanwhile, one-armed scientific genius Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) creates a serum designed to regrow his missing limb, but which accidentally turns him into a hulking great CGI lizard in the process.<br/><br/>While this reboot isn't quite as terrible as the third Raimi film, neither is it good enough to warrant starting things all over again. The script fumbles the origins of Spidey and feels utterly contrived (Parker being able to build web-shooters thanks to a handy synthetic material invented by Oscorp, student Gwen Stacey working part-time at Oscorp, those crane drivers helping Spidey to swing across town, Gwen rustling up an antidote to Connor's serum in a matter of minutes), Andrew Garfield proves nowhere near as likable as Tobey Maguire in the role, and Mark Webb's direction leaves a lot to be desired: I didn't care about any of his characters and his forgettable action scenes are over-reliant on unconvincing CGI.<br/><br/>I have yet to see The Amazing Spiderman 2, but the fact that the character is getting yet another reboot in 2017 just goes to show that this particular incarnation isn't doing the trick."

That all being said, It's an absolute shame that Garfield was shut down early. He is clearly the better Spider-Man. The chemistry between him and Gwen is real, for obvious reasons. There are some new shot styles in this reboot. The POV shots are incredible. The entire vibe of the movie is much cooler than Tobey Maguire has ever been in his wildest dreams. If only they saved the ""Amazing"" reboot for the MCU we would all see the most tight butthole movie yet. Emma Stone might be the world's biggest babe.

"dfa120374","8","1","3","16 February 2015"," Much More Enjoyable Than The Previous Films
","The Amazing Spider-Man is a far superior film to any of the previous Sam Raimi Spider-man movies and it defies logic how anyone could like those movies over this. The action, the casting, the performances, the visuals...everything was so much better, and thankfully this version was MUCH less cheesy i.e. ""You're the one who's out Gobby, out of your mind"". I mean really?! The previous movies did have some decent comedic moments, but overall they were just mediocre action movies with decent CGI.<br/><br/>This version however, is a film with much better action and has excellent CGI AND practical effects. This film used much more practical effects than the previous movies, so it's pretty funny to see people praising the Raimi films while calling this a ""CGI crap-fest"". The visuals are anything but crap and they interweave seamlessly with the live action scenes. Some of the action CGI from the previous films you could tell was CGI, but here you can't and if you say you can then you're talking rubbish. Some of the scripting may be a bit predictable, but no more predictable than what we've seen previously.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker/Spider-man does an absolute bang up job and is the much better actor at playing these two roles than Tobey Maguire. Macguire did play a good ""nerd"" for Parker, but he was very two dimensional with his performances. Plus a jellyfish has more of a backbone than Maguire's Parker. I much preferred Garfield's version of Parker where he is seen more of a loner than a nerd and he captured this well in his performance. Even though she was playing a different character, Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy was far, far less annoying than Kirsten Dunst so that was a much added bonus. Sally Field, Martin Sheen, Denis Leary, and Rhys Ifans were all great in their individual roles as well, and the cameo scene involving Stan Lee in the library was a nice touch.<br/><br/>This Spider-man film completely out-classes the Raimi version and you'd be nuts to think otherwise."

Spider-Man 1, 2 and 3 were just fine with Tobey and Kirsten. The visual effects in this reboot as at least as good as the first three, but the writing here is like Spidey meets an evening soap opera.<br/><br/>Adding Martin Sheen and Sally Field doesn't help. Both put in their typically solid performances, but it's not enough to make this film into a must-see. In fact, I thought all actors put in very good performances but the writing held them back and the pace of this film is simply... too... slow.<br/><br/>This is supposed to be an action film, based on the development and subsequent exploits of a Super Hero. What it turns out to be is a little bit of action and a little bit of Spidey thrown into a 90210 made-for-TV movie.<br/><br/>If I'm 50 minutes into the film and they're just then developing the character of the Super Hero, then they're doing it wrong.

"Vartiainen","Null","1","3","24 May 2014"," Surprisingly, the reboot surpasses the original
","The Amazing Spider-Man, in my honest opinion, is better than the Sam Raimi trilogy. Not by much and both franchises have their fair share of both good and bad, but on average, the new ones are better. As controversial as that sounds, and I know there are those that don't share my sentiments at all.<br/><br/>But, let me explain. The two main reasons why I think The Amazing Spider-Man is better are Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone. I never quite liked Tobey Maguire in the originals. Sure he made for a very convincing Peter Parker at his most geekiest, but I never bought him as Spider-Man. Garfield, on the other hand, can do both. Sure his Peter Parker is a more self-confident take on the character. He's more of an oddball tech genius than a nerd, but that's a valid take on the character so I have no complaints. Plus that characterization lends much more easily to what Spider-Man, at his core, should be: a trickster. Add in Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy and you have one of the best romantic pairings ever seen in a superhero movie. The two have incredible chemistry together and you'll totally buy they're in love. Plus Gwen Stacy is a lot of fun. She's active, independent, genius in her own right and actually has a role in the film beyond being the romantic interest and a damsel in distress.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the advances in special effects are put to a good use and the action scenes are very cool to look at. The actual settings are perhaps a bit more ordinary than in the originals, but the fighting styles are more varied and you can feel the speed of the combat. There are also some really cool slow motion scenes, reminding me of the Robert Downey Jr. Sherlock Holmes films.<br/><br/>The one aspect where this film is clearly inferior is unfortunately the villains. The ones in the originals were given a lot of depth and emotion and they were certainly memorable. Sure they were goofy, but that was part of the charm. Not so much in this one. The style overall is more realistic and perhaps even a bit darker, which hits the villains the hardest. They just aren't that interesting or memorable without the over-the-topness.<br/><br/>It's also worth noticing that the storyline is very similar to the first Spider-Man. Usually a reboot that just rehashes the same would be doomed to failure, but this time it surprisingly works. Once again the stronger actors pull this film back from the brink.<br/><br/>In the end it comes down to a matter of taste. Do you like Tobey Maguire or strong, enjoyable villains? Then you'll probably prefer the originals. Do you want to see a more joking, confident Peter Parker and a romantic lead that's actually worth a damn? Then The Amazing Spider-Man might just surprise you."
"mrrockey","5","1","3","17 May 2014"," The Amazingly Soulless Spider-Man
","I guess it was inevitable that the Spider-Man franchise would get rebooted. I mean, Spider-Man 3 generated a huge backlash with things like ""emo Peter"", not much Venom, too many characters etc. Things weren't any better behind-the-scenes as Sam Raimi left due to differences with the studio and thus, causing the cast to leave as well. So as a backup, Sony decided to completely REBOOT the franchise with a new director, new cast, and an all-around new vision to keep the rights to the character. So, is The Amazing Spider-Man really... amazing? Let's find out!<br/><br/>The plot of The Amazing Spider-Man is basically a re-telling of the origin but in this version, Peter Parker is a socially-awkward teenager with a past hidden from him as his parents mysteriously left him one night in the belonging of Uncle Ben and Aunt May with no explanation whatsoever. He goes to Oscorp one day to try to find some stuff regarding his parents after finding a briefcase in his house with info on them leading him there, where he ultimately gets bit by a genetically-enhanced spider that ends up giving him superpowers. At first, he uses it irresponsibly, but after Uncle Ben dies because of Peter letting a thief escape, he decides to use his powers for good and fight crime known as Spider-Man.<br/><br/>While The Amazing Spider-Man isn't a terrible film, it is, however, a soulless film. The movie feels like a business decision on Sony's part and not a story a writer and director wanted to tell. But first, let's get the good stuff out of the way, shall we?<br/><br/>The cast is mostly solid. Garfield is very convincing as the socially-awkward Peter Parker, his constant stuttering and twitching make you believe that a guy like him would get picked on in high-school. But as Spider-Man, he came across as a really obnoxious, unfunny douche. I know this is faithful to how he acts like in the comics but this constant cracking of lame jokes and puns just don't work on FILM. Emma Stone is typically likable here as Gwen Stacy and her chemistry with Garfield is excellent. You really believe these two in a relationship together. Martin Sheen does a great job as Uncle Ben, with a believable concern and care for Peter. But Sally Field just doesn't work as Aunt May, she comes across as an annoying nag rather than a moral guidance for Peter. But everyone else was good in the cast.<br/><br/>The film also LOOKS quite good. Spider-Man looks better than he ever has on film. The way he swings through New York and does all his acrobatic movements are very well-done. The scene that showcased this the best was probably the scene where Spidey swings through multiple cranes set up for him to get to Oscorp, that was a fun scene. While the action doesn't exactly rival The Dark Knight Rises or The Avengers, they WERE good and a lot of it felt like watching a comic-book on screen. Especially the fight with the Lizard in the school hallway.<br/><br/>But while the film has those things, it ultimately feels soulless. What I mean by this, is that, the story just doesn't need to be told again. This film basically follows the same structure and many of the same plot points of the 2002 film and that's NOT the way to do a reboot. The point of a reboot is to tell a story that hasn't been told before under a new timeline. When you just re-hash what was done before except make a few tweaks so it could be labeled a reboot and not a remake, it just comes across as a business decision, and not a story with any flesh and bone. And since we all know this story point by point by now, the impact of seeing things like Spidey swinging on web or using his spider-sense for the first time just doesn't have much of an impact now.<br/><br/>The one element they incorporated from the comics that was absent from the Raimi films, was the whole mystery behind what happened to Peter's parents. While this sounded good on paper, the film never goes anywhere with it after setting it up and now that the sequel has come out and we learn that the whole mystery basically amounts to ""Oscorp = bad"", it makes this even more disappointing.<br/><br/>While Stone and Garfield really do have good chemistry on screen, the way their romance is written and developed, leaves a little to be desired. For one thing, it's REALLY cliché. The script ticks all the boxes of a generic high-school romance. First, they have an awkward conversation in the school hallway, then they have an awkward date, then they kiss. It's also rushed. They look as though they're ready to have spider-sex right after their first date.<br/><br/>Even WORSE, is the villain. I know this sound really controversial but I thought the Lizard was one of the worst villains in a comic-book movie. Yes, he was that bad. Why? Well, for one thing, he doesn't fit in the film's tone. This film takes a somewhat more SERIOUS approach with the Spider-Man origin and it shows with the color palette(which was unnecessarily dreary) so a villain like this just feels out of place. Another problem is that they try too hard to make him a ""complex"" and ""sympathetic"" villain. They try to parallel him missing an arm to Peter missing his parents which doesn't work, because the circumstances are just far too different. And to top it all off, his motivations are really rushed. His switch from noble scientist to savage beast is done in like, a minute. So yeah, he sucks. <br/><br/>Overall, while The Amazing Spider-Man is certainly flawed, it could've been forgiven if the film just wasn't so SOULLESS. And that's really why the film didn't work, it was JUST a business decision. 5/10"
"samwrrussell","5","1","3","12 May 2014"," Putrid movie.
","There's not much to this movie that stands out as good, it's basically an undated version of the first Spider-Man movie. This makes it practically a remake, however most remakes improve upon the original. This movie has nothing good to offer that the first movie didn't. Instead the villain is mediocre, and none of the characters are very good. The problem with making this movie not look like a remake is that they have to go out of their way, sacrificing what makes a good movie, to come up with ideas. There's no point in making a movie that doesn't have any thing to offer. Even if the preceding Spider-Man trilogy didn't exist it would still be a bad movie without a better movie to compare it to. Peter Parker's character wasn't what I expected, instead of being socially awkward he had a over exaggerated sarcastic personality. The only memorable actor was Martin sheen as uncle Ben. Over all this movie is not worth it."

","Why was this made? I ask you, why? We know the story and there is nothing wrong with how it was told in the Sam Raimi versions, so why? to be darker and please the comic fans, or to make more money. Hmm...how bout both. Seriously, this does nothing more than change the cast around and tell the story quicker, nothing more.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield plays an okay Spider-Man with the wise cracking and confidence etc, but his Peter Parker does not hold a candle to Tobey Maguire. He plays it more normal and straightforward, rather than nerdy, which is what Peter Parker is. Gwen Stacey is a huge improvement over Mary Jane which I liked, but their chemistry starting out is awkward and stupid. The villain is a friend of Peter's dad, Curt Connors, who develops a serum that could grow back his arm, but instead turns him into a horrible looking CGI lizard. Although the fights with the lizard are unique and he isn't the worst Spider-man villain we've seen, he's still ugly as sh*t and dies pretty simply. The film is style over substance, and the style is not that interesting. It's dull and it's trying too hard to change the way it tells the story. Nothing stood out that I haven't all ready seen. The death of Uncle Ben is not only brushed aside like nothing, but he's not even what motivates Peter to become Spider- Man. No, it's Denis Leary playing the police chief, and Gwen's father.<br/><br/>When something stylized in the film works, it works well enough to get by, but definitely not enough to really enjoy. Would not recommend unless you're a big fan of the comics."
"bob the moo","Null","1","3","13 April 2014"," Sterile
","When this reboot came out it felt too close to the most recent series of films and generally it looked uninspired so I gave it a skip but the upcoming release of the sequel made me think that maybe it was worth me checking out. In terms of the plot the majority will be familiar to most people since it is not only a famous character but we only really had this same plot a few years ago. The second half of the film has a different villain than the previous film but really it will all feel like very familiar territory – and this is just one of the problems that the film never totally overcomes.<br/><br/>The feeling that the whole film is unnecessary is one that never goes away; it feels superficial and hollow from the very start and even the introductory origin material doesn't scan – it is unconvincing and illogical and this continues all the way to the bite. From here the development into Spiderman is not particularly well done, with a comic tone that isn't warranted or supported by the material. The focus on Peter and Gwen Stacey offers potential but it doesn't come through because it also feels overly superficial and keen to be where it wants to be without actually doing any work to get there on its own. This continues for the remainder of the film as it never really has any heart or any sense of real danger or thrill.<br/><br/>The effects do cover for it and there is a natural flow and movement to the characters who are wholly CGI but to be honest, without any real reason to care about what was going on, all I could think was how little you could get these days for over USD200MM. There isn't any grit to it although the bigger surprise to me was that it really wasn't a lot of fun either. Okay we get the wise-cracking Spiderman of old, but it isn't particularly funny and there isn't any wonder, mischief or fun to the character or the action. The performances are fine but mostly wasted because the material isn't there for them; Garfield is fine but Stone doesn't convince and just feels overly flirty. Ifans fails to bring out the tragedy of his character in the way some of those in the previous series managed. <br/><br/>Generally this film never stops feeling unnecessary. The story is overly familiar and this telling is uninspiring and uninspired; it has the money on the screen in terms of the effects but otherwise it is disappointingly hollow and Corporate, with no edge, no fun, no spark and no real reason for it to really exist beyond the profitability of the character. I was genuinely surprised by how totally sterile the entire film was."

","How should I start, well.... First of all I think this was a very decent(good) film, it just lacked a little bit of action. After all it is a superhero movie and superhero movies are known for its action. I loved the chemistry that Andrew and Emma display,it is like they are actually in a relationship;) Andrew did a good job on being Spider-Man and brought a different but good take on Spider-Man. The story is good, so is most of the acting and special effects. In the end this movie wasn't really something special but it wasn't bad either. It will take time to get used to a new Spider-Man after all the Sam Rami films so people might not be as open to the new franchise. I give this movie an 8.3/10 coming from a Spider-Man fan."

","Spider-Man is the most beloved character in comic books because behind the mask and the swagger, there's Peter Parker, a sympathetic teen with girl troubles and family issues.<br/><br/>The recent Spider-Man trilogy directed by Sam Raimi and starring Tobey Maguire dutifully included the origin story about a boy who gets infected by a radioactive spider, but then the series grew freakishly large. By the multi villain spectacular ""Spider-Man 3,""""The Amazing Spider-Man,"" directed by Marc Web and starring Andrew Garfield, is not just a reboot — it's a rejuvenation. From the first image of sensory awakening to the final acceptance of adult responsibility, it pulses with the warm blood of a very human hero. Peter (Garfield) is abandoned by his scientist parents at age 7. He is raised in suburban New York City by his Aunt May (Sally Field) and Uncle Ben (manly-wise Martin Sheen). Peter is a budding photographer who is bullied by star athlete Flash Thompson (Chris Zylka, resurrecting memories of the obnoxious jocks in John Hughes movies) yet protected by Flash's brainy girlfriend, Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). Peter learns that his father partnered with Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) at Oscorp, and he talks his way into the company's genetics lab — where Gwen is a volunteer and Dr. Connors believes he can re-grow his missing arm with the formula that Peter's father hid. This art-directed movie is uncommonly smart about science and technology, but after nosy Peter is accidentally exposed to spider DNA and morphs into a web-spinning superhero, it really soars. His mastering of the physical and technical skills is thrilling,becomes a moral conflict and must make a leap of faith to accept his supernatural abilities<br/><br/>we all know that with great power comes with responsibility, but this new version of an old story amplifies both the power and the responsibility.costumed vigilante Peter is heading for a showdown with Dr. Connors' reptilian villain, he is also shyly romancing Gwen under the disapproving eyes of her cop father (Denis Leary).<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man is almost the best Spider-Man movie. It has an incredible hero and an incredible villain living in a world that is close to reality. He is not yet professional to his own powers. He is a teenager who needs to be responsible. The drama is more effective in this film than the recent trilogy. Although I complain too much about the pacing, the depth of the story makes you think that awesome set pieces and perfect film making doesn't quite matter. Because it's a superhero film that cares more than just action. The action scenes are great but the mind blowing effect here is the heart and the man behind the mask"
"ultratron563","8","1","3","9 March 2014"," Does for Spider man, what Batman Begins did for Batman
","I LOVE SPIDER MAN! he's one of my top favorite superheroes. and this movie did him justice! even more so than the Rami films in some cases. Andrew Garfield is as perfect for Spider man as RDJ was for Iron man, and Christopher Reeve was for Super man, he is far superior to Tobey Maguire, who felt more like a guy playing spider man, while Andrew feels like he IS Spider man, he's funny, he's smart, and he's git the right build. I know a lot of people hate on this film, simply because it's a reboot. but then again a lot of people did the same for Batman Begins. Although it is VEEERRY obvious that a lot of scenes were cut out. and Peter does do some questionable things, but Garfield is so likable that you forgive him for it. Martin Sheen, Emma Stone, Rhys Ifans, Dennis Leary, and Sally Field all do a great job as well. The score is very inspiring, and there's also some cool action scenes that feel like they were lifted right from Ditko and Bendis Spider man comics. Stone and Garfield also have great chemistry together!! much better than some romance films we've getting *cough* Twighlight *cough*. The only major gripe I have is the final line. it really makes Peter look kinda like a douche, but in a way I know it was done to set up something very important in the sequel...."
"raulfaust","9","1","3","23 February 2014"," Who I Am Hates Who I've Been
","First, I have to mention how irritated I get when I see everyone around bashing this movie, saying that Sam Raimi's work was the best and the only decent. In my point of view, BOTH productions are great for their own merits, and there is no point on bashing one just because you're fan of the other. Is it a remake, reboot or anyhow related to 2002 version? I believe it's a matter of opinion, and it doesn't really matter how it is called. The truth is that WE ALL were used to that version; we all had in mind Tobey Maguire condescending the bank robbery, hearing the clichéd ""With great power comes great responsibility"", loving Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane, among another unique aspects of 2002's version. If now there are different actors and situations, that's because filmmakers are innovating and trying to develop something new-- and that's a good thing! The first scene in which Andrew Garfield stares at the world on top of the building is really beautiful and melancholic, and from that point on I could realize how good photography direction did in here. The burning car scene, for instance, proves that Marc Webb KNOWS how to deliver an impacting scene-- mainly when Parker watches the father and son meet again. I felt really thrilled in that scene. Stan Lee's cameo was quite hilarious, and I'm sure he's proud of that homage. The ending thought of ""it's all about asking who I am"" was indeed smart, and I considered it original-- forgive me if it's already been used, but I'm unfamiliar with superhero movies. Great directing, great acting, great storyline and a refreshment for Spider-Man ideas."
"andriko01","8","1","3","23 February 2014"," It's worth the view!!
","Well, for me it was an actually good film. It had a lot of anxiety, action and it had as a side scene the college ""bully"" and Gwen, witch at some part join the main scene. I don't really think that it's as good as the other ""Spider- Man"" movies, it has a big more of a comedy taste, like the part that he's in the sewers and he's playing Bubble Mania on his smart-phone. Although it has a quite clever scenario (because it's mostly similar to the other Spider-Man movie :-P). Possibly a part of the big audience are 14 year-old girls that just want to watch the movie for Andrew Garfield. It could've been less cheesy (Peter Parker with Gwen) but it's good to be in there, it makes the movie more interesting. The part that Peter goes to the house of Gwen was unnecessary, although it made the Peter-Gwen part go on. So, unlike the rest of the reviews, I think it's worth the view."

","I know that it's been out for a couple of years now, but I just watched ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" for the first time on Encore OnDemand.

But let's face it-- there's A LOT of good movies and television these days. <br/><br/>But oh was I ever rewarded for my wait! What a well-made, enjoyable film! It's significantly better than the first ""Spider-Man"" with Tobey Maguire, although I DID also enjoy those Sam Raimi films when they were new. If there's one slight edge I'd give to the previous series, it would be the development of Peter Parker's love interest. Granted, there's only so much time in a movie (this one is about 135 minutes), but I thought that Peter and Gwen Stacy's romance developed a bit quickly, in contrast to Peter's roller-coaster relationship with Mary Jane Watson in the previous trilogy.<br/><br/>The special effects were quite realistic, the Lizard was scary,and Peter's relationship with his Aunt and Uncle were what you would expect. Overall, I would definitely give this movie a thumbs up, and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes action or science fiction, yet I think any ""movie fan"" would be entertained by this latest interpretation of Marvel Comics' wall-crawling wonder."

Only problem is all you end is the same story we have seen before with a character playing Peter Parker who looks like it was scripted by someone whose idea of cool is based on Bart Simpson.<br/><br/>The result is dull and uninteresting.

"thedudejh","3","1","3","9 February 2014"," Not ""Amazing"" in the slightest
","The Amazing Spider-Man did not ""amaze"" me in the slightest. Garfield was an incredibly stale and boring Peter Parker and the film itself did not invoke any sort of emotion with me at all. There are also points where The Lizard looks absolutely laughable. Sam Raimi's 2002 Spider- Man is the DEFINITIVE film adaptation and is far more fun than this film ever was. This one didn't have the charm, the wit, the humor, the emotion, or the performances of that film. This was not very good. Plus I couldn't stand Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker and Spider-Man. He didn't seem to fit at all and he was such a dick in it too. The only thing good is it has some moments of impressive cinematography and Leary is in it but they kill him so forget that."
"akik1259","5","1","3","2 February 2014"," More modern update is not exactly a good thing
","A reboot only 5 years after the previous movie? Seems a bit odd. This movie has all new actors and retells the story of Peter Parker becoming Spiderman. This time he is played by Andrew Garfield, and he really plays up the emo teen angle. He acts like a jerk and talks back to his aunt and uncle. To me that got annoying fast.<br/><br/>Instead of Mary Jane, we get Gwen Stacy played by Emma Stone. I liked her for the most part and Rhys Ifans plays Dr. Curt Connors aka The Lizard. I thought the lizard looked downright weird with the blatant CGI. Also the motivation that turned him evil was kind of hard to buy.<br/><br/>The scenes with Peter coming into his powers are pretty amusing. Also his romance with Gwen was very convincing. What I didn't like was his attitude, he's a lot more jerkish and self-centered then the comedian hero we're used to. He doesn't get a lot of funny lines and acts like an idiot through most of it.<br/><br/>The action, including the climax battle, is good but not great. It's pretty standard superhero fare these days. Overall the worst of the 4 movies so far, and die hard fans probably won't like it."

","Following the cheesy remake of marvels comic Spiderman (one of the most beloved character in comic books) which was a 'few strands short of a web', Spiderman returns in a modern take, overcasting New York City which may have you asking 'didn't I see this 10 years ago. But With a younger star and more malicious villain than ever, the Spiderman myth continues to be more 'amazing'.Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is an isolated, secretive boy.<br/><br/>Struggling with an intimidating atmosphere and the 'average' bully, Flash Thompson (Chris Zylka), he finds a hidden briefcase that his Auntie May (Sally Field) and Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) never mentioned. It leads him to the Oscorp towers where he pretends to be an intern to discover why his parents vacated him when he was younger and he is bitten by a rare breaded spider which gives him supernatural and unearthly abilities and embarks on his arachnid adventure to save New York City and Gwen Stacey who Peter is dating under the disapproving eyes of her cop father and who also wants to get under Peter Skin more than the radioactive spider did There's only one thing in his way; Dr Curt Conner's who overdoses on Lizard juice and turns into a hyper- violent mutant.. As the skateboarding 'dynamo' becomes a magnet for moral conflict and must make a substantial leap of faith to accept his powers and save mankind. The director, Marc Webb made an unexpected return since his last rom-com (500)days of summer which received many negative reviews. Whilst this film is more riveting, the superior motion picture has a more stimulating origin storyline and just the right casting. Having been bitten, Peter transforms into a confused and maniacal state leaving him with uncontrollable fiendish powers and strengths as he pulls of two very contrasting characters.<br/><br/>With a more engaging film cover, the background suggests that the movie includes more action and thrill giving it a positive effect on people before they even watch it. The outfit is more modern with intriguing gadgets and has fans believing it was set in Manhattan, New York considering it was filmed in Universal Studious, Florida. The transformation scenes are tremendous which streams the Shakespearean drama through teenagers' headphones and has you urging to see the sequel coming out this year (2014).<br/><br/>In my opinion watching a 2 hour and 16 minute long sci-fi movie wasn't the ideal way to spend the afternoon, especially since the origin takes an hour to tell, but as far as reboots go, this is a pretty successful on e and five minutes into the film i was bitten with pleasure. The amazing Spiderman is but no means perfect with a predictable storyline, but the good outweighs the bad and Andrew Garfield pulls of a very genuine American Accent and deserves a lot of recognition. Even though Peter just have happened to pass himself off as an intern and can enter a top secret area, create chaos and leave without triggering any alarms, these are coincidences that we don't dwell on long.<br/><br/>Through it all, Garfield fills both his intelligent Peter parker as well as star quality confident superhero, Spiderman. Mixing considerable acting with relatable teen boy arrogance. Also adding a bit of smartness and quirk, the amazing Spiderman turns to be a blockbuster hit, grossing precisely £262,030,663 on its release date of 3rd of July 2012. It's debatable if we needed another Spiderman after only 5 years, but if you wanted a new interpretation where the story, romance and action stay balanced, this is what you have been looking for.

"delsworld86","3","1","3","7 December 2013"," The Amazing Garfieldman
","In a controversial move, Hollywood decided not to continue with Sam Raimi's CGI-athon Spiderman frachise in favour of a complete reboot. I'm not surprised really, the third instalment was just awful.<br/><br/>This time Peter Parker, played by Andrew Garfield's hair, goes through all the same motions - a good-hearted loner who faces the stereotype bully, pursues the girl, gets bitten by a spider, perfects his abilities, and along the way there just might be a few well trodden superhero lessons to learn, like the importance of being able to disguise a giant barnet under a raspberry condom mask.<br/><br/>In this episode, sorry movie, The Amazing Garfieldman is up against his biggest green screen foe to date - Rhys Ifans, played by a cartoon lizard. All the while pursuing his relationship with Emma Stone's Gwen Stacey.<br/><br/>It's well acted and there's genuine chemistry between the two leads who were in fact dating throughout the movie. There's another good turn from Denis Leary, even if his character was screaming for an injection of Tommy Gavin vipishness.<br/><br/>It plays slightly truer to the comic books (Spiderman invents his own web slinging device, rather than the biological alternative) and Garfield is in my opinion far more likable than that space cockroach Tobey Maguire. <br/><br/>But for all the little pro's, it does absolutely nothing new with the franchise and borrows heavily from the Sam Raimi series. It's far from a bad movie, it's just not a particularly interesting or inventive one and makes no apologies for following a nice safe, linear formula to it's predictable outcome."
"Floated2","7","1","3","4 December 2013"," Solid Reboot with its share of flaws
","Following Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy, many were eager and anxious as to what they would do with this reboot. Having waited a while to see the Amazing Spider-Man, I noticed the similarities as well as the flaws. I am not exactly sure yet how I truly feel about the film. There were its positives such as some action scenes, the chemistry between the leads, and the overall feel (was meant to be taken more serious, had a strong darker tone). As well as some of the negatives, flaws or things I did not care for too much such as Peter Parker being slightly unlikable throughout (how he treated his aunt, uncle, etc.), the way in which his uncle Ben died (did not think this was well done), how easy it was for Gwen (Emma Stone) to fall for him, as well as scenes later on involving the main villain- the Lizard.<br/><br/>Now there are striking noticeable differences between Tobey Maguire's Spider-man portrayal to Andrew Garfrield's Spider-Man. Maguire played his part as more as an outcast social nerd likable and relatable nice guy, while Garfield was looked as more as a loner punk skater who showed his share of emotion and teenage anxiety. Garfield did have a sense of ""nerd-like"" personality but it faded away as the story went on. Both of their portrayal's work for their films and it is obvious as to why they specifically wrote Garfield's Peter Parker to be more edgy. Had they made the same similarities, people just would have complained that they were too similar.<br/><br/>Unlike many people, I didn't really care for the Lizard as the villain and found the way it happened to be rather weak. It was a basic rehash of Spider-man (2002), the typical scientist experimenting with chemicals then one goes wrong and ends up within his body type routine. Though I did enjoy some of the fight scenes involving Spider-Man and the Lizard. They were really well done, specifically the scene where Peter goes down in the sewer as he is patiently waiting for the Lizard to show up, then as he does, they start fighting. As well as when the Lizard comes to find Peter at his school and havoc breaks out. The camera shots and sequences are neatly done. Their finale is also what puts it atop, which includes them fighting outside on top on the lab, then going in the balcony. We see several hits back and forth as it is realistic. Though in this scene towards the end, is where the father of Gwen shows up only to be injected, and as it happens he supposedly passes. He then tells Peter his one wish to not continue dating his daughter. Only to find out by the ending, is what we see.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the cast of Sam Raimi's trilogy better as I feel we saw the potential played out, and their parts were equally great. The CGI was more polished and I did like the Spider-Man outfit in TAS better than the originals. Also the way the web shots were done, I found them better. All in all, the Amazing Spider-man is a very solid addition to the franchise, and we are all waiting patiently for the sequel.<br/><br/>As a rewatch 07/10/17' opinions on the film remain the same. Andrew Garfield portrayal's of Spider-Man was intended to make him different from Tobey MaGuire's version and it was. Overall solid film.<br/><br/>For a third viewing 03/30/19', and watching this film directly after watching Spider-Man: Homecoming, there are very noticeable changes and differences in this film compared to Homecoming. This film felt more dramatic, much lesser fun and less exciting in tone and overall more depressing as opposed to Homecoming (which is obvious given the deaths in the Amazing). In a way this film had an ""indie"" feel, which I have not noticed much before but am sure people have. Both Peter Parkers/Spider-Man were different completely in character. However, this film does remain quality (take it for what it is, it's supposed to be different compared to Raimi's Spider-Man film) but in comparison to Homecoming, that film does have a more natural and fun vibe."

I felt that after Uncle Ben died his wife in my opinion didn't mourn correctly compared to someone who really mourns. Also when Peter totally embarrassed the bully I was surprised that the bully actually admire Peter. I guess it was because of being a hero and completely saving his behind at the high school.Other than that everything was fine and it was enjoyable to watch.

","This movie is only based on the idea and the parts of Spiderman. The creators took Spiderman's concept and mixed it together to a new story, where everything of the Spiderman universe is completely mixed up, so far, that not much of the original idea remains. Almost every part of Spiderman's story and every character has been altered beyond recognition just to fit a new, unbelievable and lame story. Suddenly, you have a totally new background of Peters life, you have Peters mentor from high school as his opponent and Stacy father as chief of the NYPD. So, just everything mixed up to a new and not very tasteful Spiderman cocktail. The only character that improved compared to the old trilogy is Uncle Ben, Martin Sheen plays him very believable and not with that much pathos. But that's about it; after roughly half of playing time, when it comes to the showdown, it gets extremely boring. At least is has some enjoyable scenes in the first half. So, everybody who thinks that Reimi's Spiderman was too far away from the comic don't be surprised to get a shock when seeing this version, it has not much to do with the original. But apparently, today's movies are made for the new generation of movie-goers, which has no relation to the the origins of comics (or to any origin at all) and just look for some action. You see it every where, Star Trek e.g., and this is the same. Very simple popcorn cinema for the ""new generation""."

","""People often say that there are basically 10 stories that people tell, but they are wrong, there's only one. Who am I?""<br/><br/>If truer words were ever spoken, I have yet to hear them. There's been a lot of talk about The Amazing Spiderman since the Sam Raimi era of Spiderman films was cut off at the knees while gearing up for the fourth installment in order to reboot it with the recently released Amazing Spiderman. Is it too soon? Does the film series really need a reboot? Is Sony just trying to cash in on the franchise by pandering to the newly minted tween audience made popular by the Twilight series?<br/><br/>I was one such inquisitive mind as I was a big fan of the Sam Raimi Spiderman series. After coming home from seeing the new film not a few hours ago I can honestly say that I don't have those questions anymore. Comics are notorious for reinventing their characters to fit the generation that's reading them. Is it any wonder that the films would do the same? Yes the thirty year olds who grew up reading the comics and went to see the first movie still remember it quite well, but the ten year olds whose thirty year old parents took them to see it are now twenty and can now appreciate the journey of Spiderman all the more. Why should they be denied the greatness of that journey simply because a similar movie was made not ten years ago?<br/><br/>It's a different time, the story is being told to different people. We're different. Stan Lee has often been quoted as saying that superheroes are the mythology of the day. Mythologies change over time. They evolve and grow based on who is telling them. In 2002 we needed a hero. To quote Rosemary Harris as May Parker from Spiderman 2:<br/><br/>""I believe there's a hero in all of us. That keeps us honest, makes us noble. Even if we have to give up the thing we want the most.""<br/><br/>We needed someone to teach us that. We needed someone to look up to in our time of need. That's the Spiderman that Sam Raimi created for us when we needed it the most. But that isn't who we need anymore, and that isn't the Spiderman you're going to see in The Amazing Spiderman. In this you're going to see ""the man in every hero"". The guy who wants to do the right thing but isn't always sure what that is, the orphaned kid who misses his parents, the boyfriend with a thousand masks.<br/><br/>That's the hero that we need now, and that's the hero we got. Was this reboot necessary? You're welcome to your own opinion on the subject, but I'm going to go with yes. Not because Sam Raimi did a bad job with the first three films, he didn't, though I have my issues with the third film. But because whether he's in a friendly neighborhood, or spinning spectacular webs, Spiderman will always be...<br/><br/>Amazing...<br/><br/>To check out more of my reviews, go here:<br/><br/>http://andrew-heard.blogspot.ca/"

When I say it leaves people wondering about a sequel, I mean that while there is substance there, would it not just repeat the original series ideas?

I thought that I could easily watch it again and it was a good re-boot from the previous series, but upon closer inspection, it was very flawed. Peter Parker is one of my main problems, because he is closer to the comic than the original. While this sounds strange let me explain: in the comics, Peter Parker (Spiderman) is meant to be a bit of a wise- crack when fighting villains and really embraces the costume and powers as a source of freedom. This film shows this side more than the original but yet, I felt myself liking Garfield's Spiderman less. He was too arrogant for my liking, even to the police, just because he is wearing the suit. His tenancy to shout ""Woo!"" is also a tad annoying. The fact he doesn't turn up (or does but about 20 meters away from the actual funeral) adds to this dis-liking of the character. Just because he made a promise to Gwen that he won't get her involved in his superhero life doesn't mean he can't show up to respect a man who, although Gwen's father, helped to save Spiderman and the city, sacrificing his life. He's hardly asking Gwen to become his wife by turning up at her father funeral. These points aside, it was still a like-able Spiderman, just less like-able to Tobey Macguire's.<br/><br/>The next thing would be it's lack of superhero moments. Half-way through the movie I wouldn't be surprised if many confused it with a Romance film, with a suit wearing acrobat lover. The film does great a great Romantic tension between the characters which we can feel for and enjoy but through this we miss what many paid to see, Spiderman. There are about two fight scenes with the Lizard and Parker can't keep his signature mask on for most of it. The audience feels thinking that was a good Romance, but I would have liked more Spiderman. In other words, they are advertising to the right demographic for Spiderman but the wrong one for the movie they made about him.<br/><br/>As for the film in relation to the previous series, it falls short. It starts interestingly enough with Peter Parker's parents scurrying to escape their home, leading the audience to believe that the film will be darker and different from it's predecessor, but it isn't. It's darker but not the story, the design concept. They've made the cities more un-friendly looking and Spiderman a bit more serious looking than Macguire's child-like charm but everything else is just as serious. The story contains little new information too, it uses the Lizard and Gwen Stacey. Neither character was explored in great depth in the original trilogy but adding character alone doesn't make it all too different, it's the same story for the most part. The writers and Director can't be blamed for this though: the story of Spidermans origins have to be the same, otherwise they get an abundance of hate for changing it. Yet they get picked on for it being too similar, it's a lose-lose scenario from this front.<br/><br/>As for the run-up to the sequel, what can we expect. Well more of the same as Spiderman 2 I presume. Peter has adapted to his powers but has lost Gwen, or hasn't, the end scene was done so terribly that we are left wondering what to make of it. None-the-less, the film is too similar to the original Trilogy and even as a stand-alone movie, it falls short of what it said it was- an Action movie- and instead re- invents itself as Romance. It doesn't take a darker slant either, it feels childish with the number of ""Woo!""'s and arrogant behavior of Peter Parker and while the ideas for a darker movie are there, they are never explored properly. All-in-all, if you want to see a movie that you'll enjoy fist time around without being too fussed about the technicalities of it, this will do. If you on the other hand, want to see a Spiderman movie that will satisfy your thirst for Action/Adventure then opt instead for the original Trilogy."

","Andrew Garfield, the new Spidey, should have been the first Spider Man. The original, in this case the ubernerd Toby Maguire, was so terrible in the role that it beggared the imagination. And pairing up this dwarf with Kirsten Dunst, the statuesque love interest in the first go 'round, was about as believable as Michael Jackson's baby chimp mating with King Kong—a total and complete casting disaster—watching them kiss was like watching your parents make love. According to everything written about Stan Lee's original vision of this super hero, Peter Parker was much darker and more conflicted than the previous, watered down version, and it's about time that the producers got it right. Emma Stone was right for the role as the love interest as well, rounding out the superb cast. In short, this is the film that the first wanted to be."

","Not good not bad. Thankfully I went into this knowing that it will be different from Raimi's Spider-Man. There are things I liked about Raimi's version and Marc Webb's version.<br/><br/>Here's what I liked and didn't like about both movies - 1) I still like the idea that Spidey's web-shooting ability being a genetic mutation rather than coming from a device. 2) Maguire was suitably geeky and nerdy as Peter Parker. 3) Garfield's Peter Parker was too cocksure to be convincing that he'd ever be bullied at school, have trouble making friends or get the girls. Also his version of Spider-Man was too cocky. 4) Raimi's style meant the movie had a horror comedy feel which made it stand out from the other polished and shiny superhero movies. 5) Although typical of most superheroes, Raimi's Parker's desire to keep his identity a secret to protect his loved ones makes the character richer and easier to root for. Whilst Webb's Parker seems to be a lot more immature and reckless with his powers; like a teenager who seems disinterested in anything else except getting the girl. 6) Uncle Ben - I prefer Martin Sheen's Uncle Ben way more than Cliff Robertson's. 7) Aunt May - Sally Field's Aunt May doesn't seem to have much more to do than pout around the house waiting for Peter to come home. However, I'm not sure if I prefer this or Rosemary Harris' naggy version. 8) Raimi's montage of Peter's realisation, acceptance and transformation into Spider-Man was more fun to watch and more structured; it showed the process. Whereas Webb's montage was more like a Nike commercial or music video. 9) The pace of Webb's movie was a little uneven, it just jumped from one set-piece to another before the previous one has finished. 10) In Webb's Spider-Man, I do appreciate the implications of Peter's mysterious family history and shadowy parents, which wasn't even hinted at in Raimi's, but ultimately it didn't really have any real impact on the story, unlike the background of the Hulk for example.<br/><br/>All in all, The Amazing Spider-Man feels rather unnecessary and excessive just now, since Raimi's Spider-Man movies are still fresh in the public consciousness. Also, it feels too much like Twilight with superheroes/supervillains. I'm leaning more towards Raimi's Spider-Man as the more superior movie."

Most of us think as Peter Parker a dorky shy boy who has real heart who may not be that good looking but he's a pretty damn good guy, which I feel Tobey perfected. How they made Peter in this it feels like... It doesn't feel like Peter Parker, this guy skateboards? A girl asks him out in the beginning? I mean he seems semi cool and not the dork we all love.

","I have nothing against a franchise reboot. It certainly didn't hurt the recent Batman films, or Star Trek. However, the conditions have to be right. And conditions were decidedly NOT right for a Spider-Man reboot.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi's first two Spider-Man films are not only recent (the first only 10 years old), they are also successful, popular, and well-liked. We haven't had a long period of time go by and/or tolerated a series of mediocre franchise entries. As a result, the audience is inevitably comparing this film to the previous ones (I haven't seen a single IMDb review, even the sparse positive ones, that avoid mentioning the Raimi films). Even worse, it's obvious that the film-makers were comparing the films as well. As a result, it's nearly impossible for ASM to include things that WORKED from the previous films because they'll seem too similar. Thus, the whole origin sequence seems forcibly, awkwardly different rather than natural, organic, and elegant.<br/><br/>The film has other problems too. It's incredibly inconsistent in how it treats plot points. Significant elements are raised (the fate of Peter's parents, Spider-Man's hunt for Uncle Ben's killer) and are then dropped for no discernible reason.<br/><br/>Characterization, especially of Peter, is another problem: for a kid who's obviously a scientific/engineering prodigy, he's astonishingly inarticulate. I suppose this was an attempt to recreate the verbal stumbling typical of adolescence, but unfortunately it results in a character who seems more stupid than he really should be and a lot of awkward, forgettable dialogue.<br/><br/>It's too bad, because in some regards the film showed promise. Martin Sheen was great, as he always is. The effects and action sequences are well-done, if not exceptional. And one thing they did better than the Raimi films is including more of the non-stop wise-cracking typical of the comic book Spider-Man. I really think if the film-makers had either (a) let 5-10 more years go by or (b) as some other reviewers have suggested, just got a different director and cast and did Spider-Man 4 without retelling the origin story, it would have turned out a lot better."

","It wasn't all dark, doomy, terminally introspective and morbidly fatalistic like Nolan's Batdude exercises in bloated style over content and self-absorbed guilt-tripping. Neither was it quite as fun as Raimi's earlier initial updated comic-book take. So, it lands itself in the middle ground between the two and turns out to be...well...middling.<br/><br/>There are some tweaks to the back story, involving Peter Parker's parents picking a peck of pickled peppers. Or, rather, dying in suspicious circumstances linked to Oscorp. And the love interest shifts away from Mary-Jane to comic book second stringer Gwen Stacy. Andrew Garfield looks goofier than Tobey Maguire due to unfeasible teeth and has a blander and less convincing way of delivering dialogue. Rhys Ifans looks and acts like a man just there for the cash, fully realising that he's merely a villain-cipher in a sea of green screen. A lot of the time he looks as if he's going to burst out laughing at the absurdity of it all. It's not that he's bad, more that he doesn't seem to care that much and is therefore simply going through the motions and waiting for payday. Martin Sheen and Sally Field are decent enough, looking happy to still be in gainful employment, and they do lend an air of humanity and characterisation to their roles in the proceedings.<br/><br/>Standout for me is Emma Stone as Gwen – who is absolutely gorgeous and cute and emotionally astute. She lights up every scene she's in and never gives the impression of being contrived or fake in her performance.<br/><br/>Like THE AVENGERS it's a mass of CGI, which is par for the course these days. Some of it is convincing, but a lot of it looks continuously unnatural, and where THE AVENGERS had a clever sense of self-aware humour to act as a buffer against the intrusion of the SFX pulling you out of the moment, SPIDER-GUY doesn't have that same creative mindset.<br/><br/>I'm really getting tired of this superhero CGI stuff. I gave this a spin because it was available and I picked it up at random. It filled a viewing space, and I wouldn't have gone out of my way to see it. It is neither offensively bad nor astonishingly good - just amazingly average."

","So, here we go again. Another remake of the remake of the remake... The story we all know, the lines we read, the fights we've scene the question is weather it will be packed good enough for us to love it again? For me the answer is, no. It fails in characters development, in the plot very much so and gives us a lot of new cool 3D and CGI effect but very little on the story line and the creation of the cult super hero. The plots which determine the destiny of our superhero are the least developed and have plenty of leaks which makes it hard to buy the whole story. We got a new super villain which we haven't seen before and is great but it is so weakly explained why is he doing everything he does. That is what is it like with most other things in the movie as well, just doesn't give us anything to grab hold of and makes us anticipate the sequel. That is what made the previous franchise amazing and that's where i can see this one failing. Sequel to this or not, either way, its irrelevant."
"jimtay01","4","1","3","8 December 2012"," Big Disappointment
","I just ordered this movie over pay-per view, expecting it to be different. In my mind, I was thinking of the difference from Christopher Nolan's Batman, from the earlier Batmans. (Christian Bale vs Val Kilmer). Nolan's Batmans being much more sophisticated and realistic, than the older Batman movies from the 90's, with Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr Freeze, or Jim Carry's joker.<br/><br/>But it was just the same as the original 3 spider man movies. Something more for kids.<br/><br/>I couldn't believe it when he started goofing around with the guy who was stealing the car. Shouting and mouthing off. Only a 9 year old with a silly sense of humour could enjoy that.<br/><br/>I think this actor was also really bad. He seems like an arrogant little kid. Were we supposed to feel good about him beating up the so called bully, ""flash""? When all he was doing was playing basketball? The ball knocked over the girls paint can. I mean it wasn't intentional. He was playing ball and that's what happens. So were we supposed to feel good about this guy getting what he deserved? Because all I saw was an arrogant little prick, picking a fight because he got new powers.<br/><br/>There were a couple enjoyable parts. Dr. Connors was a good actor and his parts were good. The girl's cop father was pretty good, and the crane operators who lined up the cranes for spider-man at the end. (I like to see this working together for a good cause).<br/><br/>But the whole spider-man part was just bad."

","I felt nothing when this film finished, not even entertained, thats its problem. Its soul less, filled with average special effects, empty characters and a thin plot. <br/><br/>Someone mentioned twilight, I understand that - maybe I am a little old for what appears to be more a teen film than say The Dark Knight trilogy, Watchmen or hell even Captain America. <br/><br/>Andrew Garfield is the loner, sulky guy who mumbles a lot but doesn't have to try very hard for Emma Stone to like him. Add to that the complete lack of chemistry between them (on screen) that for some reason has them standing round in corridors mumbling to each other for what seemed like forever. <br/><br/>I love superhero films, but I am getting a little bored with the CGI crap fests which I thought Batman had ridden us of. This unfortunately is one of them. Sam Raimi's films suffered the same however at least had likable characters. I didn't get the point of the police chief, Uncle Ben was confusing, the build up to Spider man first appearing was under cooked and the finale was poor (and shown in the trailer) <br/><br/>Then we have the Lizard. Another bad CGI cartoon jumping around smashing things. To be honest during the 'fight' scenes I was bored with the shoddy special effects that don't really look any better than the previous films. <br/><br/>Finally my biggest complaint.

In Sam Rami's Spiderman Uncle Ben's death scene was more dramatic and emotional, because it was shown off screen. Nice attempt Marc Webb, Hopefully the sequel is better.

"itamarscomix","4","1","3","18 November 2012"," What's the point?
","The Amazing Spider-Man isn't quite a horrible film; it has some redeeming features. Most surprising of all to me was Andrew Garfield - I really had very little faith in his ability to play the titular character, but he did an excellent job, better, in fact, than Tobey Maguire ever did, as both Spider-Man and Peter Parker. Coupled with Emma Stone playing a very charismatic and likable Gwen Stacy, they manage to inject real feeling and humanity into the high-school and the romantic scenes, that was sorely lacking with Maguire and Dunst.<br/><br/>But that's just not enough. Obviously, in almost every film, there's one actor that I'd have liked to replace with someone else - but is that a good enough reason to remake the film with a different actor? That's what The Amazing Spider-Man is. Maybe it's a little more gritty than Sam Raimi's version; maybe it's a little more teenager-oriented; maybe it stays more true to the comics on some plot points, at least to certain versions of the comics. But it's not different enough that it can be viewed as its own creation, rather than compare it to Raimi's films, which is apparently what the producers wanted to avoid. They jumped the gun way too fast, rebooting the series when the Raimi films are still fresh in our memories, and in doing that prevented their film from ever being appreciated as a new one.<br/><br/>And in that comparison, it loses, badly. For every redeeming quality there are ten screw-ups staring us right in the face. The script is very poorly written; Spider-Man's origin story once again takes up half the film, but it's done so much less convincingly than in the 2002 version, and followed by very awkward, nonsensical scenes of Peter Parker skateboarding around and doing slam dunks, apparently in a condescending attempt to make the film more appealing to teenagers. Instead of the appealing and menacing villains of the first two Sam Raimi films, we get Rhys Ifans - a talented character actor - doing his best with a poor script and with a very unconvincing CGI human lizard, which makes for a very dull, gray, cartoonish villain that goes starkly against the more realistic approach Marc Webb was trying to go for. As for Martin Sheen and Sally Field - they're both terrific actors, but they bring nothing more into the characters of Uncle Ben and Aunt May than the weak lines the script gives them.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man is just good enough to make for an entertaining summertime braindead blockbuster, but even though it's not a terrible film, it's something worse - a film that doesn't deserve to exist. Kudos to Andrew Garfield on his work; in a good film he could have been great. But this isn't it."

","If I count the 3D effects of this film, it can achieve a big Okay. But as a movie compared to previous Spider Man films, I have to assert it as the worst of this Marvel's spider version. Marc Webb looked to be more concerned with representing Spider Man's earthly features rather than the script. Though he pulled some major changes in the story of earlier productions such as casting Stacy instead of Mary Jane, bringing the Lizard in antagonist role; still Webb, seemingly, paid his most concentration to make Spider Man more humanistic following Nolan's philanthropy in Batman series. I couldn't be satisfied with the maladroit over-acting of Andrew Garfield as before. Irfan Khan's short appearance and departure came as vague. But Emma Stone's acting was emancipated from these glitches despite having just a commercial heroine role. The way Parker turned him with the suit was quick and quirky. Overall, this so-so super hero movie could not reach my high expectancy____7/10"

","Okay, the last thing I wanted to see was yet another Spiderman movie, Spiderman has never been a character I have particularly been interested in. I enjoyed the Raimi flicks but never did see the much maligned third installment . Even though it is the same story I enjoyed the shadowed soul of this Peter Parker, he is flawed, this is evident even before his developing powers and the murder of his Uncle. Although we are witness to the predictable anger/revenge which follows it evolves and becomes less square jawed heroics and a little more ""nah nah nah nah nah"" particularly with the car thief. I thought there was good chemistry between Peter and his love interest and was happy to see strength in both the important women in his life a refreshing change from frail Aunt and doe eyed obligatory girl friend he must at some point rescue, which may yet happen this is the first of this series. Did they need to make another Spiderman movie? Probably not. Is it fun to watch and engaging? Sure it is. It's a movie about growing up being in love and saving the world this is usually a recipe for success."
"jamiebonline","5","1","3","21 October 2012"," Definitely not amazed
","OK I did not see this in 3D and so I can't comment on that. This was a mediocre movie at best. The back story about Peter Parker's parents was never fully explained and that was not the only plot hole. The directing was fine, I guess. I didn't notice anything special. The effects seemed weak but then I am not a big fan of CGI. Comparing it to the Avengers though, it seems like it was a lower budget especially when the lizard guy (the main villain) speaks! The action sequences were hampered by spider-man's silly comments that seemed forced and not amusing like they were meant to be. There was some humour though that worked. One nice sequence is when Parker shows off his new-found basketball skills at the school. The moment where he breaks the backboard. There were a couple of nauseating moments of American heroism towards the end. I am so tired of stupid middle-aged, hard-working patriotic wooden characters flaunting their morality on screen. The casting is not bad although I too am tired of seeing high school students being played by adults in their mid to late twenties. Is there no younger talent out there?? Martin Sheen and Sally Field were effective as the uncle and aunt of Peter although predictable. The best thing about the film was Emma Stone although she did seem to be a bit of a fish out of water. She is too intelligent for a movie like this. Consider Easy A or Crazy Stupid Love. This movie is nowhere near their level.<br/><br/>It is worth noting that this is basically a rehash of Sam Raimi's Spiderman of 2002. That movie was better. Go see it if you want an escape and don't expect much depth of intelligence and nothing new from the annals of the superhero genre. Do be prepared to be bored at times and mildly annoyed."
"thevikingage777","8","1","3","17 August 2012"," Why This Version is Better
","*spoiler*<br/><br/>I was shocked too that they were making a new spidey so soon, but since I wasn't a huge fan of the cheese-fest that was Raimi's installments (and the nail in the coffin that was Spidey 3) I was interested in seeing how it'd play out. And boy was I impressed on all counts. Here are some of the major differences that I found made the movie/story/characters so much better.<br/><br/>1. Gwen Stacy was not a damsel in distress. Mary J was in peril in all three installments, but Gwen even when we thought she'd be in danger in the Oscorp building she wasn't, the Lizard just walked away. Of course he would! The villain's goal is to perform his experiment (change humans into lizards or run his clean powered energy source), why would he want a female audience member?<br/><br/>2. Peter Parker in this installment was the right amount of awkward without being a socially challenged wunderkind like Maguire's. In this movie, he was able to intervene with a bully, has frank conversations with his Aunt/Uncle, and actually expedited a swift-moving relationship with the girl. Tobey's performance showed a college student who couldn't string together two sentences with a girl, had no honest conversations with his adopted family, and seemed pretty clueless about anything social going on around him (take a shot anytime you see him with a quizzical expression in his face). This version of Parker, sure had the awkwardness of teendom (although more endearing, the awkward non-talking scene where he and Gwen make a date is adorkable) but he still had relatableness and believability with his interaction with humans. Tobey just seemed like an alien that couldn't hold his own in *any* interaction (he really thought Mary Jane, a girl he's known his whole life all of a sudden would have an appreciation for poetry!?). I am absorbed into this Peter's behavior as a teen, and the old Peter's behavior as a college student is just pitiful.<br/><br/>3. Gwen Stacy had some bite. The only female in Raimi's Spidey-verse that showed any fight was the very old Aunt May when she hit Dr. Ock with her umbrella. Gwen does something as similarily innocous with a trophy, but at least she's doing something - Mary Jane just sat there in shock and let Spider-Man get his ass handed to him. <br/><br/>4. There was no useless voice over. Sure that's taken from the comics, but that device is not that necessary for films. Especially in Raimi's movies where the narration tells you things you already know. This version isn't treating the audience like morons.<br/><br/>5. Gwen Stacy actually had some deductive skills (as well as generally very intelligent). Even after having her ah-ha moment with the kiss (really the kiss is what gave it away? not his constant absenteeism during Spider-Man appearances?) she seemed unbeknownst in Spider-Man 2. Whereas with only a flick of webbing that Gwen didn't even see happen she immediately found out his secret identity. But yet getting thrown aside moments before getting hit by a flying car, Mary Jane doesn't figure out he's Spider-Man (oh because her eye's were closed - of course!). Furthermore, Gwen later deduced the promise her dying dad said to Peter. She also figured out how to create the cure, sealed off the building, and was employed as a high school student at a top tiered biotech firm (which is unheard of).<br/><br/>6. We see signs of Peter's intelligence when he designs the web shooters and his door-locking device. Also his understanding of the equation and how he flawlessly put it into the program; also how he was able to break into the spider room. We see no signs of intelligence with Raimi's Spider-Man. He doesn't even know his class schedule or how to tell time (even my dumbest students know when they're running late). He can't remember to take the lens cap off a camera. The list goes on. We never really see moments of brilliance.<br/><br/>7. Spider-Man actually got hurt in this movie. His chest was tore to shreds, he got beat up by a bully, he had his leg shot, the dude was constantly beat up throughout the movie. I never saw even the hint of blood on Tobey. His hair wouldn't even be tussled. If the hero can't get hurt, why should I care about his safety?<br/><br/>8. The romance had a beginning, middle, and end. In the trilogy, it dragged out ad nauseum and even when they were ""together"" they weren't really that happy.<br/><br/>9. Hardly no cheesy one-liners. Every word out of Tobey's mouth was some lame pun, but that was almost non-existent in this version.<br/><br/>10. He never catches the killer. I love that. Leaves not so much a cliff hanger, but that in life you don't always get what you want. Also, it was more of a set piece for him to discover revenge isn't the way to go, but rather to be a protector of the city. Much more effective."

Overall I think the movie was very good however, there were some things I would of changed.<br/><br/>There were several fantastic things about this movie but I will say the biggest ones. First off, the casting was great. Andrew Garfield played a good awkward nerd who wasn't sure how to use his powers at first. The actor who played the lizard I have never heard of but he I think nailed the role. Also, Martin Sheen in Uncle Ben fit very well. <br/><br/>Next off I really liked the story. I think it balanced pretty well. The story line was well written and makes me want to see the rest of the movies already. It had great action scenes. Along with this it had the right blend of comedy and drama. It was not just straight on senseless action. It had a reason that made it worth watching. It even had a love story.<br/><br/>Along with this there were some things I would of changed. First off, I wanted to actually see Norman Osborns character. I think it would of been cool to see Norman Osborn. Along with that the Daily Bugle would have been a great addition. I realize they took an approach where Peter Parker was in high school. But, I hope to see the Daily Bugle in the rest of the movies. <br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD: The last part I would of personally liked to see changed is a part in the ending. The part where Captain Stacy dies. I think they were trying to pull on your heart but I think it would of been better to keep him. I wanted to see him in the later movies to see how he dealt with Peter after those certain events. He told Peter to stay away from Gwen to protect her but I thought they should of kept him. It would of been great for the sequels.<br/><br/>Overall it was a fantastic movie. The things I think they could of changed or added may have been left out for a reason. I personally cannot wait to see the later movies. There is still more of the story to come. If you saw after the credits you know there will be more."

Hate it or love it, we are shown an entirely new angle on Spider-man. Though Peter Parker is still loosely the same, (smart, goofy photographer on the outside of high school social life)his characterization goes much deeper in one film than anything that came of the entire Raimi trilogy. Now, certainly we all have our preferences; while some would scold the movie for its slight deviation from the original Parker, others would praise it for making Peter more believable and thorough while still maintaining the basis of the original character. In The Amazing Spider-man, Peter is presented as conflicted over an event in his past (his abandonment by his parents.) While most cannot understand such a sentiment to the degree of Peter, a sense of internal conflict over our past trials and traumas is something that nearly all can attest to feeling, especially confused and maturing teenage boys. Additionally, Peter's status as an outsider appeals to the idea in the minds of many that they are misunderstood by almost everyone, even those close to them. All in all, the latest characterization of the web-slinger outside the suit is easy to relate to for the introverted, intellectual teens of today just as the original comic book version was to the same types of teens in previous decades.<br/><br/>The characters and the sequences in this film operate on a level of emotional depth that is several notches deeper than that in the first three Spidey-flicks. The most glaring reflection of this comes from the romance between Garfield's Peter Parker and Stone's Gwen Stacy; from the natural, warm smiling moments to the awkwardness of the first date proposal and mom opening the door mid-kiss, this is very much a real-world type of teenage romance that everyone has experienced at least once. The solace and unique understanding that Peter finds in Gwen is, although not necessarily true to comic book storyline, yet another element of the film that is very palpable and very real.<br/><br/>One area of the film that seems to have left many wanting is the storyline involving Dr. Curt Conners/ the Lizard. Certainly Dr. Conners wishes to turn everyone in the world into mutant lizard-people was not nearly as believable or sensible as other elements of the story, and it seemed as though the idea was forced to make the film seem more ""comic-bookish."" Thought that basis of the story was not quite perfect, I believe it is an issue that will be resolved in the sequels. As stated previously, this is a whole different kind of Spider-man film that what we're used to. Rather than striving to create a cinematic graphic novel, this film's crew set out to create a believable and sentimental cast with depth and motivation, something that will make the later movies in the series even more compelling. This a is a new type of hero movie (a la Nolan) that gives us more than grueling duels with baddies, but also palpable inner-conflict that comes along with the super sweet stretch-suit. The Amazing Spider-man was so much more than I expected it to be, and my hopes are extremely high for what is to come for this series in the next few years."

","When the amazing spider-man was first announced as a reboot following the at best messy spider-man 3, the fan base opinion was severely divided. There were those who were excited by the prospect of revisiting Peter Parkers origins and thrilled by the idea of a new, more faithful approach to the characters that resembled more closely the original comics. Then there were those who were filled with doubt and dread. Cynical that the reboot would bring anything new that hadn't already been done better in Sam Ramis first film, cynical that the new film would try and appeal to a hip younger audience and would feel uncomfortable like twilight in spandex. With a sigh of relief the web heads loyal followers can rest easy however. It must be stressed that this new, fresh take on the story is A)in no way offensively teen marketed and B) actually pretty damn good. Of course we follow the same familiar plot: nerdy teenage boy with hopeless crush living with his aunt and uncle is bitten by a genetically enhanced spider and develops superpowers, uses power for own gain, power responsibility, after tragic event becomes a hero blah blah blah you know the rest. However you cant blame the film makers for this, spider-mans origins are an integral part to who he is and are therefore impossible to change, but kudos should go to Marc Webb for at least telling these events in a way that feels new (Peters first experiences with his spidey sense for example is humorous and inventive as is a scene in which Peter tries to get to grips with his new found strength). What's more important anyway than what we've seen before is whats new. Gwen Stacey makes a MUCH more charismatic love interest than Mary Jane, shes funny, likable and does more than just whine at Peter and then scream when she needs help for the whole running time. Emma Stone has made Gwen Stacey into a character that you understand Peters affection for aiding your emotional investment when things all go wrong. Its a strange point to make but its true, for perhaps the first time the love sub plot in a comic book movie is not only entertaining but its in places rather emotional and effective. Marc Webb manages to tell a more human real love story as the sub plot to his blockbuster than most Rom-coms (or certain vampire films) do. The rest of the cast are also likable and believable all round, Martin Sheen is a funny charming uncle Ben. Ryhs Ifans is a sympathetic but enjoyable villain as the lizard. Even Chris Zylka as Flash Thompson gets a bit more 3 dimensional in one notable scene. but of course the focus here is and always should have been on Andrew Garfield. Here is the films biggest strength. It needs to be said that Garfield truly wipes away all memory of Tobey Maguire and that also he may be one of the most if not the most, perfectly cast lead in a superhero blockbuster. Forget Bales threatening moody batman or Downey Jr's funny witty iron man, Garfields Peter is lovable, funny, heroic, believable and simply is the spider-man the comics portray. He has the perfect physicality to the part, has impeccable delivery with both emotional dialogue and humorous banter. He caries the film from good to triumphant so when the great powerful moments come with James Horners (excellent) score blasting in the background you really feel engaged and thrilled. Outside of casting, the special effects are all seamless (ignoring a couple of cartoonish shots of the lizard) and some of the stunts spectacular. Its a shame then that non of these individual parts add up to any amazing set pieces or action scenes. The battles between spidey and the lizard are entertaining and engaging but never thrilling. There's nothing too special here in the action department. The films most memorable fight (a frantic battle between the lizard and spidey in the school) is fun but not jaw dropping, although it does feature Stan Lees greatest cameo yet. Thats not to say the film is not visually impressive. Marc Webb has brought style that Sam Rami's more cartoonish camp siderman films simply could not dream of. The city lights blur in th night as spidey glides elegantly through the air, the lighting in one sewer based moment is exquisite as a web structure is constructed before is gracefully and beautifully with soft almost magical fairytale esque music accompanying it, and Marc Webbs first person swinging shots are, whilst videogamey, very dynamic. But the true quality of Sonys spider-man reboot isn't really in the fantastical scenes, its in the more personal, heart warming scenes which is wear the film incidentally is light years beyond the whinny irritating emotionality of the first series more intimate moments (See any scene with Mary Jane). This time round things happen on a smaller scale to effect Peters life and we genuinely care. We care about his relationship with aunt May, we care about him trying to maintain peace Gwens farther despite saying all the wrong things, and most of all we care about him and Gwen. Sure the villain may not be as threatening as many of Batman's more memorable foes (although the lizard does have a believable sympathetic story to go with his human alter ego), sure the actions never up there with spider-man 2's train sequence or the dark knights bat pod tunnel chase and sure many scenes feel familiar and (very rarely) weaker than they were in the past films. But overall the amazing spider-man is more emotional, more charming, more believable and more stylish than many of its genre. Doubters, you can put your fears to rest now."
"bigmystery23","6","1","3","6 August 2012"," Is a remake necessary?
","After watching this remake, I came out of it in a dispute with my family. The truth is that this remake should have waited maybe five to ten more years. It may not seem so soon, but it is! All I could do was think about Tobey and Kirsten throughout the movie. If you can get passed that, then you're in for a romantic treat. By saying that, I mean it. The entire film is led by the chemistry between the two leads. Are their performances good? No doubt! Is Garfield a better Spider-Man? In my opinion, no. He has the fine looks, lean body, and talent, but that's not enough. Maguire had the quirky look, awkward aspects and built figure to become a hero who the audience had sympathy for. All the sympathy in this film is at the end of the movie, when a character dies, rather than with anything revolving around Garfield. This film has plenty of dazzling visual effects and epic action sequences, but sadly, it isn't needed at the moment. If you're looking for new and fresh material, skip this film. If you want to go on a date or see an action film, go to the theaters, especially IMAX."

","When the first trilogy of Spiderman had come out, I was impressed by the acting, visuals, and story. This new rehash of Spiderman did not leave me with the same impression.

Spiderman is an amazing superhero and his theme should reflect him. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Poor story telling: Slow and boring is how this film progresses. I did not feel as if I got to know all the characters in the film and it seemed as if most characters besides Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy were bland and missing something. </li></ul><br/><br/>Tobey Maguire's performance in the original is more believable than Andrew Garfield's in this rehash, although I must say Andrew did a pretty good job.

I didn't see any reason to reboot the movie the old one was just fine, although the movie tells us a whole new story about spider-man but still lets face it ""IT WAS CRAP"".<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield was acting like a useless monkey in the spider man suit and I really didn't get why they put Irfaan Khan in the movie. He barely spoke. Other than that Uncle Ben's death scene totally lame.<br/><br/>Movies like these are normally known for their fight scenes but the fight scenes in this one were really really weak and the climax fight was BULLSHIT.<br/><br/>I gave it 5 stars just for the effort otherwise it doesn't deserve it."
"franciscoraposo72","7","1","3","2 August 2012"," Great movie
","On top of this review there's a seven, but the truth is, I don't have a specific rate for this movie, I just think that The Amazing Spiderman is a great movie. From all the blockbuster's that we will have this year, The Amazing Spiderman will be distinguished from all of them by its humor, performances, actor chemistry, entertainment, heart, and of course, by being a spiderman movie.<br/><br/>Before I see it, it took me a little time to want to go see it, cause, I've seen all the previous spiderman movies and when I saw this movie's trailer with Garfield instead of Maguire, I thought to myself, that The Amazing Spiderman was just a stupid remake that I wouldn't to go see. Later, when I was invited to go to the movies, The Amazing Spiderman was an option of the viewing, I saw the new trailers, I read the reviews and it actually got me thinking that I should give it a shot.<br/><br/>I left the theater with a big smile on my face. The Amazing Spiderman is not an untold story, it's very similar to Sam's Spiderman, but it has many good qualities that I did not see in the original Spiderman. First of all, Andrew Garfield (The Social Network) fits better in the suit than Maguire, I admired his performance as the Peter Parker and Emma Stone, who you'd think that plays Mary Jane, actually plays Gwen Stacy, and her performance was also amazing, but I really admired was Garfield and Stone's tremendous chemistry, which was the back bone/heart/soul of the movie. Overall, The Amazing Spiderman wouldn't be the same with these two love birds in the film.<br/><br/>So, my thoughts are: The Amazing Spiderman convinces in the performances and in the amazing CGI effects. The action scenes weren't amazing at the ending but we can still get from a superhero what's most important, a well-told story, good performances by the cast and heroic scenes, and this movie had all of that. Marc Webb did a great job and I'm looking forward for the sequel.<br/><br/>Go watch it."
"Zokyah","8","1","3","27 July 2012"," Really worth watching
","It might seem strange to do another Spider-Man movie after just a decade, but I don't think it is that odd considering there's a new Jane Austen movie/miniseries every five years or so. After all it is not a copy of the first movies, but another interpretation of the original story of Spider-Man (the comics). I haven't read the comics myself, so I can't judge the film in that perspective. I will try not to compare the films too much, and just talk about The Amazing Spider-Man as a good or bad film. Let's begin with the story.<br/><br/>We first meet Peter Parker, a shy guy, a little bit lonely, a little bit geeky, but not in a cliché way. This character is actually very believable, and very lovable and I'm sure it has a lot to do with Andrey Garfield's great acting. There is something very genuine about him which makes us like him at once. We learn how he lost his parents and came to live with his aunt and uncle (perfect cast with Sally Field and Martin Sheen). His transformation into Spider-Man is a result of his curiosity for his father's work at Oscorp, and there's an interesting parallel between his physical changes into Spidey, and those of Dr Connors' transformation into the Lizard, and how it affects them differently.<br/><br/>The dialogues are very well-written, with a lot of humor and wit (I loved the last line before the credits), and there is a certain darkness to Peter that was lacking in the other Spider-Man movies (especially in the third, which was supposed to be darker).<br/><br/>As for the girl Peter is in love with, Gwen, we appreciate the fact that she's not constantly in danger and can take care of herself even though she doesn't have super-powers. She doesn't exist just to be Peter's love interest and damsel in distress ; she's very smart and doesn't need to be saved every other day.<br/><br/>The action scenes are just the right length, and they don't try too much to impress us. I do have one complaint however, and that is regarding the split personality of Dr Connors. Even if it's not as bad as in Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2, it thought ""seen this, done that"" and I would appreciate if screenwriters didn't feel the need to always give split personalities for bad guys. Or at least, don't make the guy talk to himself, I'm tired of this device since Gollum.<br/><br/>On the whole, it's a great movie and even if you think the first ones have done it all, I can assure you you'll be proved wrong. It has everything you can expect from a super-hero film : good action, good story, a bit of darkness, a bit of romance, and a lot of humor."
"innerguard","8","1","3","26 July 2012"," Very enjoyable, well written story of spidey
","Spider man returns to cinema screens with a very enjoyable reboot to the franchise which lies closer to its comic book roots than the original. The amazing spider-man was not a movie that held a very big standing in my years list of anticipated films with the release of Prometheus and the dark knight rises but after watching this flick I can honestly say viewers will not be disappointed. The movie follows our nerdy but lovable protagonist Peter Parker and as the movie begins we gain a deeper insight into the history he posses than is first demonstrated in the original spider man. The movie is effectively paced and never leaves to much to the imagination. We learn about Dr. Connor's desire to regenerate his arm which leads him to become the reptile beast we have seen previously in the comics and the animated series. Not expecting much I was Definitely pleasantly surprised while watching this movie, I became engaged and always wanted to learn more about the characters involved. The only negative points for me was that in some scenes Andrew Garfield was slightly emotionless in heart wrenching scenes and that parts of the movie were in my opinion 'cheesy' (reference the last minute save by the crane operator) but asides from that very good film that is Definitely more than a cheap weekend flick."
"simon-adams-88","8","1","3","25 July 2012"," The reboot no-one really wanted has been released. Check out the Film-Vault review!
","A new Peter Parker is donning the red and blue spandex and taking on the mantle of Spiderman. Its Garfield Vs Maguire, Stone Vs Dunst and Webb Vs Raimi. Who will win?The Answer is Garfield, Stone and Webb. This film matches the tone of how I always perceived Spiderman, and the actors and director hit the mark again and again scene after scene. It is an origin story, so we get the familiar bits, Peter gets bitten by a radioactive spider, Uncle Ben gets killed yada yada yada, but because the human side of the story is so engrossing the superhero bits take you by surprise, even the ones you know are coming. It really had me going for a while that they weren't going to kill Uncle Ben in this movie.<br/><br/>Brit Andrew Garfield is Spidey and my does he shine. In a (reaaallly) shoddy article I wrote for this website about two years ago, I commented on how Tobey Maguire's Spiderman was always whinging and whining. Garfield's Spiderman has the same problems, more so probably, but there is something about web-slinging through a city and outsmarting criminals that should put a smile on your face. That is where Webb shines. He has crafted the most realistic but still fantastic superhero story that I think has been told, by pumping it full of relatable human emotions. Enter Emma Stone as Gwen Stacey, and my is she fine. I can't remember an on-screen role haunting me as much as this one, aside from Zooey Deschanel in Webb's earlier work 500 Days of Summer. Not only is she beautiful, but she is kind, friendly, smart and brave. It's really quite a step above Kirsten Dunst's screaming bag of meat Mary-Jane. It's a perfect Emma Stone performance, and if it had been given in any film type other than super-hero, more people would be talking about it. She is given a lot to do, playing a turbulent emotional teenager has never been done so well. And the chemistry between them, really does sizzle.<br/><br/>The villain, the Lizard. In my opinion, the design is a little off, but I can get over that. In human form Rhys Ifans is first class playing the slightly eccentric Curt Connors. However, if there is one true criticism of the film it's that Connors development seems rushed through all three acts, particularly in his relationship to Peter. They were supposed to be good friends but there connection seems weak and at times, forced. . Who else have we got? Oooh, The Illusive Man himself Martin Sheen playing Uncle Ben. It's a perfect bit of casting here, even if he is only in about two scenes, and managed to inexplicably pull the out-of-his-league Sally Field.<br/><br/>From a directorial standpoint this is Marc Webb showing the world what he can do with a budget. He's pulled a fast one here, he has made a teenage rom-com but wrapped it in $300million dollars worth of special effects and spandex. Case and point, the discovery of his powers. As soon as he asks Gwen out, he feels all kinds of confident, and that really comes across, giving him the courage (cockiness?) to leap off buildings. Looking back at Raimi's Spiderman, it lacked this basic human connection and feels a little forced. Unfortunately, a couple of all too cheesy scenes occasionally snaps you out of the perfectly crafted realism, something I think could have been avoided.<br/><br/>The music is truly awesome; blending the high octane stuff (but never over the top) with the lovey-dovey stuff and a bit of twinkly piano music for the lighter bits makes it the cleverest score of the year so far. The special effects are second to none and if there was a film that was designed for 3D it's this one - if you've been on the Spiderman ride at Universal studios you'll know what I mean. It feels like you're really there with him slinging through the city. The action, while good, isn't as good as Spiderman 2. Some of the Lizard fights are a lot of fun, but I can remember Spiderman fighting Doc Ock on the above ground Subway line and it still gives me goosebumps.<br/><br/>While everyone was critical when this film was announced, I think they have all been silenced now. This film was everything a reboot should be, showing the original how it should have gone about it. With two perfectly cast leads (both with enormous futures) and a great director this is definitely not one to miss. Unfortunately this means that with a trilogy announced under the guidance of Sony, we won't see Spiderman in the Avengers for quite some time (but I sneakily liked this more, so I don't care)."
"dfle3","7","1","3","24 July 2012"," The untold story begins...again...
","When I walked out of the theatre after seeing this movie, I saw the poster for it, which had the tagline ""The untold story begins""...to which the appropriate response is: ""Again?"". In another ten years they could again have another origin story for Spider-Man and use the same tagline again.<br/><br/>I'm not that familiar with Spiderman lore, but I did read recently that this origin story is more in keeping with one of the comic book iterations of this story...perhaps the first comic book series? So, basically, it's a tweaking of the Tobey Maguire incarnation as the hero. Someone on the internet did call me an idiot many years ago for saying that I saw a Spiderman movie in the cinema where the hero, Peter Parker, gained his powers by a bite from a radioactive spider. That person just didn't believe that I saw this. In any case, genetic engineering is more 'current' in our society, so bites from radioactive spiders is out.<br/><br/>Can't say that I remember, but I probably liked Tobey Maguire's turn as Spider-Man better. Perhaps if I'd seen this current version first, the situation would be reversed. In any case, Andrew Garfield is very good in the role of Peter Parker/Spider-Man...but he did strike me as having a very Tobey Maguire type of vibe to his performance. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy is also good in her role as Peter Parker's love interest. And, again, she is very reminiscent of Kirsten Dunst in her role as another love interest for Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man (a different character though...hence why this origin story is slightly different to Tobey Maguire's version). One annoying thing about this movie is the piling on of coincidence after coincidence as far as how some characters keep popping up in places where they are likely to meet Peter Parker...or indeed for having a relationship to people Peter Parker/Spider-Man has 'conflict' with.<br/><br/>My biggest bugbear is the ancient cliché of the superhero displaying extraordinary powers in a sporting context. I'm Australian, so basketball or gridiron holds no interest for me. So, it's just so face-palming to see Peter Parker excel in those sports. No doubt it's aimed at the younger demographic for this movie...providing the lesson that yes, boys, you too can become an athletic superstar...with a little help from superpowers...and genetic engineering...and anabolic steroids too? This awful cliché reached its nadir in ""Bionic showdown"" where an American human/machine hybrid won a gold medal at the Olympics...yuh...no cheating there, sir!<br/><br/>The end of this movie does have a narrative hook to keep you watching sequels but I'm not sure that that will be enough to make me fork out to see it. Denis Leary as a prominent policeman in this movie was good for laughs and would have been a welcome return for any sequel.<br/><br/>A solid movie but the similarities to the Tobey Maguire incarnation are too fresh for me to get that much out of the movie...not sure, but I may have bailed on the Maguire franchise after the first sequel...these kinds of movies tend to peter out, interest wise, pretty quickly. For those new to the franchise, it's a likable origin story with some good casting and acting."
"manasgoswami60","8","1","3","21 July 2012"," Good Movie
","It's a very good movie. 3d projection is very much perfect. But it'll be better if story line finished properly. such as we can't see Irfan Khan after hanging from bridge. If you are just looking for blockbusting action and fight scenes from start to finish then no, this movie will probably not deliver for you. However if, as a fan of comic books, you are just as interested in the lives and the motivation of both the heroes and the villains and seeing them have to deal with the same emotional issues that you do, no comic book movie has done it better. Most action scenes were non-thrilling. In a scene where Spiderman rescues a boy from a falling and burning car, he wastes almost 5 minutes trying to convince Jack (the boy) to be brave, climb up and hold his hand. He even gives the boy his mask, but the boy doesn't follow him. So in the end he has to throw his spider-thread to pull Jack up. However, such interesting character development unfortunately does not hold together perfectly with the action. Of course, Spider-Man is foremost a movie that has to entertain; yet the cocky web-slinging CGI hero seems too unlike Garfield's brooding Peter Parker. The quality of the special effects is largely inconsistent, with POV scenes of Spider- Man diving around the city impressing greatly, whilst his actual battles with The Lizard are considerably less ambitious. The weighty retelling of Parker's familiar back-story also means that during the denouement several large plot points, which could have expanded the action, are left undeveloped – and so the ending is a little too simple and unsatisfactory.<br/><br/>Webb has successfully addressed the new demand for superhero movies to be deeper and more human; yet he is not a director adept at providing big-budget action to an audience in the same way as Joss Whedon or Christopher Nolan. The Amazing Spider-Man is therefore the sum of two films, a satisfactory coming-of-age movie and a not challenging action film. Unfortunately, Webb is not strong enough to convincingly hold the two together."
"jsbfacebook97","7","1","3","20 July 2012"," Truly AMAZING
","The Amazing Spiderman was in fact amazing and i would recommend it to any one. However, the normal ""Spider-Man"" and ""Spider-Man 2"" were better. It's much different than other Marvel movies because Peter Parker is no billionaire or Playboy, he is a normal high school ""nerd"". One of the major flaws in the film was that the beginning 15-30 minutes went by very, very slow, but once the movie actually got captivating, it was fine. The main reason for the slowness is because the film had to take the viewers once again through the process of how Peter got his powers. If you haven't seen any of the other Spiderman films, this wouldn't affect you, but if you have, this could seem very laborious. About halfway through the movie, Spiderman had captured my heart and I found my self rooting for him the rest of the way through. Overall, I give Spiderman a 7 out of 10.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, Stan Lee once again makes a cameo and it is pretty funny."
"alexblume","7","1","3","19 July 2012"," Good, not great.
","The Amazing Spider-Man is definitely the best Spider-man movie thus far. The casting and acting is much much better in this one than the others. Martin Sheen does a fantastic job in his limited role as Uncle Ben specifically and pretty much everyone else does a better job with their roles in this film. The story is better than the original and is intense in places. <br/><br/>However, this movie has nothing out of the ordinary at all. Pretty much everything in the film can be expected. I walked into this film expecting a great film, but I got a good one. The story line and plot devices are very ordinary and nothing unexpected from the audience. Much of the story line is very similar to the story in the first film. There are just small things that are better in this film. I expected better but it was still good."
"LaserLion","7","1","3","19 July 2012"," Liked it a lot
","The Amazing Spider-Man has a depth to it's romance the previous installments did not. The grittier approach suits the web-slinger well! Both Webb's gritt and Raimi's triumphant day-time-hero works, Spidey goes both ways. There are three scenes in particular where the cut-away is sloppy and feels like a time lapse, but that's a personal nitpick and I suspect most viewers won't even notice. I look forward to future installments with great fanfare.<br/><br/>I am in love with Gwen Stacey. <br/><br/>Spider-Man may be the most cinematically inclined of all Marvel properties."

","Every fan of Spider-Man, Andrew Garfield, Marc Webb should go and see the movie.""The Amazing Spider-Man"" when you see it as a reboot of a previous Spider-Man film franchise which was a hit, everyone expects more from this movie.Marc Webb has done a great job in retelling the story of Peter Parker but has not done a great job in using the 3D effects to its fullest. Andrew Garfield has done an amazing job as an actor in the movie. He is in many ways a more convincing Peter Parker/Spider-Man than Toby Maguire. But has not been able bring the innocence of Peter Parker to the big screen as was done by Toby Maguire.Marc Webb could have made it a better movie had he emphasized more scenes of Peter Parker realizing his responsibility as Spider-Man,New York city's opinion about Spider-Man's action as a vigilante,more 3D effects.Chemistry between Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield is excellently portrayed.It is a good movie to watch but cannot be compared to previous Spider-Man franchise in terms of direction."
"NotoriousYDW","8","1","3","15 July 2012"," A darker version of Spider-man !
","I saw this movie in theaters last night and overall enjoyed it. You could wonder whats the point of rebooting a franchise only 10 years old, but when it delivers in the end, you won't hear me complain. <br/><br/>First of, I liked the 3 previous Raimi movies, so with the new one coming so fast it's impossible not to compare them with each other. The first thing I noticed was the darker, more serious tone that was set from the beginning. It's like Marc Webb is going more in the direction of the new Batman movies, witch isn't a bad thing of course. Although I liked Tobey Maguire as Spider-man, I always thought he was a little to soft to play a hero. Andrew Garfield for me seems more fit for the role. He plays a more mature Peter Parker, which fits with the darker tone of the new movie. The special effects were also definitely the best of the series. However I felt that some key moments that makes Peter Parker become Spider-man, were a little bit rushed. It also left me open for some answers in the ending, but with probably a sequel coming the next years, they will be explained. There was some good humor in it to that had me laughing a couple of times. <br/><br/>So overall: A darker tone, good humor, best CGI of the series, a good story with some minor flaws. There is really no reason for me to not like this movie. I would hold it on par with the first 2 Raimi movies. Looking forward to the future!"

"seaview1","8","1","3","14 July 2012"," The Amazing Spider-Man Re-Tingles the Franchise
","For the past decade, Marvel Comics has been churning out film versions of its iconic super heroes, but in this case, Spiderman, only a decade before, had been rendered successfully by director Sam Raimi. Well, a poor third film meant a re-imagining of the franchise, and as The Hulk and Batman series have shown, studios are willing to try to reclaim a tentpole blockbuster. The risk can be a marginal failure as in Superman Returns. Not so here. With well cast leads and strong supporting roles, The Amazing Spider-Man is quite entertaining especially toward the end, and it displays emotional resonance that enhances its storyline.<br/><br/>Young Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) lives with his Aunt May (Sally Field) and Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) after his parents abandoned him as a child. Now an awkward, bullied high school student, he has a crush on cute blonde, Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), who has an authoritarian father (Denis Leary). Upon discovering his dad's old files, Peter seeks out his father's former colleague, Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans), who is researching the regenerative, healing capabilities of reptiles in his lab at Oscorp. Parker snoops around the lab and gets bitten by a genetically enhanced spider, and soon he begins to develop superhuman strength, agility, reflexes, and the ability to crawl on walls as well as shoot a powerful web. His self absorption sets in motion events that will exact personal loss. Guilt stricken, he becomes a masked avenger, catching criminals much to the chagrin of the police who think he is a vigilante. Meanwhile, a desperate Connors is forced to test a serum on himself which transforms him into the Lizard who menaces the city streets and threatens to infect the entire population with the chemical. As Spiderman confronts The Lizard in a grand battle, the fate of the city including Gwen hangs in the balance.<br/><br/>How does this compare to the previous Spiderman? It's nearly as good but with a different take and still retains the essential ingredients that made the former film a standout. The film always keeps the focus on the relationships between Peter and Gwen and Peter and his family. Those grounded bonds form the soul of the film and make the film a more enriching experience. There is no Mary Jane Watson or J. Jonah Jameson yet.<br/><br/>The filmmakers, director Marc Webb (500 Days of Summer) and screenwriters James Vanderbilt (Zodiac), Alvin Sargent (Ordinary People), and Steve Kloves (Harry Potter series) made the smart choice of starting with a younger version of Peter Parker, perfectly embodied by Garfield, whose adolescence and psychology are part of a fully realized character. Garfield and Stone make an adorable couple and display good chemistry that is endearing. Fields and Sheen are quite effective as Peter's guardians and the screen lights up whenever they appear. Leary, proving he can do drama as well as comedy, makes the most of his role as Stacy's dad who is a police captain in conflict over the rogue Spiderman. Marvel legend Stan ""the Man"" Lee has another amusing cameo.<br/><br/>Although bereft with open ended plot points by film's end (likely to be resolved in future sequels), there are a couple of nice touches that lift this film above most standard comic book adaptations. In one particularly affecting scene, a construction worker rallies a team of crane operators to assist Spiderman, whose earlier courageous act now pays timely dividends. During the rousing climax, Spiderman is rescued when an unlikely savior intercedes. Even Connors' Lizard is not your stereotypic villain and figures in a surprising and unexpected act at film's end.<br/><br/>Special effects were pretty good in the older Spiderman, but they are even better here especially in the trademark web swinging between skyscrapers. If the musical score sounds like a cross between A Beautiful Mind and Aliens, it's because James Horner does the honors on each film.<br/><br/>Despite the odds, what is 'amazing' is that lightning has struck twice for the franchise. The Amazing Spider-Man is a familiar yet refreshing take on a formula that works quite well here. And yes, stay for the end credits which reveal a teaser for the next film."

","For those of you interested in what this film is like and how the makers managed with this restart:<br/><br/>It's not as good as Sam Raimi's version, this film reminds you of the strengths of his film rather than erasing your memory. I was a fan of the first film and it's two sequels but was willing to see where this one was going and what it could bring to the popular comic-book superhero, on the plus side the acting is good and the visuals have a sort of realism which is enjoyable, the way Spiderman moves and the acrobatic dynamism is exciting and well-executed. On the down-side the film is emotionally misjudged veering from almost excessive emoting of tragic events to flippant instant recovery, basically it comes across as shallow and insincere, maybe this is clumsiness or editing. Also the action scenes are a bit confusing, sometimes you wonder if you blinked and missed something like on the bridge sequence (not a spoiler, there is a bridge sequence like in Raimi's Spiderman but I'm not saying what happens!)<br/><br/>It's worth seeing this film but not worth rushing to see it with high expectations, I expect that the tone is marketed towards young male demographic which it will please, but this is not good enough to be called a classic which Raimi's is."
"seularts","6","1","3","10 July 2012"," Nice, but no!
","I agree this is a nice movie, but why in God's name would you remake for the 1000 time the same story. It would have been nice to continue where they left off last time. Sure this is how the first films and any other movie with 'Spiderman' should have looked like, but don't go with the same story line from the beginning, especially since this is not even the original.<br/><br/>Except for the nice special effects and an OK acting, the rest of the movie is just predictable and kind of boring, especially if you know the animated series. Nothing too new happens and it just adds one of the 10's of villains in Spiderman."
"EmmaDinkins","7","1","3","9 July 2012"," Chix Chat on Film Review: A Spiders tale respun.
","I still contend that it was too soon to reset the series, however The Amazing Spiderman was not too bad. The biggest problem for me was that the other actors who portrayed the key characters so recently were still very fresh in my mind. I did like that this Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) brought a heightened level of masculinity to the role or at least as much as could be expected for a man swinging through the city in red and blue tights with his junk on prominent display. So this time around the protagonist that Spiderman must square off against is Dr. Curt Conners (Rhys Ifans) who is pretty much an enigma the entire film, there are hints that he may have played a part in the death of Peters parents, there are hints that he is involved in some unscrupulous dealings within Oscorp, but nothing is ever clearly defined. Not even the basis of his greatest loss, which was his motivation for the research that led him to the genesis of the Lizard. Speaking of which, why did the Lizard remind me of Venon from the last Spiderman (Tobey Maguire)? I know he had scales and a tail, but he sure looked a lot like the same special effect. The story of Peter Parker and his encounter with a radio-active or genetically altered spider is consistently the basis of the transformation into Spiderman, even with his acclimation to his new abilities taking place very rapidly it still seemed tedious since it all just played out not so long ago. What I found to border on the ridiculous though was how easily Peter gained access to the spiders. A state of the art lab with state of the art technology and security would not have an area with potentially dangerous specimens so unattended, still it all just seemed too familiar. Same old same Aunt May (Sally Field) and Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) solid pillars of the earth and nothing special. I will say that I enjoyed the romance that played out between Peter and Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) as it seemed very organic, fresh and genuine. Obviously, there will be sequels, but now I have Mr. Garfield in my mind overlaying my visualization of Mr. Maguire as Spidey. If the sequel is fresh and has some new discovery for Peter in store, like really utilizing his 'spidey senses' then I may be a bit more enthusiastic about hitting the theater to check it out. As it stands 'been there, done that' so it gets an amber light."

I loved the first Tobey movies but they regressed as a trilogy.<br/><br/>I loved it how Spiderman was vigilant and on edge in this movie! It was great that Peter Parker and Spiderman did not come across as two different people! The two were differential in a way!<br/><br/>It was not an action packed movie which is good.

"steves1777","7","1","3","7 July 2012"," Very enjoyable revision
","I am a fan of the Tobey Maguire series - even SM 3 - and the casting and performances in those three films were great. It would not be fair to compare this version with those as it takes a different approach. The TM series has not really aged long enough for a remake, but hey, they didn't ask my permission and box office results proves them right.<br/><br/>Casting was good with Hollywood dredging up old-timers (Sally & Martin) for the Aunt Mae and Uncle Ben roles. This was distracting to me, but young audiences will be immune to the Flying Nun or faux POTUS. Denis Leary played his stereotypical NY service sector role well. Spiderman was played adequately but I was not overly drawn to this portrayal. Emma Stone is always excellent - see The Help, Easy A, and SuperBad to enjoy other performances by ES. Except for some wardrobe eccentricities (Japanese schoolgirl outfit is a bizarre choice in the scene where she tours interns around OsCorp), she delivered a highly watchable performance. Although similar to her high school student character in Easy A, it was very appropriate.<br/><br/>The plot deviated significantly from the classical (i.e., original comic book storyline), but was nonetheless satisfactory. It tied-in well with the super-villain character evolution as a genetic mutation. The emotional versus excitement ratio was erratic for my tastes. For example, Peter is awkwardly presented as intelligent when Gwen Stacy tells Dr. Connors he is smart, but this has no prior support until he starts building Spiderman gadgetry and reading genetics textbooks. By the way, since when do film loaded cameras appear in the same movie as cell phones? His relationship with Eugene, the bully, is intense when he is pummeled by him in the schoolyard yet with little explanation, it becomes quite friendly. His pursuit of Uncle Ben's murderer is not really believable and seems half-hearted at times. The culprit is described as having a 'star tattoo on his left hand' but it is actually his wrist or forearm and correctly envisioned by Spiderman during his hunt. Okay, let's call this a dialogue blooper.<br/><br/>Another blooper is when Spiderman's skateboard gets broken in half and he hands part of it to Aunt Mae only to have him carrying it intact in the following scene - it's a non-descript ratty skateboard with some criss-cross white lines underneath, but I suppose he could have a stash of similar skateboards in his closet (NOT!). Bloopers are fun after all and get a movie blog time so the suspicious side of me says they're often intentional. His antique camera also makes several miraculous recoveries.<br/><br/>One word about the audience. A lot of people brought very young kids to see this film. I'm not talking about a single five-year-old. There were at least two dozen two's, three's, and four's and one guy repeatedly took his one-year-old out of the theater. I'm not complaining about them making noise or bad behavior and in fact they were not disruptive, but it is rated PG-13, not PG, not G. A kid-filled group for movies like Brave enhance the experience, but seeing these youngsters was off-putting.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd recommend this for everyone over 10. Watch the Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst movies before the DVD is released."
"cat_ranchero","7","1","3","7 July 2012"," Worth a look?...
","I found it quite hard to look at this film without drawing parallels with Sam Raimi's 2002 film Spider-Man. The two are very similar in many ways although this one did try to stay a little more grounded. As far as performances go, well everyone did a decent job; Andrew Garfield coped well with the dual role of Spider-Man and Peter Parker and Emma Stone did a decent job as Gwen Stacey. I thought Rhys Ifans did a very decent job as The Lizard/Dr. Curt Connors and Denis Leary was fine as the cop Captain Stacey (Gwen's dad). But I must give a special mention for Martin Sheen as Uncle Ben and Sally Field as Aunt May; a masterful piece of casting; both were perfect (IMO).<br/><br/>Comparing the two films (it's hard not to), I felt that this one didn't really add anything that the original did. Yes, it's a slightly different take on it, but essentially the same. There are long periods spent setting up dramatic plot points that don't always pay off and I also felt it was far too long. The CGI is all very well done and the fight sequences are also well executed but I did have the nagging feeling I had seen it all before. Don't get me wrong, it's a good film, but (IMO) not different enough from Sam Raimi's effort to be a great film. Even soÂ… Recommended, especially if you haven't seen the original 2002 movie.<br/><br/>My score: 6.8/10<br/><br/>IMDb Score: 7.8/10 (based on 29,271 votes at the time of going to press).<br/><br/>MetaScore: 66/100: (Based on 42 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com at the time of going to press).<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 72/100 (based on 228 reviews counted at the time of going to press).<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 84/100 'Liked it' (based on 291,053 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).<br/><br/>You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster."
"in_shahieras_prince","6","1","3","6 July 2012"," The other alternate version of Spiderman, okay!
","The Amazing Spiderman - I am seriously don't know what to expect from it. It certainly a different perspective of the previous version of Spiderman, though the storyline and some part of the tragedy points were exactly the same. Thinking as one modern guy watching for scientific approach, this one surely much better and logical than the Tobey McGuire's version. One of the most 'thumb-up-ed' element within it was the casting. It was good to keep on watching Mr. McGuire as the pathetic, hidden hero of Peter Parker, but putting Andrew Garfield (Eduardo Saverin of The Social Network) to Parker's face really made it different, and better version of Peter Parker. Even the heroic girlfriend of Parker from Mary Jane Watson (of Kirsten Dunst) to Gwen Stacy (of Emma Stone) was another great turned out version of this movie. Top of all that, I was excited for Aunty May's casting by Sally Field (known for her role as supermom, Nora Walker in Brothers and Sisters), as she really did charmed me for her character in the movie. She was destined for that role, and touched us all by it. Some other characters, such Flash Thompson (Chris Zylka) also keep this one alternately special than the previous one. I guess, even with such a same storyline, The Amazing Spiderman creates its own name for it. Refreshing and variant. I could say, technically it was good, including the actions and the effect stuffs. Except for one to the other shots, the CGI technique was too obvious, added to its some technical goofs that can easily discovered at a glance, such when Dr. Conners becomes the lizard, he becomes far more massive than his human state, shredding his clothes - logically, this should leave him naked. Yet after his first transformation, he is seen in the sewer with a towel/robe on his body. Also, for some plots approaching to the end of the climax, the scenic story of everyone trying to help Spiderman overcoming the evil Lizard by crane, helicopter and even traffic staffs was too much and overdoing. It seems to get itself a continuity later on, but I can't say that I am excited for the sequel, though I prefer this version much better than the other three. I think 3 is fairly enough."
"arnieiam","7","1","3","5 July 2012"," There will be mixed reviews
","I guess the best way going about this is by comparing this one to the 2002 film. After watching this film I can confirm that Raimi's semi campy version is marginally better. For the record I'm saying that Raimi's version wins by split decision, sort of.<br/><br/>First of all, it's quite surprising that the 2002 film is more faithful to the source material than this one. Don't let the artificial web shooters in this film mislead you, it strays from it afterward.<br/><br/>They had to redo the origin story in this one as well as add other elements to it which really start to make certain plot points incredibly forced. We didn't need to see another origin story, they could've done it like The Incredible Hulk where it's presented in fragments. Nope instead you end up with this poorly paced film with these subplots that never resolve, unnecessary sequences (skateboard) and a huge amount of suspension of disbelief (bending a field goal post and still no one suspects Parker is Spidey?!). Uncle Ben's death in this film was more contrived here, and it doesn't resonate as much as it did in the original.<br/><br/>What's really good though is that Andrew Garfield is a way better Peter Parker than Tobey Maguire. He was portrayed excellently in this one. Showing that he is very crafty, inventive, productive and reclusive at times. And Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy was so much better than Bring It On as Mary Jane. Gwen isn't just some damsel in distress, she is a very useful character. That is where the film gets huge plus points. They have really good chemistry and their romance is genuine and not tiresome.<br/><br/>However the Raimi films (first two) dominate in the villain department. And I know what your thinking: the Green Goblin in that ridiculous suit?! That's better than the Lizard?! Yes. Ignore the get up and actually observe the dynamic between the villain and Spidey in each film. They have a sense of humanity, you really get to care for them when they die. This film really had a good opportunity with the Lizard by portraying him as someone struggling with a Jekyl/Hyde syndrome, just like the comics. Instead both personalities are just insane and with no shred of humanity. So much for staying faithful.<br/><br/>Some reviewers say that this version is darker and 2002 is very light hearted to which I say: the 2002 version has a bigger body count first of all and Danny Elfman did the music.<br/><br/>I'll end this user review on a positive note. Like I said I have mixed feelings for this one. So I have to name the rest of the stuff I liked. The effects were much better here. The Mirror's Edge like sequences rocked. And I really liked the scene where he's in the sewer and he makes a web to detect vibrations like a real spider does.<br/><br/>Go watch it, you'll either love it or hate it. Luckily I'm sort of a tweener."

","It had a great plot and great fight scenes. Overall it was all good but I felt it was rushed. Not the making of the movie but the actual movie Peter first talks to Gwen tells her he's spider-man is one example. I like the different spin on things and the change in the girl for spider-man. I think Andrew Garfield did a fantastic job as well as Emma Stone. I like the ending it kept spider-man how it should be. The overall film and spider-man himself were both very good at keeping it serious with action as well as a adding a good amount of humor in the mix of it all. The new enemy was also very clever and having him tied in with oscorp. If you stayed after the credits and saw what looked like a hint at a sequel like me I am looking forward to it. Besides that I thought it was definitely worth watching."
"khfan250","7","1","3","3 July 2012"," Amazing? Not Really. A Solid Comic Book Movie? Yes!
","I've always been a huge fan of Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man"" trilogy (yes, even the third one), but after watching them again, they aren't exactly the great movies I remember them being. True, they are a lot of fun and did address the dilemmas of being a superhero, but, face facts, folks: they are very corny and very silly. And this re-boot, though I think it came out a little too soon, manages to capture that spirit and energy that the first trilogy had, as well as improve upon the mistakes of the previous movies.<br/><br/>Even though I liked the earlier movies, I never liked Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. As Parker, he certainly played up the part of being socially awkward, but, even after he got bit by the spider, he still stayed in that phase of acting. There was no variation, no passion in him that made me want to get invested in him. Andrew Garfield is very much the superior performance here. There are some aspects in his acting that seem very Haden Christensen- esque, but he is very likable and very funny. I found myself rooting for this Spidey more in this single movie than I did at all in the previous trilogy!<br/><br/>The supporting cast is much better as well, for the most part. Gwen Stacy played by Emma Stone is very cute but wasn't afraid to get her hands dirty. In the original trilogy, I always got tired of Kirsten Dunst's Mary-Jane screaming and hollering until Spidey came to the rescue. Here, Gwen Stacy still needed to be saved, but she was quite capable of defending herself when she needed to. We also have Denis Leary as the tough, no-nonsense Cpt. Stacy and Martin Sheen and Sally Field being very likable and supportive in their respective roles.<br/><br/>Now a common complaint from a lot of people is the villain, Dr. Curt Connors/The Lizard. I have to disagree, but not for the reasons you may think. I think Rhys Ifans did a great job as Connors, making him very likable and complex, which makes you all the more heartbroken when this travesty befalls him. I'm also glad that The Lizard did talk instead just being a huge, grunting, CGI mess. But, like everyone, I'm not a fan of his design and he doest hold a candle to the villains from the first two movies.<br/><br/>There are also some problems with the movie. In the trailers, we were promised answers to ""The Untold Story""; we were meant to know what happened to Peter's parents. And what do we learn from this plot point? Nothing! I guess that means that they'll save the answers for a sequel, but they could of at least given us some clues as to what's to unfold.<br/><br/>The action scenes, while good, seem much less cinematic and sweeping than the first trilogy. There was this sense of wonder and atmosphere that they captured and, try as I might, I just didn't get that from this movie. Still, the action is decent.<br/><br/>Final verdict: Anyone who's fresh off ""The Avengers"" and is still awaiting ""The Dark Knight Rises"" should definitely check out this flick. Die-hard fans of the Raimi movies probably won't enjoy it, but if you're a comic book geek or an action movie fan, this should definitely quench your summer movie season thirst."
"byrann_gowan","8","3","18","4 July 2012"," Better than Spiderman 3, not as good as Spiderman 2, on par with Spiderman
","The story of this superhero movie is that Peter Parker is struggling in his life. He's the punching bag for Flash, the bully at school, and he's trying to figure out why his parents left him so many years ago. After he gets bitten by a spider (go figure), he starts to develop powers, which puts him on a collision course with Dr. Curt Conners' alter ego, the Lizard.<br/><br/>First off, let me say that this movie is a huge step up from Spiderman 3. I know that this is a reboot and really isn't a part of the Sam Raimi trilogy, but let me tell you that this movie is on par with the one from 2002. That's how good it is.<br/><br/>Next, I'm going to say that it's about time that we had the Lizard as the villain. We've already seen two films where Dr. Connors plays a supporting role, so it's great to see him as a main character to the movie, and Rhys Ifans plays him well.<br/><br/>Speaking of Ifans, he, along with Garfield, Stone, Leary, Sheen, and Fields all deliver terrific performances. Sally Fields plays Aunt May, the protective Aunt who worries about Peter when he's out late. Then there's Martin Sheen as Uncle Ben, who provides many words of wisdom for Peter that really echo Peter's destiny as a hero. Emma Stone plays Gwen Stacy, the love interest of Peter/Spiderman, while her father is played by Dennis Leary, who is great as always. As mentioned above, Rhys Ifans is a great Lizard, but if anyone steals the show, it's obviously Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker/Spiderman. He seemed to be comfortable in balancing Peter the insecure nerd and Spiderman the loudmouthed crime-fighter, which is a good thing.<br/><br/>Overall, a job well done to everyone. It doesn't quite hit the heights of Spiderman 2, but it is enough to say that the franchise has been rebooted and it's in safe hands. A 9/10 for me."

","After watching all the previous Spider-Man movies, I had doubts with regards to this movie but it was worth the watch. It shines on its own and it is a nice start if they want to continue making sequels. Nice CG, Nice acting and nice story. The fight scenes are uniquely done. Andrew Garfield is also a very good pick for Peter Parker. Kudos also to Emma Stone. Spider-Man 1 and 2 were very great. Especially because it seems lively and it tackles the day to day problem of Peter Parker. This movie is not lively though. It is dark. The Spider-Man here fights smartly and uses his environment more. Although I liked the old costume more and that the Peter Parker here seemed like a troubled teen.. this really was a nice watch.:)"

","James Bond, Batman - and now 'The Amazing Spider-Man'. Another movie- series overhauled and, as was the case with the first new Bond an Batman, very well done. The first half of the movie is reserved for Peter Parker's character-development; the Highschool-outsider, accidentally developing super-powers and wondering what to do with them is comprehensibly presented up to the turning point of uncle Ben's death. Here two important things happen: First of all, Peter Parker starts to realize that he is a part of the world, that he must not waste his abilities but use them for 'the good'. Whatever that maybe: As he is to find out a little later, it is not so easy to do the right thing. This challenge to find his way is the movie's central topic and it gets turned over and over, being presented from different angles; Parker has to find his way as a person with special powers (does he want to be a 'hero'?), as a young guy in Highschool - and in love - and, simple as it seems, in as well as under the city of New York. Back to the turning- point: The second thing that happens here is a shift of focus. The movie from here onwards looks a little less into Parker's character and lays more weight on the typical action- and love-story-elements. Those are solidly done, but they are not as amazing as the first half. Sure, it is great to see Spider-Man swing through the streets of New York in 3d, but it isn't something that'll blow your socks off. The same holds true for the tragic elements that are an integral part of the story: When uncle Ben dies, you can feel Peter Parker's pain as well as the lesson he is learning. But in the end, when it comes to the love-story, he is not quite learning something. Maybe he doesn't have to. It sure feels good to see Gwen Stacy smile in the end. But it is a scene that is solidly Hollywood: Good, very good - but not amazing."
"katiekeane87","2","2","12","29 October 2013"," Too much romance ...not enough action
","I think my summary says it all. Watchable but certainly not the performance Tobey Maguire gave. The castings bad. Emma Stone comes off way too savvy. Andrew Garfield comes off as drippy rather than the classic geek that Peter Parker is in the comics. Martin Sheen & Sally Field do not portray elderly and vulnerable at all. If this film happens to be showng on TV, its worth a watch. Do not spend your money if you was a fan of the 1st 3 movies. You WILL be disappointed. Saying that, I will be watching the next instalment as I normally love the comic book genre films that are getting serious big screen time at the minute.

","I will not go so far as to say this is one of the worst films I ever saw, or even the worst (""Howard The Duck""), but if you are a ""Spider-Man fan, you know that this story is not canon. Lets start here: Spoilers ahead: When Captain Stacy died (Amazing Spider-Man 91), it was after a battle with Doctor Octopus (Doc Ock), not the Lizard as was shown here. In fact, Stacy was much older then Denis Leary in the comic. Next, Gwen despised Spider-Man (Particularly after 91), in fact it led to the multi-armed armed Spider-Man (Peter Parker wanted to lose his powers). The Lizard did not look like the Lizard (No scales), and Norman Osborn is made to look like he was responsible for the death of Peter's parents. Osborn/Green Goblin, is responsible for a lot of things including the death of Gwen in Amazing Spider-Man 121, but not that. Nor was he aware of who was Spider-Man until much later. Here he is basically set up to be like ""Blofeld"" from James Bond, whose identity is a mystery until later on. Martin Sheen & Sally Field where far too young to be Aunt May & Uncle Ben, and even why Uncle Ben died (In Amazing Fantasy 15 (The first Spider-Man) it goes to the inability for Pete to collect money from wrestling because the check was made out to Spider-Man). The Special Effects were very good, which prevented me from giving it one or no stars, so I give it a generous 2 stars."

Emma stone's character tries to be more than a screaming damsel in distress and pulls it off to some extent but really just because she doesn't shout as much as mary jane doesn't make her much of an improvement.<br/><br/>The plot is full of holes im sure the writers aren't gonna fill in the sequels.Esp the role of the parents. I mean why? Just for a freakin formula? And the Lizard.Why turn into a lizard and go to the Oscorp building when you can just go there as a normal human being and set the Machine thingy off? And turning from mentor to evil to inexplicably good in the climax? Doc Ock rip-off anyone?<br/><br/>From the chick's villain father to the preachy uncle this movie is full of Stereotypical melodrama. And 7.3 for this movie? Some fanboys need to get a life."
"generationofswine","2","2","12","4 November 2012"," Too Dark
","Don't let the title fool you, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" isn't as dark as the Batman movies, but still, it's too dark for Spider-Man. The first three had it right, Spider-Man is supposed to be lighthearted fun, a story about a nerd that has to make wise cracks to keep his sanity in the super hero game. Even as an adult he's still a nerd and still hasn't exactly grown up.<br/><br/>At least this keeps the nerd element. But most of the action is dark, again, too dark for the source material. And his teenaged years, they kept the nerd, but tried too hard to make you feel his inner pain. It's one thing to try to make the audience feel sorry for Peter Parker, but it just feel wrong to turn the story as much into a drama as they did.<br/><br/>There's nothing campy about this, and what humor there is falls short.<br/><br/>It was too soon for a reboot, and this one is lacking, they turned the Spider-Man story into something it isn't and as a result it's too hard for the awkward comic book loving dork to really identify with the character."

","I watched this tonight and I was one of those who was not skeptical of a spiderman reboot. Being a huge fan of spiderman, i was eager to see what Webb had to offer and he delivers a spiderman which has so much more substance than Raimis version.<br/><br/>One of the best things about this film is the fact that the spiderman stunts were done with wires and as little cg as possible and it has paid off because it looks authentic and believable! The fight scenes are very good and really shows how agile spiderman is. In Raimi's spiderman, i think it lacks this quality. Also Webb made sure that this incarnation of spiderman cracks a few jokes just like its comic counterpart. <br/><br/>Webb also does a great job with the character development. The chemistry between Parker and Stacy is great and the acting from Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone is brilliant. I really enjoyed Garfield as Parker/spiderman. <br/><br/>Some issues i did have with the movie is that it has that ""mysterious"" plot line running through the film with peters parents which may just be something for future films but does niggle at you throughout the film and also some of the highschool scenes, although they were fun felt abit strange in the film as Webb does set a dark tone in the film which again distinguishes it from Raimi's version. <br/><br/>Positives: Great action scenes, great acting and characters Negatives: ""cryptic"" plot line in some places, pacing is good but some places are abit quick Overall: Definite must see, great movie and i think it is superior to Raimi's version."

","I admit I'm not familiar with the story of Spider-Man or the Spider-Man genre. Part of Spider-Man 3 filmed here, and it is amazing how many hundreds and hundreds of people are involved in filming a scene, and we did see how car crashes were accomplished.<br/><br/>That aside, I wasn't aware that there were two Spider-Man franchises, Spider-Man and the Amazing Spider-Man. It seems that The Amazing Spider-Man is loathed by people on this board.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield stars here as Peter Parker. He's a quiet kid, not a nerd, just a shy kid with a crush on Gwen (Emma Stone), but one who goes about his business. His aunt and uncle are played by Sally Field and Martin Sheen, both excellent. Peter's father (Campbell Scott) and mother leave the boy with the relatives while they disappear. We don't really know what happened to them, despite a newspaper story that says they were killed in a plane crash.<br/><br/>Peter is remarkably intelligent and, after finding his father's old research notes, meets his father's ex-partner, Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans). While nosing around Dr. Connors' lab, Peter becomes Spider-Man when he's bitten by a spider and turns his powers to vigilantism. While experimenting on himself, Dr. Connors goes a bit overboard and turns into a supermutant Lizard. He starts terrorizing New York. It's only a matter of time before Spider-Man and Connors meet.<br/><br/>I guess one franchise, comic books, and a Broadway show aren't enough for Spideyd -- there has to be a second franchise as well. The effects are fantastic, as one would expect, and the cast is good. Besides those mentioned above, Dennis Leary is on hand as the police chief and Gwen's father.<br/><br/>For what it was, it was entertaining. I'd be interested to see some of the Spider-Man franchise to compare the two."
"jimjo1216","Null","1","4","4 September 2013"," A new Spider-Man for a new generation
","A new Spider-Man for a new generation. This Peter Parker is a much more contemporary outcast, full of angst. No longer a bookish science nerd, Pete's a skateboard-riding introvert. And like all high school kids, he's got issues he's struggling with. Growing pains, personal stuff. He's moody, he's rebellious. This Peter Parker is meant to appeal to today's youth. He could be a friend or a classmate or a neighbor. He is a stand-in for every teenager who teethed on cell phones and grew up on the Internet.<br/><br/>Personally, I feel just a little too old for this interpretation, but the update probably keeps the character fresh for modern audiences. Sam Raimi's films are more traditional adaptations of the comics, while this is a cinematic re-imagining of the source material. The familiar ingredients are there (Uncle Ben, Aunt May, genetically-engineered spiders), it's just a matter of how they're used. Your miles may vary, but I wasn't quite in sync with director Marc Webb, although I could see what he was going for. The best thing about this movie is Emma Stone. The Lizard looks lame and some of the special effects look too fake. And the story isn't particularly gripping. But maybe I'm just too old."
"jafar-iqbal","6","1","4","23 August 2013"," The best Peter Parker, but not the best Spider-Man
","Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield), an extremely intelligent but awkward teenager, wants to find out why his parents disappeared when he was young. His search leads him to scientist Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans); but it also leads him to getting bitten by a mutant spider, turning him into the Spiderman.<br/><br/>I was never a big fan of the Sam Raimi-Tobey Maguire incarnation of Spider-Man, mainly because I'm not really a big fan of Maguire. So I was actually quite interested in this reboot, because I am a very big fan of Andrew Garfield, and I was interested to see what he could do.<br/><br/>What he did, in the end, was give what I think is the best portrayal of Peter Parker to date. His speech patterns, his physicality, his presence on screen; everything about Garfield's performance was exactly how I imagined Peter Parker to be. And, coincidentally, Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy was also near-perfect. It helps that the two are a couple in real life, bringing their off-screen chemistry to their on-screen romance. It's very well done.<br/><br/>And yet, despite two fantastic lead performances, this wasn't a very good movie. It was just okay. I found myself being bored for large parts of the movie, which you can't say very often for most Marvel movies. Part of the problem is that the villains don't hold up their end of the deal. Rhys Ifans is a very good actor, but I never felt a threat from The Lizard, as though this was a terrible danger for Spider-Man. Sure, the visuals are good, but that's not really enough. It also seemed like parts of the story had either been cut or shortened, certain sequences feeling rushed and undeveloped.<br/><br/>Like all comic-book movies, there are the nods to the past, and that is always fun. And you have cameos from stalwarts like Martin Sheen, Sally Field and even Stan Lee himself, but it doesn't help the overall enjoyment of the movie. However, and maybe this is because of my appreciation for Garfield and Stone, but I'm willing to give them another chance. There is a sequel on its way, and I'm looking forward to it. I wouldn't say the movie was awful, because it was far from it. I just think it was somewhat below my expectations, and they now have one more chance to win me round."

","It's a new reboot of Spider-Man (Andrew Garfield). This time, the love interest is Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). There is a bit about his parents tying them to Peter's powers.<br/><br/>Marc Webb takes over the franchise. It's a surprising move but he does a good job. It's slightly less comical than Sam Raimi. Andrew Garfield is the same age as Tobey Maguire when he started, but Andrew looks much older. It's hard to imagine him as a high school nerd. Andrew looks his age which is 27-28 whereas Tobey always looks like a kid. Andrew really looks like one of the cool art kids with a guitar. Emma Stone is great as the love interest. Rhys Ifans is the villain but the problem is his CG avatar. He's a lizard and doesn't have much personality. Willem Dafoe as Green Goblin and Alfred Molina as Doc Ock are far superior villains than Rhys Ifans. So the franchise continues, but not a total revolution. Just new people. The constant rebooting may wear people out someday."
"joetufano719","5","1","4","12 August 2013"," Disappointing. Why do people love this one so much?
","I really don't understand why fans adore this film. The original Spider- Man trilogy had a chance to revamp itself after Spider-Man 3 but unfortunately that wasn't the case because of the reboot, which I wasn't supportive of to begin with. Though I saw a few previews on TV about a week before it came out so I decided to give it a chance. And even though I did like it on the first viewing, a part of me felt disappointed. And that's probably the best way to describe this movie: disappointing. <br/><br/>This movie is not without positives. The visuals have improved a great deal but it's been a decade so it's expected. Martin Sheen, Dennis Leary and Emma Stone I thought did very good with their roles and they were probably the only people in this movie that I was really interested in.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield is a great actor and I was really impressed with him in ""The Social Network"", but his version of Parker is nothing like his comic book counterpart. He looks way too handsome to be the biggest loser in the school and he's not very likable overall. Now I don't blame Andrew Garfield. He does his best with what he's given, and I believe he can do a really good Peter Parker if he was given the right character design and material. But nothing about this Peter Parker said underdog to me. Plus has no character arc. Unlike Spider-Man 1 and 2 where Tobey's Peter learns about responsibility and sacrificing what you want the most, this Peter Parker (not Andrew's fault though) doesn't get better. In the end he breaks a serious promise he made to a man who gave his life to save him, therefore putting Gwen in grave danger.<br/><br/>As for the relationship between Peter and Gwen, I didn't buy it. Emma and Andrew do have good chemistry with each other but it almost seemed way too easy for Peter to get Gwen's attention. This movie missed the point completely. The whole point of the Spider-Man lore is that he's trying to get the girl's attention, and it seemed like they were throwing themselves at each other from the start. They don't get to know one another, and they don't go out on a date. Why did they like each other? Because they do!<br/><br/>What's the Lizard's plan? Turn everybody in NYC into lizards! I'm not asking that he be a complex villain like the Joker or Bane, but at least make it somewhat convincing. But no, all the lizard wants to do is take over the world! In the comics, the Lizard was a normal, nice guy who desperately wanted to fix his severed limb. When the serum he uses turns him into the Lizard this gives Spider-Man quite a problem: He has to stop the Lizard but he doesn't want to harm his friend. In this movie, there's no arc for him either and there's no evidence of any humanity that we're supposed to attach to with Dr. Connors. I can't say anything that hasn't already been said about the Lizard, so the bottom line; the Lizard is one of the weakest movie villains I've ever seen in a movie.<br/><br/>As for the tone, it was way too dark. Not every superhero movie has to be ""The Dark Knight"", which was proved by ""The Avengers"". I'm not entirely opposed to a darker tone, but it's not always the right choice to go for a darker and realistic tone in a superhero movie. Just because you use a dark tone in a superhero movie, it doesn't make it better. In fact, the movie gets so serious that it feels depressing and all the fun is sucked out of it. I know that Spider-Man is going through a tough time but life's not always dark and gloomy. There's nothing wrong with a dark tone, but there's nothing wrong with a light- hearted tone either. It's okay to be cheesy sometimes. Here in TASM, I didn't feel any heart whatsoever. But hey, all the fans care about is no more chessiness right? <br/><br/>This is probably my biggest problem with the movie aside from the character of Peter Parker; ""The Untold Story"". What untold story? This was the main reason that raised people's interests including me. All the hype around this movie was that there was some big secret about Peter's parents having something to do with the spider that bites him. After seeing this movie, the answer never came. All we know about peter's parents is that something happens where they had to disappear and leave Peter with Aunt May and Uncle Ben. Then years later Peter does some research after finding his father's bag in the basement and discovers that his parents worked with Dr. Connors at Oscorp. And that's all we're told. It never comes up again and it's forgotten about halfway through the movie. Granted, in the first entry of a new series we shouldn't get all the answers right away and that's not what I'm asking for, but I want to know something about them. People keep saying that it will all be explained in the sequels so we should give the movie a pass. Well guess what? The trailers weren't advertisements for a sequel, they were ads for this movie. It really makes me wonder why are fans not bothered by that?<br/><br/>Hey, if you like or absolutely love this movie, good for you. But I don't really find it that great. It's not by any means a terrible film, it's just not up to Spider-Man standards as far as I'm concerned. I don't blame any of the cast or Marc Webb. As for the upcoming sequel I am willing to give it a shot and I think has a better chance of being good. Let's hope it does."
"hk2-1","3","1","4","22 November 2012"," Why?
","Let me get this out of the way right now: I have been a longtime Spider-man fan reading the comic books from the late 80s.<br/><br/>That being said, I think the reboot has re-imagined Spider-man for the 2010s. I thought it was very well-acted and was very character-driven. I thought Andrew Garfield was cast perfectly as Peter Parker and that he and Emma Stone had excellent on-screen chemistry. I thought they had great supporting performances from Martin Sheen, Sally Field and Rhys Ifans. I liked the details that the 2002 movie didn't pick up, like Peter Parker being a science whiz kid and that Spider-man started out when he was still in High School. I thought that Curt Connor's motivation was fleshed out with the screen time given him. And the old 'turning the city into lizards' plot made me smile, because it was the old standby plot for the Lizard in the comic books. It was what I would expect from a summer blockbuster movie.<br/><br/>But as you can tell, there's a 'but' coming somewhere...<br/><br/>As a ""fanboy"", I couldn't help but feel that this movie was trying to capture the Batman:Year One/Batman Begins feel and I think that is where it fails. There were so many ways they could have gone about doing this, whether that would be a continuation from the Spiderman3 storyline, or a reboot that didn't involve re-introducing us to characters we were fairly familiar with. Sadly, the producers felt the need to press the 'reset' button on the strength of the Chris Nolan Batman franchise; that people would like to see their superhero fumble and stumble his way into becoming the ass-kicker that he would ultimately become. Now, don't get me wrong, that is a wonderful premise. Unfortunately, we have seen this story before. and just recently too. While you can appreciate the fresh take it had on the origin story, there's only so many ways you can peel an onion. Which meant the first 45 minutes could have been dealt away with and we still would have ended up with an entertaining movie without taking a dump on the sensibilities of anybody who has a.)seen the first series of movies or b.)followed the comic books.<br/><br/>Overall, it was an entertaining summer movie, but I wouldn't rank it as my favorite among the four. And truth be told, it was exactly what I expected it to be, despite giving it every chance in the world to redeem itself."
"JohnRayPeterson","7","1","4","2 November 2012"," It's a bloody remake; okay if you haven't seen the first or are a die-hard fan.
","It's a 'bloody' remake; it's okay if you haven't seen the 2002 version with Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco and Willem Dafoe or if you are a die-hard fan of the franchise. It's also one you might want to see if Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone and Rhys Ifans are more your type of actors. The latter was sort of my reason to see it. I enjoyed it enough, but would have to say that the differences between the two were not enough for me to rate it any better than the first. I see by user reviews and ratings that audiences felt pretty much the same way. The critics however were correct in giving it a lower rating than the original, simply because it did not have that certain something that comes from being original nor did it provide that great of a distinction from the original. I may prefer Emma Stone to Kirsten Dunst, but is something subjective and I don't claim one is any better than the other. If my review does no inspire you to go see it or if it does not make you decide not to, that's just fine; let the ratings do the job. I'll give credit to the directing by Marc Webb who did no less impressive work than Sam Raimi. The tempo in this latest one is faster, keeping in tune with today's fastest pace world; it should please the younger crowd."

","Hi. <br/><br/>I've read Spiderman since i was 5 years old, and i've always had my own idea of what a real spider-man movie should be like. First of all, Peter had to be a friendly guy - a real nice fellow so to say - and this movie actually accomplished this. So thumbs up for that. <br/><br/>I've always been a little afraid that someone would make a movie and put a bodybuilder in a suit - and I'm pleased to see that it did not happen i this movie or other recent spider-man movies. Thumbs up for that. <br/><br/>The only reason why this movie does not compute is because its too sweet, too keen on being best friends with a teen audience. It just too nice and soft around all edges. It does not do the job better than the former spider-man movies. <br/><br/>Its, story wise, without dynamics. You can put all the computer animated things into the frame you want, but it wont work without a solid manuscript. <br/><br/>i like Peter, although i think him portrayed a bit to confused and too childish of a young man that age. And that might be my general point. This movie is made for Christmas eves and feel good situations, a movie you can see with your girlfriend (a girlfriend that does not care about spider-man) and you can kiss without missing anything really. Its too harmless and you do not miss anything important story wise if you go to the kitchen for a minute or 2. <br/><br/>This movie has its ups, but if you are ready to rock ?? - just be prepared to dance to Christian-rock. Its without balls!!!"
"LloydBayer","6","1","4","10 August 2012"," Why fix it if it ain't broke...
","While many people are asking ""why reboot a movie just five years later"", many others are still saying that Sam Raimi's trilogy swung into a brick wall after Spiderman 3 (2007). By the looks of it, this is not just a remake, but the re-boot of a new Marvel franchise. Is it needed? Well, if 2012 is the year of the superheroes, then more the merrier. Right? <br/><br/>Personally, I thought the whole movie is one misplaced pun with Marc Webb stepping in as the new director. The story however, is not new. As a high school teenager, Peter parker (Andrew Garfield) has issues of his own. Orphaned at a very young age, Peter has since lived with his uncle and aunt, but finds his parents' disappearance a hushed mystery. Additionally, he is bullied at school as a misfit and science geek. If all this were too much to bear, peer pressure blows a gasket when the inevitable happens – the bite of a genetically engineered spider that endows Peter with 'amazing' superhuman abilities. The rest, as any superhero aficionado will tell you, is history. That little synopsis should tell you that this is a remake that borrows, albeit heavily, from Raimi's screenplay that is just about 10 years old. For me this appears to be one major stumbling block. Sure, Webb spins his own yarn with little tidbits that seem to re-illustrate forgotten pages from our wall-crawler's Marvel origins; a web shooter, a bluer costume and some fancy fight moves to recall a few. Then there is the likable Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) instead of Mary Jane Watson, who by the way, has a fate that is altered for the movie but swapped less favorably by her father - NYPD Captain George Stacy (Dennis Leary).<br/><br/>Fresh as it may look, a remake in such a short span of cinematic memory can only mean that Webb has gone in guns blazing, or, was made to be the sacrificial lamb by studio bosses, should the cash cow refuse to budge. But as it seems, it's not all bad once the action starts. Cinematography although not picture perfect, works well as a mega teaser for New York City. Thanks to some first-person camera work, we not only see some of New York's vantage points, but also what it must feel like to crawl over and swing through those skyscrapers. Again, this is fairly rewarding for viewers opting for the pricier 3D tickets, but look around and you may find that just about every major blockbuster is released in 2D, 3D, and IMAX. Did someone mention cash cow? For this reviewer, the highpoint of this reboot are the character renditions by Garfield and Stone, both individually and as a pair of love-struck teens. Probably one of the very few areas where Webb has the one up on Raimi is Garfield's bolder Peter Parker, with or without the costume; an instantly noticeable upgrade on Toby Maguire's timid and hesitant Parker. Of course, every super hero must do battle with a super villain and this is the cue for Dr. Curtis Connors (Rhys Ifans), a scientific genius at Oscorp. If you asked me, Ifans does a better job as Dr. Connors as compared to when he turns into the reptilian humanoid called The Lizard. As literal as this may sound, the Lizard-man is the wrecking ball that manages to do more damage to the movie than any good at all. Perhaps I was the only gob smacked viewer in the auditorium, but my disbelief stems from my cemented opinion that the Lizard is a miniature (plasticky look and all) version of Godzilla and a bad replica at that. Seriously Webb? Ishirō Honda's ""Godzilla"" all but tore through cinema screens in 1954 but that is no excuse not to have used over 40 years of technological advancements to give the Lizard a palpable look and feel.<br/><br/>And so the answer to my question earlier remains a firm NO. There was no real need for this reboot given there was nothing really wrong with the preceding storyline. And trust me; we who love cinema are not short of celluloid memory. But now that we have a remake, Marc Webb can only redeem himself by bringing out a sequel that will win over the hoards of Sam Raimi fans. Including Stan Lee and Steve Ditko."
"Brownsbros3","8","1","4","1 August 2012"," Off to a good start
","The new Spiderman franchise got off to a good start with its initial offering. Andrew Garfield did well as Peter Parker/Spiderman. Though, I wish at times that he would pull his pants up. They offered a different take by starting out with Peter's first girlfriend Gwen Stacy. Because, of what ultimately happened to Gwen in the comics, a lot of the different Spiderman incarnations choose not to deal with the character. Most tend to use Peter's girlfriend/future wife Mary Jane Watson. I really liked Emma Stone in the role of Gwen. Although, with her ever-changing hair color, she could probably have done either role.<br/><br/>I also want to give credit to the supporting cast of Martin Sheen, Sally Field, and Denis Leary that really added to the quality of the film. Even though the Lizard is not one of my favorite Spiderman villains, I thought they handled it very well. Much like Spiderman 2, I wish they would quit having Peter take his mask off so much. It's supposed to be a secret identity! It's not a secret if he keeps telling everyone.<br/><br/>I do rank this one ahead of Spiderman 3, but they do have some work to catch up to the first two. I do wish them the best, and I look forward to the sequel."

Something that I would actually recommend to go see. The new cast added a much needed spark to spiderman and it shows throughout the movie. Its not even close to how dark and weird the last spiderman movie was. Its more light hearted with corny jokes in it that will give you a chuckle. It has some good action and its suspense will at least keep you interested for the entire movie. Don't get me wrong this is not movie of the year or even movie of the summer.

Instead, in January 2010 Sony announced it would reboot the franchise with a new director, 37 year old Marc Webb, and a different cast. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" (with a budget of $215 million) broke an opening record on its 3 July release of $35 million in the US and Canada. By Sunday, it is not unlikely for that figure to reach between $110 and $120 million. Little shock then, that Sony announced a new trilogy this morning on its Facebook page.

There, he is accidentally bitten by a scientifically altered spider that will grant him uncontrollable super-powers.<br/><br/>Peter's life is in turmoil; he is torn between school, a teenage crush and a clash with his uncle. He is getting acquainted with his enhanced strength – so far a fun pastime. As most teenagers absorbed by themselves, he disregards the loving family who raised him. He looks for answers about his parents' past and future options. But a tragic family accident shuffles his priorities, pushing him to uncover what he's meant to become: a superhero.<br/><br/>Details are peppered through the film's first half to understand why Peter was granted heightened spider-like senses. The script develops slowly, allowing audiences to gauge the nerdy adolescent's transformation. Even when restlessly climbing walls, he's still a boy who doesn't want to miss answering his aunt's phone call. The character is not lost behind the mask. Marc Webb has meticulously worked to develop Spider-Man's personality and skills.<br/><br/>For years, one-armed Dr. Connors has tried to develop a form of genetic manipulation to implant the DNA of a lizard in mammals, in the hope of reviving his missing limb. When Peter shows up with his father's research, the puzzle is solved. The cost of knowledge, now in the hands of a selfish scientist, leads to a ferocious giant reptile destroying the city. Spider-Man feels the urgent need to clean up his mess.<br/><br/>The short five-year gap between ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" and Sam Raimi's last installment, had fans wondering 'is this too soon?' Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker will sink Tobey Maguire into a distant memory. Notoriously nervous, fame-shy and a victim of bullying himself, he slips into the role of a caring student constantly harassed for his heroic acts remarkably.<br/><br/>This also applies to Emma Stone; she's a charming Gwen Stacey and their chemistry – the pair started dating after they met on set – adds to the film's honesty. Another notable performance came from Indian actor Irrfan Khan (Slumdog Millionaire, Salaam Bombay) playing scientist Dr. Rajit Ratha.<br/><br/>Less-obvious special effects add to the film's credibility. The combination of technology with impeccable cinematography have created visually memorable scenes. Emotions merge with spontaneous humor. Unstoppable action picks up the pace. ""Amazing"" could be used to describe the film in one word; Marc Webb has produced one of the most crafted action choreographies in comparison to Spider-Man's predecessors.<br/><br/>Find all of our film and festival coverage, as well as our events and education at www.DohaFilmInstitute.com.

"julian-mumford","7","1","4","27 July 2012"," A mostly worthy and thoroughly modern reboot
","Ten years is clearly a long time in the movie business. The original Spiderman with Tobey Maguire on-board, debuted in 2002 and there followed two sequels, all box office successes.<br/><br/>With Maguire unwilling to continue the franchise, we now have a reboot clearly aimed at an audience who will view the origin story as fresh and original.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield fills the Spidey suit and Emma Watson is his highschool sweetheart, Martin Sheen and Sally Field bag the Uncle and Auntie roles respectively.<br/><br/>The story must be known to most but in summary, camera wielding Peter Parker is the usual weakling school misfit, who has been left to be brought up by his Uncle and Aunt, following the mysterious disappearance of his mother and father.<br/><br/>Bitten by chance by a genetically modified spider, he develops webslinging and enhanced powers that ultimately he will come to use in the pursuit of bad guys, whilst dressed in a cool, Spiderman outfit. Essentially a coming of age story but writ large with superpowers and the intrinsic responsibilities that come in the same box.<br/><br/>Garfield is a serious actor and here demonstrates just that, handling the initial scenes well, helped of course by veteran actors who remember when acting was actually required in a film. Stone is a great counterpoint, all her usual screen perkiness is on display together with some rather neat sexy socks thrown in for good measure. Unlike some action films, her role gets some good screen time and takes a proactive part in the climactic scenes.<br/><br/>Bad Guy duties fall to Rhys Ifans as Dr Connor, this is hardly a spoiler as he is the obvious candidate and makes a good cold blooded killer, in every sense.<br/><br/>So far so good but this is almost a film of two halves or segments. Whenever there is character interaction and real acting involved, the film works very well. Directer Marc Webb (500 days of summer) knows how to use his actors and there are several touching scenes. Where the film occasionally falters is in the action sequences.<br/><br/>Like all modern blockbuster, action sequences are required and must continue to top the last film with ever more impossible fights and sights. This drives all modern films into the computer to generate the spectacle and increasingly as it becomes more fantastic, it becomes less real and dissipates any real tension or interest for the audience.<br/><br/>Interestingly a couple of scenes are filmed from a first person perspective, resembling a computer game which in some sequences, the film does imitate.<br/><br/>There are are some weak throwaway lines during the action which also jar, which is a shame as the film as a whole works well and these drag you away from caring about the characters. A sequence involving cranes only lacks an American flag to celebrate American ""can do"" attitude and will give foreign audiences a wry smile, subtle it is not.<br/><br/>Just like comparing tennis stars from different era's, it is probably pointless making comparisons to previous versions and the film should be treated on it's own merits and standalone it does. As all origin films must, the remaining story has to be wrapped up fast and this is no exception.<br/><br/>Dennis Leary gets a decent part and plays the character in his usual laconic way, Ifans does well with the limited time he is actually on the screen as himself.<br/><br/>Garfield is a worthy replacement, the requirement for an increasing amount of CGI is not his fault, he does well with the on screen time he is given, he also gets to keep the mask off for extended periods. This film will clearly move him into the A list of ""go to actors"" <br/><br/>Summary<br/><br/>A mostly worthy and thoroughly modern reboot for the next generation. The film shines when real interaction and acting is allowed, becoming less interesting during each action sequence.<br/><br/>This equation will of course be inverted, the closer your age is to the target audience.<br/><br/>http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/"
"ptser","6","1","4","23 July 2012"," baffled spider-sense
","Well, this one gives you a mixed, baffling feeling after you leave the theater. It's certainly not bad entertainment (on the contrary) but something seems incomplete here. Some certain highlights make up for that, but I feel some points must be made: <br/><br/>I think more and more marvel fans have now some secret prayers: ''Oh please, let Paramount buy the rights of Spiderman and X-Men...let them join the Avengers..'' and ''oh, please, let Nolan direct a Marvel hero!''. Well, it seems that both Webb and Universal look into those prayers, but not very sure of which route to take. There is a ''realistic'' approach , (earthly colors, casting, plot(web blasters and stuff)) and at the same time an ''avengers'' approach (you get to laugh quite often and even an after credits scene where you think S.L.J. is in the shadows). However, this Spiderman is neither Nolanesque or Avengeresque and Peter's quest(ion) is present: Who am I? It is obvious that this is just the first one of movies to come, so no quick judgments. After all, BB has little in common with TDK, part from a director's vision. However, more baffled moments are there: Webb seems eager to please everyone with the cost of losing the movie's personality: He wants to please the comic fans with numerous winks (from swinging shots to lab coats) and the twilight generation (well, it IS a better love story than Twilight...). Raimi's Spiderman was Raimi's, with it's own personality, pros and cons. If Spiderman 3 was a waste of time, money and Venom, Spiderman 2 still the remains THE best spider-movie. Webb needs to show himself more and give this spider-man a heart of its own. As for the rest, Andrew Garfield will take care of everything. At certain points, you just want him without the suit, as he is the sole heart of the movie. Of course Mrs. Stone is a joy to watch, but Gwen is just another baffled moment. One simple example(of many): How come a self confident and courageous girl (she even confronts the lizard) be MORE SHY than geeky peter?? Ifans makes an excellent choice as Dr. Connors, while lizard...well..not so much (just another contradiction of the film). It's not the best CGI out there, and the productions decision to make him more like a man-lizard (instead of lizard-man) is awkward at times. And of course, the transition from the ethical scientist to the bioterrorist Lizard is biased and sloppy. In general, the movie gives an impression of a lot of deleted scenes and more questions raise than answered. <br/><br/>All in all, I don't want to say it's ''not good'', but it certainly lacks personality and heart. A general discussion point must also be made: This entertainment these days is not about originality (all major ''coming soon'' movies are either remakes or reboots or sequels) but how old material will be played out again. This one is either a BB (here's hoping for Norman Osborn to show up) or a ..Hulk (rememberd only for RDJ in the end). Let's hope Webb is only warming us up and is not actually baffled himself of which route to take."

"jonpustavrh","6","1","4","21 July 2012"," Just Spiderman
","OK The Amazing Spider-man is not a bad film, but is not great either. It is different from 2002 spider man mainly because of a villain and other characters.<br/><br/>The movie is soft, it is typical superhero movie- hero rises villain is created they fight hero wins. The end.<br/><br/>That is also the case here. Web added a new story, story of spider-mans parents. I didn't enjoyed it at all! Why? Because is only partly done. Only thing you learn about them is that they left him when he was very young and that his father was working with Dr.Conners. I know that we will learn more about them in sequels but it leaves viewer empty.<br/><br/>That was the first think annoying me.<br/><br/>Second think: The villain!<br/><br/>OK Dr. Curt Connars/Lizard is great character! But they should put more time in their's relationship which off course wasn't given. He just comes to his home and they become friends. Its like you would give Two-Face for the first Batman villain. NO!. The character must develop!<br/><br/>Third think: Gwen Stacy.<br/><br/>I don't know why but by the end of film the only character that i got to know is spider man. They like don't talk to each other and then are like together ... i mean what the barely even know each other.<br/><br/>Fourth think: Every body knows who spider man is!<br/><br/>Like everybody. Gwen, her father, some kid, Conner's, and some random people in New York. In previous trilogy every spidey villain gets o know who spidey is... but OK they all die at he end, here hes like hey i am spider man...<br/><br/>The movie has a lot of flaws. But acting is good, lizard is amazingly done and they were some funny scenes.<br/><br/>But please for love of god i hope the sequel would have an actual story something to think about not just some movie you just watched. The film have no twists and turns if you see the all the trailers you have seen the movie.<br/><br/>The movie is just chronologically played.<br/><br/>ACTING: 3/5 there wasn't any hard role to play<br/><br/>DIRECTING: 3/5<br/><br/>STORY: 2/5<br/><br/>VISUALS: 4/5<br/><br/>MOVIE: 6/10"
"Carris_BCN","6","1","4","21 July 2012"," Good action and actors but bad director and script
","First I will comment that this film let me a bit frustrated because it is a mediocre film when it could be a great film with only minors modifications all around Spider-man nonsense actions. I will say a few examples of BAD THING: <br/><br/>_Spider-man constantly take off his mask without any reason (why?, only to see main character face?) _Perter Parker showing is new strong and athletic powers (are Peter stupid or what?) <br/><br/>_some parts of film, like discovering is power, are rushed and have few minutes and other insignificant actions, like how he enter in Oscorp, to plot take a lot of time (what did think the director?). Making the film have a big holes in the argument progression.<br/><br/>_The romance in film looked lukewarm, forced and superficial. <br/><br/>_Peter is not a nerd and is personality have not big change after become spider-man and be Spider-man seems as a play thing until the end of film (how can one create attachment to Peter/Spider-man with this ""cool"" Peter from beginning. Other time what the hell is the director thinking?) <br/><br/>_...<br/><br/>:(<br/><br/>But not all is bad, lets do a list of GOOD THINGS:<br/><br/>_Good actors (to bad that script and directors don't make them shine with more deep personality characters)<br/><br/>_Very good special effects <br/><br/>_Credible bad guy character <br/><br/>_Good actions scenes with villain involved (not others irrelevant scenes)<br/><br/>In resume, not being a bad movie is not good neither, is a bit insubstantial in plot and characters development making only another hero movie that will no be remembered is not a well recognized hero like Spider-man was the main character. I know that normally no good make comparatives but I will because others Spider-man films are very recent and the director have to considerate that people will make comparatives. If you compare to the Spider-man of 2002, this is catastrophic losing in all aspects to his predecessor."
"vicky150188","5","1","4","20 July 2012"," This is not what I expected
","First of all i am a huge fan of spider man because of Tobey Maguire, no one can beat him..according to my view, why this film unable to satisfy spidey fans<br/><br/>1. If this is the first film of spider man then it will be a massive hit of the year, even though it is a reboot it is considered as 4th part. so what spider man could do in the screen are already know by the fans. so if we speak about the reboot its like a broken record player which plays the same story again & again.<br/><br/>2. The next big strength for spider man film is background score, which could have been much better in this film than the previous films. what Danny Elfman did in the trilogy was STUPENDOUS.<br/><br/>3. The next sole thing about spider man is Costume, i don't know why Webb decided to change the costume, it doesn't look good at all.<br/><br/>4. The next one is costume shrinking can be seen clearly in action scenes, he is a superhero so his costume should be in a stiff manner.<br/><br/>5. Most of the scenes(spider man) in this film are in dark.<br/><br/>6. Finally i couldn't be able to feel this was a superhero(SpiderMan) film at all.<br/><br/>some good things:<br/><br/>1. Andrew Garfield fits perfectly for the character as Peter Parker / Spiderman, all the other casts are acted well especially Rhys Ifans.<br/><br/>2. High School fight is good.<br/><br/>Hope the sequel will be more amazing, but not this one."
"super_mario_crivellaro","3","1","4","20 July 2012"," Original is better.
","I came into this movie just expecting to be entertained for 2 hours or so but this film just fails to do so. Spiderman just gets thrown across the rooms like nothing, it's almost embarrassing! On top of that he goes around every day and comes back at night with bruises and cuts and scars, I mean does he get a good beating every time he goes out? Plus he gets shot! I mean is spider-man even supposed to get shot? Wasn't he supposed to see it coming with his spidey sense? And when he gets shot, he is so weak he can't even swing across town without the help of the crane guys. Though the special effects and CGI was pleasing to the eye, it just gets shadowed out by this lame excuse for a movie. Go see the original and save your money."
"savannahbanana1996","6","1","4","19 July 2012"," Played Up But Did Not Deliver
","When I went into this movie, I admit; I was pretty hyped about it. The main reason was the amount of publicity it received, which can be a good thing or a bad thing. In this case, it was a bad thing. I can't go on reviewing this movie without comparing it to the 3 previous Tobey Maguire movies. Andrew Garfield, who plays Spiderman in this movie, is tall, gangly, and cocky in my opinion. He takes off his mask way too many times to be wanting to keep his identity as Spiderman a secret. I thought Emma Stone was good as Gwen Stacy, Peter Parker's boyfriend, but she found out he was Spiderman a little too soon.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie did not hit it off with me. It probably had a lot to do with the fact that I loved the other Spiderman movies and compared them too much to this installment. I hope this review was helpful to you and I'm sorry if it was not. God bless!"
"Breakbeatpaul","8","1","4","19 July 2012"," Best Spider-Man Yet!
","At first I couldn't get passed the fact that Peter Parker now looks like a Jonas Brother. <br/><br/>But once the movie picked up speed I was drawn in immediately. Now mind you I put off seeing this movie until its 3rd week (which is long for a comic book nerd like me) just because I hated the ""boy-band"" image I saw. <br/><br/>After all that is said and done, I think Andrew Garfield did a spectacular job. When he's in the suit his Spider-Man performance leaves Tobey Maguire awkwardly dancing in a distant second place.<br/><br/>Now I can't wait to take my nephews just so I can see it again! Great Story, great Acting, and truly amazing special affects are what I tell anyone who has doubts about seeing this reboot. <br/><br/>I would even go so far as to compare it as the Batman Begins of its franchise. <br/><br/>Not to mention the fact that the 3D is just something YOU HAVE TO EXPERIENCE IN THE THEATERS! I don't care how big your 3D, LCD, HDTV, is. Nothing compares to a good theater experience. <br/><br/>Move going is expensive these days, and this one is worth it."
"scottedunlap","4","1","4","17 July 2012"," Wow, I blame Spiderman 3!

Iron Man was awesome, Iron Man II though, ugh, just okay. ""The Avengers"" was AWESOME, and ""The Amazing Spiderman"" just okay. Producers of this movie didn't learn from ""The Return of Superman"" about how NOT to make a super hero movie, really how to make ANY movie. Shouldn't a movie have a decent story? Is that so much to ask? Sure, you throw in some young good looking people (Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone), and then balance it with some older talented ones (Martin Sheen, Sally Field) and there's your cast boy, well lets add some CGI, and a romance that NO ONE CARES ABOUT! After putting these things together, they think they have a movie. Well, I guess they do. I guess people will pay to see it, like I did. Well, if you are bored, and you like action, and a quickly thrown together sketch of how Peter Parker became Spiderman, go see this. For my money though, Spider Man II, Iron Man, and The Avengers are light years beyond this endeavor."
"lethal_weapon_118","6","1","4","15 July 2012"," Too similar to the past
","I think I would have enjoyed this movie a lot more if I had not seen the previous movies. I realize that it is going to have similar events and plot lines as Spider-man (2002)being based on the same comics, but it was a little too similar for my liking. I appreciate originality and I felt it played more as a re-make then a reboot. Even the scene in the beginning where a young man is being bullied with a food tray reminded me of the scene in the 2002 movie where Peter uses the tray to show his new skills. I thought by adding things so reminiscent of the past movie the director was almost making fun of it, and trying to show that he could do it better.<br/><br/>I am not saying it was bad, it was a great movie. Just a little to similar a little too soon."

","I went into Amazing Spider-Man with high hopes I must say, and I was not disappointed. It's better than the 1st film, better than the 3rd, but it just fell short of being better than the 2nd.<br/><br/>The chemistry between the Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone is amazing, you actually feel for the two of them through out the film, Emma Stone plays the role of Gwen Stacy perfectly, as Andrew Garfield does as both Spider-Man and Peter Parker.<br/><br/>The villain, Dr. Curt Connors (AKA The Lizard), played by Rhys Ifans, is superb in the film, as is Captain Stacy, played by Dennis Leary.<br/><br/>The only flaw I had with the film, is that the villain was a lot like the villain in the past 3 films, as he would talk to himself (or a more insane version of himself), but the director did a great job in making Spider-Man more arrogant than he was in the other films, there are times when you will laugh out loud at his wise cracks, but you still can't help but feel for him at times in the film.<br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend this film to everyone. It's a lot more in depth with the relationship moments in the film, which the past 3 films lacked, although it doesn't have the same set piece moments that the Sam Raimi films had, so do not expect the film to be filled with them"
"rgblakey","8","1","4","12 July 2012"," Spider-Man swings back into action
","After years of struggling to get a Spider-Man movie made, Sam Raimi not only stepped up to the plate, he knocked the series out of the park. There were issues with all of his movies on some level, especially with his third outing, but nonetheless they worked. Usually the re-boots or remakes take quite some time to happen, but this time around it took less than ten years to make it happen. With Amazing Spider-Man, they forget the previous films happened and start from scratch. Fans were up in arms trying to figure out why this was happening all over again, but the trailers look to have stepped it up. Will this new incarnation be something more or just a failed attempt at cashing in and continue the demise of the once promising franchise that started with part 3? The Amazing Spider-Man follows Peter Parker, as he finds a clue that might help him understand why his parents disappeared when he was young and this path puts him on a collision course with Dr. Curt Connors, his father's former partner. All while trying to come to terms with his new found powers and emotional struggle with his feelings for Gwen Stacy. Not only doe Amazing Spider-Man work, it ended up being the best of the Spider-Man films so far. Was it necessary to go back to the beginning and tell this story again? No, but manages to make it work with so much more depth than the previous film. This film manages to bring the character story front and center as it should be instead of just about Spider-Man swinging around and fighting. The relationship here between Garfield and Stone comes off way more believable than anything in the previous films. Garfield is the perfect Spider-Man jumping right off the page of the comic and bringing both Spider-Man and more importantly Peter Parker to life. Rhys Ifans doctor Connors works well enough, but isn't given a whole lot to do until the second half of the film and most of that is as the Lizard. The rest of the cast do a great job bringing everything together. The story really steps it up here bringing all the emotion needed to make it work. It takes its time to build up to every moment rather than just rushing to get to the action. Anyone that has ever read the comic knows that it was always about the character arcs more than the action and here they nail it. Have no fear; there is plenty of action that is some of the best of a Spider-Man film so far. The decision to use less CG really changes the dynamic of this film and makes it seem more realistic. The lizard comes off really well and is a great villain, but comes off a bit one dimensional and underdeveloped, but still manages to work. If there is any complaint about this character it's his mouth when he's talking, it comes off a bit awkward that seems due to the CG. The 3D works OK, but really only adds depth to the film and a few moments here and there, but overall is really not necessary.<br/><br/>While the original Spider-Man still holds up in comparison to this new film, it comes off a bit campy. In comparison this is Nolan's Batman Begins compared to Burton's Batman; both are good, but just not in the same league. Like it or not Spider-Man has been re-booted, but it works great and creates a whole new world to build on. This Spider-Man really lives up to its name as amazing.<br/><br/>http://www.examiner.com/movie-in-dallas/bobby-blakey"

"xamtaro","7","1","4","9 July 2012"," Should be renamed ""Peter Parker: High School Drama""
","It was not even 10 years since the first spiderman movie, starring Tobey Mcguire, was released to critical acclaim and financial success. Despite deviating somewhat from the comic books, the movie stay true to the spirit of the source material and was lauded by both comic fans and casual movie watchers alike. Enter THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN, the first in a new trilogy of movies based on Marvel's favorite web-slinger. With a promise to adhere closer to the comic books, the film goes back to explore Spiderman's origin once again. A genetically altered Spider's bite, a death in the family, a promise made, a responsibility accepted. But once we get down to the specifics, THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN becomes its own unique creature.<br/><br/>The overall tone is closer to a character centered teenage romance drama than a Superhero blockbuster. Teenager Peter Parker, played by Andrew Garfield, is less of Tobey Mcguire's lovable loser and more of a misunderstood social outcast; seething with angst, awkward with girls, prefers to be alone. Abandoned by his parents under mysterious circumstances, Peter was raised by his Uncle Ben and Aunt May. In high school, he grapples with finding his sense of identity and finding his first high school crush in the form of snowy haired Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). One day, Peter discovers a mysterious briefcase that belonged to his father which leads him to Oscorp and his father's science partner Dr Curt Connors. An accident grants Peter Parker with spider-like powers but also results in a new scaly menace intent on wiping out human life. <br/><br/>From the get go, THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN shows itself to be a very competent human drama film. Relationships are the focus here. We get an insight into how Peter's relationships with his Uncle Ben affects his choice to become a masked vigilante. Martin Sheen completely nails the protective ""tough love"" yet gentle personality of Uncle Ben from the comics. It feels very natural and this makes his eventual death weigh even more on Peter's life changing decisions. Similarly the chemistry between Peter and Gwen is more nuanced than the more fairy tale like romance between Peter and Mary Jane from the Sam Raimi trilogy. Overall, the characters are definitely more grounded in reality, fully developed and easy to relate to.<br/><br/>However it is this move to try and ground the movie in reality that is also one of its many downfalls. Although director Marc Webb perfectly captures the emotional aspect of the movie, he seems to have trouble grappling the drama with the action. Once Spiderman dons the mask, the film splits itself into two movies: ""Peter Parker: High School Romance"" and ""Spiderman Begins"". This shift in tone can be jarring and similarities to ""Batman Begins"" abound: a parental figure killed in front of our protagonist, setting most of the action at night, a darker tone, even the plot thread of the authorities hunting our masked vigilante. Unlike Batman Begins, however, THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN hints on themes but never develops them; a likely result of giving too much weight to Peter Parker's emotional drama. The theme about the power of anonymity behind a mask, for example, is a poignant one befitting the Internet age yet is only touched upon but never focused on.<br/><br/>Not surprisingly, director Marc Webb is more known for romance drama ""500 Days of Summer"" than any blockbuster. Like a Basketball player handed a golf club, Webb fumbles about once the Superhero plot is introduced. His lingering long shots are eschewed for fast whip cuts and close ups in fight scenes making much of the action difficult to follow if it were not for Spidey's bright hued outfit. Our villain is basically Alfred Molina's Doctor Octopus redux: a well intentioned scientist driven to madness by a lab accident, developing a ""Dr Jekyll/Mr Hyde"" personality only to come to his senses in the end. <br/><br/>His strong point, the human drama, also suffers at this point where we have Peter and Gwen being the adorable awkward couple at one moment and then madly in love the next moment after a family dinner. In making Peter Parker a socially awkward skateboarding kid instead of the complete nerd drifting through a crappy life, the story of gaining great power and learning great responsibility carries less impact. He already has a rebellious nature, he already stands up to bullies, he already talks back to authority figures. That metamorphosis from zero to hero hardly takes place. Ironic that a movie with two very clashing story styles never manages to convey the dichotomous personality of the shy doormat Peter Parker and the heroically resolute Spiderman. <br/><br/>The dichotomy in the movie's tone and style can be seen even in the film score by James Horner. His softer piano based tunes set during the ""Peter Parker"" convey the constant inner turmoil Peter has to grapple with; there is an underlying sense of somberness to the emotions. On the other hand, Horner's action cues and main hero fanfare are sadly generic. Danny Elfman composed a dramatic, subtle yet memorable score with tunes that just ooze ""arachnid"". Horner here gives us plain old ""heroic"" with a hero theme that sounds like a combination of ""Batman and Robin"" and Ang Lee's ""Hulk"". A sad turn from the composer who brought us the epic sweeping scores of Aliens and Avatar. <br/><br/>If one were to compare, The Amazing Spider-man would rate as the 3rd best among the 4 Spiderman films in existence just slightly behind Spiderman 1 but significantly better than the muddled mess of Spiderman 3. It is an emotionally touching coming-of-age movie, heavy on teenage drama and characters anyone can relate to. Sadly it is a mediocre superhero film, floundering in its schizophrenic switch of tone between drama and action instead of blending them together."
"EUyeshima","6","1","4","9 July 2012"," Garfield and Stone Shine in a Franchise Reboot That Has Arrived Far Too Soon
","A reboot of the Spider-Man franchise feels awfully premature given it's only been a decade since the first Sam Raimi-directed epic hit the big screen with Tobey Maguire in the title role, and it's been just five years since the release of ""Spider-Man 3"". Moreover, some of us have had the misfortune of seeing the bombastic Broadway debacle that is ""Spider- Man: Turn Off the Dark"" this past year complete with an unmemorably deafening score by Bono. Here is yet another version of the superhero's familiar origin story presented in this 2012 adventure epic from director Marc Webb (""(500) Days of Summer"") and a trio of accomplished screenwriters - James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent (who co-wrote 2 and 3 of the previous trilogy as well as several classic films), and Steve Kloves (who adapted most of the ""Harry Potter"" series). Although they go back to Peter Parker's tragic childhood in the prologue, the set-up is otherwise identical to the previous iterations except aspiring actress Mary Jane Watson is nowhere to be seen. Instead, there is spunky Gwen Stacy, a police captain's daughter, the chief intern at the OsCorp Corporation, and Peter's high school crush.<br/><br/>Webb focuses much of his movie, especially the first half, to the burgeoning relationship between Peter and Gwen, and this turns out to be a smart move since the screenwriters appear otherwise strait-jacketed by the recognizable constraints of the back story. Raised by his kindly Uncle Ben and Aunt May, Peter is the same brilliant geek and social outcast in this movie, but he's given a more brooding sense of anguish by Andrew Garfield (""The Social Network"") - who at 28, can still get away with playing a teen. The plot starts to accelerate when Peter stumbles upon his father's old briefcase filled with complex formulas that lead him to an old colleague of his father's, Dr. Curt Connors, now a top scientist at OsCorp. Connors' focus is on cross-species genetics which he hopes will produce ""a world without weakness"", a personal cause to him since losing his right arm. While at OsCorp, Peter gets bitten by a spider that gives birth to his super powers. When Uncle Ben is later killed by a thief during a sidewalk scuffle, Peter decides to become a vigilante hero who is at odds with the police, which of course, means butting heads with Gwen's by-the-book father.<br/><br/>However, things really come to a head with the appearance of the Lizard, who causes havoc first in a fatalistic traffic jam on the Williamsburg Bridge and then at Peter's high school. The inevitable battle of good versus evil takes its toll on the city and on our beleaguered hero with the requisite special effects given a full showcase to bring the movie to a rousing finish. That finish occurs over a wearying 136-minute running time, fairly excessive given the familiarity of the story. Perhaps if the Lizard represented something more interesting than a straight-up Jekyll-and-Hyde metamorphosis, it wouldn't have felt quite as long. Although Webb handles the numerous action scenes with surprising acuity given this is only his second feature film as a director, he brings a level of personal intimacy to the movie that a typical action director would likely have bypassed so as not to alienate the fanboy audience. It's also a good thing that Webb hired two bright actors to bring human scale to the love story at the center of this comic book adventure. Beyond Garfield's solid work, a blonde Emma Stone brings her innately sharp manner to a character that could have easily turned into a simplistic damsel in distress.<br/><br/>Together the two attractive leads have a palpable chemistry that bodes well for the inevitable sequels. Last seen as the suspicious academic in ""The Five-Year Engagement"", Rhys Ifans plays Connors with similar caginess and with the help of CGI effects, fulfills his villainous quotient fitfully. The rest of the stellar supporting cast feels somewhat underserved within the story's dimensions. Denis Leary plays Gwen's father with his trademark casual authority but perhaps at the expense of the character's needed gravitas toward the end. With two Oscars, Sally Field can certainly do more than look constantly concerned, the basic requirement here, but leave it to the veteran actress to provide more depth to the fretful Aunt May. Martin Sheen seems to have the best grasp on his character's blue-collar sensibilities as Uncle Ben. James Horner's music struck me as overly bombastic for the stealth-like movements of Spider-Man, while John Schwartzman's cinematography is a bit on the murky side during the nighttime shots, especially during the climax. I just wish the whole venture could have enthralled me more, but despite some clear virtues with this latest installment, Sam Raimi still casts too foreboding a shadow from my perspective."
"jonnyfendi","8","1","4","9 July 2012"," Spidey Is Spicy Than Ever!
","Spidey is spicy than ever! Ready or not, here he comes. They take Spider-Man to ""The Dark Knight"" (2008) level. Darker! More realistic! And more serious! But don't get me wrong, thiz rebooted version has its own original style and identity. I hate to compare thiz one to the previous Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy (2002-2007) but I have to say something here. I have been a comic fan since I was a little boy. I'm certainly not a fan of the previous version. In fact, I have lots of disappointments and even more tons of complaints about it. I remember when the movie came out, I said to everyone, ""Why they made Peter Parker to be some kind of Clark Kent's character? The eye color should be hazel instead of blue. Peter Parker has thiz slang language thing, some kind of skateboard boy look-alike, and he is surely not geeky!"". Well, they make up for it thiz time. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" has better costume, better camera angles and even better hairstyle. Thiz is what Peter Parker should look like! Andrew Garfield is definitely a better Peter Parker, Garfield reveals the dark side of thiz character and it looks just amazing and humble at the same time. Emma Stone is solid as a rock, another perfect choice to represent Peter's first true love Gwen Stacy. The Director Marc Webb creatively spreads his web all over these two characters. You can see there is something there between the interaction of Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy. There is a beautiful chemistry and sincere love between them! Just exactly what he has shown us in ""(500) Days of Summer"" (2009). The supporting Cast members also look amazing, Sally Field and Charlie Sheen as Aunt May and Uncle Ben, Denis Leary as Gwen's father Captain George Stacy and Rhys Ifans as Dr.Curt Connors and his alter-ego The Lizard. And guess what? I think Marvel comic book creator Stan Lee finally makes his best cameo ever in thiz movie when he's just listening to music on his headphones in the library fight scene. I'm also fascinated by how they pay homage not only to comic version but also to previous Spider-Man's movies, Spoiler Alert! Only if you realize there's a scene when Uncle Ben advises Peter, there is kind of ""With great power comes great responsibility"" thing but in different words. And there is also a scene when Spider-Man has to choose to save a car from falling off a bridge or chase the bad guy. It simply makes everybody happy. I notice that they keep the Lizard's figure to remain mysterious for almost half the length of the film and suddenly boom! The full appearance of Lizard comes out and it's so frightening. Whether you realize it or not, most of the Spider-Man's action scenes take place at night. There are a lot of night scenes, more than ever. It makes thiz version even more mysterious. I love how they capture those famous Spider-Man swingings with roller-coasting camera angle, it looks wow! And those Spider-Man's cheesy lines just like in comics, ""Hey, I'm swinging here, I'm swinging here!"", ""If you're going to steal cars, don't dress like a car thief"" or ""Please shut your mouth, reptile.. Upss!"". That's the real Spider-Man! Well, One more thing to spoil. I just want to say, at the end Spider-Man makes one great pose.<br/><br/>Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com"
"blacklist-1","7","1","4","9 July 2012"," A Great Spiderman, But Not Amazing.
","The Amazing Spiderman is certainly a diverse superhero movie, in the sense of how diverse the public opinion is, with those that love it and those who can't stand it. Me myself when I first saw the trailer, I was unimpressed and thought that rebooting the franchise after only five years after Sam Raimi's Spiderman 3 was a mistake of colossal proportions as it was just too soon. Then when Columbia Pictures advertised the next couple of trailers, I became more excited as there was more in it and I was quite looking forward to the movie, with myself becoming more open minded. <br/><br/>In the end I quite enjoyed The Amazing Spiderman for what it was. I can from my perspective see both sides of how this film has been seen, in why people like it, whilst others despise it. The decision to concentrate on Peter's parents origins was an interesting angle to take I think, and though it is not fully resolved along with Peter wanting to catch the thief who killed Uncle Ben, it will most likely come up in the sequel, so I will not see that as a negative aspect of the film. <br/><br/>Initially it took a while for me to get into the movie as though I knew they were aiming for a more serious and dark tone for the reboot than Sam Raimi's version, it took a while to adjust. Things I did like from the reboot apart from the refreshing angle of Peter's origins was the superb CGI of the Lizard and Spidey Suit. The 3D when it was properly implemented was impressive and the action sequences was terrifically choreographed.<br/><br/>The acting was also up to a good standard. It took me some time to get used to Andrew Garfield as Spiderman, but in the end he acted well and carried the part with enough charisma. Despite that though he just paled in comparison to Toby Maguire, who captured the dopey, awkward teenager who took risks so much better. But that is just my personal opinion. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacey was excellent in her scenes (though I felt she was underwritten) as she was adorable and charming. I also liked the fact the writers neatly avoided the stereotypical damsel in distress routine, which became irritatingly prominent with Mary Jane in Raimi's Spiderman. Stacey showed intelligence and seemed like a much more realistic character as a result. Martin Sheen and Sally Field as Uncle Ben and Aunt May carried their scenes with great aplomb as well. Unfortunately Rhys Ifans as the Dr Curt Conners/Lizard fared less well, with though a decent enough performance, was terribly written. The Lizard as a villain wasn't convincing enough for me as a true adversary to Spiderman as he was also underwritten like most of the cast. <br/><br/>This is one of my main problems of The Amazing Spiderman as the film just felt so rushed even though it was longer than Raimi's Spiderman. There is substance throughout the entire movie, but it only scratches the surface with underwritten roles for these characters like Stacey, Aunt May and the Lizard who don't get to flex out their characters enough. In terms of the story itself, like the Lizard's motivation and Peter's parents past and the death of Uncle Ben just felt too quick and patchy. This is not due to the fact you don't find out more about Peter's father or that the thief who murdered Uncle Ben is not apprehended. It's down to that these moments of the film felt so rushed with though there is some emotion, the impact of these events on the characters is not prolonged enough. I felt as though the film was trying to bring style too much to the forefront and not enough substance, which was lacking.<br/><br/>Part of this reason for substance lacking is the main reason why this movie does not stand up to the Raimi's first two Spiderman movies. It lacks an emotional punch, heart and humour (though there is some in TAS, I loved the scene when Spiderman apprehends the car thief) there just wasn't enough and as a result I didn't feel an infinity with these characters or really come to care about them unlike in Raimi's, which gave it more depth in story and character development. I admire director Marc Webb's idea of the reboot and he really does try, but in the end though I love the style of the film and appreciated it's attempt at interesting story arcs and character development, it lacked that real emotional punch and comedy factor, which would have made it even more fun and a superhero people could connect with. Don't get me wrong it was fun, with some also great acting and action, but it wasn't enough for me as it was easily forgettable. By all means do go and see this as it does have some merit and I thoroughly enjoyed all it's 136 minutes. I would go and see the sequel as this film showed great potential, which I hope will be further developed in the sequel. It was a great effort on the whole. But for me this Spiderman didn't quite live up to his title. He was great yes, but just not amazing."
"gillman11","6","1","4","9 July 2012"," Good But Not Great
","I love Spidey, always have and I was a big fan of Raimi's movies, even finding the freaky mess of Spider-Man 3 watchable.<br/><br/>So, a reboot so soon after the last sequel seemed redundant, although, hey its Spidey so I'll be there.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man is an entertaining couple of hours. The effects are good, Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are both excellent, the supporting cast are variable (of which more later) but Martin Sheen and Sally Field are inspired casting choices for Aunt May and Uncle Ben.<br/><br/>However, it is clear that the studio are playing a long game with this reboot and want to carry the story into at least a couple of sequels, using Nolan's Batman as a model no doubt.<br/><br/>So TASM suffers from similar problems to Batman Begins, whilst there are elements that are excellent, it is slightly less than the sum of its parts and its pacing is incoherent to the point of being confusing. There are many longeurs in the early part of the film and a lot of messy rushing-about in the second part.<br/><br/>Rhys Ifans' Curt Connors/Lizard is a curious choice for a cinematic villain and whilst there seems to be a striving to make him sympathetic in the way Raimi achieved with Dr Octopus in Spider-Man 2, his motivations are unclear and he descends into sociopathic drivelling.<br/><br/>Denis Leary's Captain Stacey is similarly poorly sketched, particularly when compared to Gary Oldman's Jim Gordon in the Nolan Batman flicks.<br/><br/>Neither of these are particularly the fault of the actors, the screenplay never really allows either of the characters to breathe as it concentrates too much of the minutiae of Peter Parker's rebirth as Spider-Man and his romance with Stacy's daughter, Gwen. Notably, both Garfield and Stone come away with the acting plaudits given that their characters are the two that are allowed to breathe and develop through the scope of the film.<br/><br/>The pivotal Uncle Ben sequence also seems curiously rushed when compared to the Raimi version.<br/><br/>The film then, ultimately suffers from the fact that it is undeniably a set up for a longer tale (made most obvious by the mid credits sequence at the end). In some ways, the film is entertaining enough for this to be forgivable but knocks it down a number of notches as a standalone flick (again much like Batman Begins).<br/><br/>The only problem for the filmmakers now is for this to ultimately be recalled fondly, the sequel has be The Dark Knight quality. The origin is told, the throughline has been established - TASM 2 has to blow us away."
"simplemandudee","7","1","4","8 July 2012"," It's good, but something is missing.
","I'll be honest, I thought this movie would bomb. Box office, critics and bomb in my eyes as well. I was wrong. I won't say much, just the basics. <br/><br/>Let me just start off by saying that Andrew Garfield blew me away. I didn't expect much from this guy, only ever seeing him in The Social Network, but he did his part and did it well. In Raimi's Spiderman, Peter Parker is a full on nerd. But in this particular one, he's more of a skater / just plain awkward type. But he made it work. As for Emma Stone, she was flawless. (I might be bias here, for obvious reasons.)<br/><br/>As for the Villain, Rhys Ifans plays a magnificent Lizard. By far the best Villain of any Spider-Man movie interpretation. I always thought this was Spider-Man movies weakest point (sans Venom, he's awesome but was just portrayed and used terribly) but in TASM I loved every bit of screen time that the Lizard got. <br/><br/>Yet, there is something missing. Something I cannot put my finger on... maybe it's just me and my mind trying to connect this and Raimi's Spider-Man and over-comparing the two, I'm not sure. One thing is for certain, and I'm sure most of you hated it too: The infamous crane scene. My word... <br/><br/>All in all, it's a great movie too watch. Full of action, some instances of comedy, and of course, Spider-Man!"
"chrisjbuck","8","1","4","8 July 2012"," Different but just as good
","I am a huge fan of the last Spider-man trilogy, as well as most superhero stories, and kind of hoped during the past few years that the trilogy was changed to a quadrilogy with a fourth movie with Tobey Maguire in the red and blue. With this being the case I was unsure how I would feel about this effort so I decided to try and cast the previous trilogy out of my mind. This was difficult as the Spider-man story was not in need of a re-boot in the same manner of Batman or The Incredible Hulk, I feel that the trilogy of the past decade were more than satisfactory.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised as this movie looks slightly deeper into Peter Parker's past that what has been told before. It has certainly more story than action, which fans of the previous trilogy may not be appreciative of. However, here we have a good cast, plenty of humour, a great story and a satisfactory script. I do think Andrew Garfield is a great choice for the main role and has a difficult task as he story requires more acting skills than before. There is less CGI and more humanity this time around.<br/><br/>I do think this movie does for Spider-man what Batman Begins did for that franchise and it would be fantastic to see a second movie of the same quality as what Christopher Nolan produced.<br/><br/>Fans of the comicbook story should appreciate this as it is much more faithful to the original story than ever before.<br/><br/>If you watch this without comparing it to the previous trilogy, you will enjoy it much more. This is because it is as removed from the previous trilogy as it can be. The villain here could have been better in my opinion but, lets be truthful, the Scarecrow was not the best pick for the Batman trilogy either.<br/><br/>I like the new suit here too."
"pastormg2","7","1","4","8 July 2012"," Good Film but Doesn't Jive with the Other Spiderman Films
","I went last evening with a friend to see Spiderman. It was nice to see what happened when he was a little child, but after that the chain of events did not match up very well with the previous Spiderman Films.<br/><br/>First off I thought that Doctor Connor was Peter Parkers college professor. In this film they have him working for Ozcorp and at the end he is put into prison. Either he must of gotten a short sentence or whatever but how can you have him in 3 Spiderman films as a college professor and in this film a scientist/villain Also, in all the other films we had the girlfriend M.J. and now we have Gwynn? In the other films Peter had a crush on Mary Jane, not Gwynn. It also took a while for Peter to let Mary Jane know that he was Spiderman, where in this film it like there is no hesitation in letting anyone know his true identity.<br/><br/>Also, in Spiderman 3 they have the killer of his Uncle Ben as the Sandman. It was not a guy who was robbing a convenience store. Plus Uncle Ben was in a car, not walking along the street. Plus, there was another criminal involved with the Sandman.<br/><br/>You can see that they are going to have another one because you have the unknown person talking to Dr. Connor in prison, plus they have to develop the romance between Peter and Gwynn.<br/><br/>I realize that the other spiderman films set the mark with regards to theme, actors and so forth. Making a film to erase all that had to have been difficult. But I'm sure I'm not the only one who is confused at the storyline that they had in this film. Plenty of action, but just very confusing with regards to the storyline"
"cmweinreich","8","1","4","7 July 2012"," A Reboot That Stays True To Its Roots
","It was hard for me to imagine the necessity of a reboot of the Spider-Man franchise. After all, hadn't we witnessed the dreadful ending of the franchise not more than 5 years ago? Sam Raimi's version of Spider-Man started off on the right foot, even though it changed a decent amount of material that any casual fan-boy (or girl) noticed. Take the web-sacs on Peter's wrists for example... since when did Peter Parker develop spinnerets? There was of course the love story between Peter and Mary Jane, which was mostly believable (even though Kirsten Dunst seems rather cold throughout the series, reminding me of Tilda Swinton), and fan-favorite villains for Spider-Man to face off with. Something just didn't quite seem to click, though, and as the series progressed, it became more noticeable. The last film of the series tried too hard, everyone from critics to moviegoers noticed, and the series died there. This take on the beginning of Spider-Man was quite different, trying to fit into the dark mold that had been cast by Nolan's Batman franchise. Andrew Garfield plays Peter Parker wonderfully, exuding nerd-ism from his core, he is able to transform into this high-school kid that no one really knows (or if they do, they mock him), and he has a real goofiness about him. Martin Sheen and Sally Field are great as Aunt May and Uncle Ben, though I felt they didn't get a lot of on-screen time to interact with Peter. Come to think of it, the beginning of the story dealing with his parents, their leaving him with his aunt and uncle, felt a bit rushed, but you get the gist of the story when you watch it. Emma Stone is also wonderful as Gwen Stacy, and I can honestly say, the on-screen romance between Peter and Gwen is one of the most believable that I have ever seen on film. Perhaps it helps that they are a couple in real life... nevertheless, there is a certain goofiness, and realism to it, and I thought it seemed very natural. Rhys Ifans does a good job as Dr. Connors, struggling with the want to better himself and the world, and the ability to do just that. There is a Dr. Jekyll-Mr. Hyde feel to the relationship between Dr. Connors and the Lizard, and I felt that inner-conflict to mesh up with the comics very well. They may not have stuck exactly to the comics on this one, but I thought they did the best job of any of the superhero movies so far, right in line with the new Batman franchise. In conclusion, if I had to give a quick breakdown, and list pros-cons, it would be this- Pros: really good story, true to the comics (think webbing from devices made by Peter, not spinnerets), well-acted, good camera angles when Spidey is swinging. Cons: somewhat similar to the first Spider-Man (for a true reboot, this was inevitable though), the CGI, especially on the Lizard, could have been better, they abruptly gave up on Peter trying to find his uncle's killer, and nobody seems to know who the second guy is at the end (is it Norman Osborn???). All in all, it was a winner, and a worthwhile trip to the movies."
"BlueonBlue2307","Null","1","4","7 July 2012"," A Very Average Superhero Film *SPOILERS*
","Alright, first of all let me make clear that im not slating the film I just found it to be a very average super-hero film.<br/><br/>Let me set the scene, a friend of mine went to see the film a few days ago on release and said that he loved it and that it was better then the Dark Knight... Now im no idiot but just from seeing the trailer I had the sneaking suspicion it wasn't going to be as good as DK...<br/><br/>My impressions on the film are simple and can be summed up as this: ""Its nothing spectacular, its an average film."" To clarify to those who are interested, no it doesn't even touch the dark knight in anyway, shape or form... Its a much better watch, go see it if you haven't already.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with the film is that the entire main cast of characters are oddly connected to one another, the world in this remake of spiderman seems very small and oddly set up, the only way I can describe this is there just seems to be many coincidences within the film... for example it just so happens Parkers love interest and school mate is a lead intern with the villain of the film, its a coincidence that parkers father was directly linked to the spider weaving project (sigh) that would lead to his powers some years later - its also a coincidence that his father was head researcher and his best friend was again the villain of the film - this is simply LAZY writing and doest bring anything to the film. Oh and his love interest girlfriends dad is also the Captain in charge of finding Spiderman - That's a hell of a lot of coincidences right there...<br/><br/>My second gripe is that there's A lot of sign-posting in this Spiderman remake... A lot. I know signposting has become the Hollywood norm and for some reason American writers and studios like to treat their audiences as complete morons who wouldn't be able to work out the simplest of plot devices even when its explained to them ten minutes before in a previous scene... Spiderman does this... Again and again. The more noticeable scene is when Parker stumbles into the lizards lair and finds a Youtube style video (sigh) explaining EXACTLY what the lizards going to do and why he's doing it... There's then a map laid out on the table with the location of the final showdown circled in red pen and labelled for good measure - REALLY? Another example would be the machine thats very obviously pointed out to us at the beginning of the film in the OSCORP labs - its purpose can be summed up as 'It's a fancy looking Mortar, nothing more, nothing less' that Parkers dad designed (sigh.) The acting and characters are again average, but the writing lets the story down, the Police Captain who's hell-bent on bringing Spiderman to justice, OK not a bad plot, a bit batman esque sure, but the funny thing is twenty of his best men just got transformed into monsters by the giant lizard destroying downtown... That doesn't concern him though and he decides to throw everything at Spiderman who's done nothing but assist and help the cops... The captain then decides it'd be a good idea to storm the OSCORP labs with just himself and Spiderman - yet he has a small army of Police and SWAT officers surrounding the building... WHY? Who would do this? You can probably guess it doesn't end well for him and it wouldn't would it? He knew who Spiderman was afterall so of COURSE the script demanded he be gotten rid.<br/><br/>The action scenes are OK and the film is passable if you switch your brain off.<br/><br/>In short its a 'painting by numbers' kind of film."

Stepping into the shoes of Mr. Peter Parker is Andrew Garfield.<br/><br/>What ""The Amazing Spiderman"" fails to decide is the tone of the picture? Do we have a comedic superhero or dark anti-hero that will emerge over time? At times I felt as if the comedic overtone took over the picture, but there are those shades of darkness throughout. Director Marc Webb conjures a visionary tale of a comic book icon that has mesmerized children and adults alike for years. Be sure to stay for the movie after the credits begin to roll, if you leave you will be dearly disappointed at the nice twist at the end of the movie.

","Raimi tried and failed, to depict Spider-Man as a neo-Hamlet with the love triangles, deceit, betrayals, and revenge. He likened Shakespeare to...Spider-Man ? I don't like Raimi's theme of ""Love story with some comic book action"" It should be the other way around.<br/><br/>Then there was Maguire who didn't resemble anything like Peter Parker. He was just a caricature of nerds abroad. Andrew Garfield looked and sold the part as a more grounded, sarcastic, and presumptuous Spidey. Webb did a superb job of what Raimi failed to do 3 times. Show what Peter Parker did between being sappy and overly dramatic to being Spidey. In this one, we see a more vulnerable, more accessible Spidey repair his suit, training, and asserting his opinions. Abrasively, if he needs to. He also tries to adjust to his newly gained attributes such as regulating his efforts to closing doors carefully. He does this through trial and error. While the film get's off to a slow, albeit phenomenal pace, once it picks up speed, it goes full bore. Raimi punctuated dialogue heavy scenes with action. Webb seemed to make the dialogue more bearable, and less theatrical, and worked it around the action.<br/><br/>Also, Webb realized what Raimi and Burton failed to do; ""You don't have to kill the antagonist!"" While the only gripe I have, is that the agenda of Curt Connors's alter ego, The Lizard is pretty cheesy. Like it's out of a Bond film or an episode of The Tick. Webb did a different take on the style of how Spidey traverses the city. Where Raimi used a greenscreen to superimpose the acrobatics, it looked flat like Spidey was swinging in front of a cityscape painted wall. Instead, Webb opted for a more visceral and dynamic style befitting this Spidey's bolder, more confrontational style. Even utilizing first person camera angles here. Webb actually wanted the viewer to enjoy the ride as it were, without cutting it too short.<br/><br/>Also,Spidey is shown as human. He is shot and limps about while gazing in the distance at how much farther he has to go and sighs.Little,trivial things like these ground Spidey and to me, make him seem less perfect and more human as Spidey still retains his fallibility. Sadly, for Raimi fans, the more humble beginnings do not warrant the appearances of either Norman or Harry Osborn and no J.Jonah Jameson chewing up scenery since Webb is going for a re-telling origin story. This is how Spider-Man was supposed to have been told. Not Raimi's over-inflated and over-ambitious take."

In addition, I preferred the ""nerd"" Peter and not the ""cool"" Peter. Andrew Garfield is a good actor, but he is too ""cool"" to be Peter Parker. the whole thing about Spiderman is that Peter Parker is a ""nerd"", but Spiderman is not. When Andrew Garfield plays Peter Parker, Spiderman is loosing his value . . . I have to say that Rhys Ifans was awesome and I really liked his acting. Finally, I still recommend you to go and watch this movie, just do not expect any surprises. 7/10"

","Well let's start off and say this film this reboot was highly unnecessary I mean it's only been 5 years since we last saw spidey in the theaters Saying that though I have to admit this was a pretty damn good reboot of The spidey story I'll start with the pros -Andrew Garfield is a much better spider-man More cocky more sarcastic more humorous -the back-story for Peter is much more improved in this film and -Emma stone steals every scene and the chemistry with her and Andrew was great Cons -the lizard is a satisfying villain but it doesn't beat the green goblin from the original spider-man film -the fight scenes are good but only satisfyingly good They could of been better I'm not complaining though for once a good chuck of this action summer blockbuster was dedicated to back-story and a storyline which i appreciated<br/><br/>Overall it's a very good reboot of spider-man with in my opinion a better lead and it looks to be truer to the comics In some ways it beats Rami's original and in some other ways rami's 2002 classic still reins supreme"
"koggle30","5","1","4","6 July 2012"," Wasn't amazing, but it was good.
","I went into this movie expecting it to be amazing, and I came out a little disappointed. <br/><br/>I wasn't sure how Andrew Garfield would do as Peter Parker but he did amazing, he played the part very well in my opinion, Emma Stone did okay, but that may just be because I would've preferred Peter's love to be Mary Jane over Gwen Stacy. But with it being Gwen it did make the story a little more interesting. <br/><br/>Personally I didn't like the way they had Uncle Ben die, it was in my opinion much better in the original Spiderman movie. I also didn't like how the first hour and a half of the movie was him just kinda walking around doing random stuff, not enough crime fighting.<br/><br/>The Lizard was a huge let down for me, I thought he would be a cool villain, boy was I wrong. He was weak, boring, and didn't have much of a reason for doing what he did.<br/><br/>Overall Andrew Garfield was good, story wasn't what I had hoped for, didn't like how much they concentrated on Peter and Gwen's love, and didn't like the villain, but these are just my opinions."
"markhilkemeijer","Null","1","4","6 July 2012"," Perhaps unnecessary, definitely not bad, terrible pre-spoiling though
","It had been a while ago since I'd seen the trailer and the previous movies. I had watched the original trailer when it first came out and I forced myself to not watch it again nor to watch anything slightly related to this movie for that I figured the trailer showed far too much.<br/><br/>It turned out worse, as the trailer apparently happened to have burned itself into my memory and actually turned out to show the entire story. On top of that, the parts you did not see in the trailer were in the first movie which, while watching the first minutes of this movie, called itself up in my memory too. This made this movie terribly predictive. The plot to the ""I'm in trouble"" joke, who the villain would be, the love story, on top of the original story.. indeed.. story-wise there was not a single surprise. They played it safe.. actually far too safe.<br/><br/>That said, if this is the first Spiderman movie you are watching and you are sure to have forgotten most of the trailer, then this movie deserves a 8.5. It'd be very enjoyable then. Much more so then it was for me.<br/><br/>Now up to my major complaints apart from it being overly predictive.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield was a terrific Spiderman (that's a big plus) but he was not a very good Peter Parker. As much as I like Andrew portraying his characters in other movies, he is just not quite as attractive as Peter, and perhaps because he is just too attractive as a human being.<br/><br/>Basically, the Peter Parker Andrew portrays is a handsome and super smart guy who takes good care of himself and stands up for the weak when necessary. Therefore, he doesn't have a reason to be as over-the-top shy as he is apart from being extremely introvert and having to deal with a trauma of losing his parents ages ago. Not quite convincing.<br/><br/>Tobey, on the other hand, actually was the weak guy himself, the one Andrew would have stood up for without needing to have Spidey powers. He therefore much more deserved to be Spiderman. You felt sorry for him and you attached to him. I think that is also the reason why in most polls I have seen, Tobey seems to score much better than Andrew as Peter Parker.<br/><br/>Secondly (or actually thirdly), Peter Parker becomes as strong as the Hulk (and that is not an exaggeration). This, however, didn't help him a single bit in the rest of the movie. There is a funny basketball scene in which he merely uses his spider senses and sticky fingers and as Spiderman he merely fights with speed and web shooters (which actually looked a bit too fashionable for the Peter in this movie too). He could and should have done much more with his strengths. And his web shooters just did not ever run out or have issues (I wonder if they even had cartridges but the movie went far too less over the technical aspects of Spider-man to make this clear even a single bit, though there definitely was room for it).<br/><br/>Apart from the above, this was a solid, good movie. It catches the emotions well, all actors performed to the best of their abilities (great thing, no sarcasm), it is just that although I went with no expectations, all of the memories called for by the movie, from the trailer and previous movies, actually made this a very mediocre experience, stuck at a solid 7 out of 10 at most."
"ahmad_boud","7","1","4","6 July 2012"," Read this review! it describes the movie fairly
","I went in to this movie expecting a nice watch,i was convinced i was going to watch a great movie,and other than a few things,i did.<br/><br/>let me say at first,I'm a huge Spider-Man fan,everything from comics to games to movies,i don't skip a single detail about my favorite hero.<br/><br/>The film starts out with a young Peter and his parents leaving,the writers leave figuring out why up to the viewer as they do not clearly reveal why, a smart viewer should realize that his folks are hunted down,especially his father who is kinda shown as a secretive man and a scientist,along with his friend Dr.Curt Conners who later becomes the villain.<br/><br/>Peter,curious about his father stumbles across a briefcase of his,in that briefcase the name Curt Conners and Oscorp pop up,so peter goes on his search,an equation his dad figured out is the missing part in Conner's project of cross-species genetics,peter gives him the equation and he forms a serum which transforms him to the lizard,something lacking in this movie is at times very crucial,The Lizard has no clear motives for doing anything he did,all of his plans come from nothing,they are just there for no reason at all,second of all The Lizard's design is atrocious ,he did not look scary and intimidating at all,plus even when Conner's was the lizard,he looked completely in control over himself and his actions,plus everything he spoke was clear,something that is not in the comics,oh and he didn't need to inject himself every time he transformed to the vigilante,it was anger in the comics,but i turned the blind eye.<br/><br/>Back to Peter's character development,it is done brilliantly here,Garfield gives a career defining performance here,Peter's path to becoming Spider-Man feels like a journey,a lot more exploring is present in this movie,zero to none in the Raimi version,plus Spider-Man was never a true expert at swinging from the first time he invented his web shooters,and i was glad that was shown,some parts though feel rushed and hurried,adding the extra 30 minutes to this movie could have filled up those error's.<br/><br/>Emma Stone is gorgeous,she truly is a lot better than Marry Jane,Gwen Stacy fell in love with Peter Parker,MJ fell in love with Spider-Man,I'm glad that Gwen was preferred over Mary Jane,oh and Emma Stone is a whole lot better looking and better at acting than Kristen Dunst,who was just there because she was a redhead,the romance in this movie seems genuine and is really heart-warming,i do though think the kissing came a bit too early in the movie,it would have been better if there was a build-up to the huge kiss,but hey I'm kinda nitpicking here.<br/><br/>Now,on to the reason people go to a superhero flick,the visuals and the action,the visuals are great at times,but also at times they feel a bit lacking,not everything looks polished enough at times,and there is no reason for this movie to be in 3D,i kinda hoped i watched it in 2D and got rid of these uncomfortable glasses they give you,and the new suit that Spider-Man dons is kinda unnecessary,its obvious it was designed for the casual movie-goers to differentiate between this version and the Raimi ones,something that could be accepted eventually though,now let me start with the action,Spider-Man looks kinda weak here,i wonder how he will be able to handle villains with more arrows to there bows and more tricks up there sleeves,The Lizard is basically a smash-and throw villain,there is nothing complex about him(IE: The Joker or Doc Ock)back to the action again,it lacks thrill,it really could have been much much better,oh and how the hell did Captain Stacy climb all the way up to that Oscorp tower with a shotgun,and after than huge satellite pole falls down from the Oscorp tower,what happens to everything down there,oh and how did Gwen come up with an antidote that just awesomely works in 8 staggering minutes,some plot holes but hey these things are in all movies.<br/><br/>bottom line,you like Spider-Man watch this,if you were ever in doubt about this,just watch it,its worth it however you look at it.<br/><br/>looking forward to the sequel!"
"bock_g","8","1","4","6 July 2012"," A reboot that's ""webbed together"" pretty well
","""The Amazing Spider-Man"" exceeded my expectations. I am somewhat of a fan of the Raimi films and I was just as doubtful as anybody else when I heard that Andrew Garfield was gonna be the new Spider-Man. I saw him in ""The Social Network"", he's a good actor; but I didn't expect him to be a better Spider-Man than Tobey Maguire. Having seen this film, Garfield is not only a better Peter Parker, his character is a lot more interesting. The problem I had with Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker was that he was just a good-hearted geek, sort of the generic hero. With Garfield's portrayal, Peter Parker is not just the shy and nerdy outcast, he's pretty street-smart and courageous; the kind of outcast people generally look up to. He has a pretty good sense of humor which is well reflected in the more decently written dialogue than the Raimi films. Not to mention, he's much more of a genius than Maguire's Spider-Man for solving an algorithm (a reference to Eduardo from ""The Social Network"" who was also portrayed by Garfield?) that ultimately creates the Lizard and builds his own web. The fight scenes are pretty good, he constantly gets bruised and his superpowers are well portrayed compared to the Raimi films. As one can already assume from the title, the film is certainly more faithful to the comic books but also pays some homage to the Raimi films as well. The supporting characters were well portrayed and were definitely more interesting than ones from the Raimi films. Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy was smart and had some pretty good chemistry with Garfield's Spider-Man. The only flaw in the film was the Lizard. He's the typical mad-scientist with the Jekyll and Hyde-ish approach that's a little reminiscent of the Doc Ock character from ""Spider-Man 2"". The filmmakers definitely could have put more emphasis on Dr. Connors and Peter's father's relationship as well more dialogue between Spider-Man and The Lizard in the end. The only thing that saved the Lizard from being the worst villain is that he's put in jail and will very likely appear in the sequel; which would indicate that there will be some more character development for Dr. Connors. With more realistic characters and dialogue, this film is definitely a good addition to the string of awesome Marvel superhero films that began with ""Iron Man""."
"nufox-music","7","1","4","6 July 2012"," Tobey Maguire is still the best spider man!
","Andrew Garfield was a BIG mistake to be chosen as Peter Parker. He is yet too inexperienced to be able to get in character of Peter Parker. the Movies story was good, and quite interesting, the graphics needless to say was superb. But what the movie lacked was ""emotion"". it failed to get us as the audience/fans to get attached to any of the characters in the movie or we could even care less if any of them got hurt at all. No one was in any immediate danger at all, though i must say they did successfully create a scary monster which made me wonder ""how the hell are they going to defeat THAT?!?! :O"" <br/><br/>THE BEST ACTOR is most definitely ""Rhys Ifans"" who came off as very legitimate (real and believable) but the rest... well, i still prefer the original spider man series cast... <br/><br/>without emotions all stories, poems, songs, drawings and specially movies will be pointless, and will be so easily forgotten... Hollywood has to focus a lot more on adding ""EMOTIONS"" to their movies.<br/><br/>all and all the movie was fun and i had a good time. but PLEASE Hollywood - BRING TOBEY MAGUIRE BACK!!! :'("
"adrian-adamiec","9","1","4","6 July 2012"," Does whatever a re-boot can (mostly)
","I'll start off by saying that, rather than delving into exactly how comic-book accurate the film was or constructing some Garfield-Maguire Venn Diagram, I'm trying to focus on its establishment of Spidey as a plausible, unique, and entertaining (I mean, that would be nice, right?) figure, and whether in covering those bases the film left something to be desired, or bit me with the excitement-bug for future -- read: requisite -- sequels. <br/><br/>The casting: Garfield clocks in with a phenomenal effort. His Parker is believably intelligent/handy, (a theme addressed early-on so the web- spinners don't come out of nowhere) outsider-ish, (but not to the point of unapproachability) and surprisingly masterful in his nuance, pulling off the unmistakable air of a clever, you're-annoying-me High-Schooler every time he brushes shoulders with the beautifully warm Uncle Ben (Sheen) or Aunt May. I will add that the latter is rendered with her eyebrows constantly knit in worry, and thus a little too one- dimensionally/sigh-inducingly by Field, but for a totally different end of the female performance strength-spectrum, it's refreshing to watch Stone, who is as collected, sharp, and consistent as her character's fashion-sense, especially when the task is attending to her feelings for Peter. Wrapping up the actors, Leary reminds me of the first time I had dinner with my sophomore-year girlfriend's father (in only the best of ways) with a clear, if quickly/even humorously covered, place in his heart for daddy's little girl. Ifans does a very solid job with Connors, handling a script that makes his transition into the Lizard somewhat mentally... strange.<br/><br/>The Story: Peter is nudged, never shoved, into his development as both a more moral, responsible teenager and hero. A few spots feel slicked- over and underplayed, but even a spider won't lament the handful of missed gnats that precede a horse-fly; the heavily emotional climaxes Webb has littered throughout the film, taking the trendy ""hyper-human- superhero"" concept boldly where no man has -- uh oh, sorry, wrong franchise. He really does a good job with feelings, though. I also really loved how an event which jolted Parker from vigilante to public servant swings back around to rescue our wall-crawler in his greatest time of need. <br/><br/>Since they do play a measurable role as setting, I'll say realism of educational-facilities and their atmosphere gets a ""B"", redeemed by the clumsier, more troubled path to power/self-mastery that takes the well- deserved limelight for the film's majority. Spidey being much wittier (as some teens tend to attempt) also works as WD-40 for scenes where the energy/development-through-dialogue ball could've been dropped, allowing successive scenes to stick quite memorably in their place on the web of events (okay, I'll stop, I promise).<br/><br/>The verdict: A few small imperfections (*cough* Oscorp lab-security *cough*) don't take as much away from the whole as die-hard Raimi-ers might have you believe. My rating of 8.5 once again makes me wish IMDb's scale went up in half-star increments, but like any decent human being, (I wonder how many teachers are reading this) I round up.<br/><br/>Go see it."
"UberGoober1411","7","1","4","5 July 2012"," A good, but not great, re-introduction to the world of (your friendly neighborhood) Spider-Man
","Being the Spider-Man fanatic that I am (and I mean that sincerely), I went into this movie with high hopes. Extremely high. Needless to say this movie was a humbling experience which showed me that just because a series is popular enough to be rebooted, doesn't mean that the reboot will do the series itself justice. With that being said, this movie was leagues ahead of Sam Raimi's trilogy of whatever bad noun you can think of and set itself up for future movies.<br/><br/>For anyone who has ever read Amazing Spider-Man #6, first appearance of The Lizard, this movie follows that plot to a T. Well, maybe half a T, but you get my point. A more modernized version of ASM #6 that's not set in the Everglades. Peter Parker, your average skate boarding high school-er, stumbles into a lab in Oscorp (after sneaking in of course) and gets bitten by a (radioactive) spider. What follows is one and a half hours of slightly sloppy action, minor romance and astounding graphics.<br/><br/>So we'll start with the good news. The cinematography and graphical design was absolutely fantastic. Could not have been done better. The special effects on the Lizard were so real you could tell his skin was slimy and his fingers were razor sharp. Scenes of Spider-Man swinging from building to building interloped nicely with scenes of Spider-Man fighting bad guys or getting annoyed by cops. The fight scenes were credible, but could have been done better but the placement of all the characters and fluidity of motions exhibited by the pro- and antagonist of the movie made up for lack of ""pazzaz"" during action sequences. Slow motion was seldom used, but when it was it was equipped nicely and never became shopworn. The way the Lizard tore things apart while throwing them at innocent bystanders, along with Spider-Man, was choreographed perfectly and all-in-all the movie's graphical prowess is where the majority of the gold lies.<br/><br/>Behind solid acting, Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield (along with bits and pieces of Rhys Ifans) carry the movie forward and their torrid love affair never gets in the way of Parker being Spider-Man. The chemistry between these two is good and hilarious at times, because Garfield really has that whole ""awkward science nerd"" thing down pat. Aunt May and Uncle Ben were the weakest acting roles in the whole movie, and that is now dis to Sally Field or Martin Sheen. They just didn't have enough of an impact, as characters, on Parker's story and family life to have a lasting appeal to the audience. Ben's obligatory death wasn't heartfelt or difficult to bear - it just, sort of, happened. Aunt May never gave one of her ""there's a hero in all of us"" speeches (a la Spider-Man 2) and therefore didn't strike a chord in the proverbial storyline.<br/><br/>I wish I could tell you more without giving up spoilers, but I really can't. Aside from the facts that I just gave you, expect clichÃ©s and corniness throughout the film. Innocent bystanders trying to be heroes and things to that nature. And going along with the recent trend of after-credits nuggets that Marvel oh-so wonderfully set up, this movie contains a ""preview"" (if one could call it that) of the next film. I am debating on whether putting a question mark at the end of the sentence because that after-credits scene did absolutely nothing for me.<br/><br/>Enough of my talking. Here's the low down:<br/><br/>+2 for Garfield's perfect (and hot, no homo) portrayal of Spider-Man<br/><br/>+1 for Stone's great portrayal of Stacy<br/><br/>+3 for graphics/cinematography<br/><br/>+1 for comic nerd appeal"

The fact is the ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" paints a realistic portrayal of Peter Parker, I saw the Peter Parker from the comics more in Andrew Garfield than Toby Maguire. The movie just has more of a realistic feel, Rami's Spider-Man was more cartoon-ey I don't know if that's what people want but I actually enjoyed ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" I mean I found somethings that could have changed, I'll let you look for them but this movie is by far THE BEST of the Spider-Man films I loved it and was not disappointed when I saw it and I STRONGLY recommend unless you're BALLSDEEP in the Rami's Franchise, If you want a real world interpretation of Spider-Man this is the film for you"

","In England, this came out July 3, so my local 2d screening of this was near full, 9 seats left. It's worth a look, not in 3d of course, but it's much better than the last Spiderman 3.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield is a much better Peter Parker, looking and acting much closer to the Steve Ditko classic Parker. Emma Stone is charming, and looks good as a blonde, she wears these horrid boots though! The movie is very different from the Sam Rami trio, which were top entertainment, but as a first movie, this is better. The action shots of web swinging, over head shots mood good, not tight in a certain scene with the excellent Martin Sheen, which could of been handled much better story wise, that needed more time, and the movie was quite on the short side, again, 5 to 7 minutes more to flesh out the family side of things would of sorted this out, that is my only problem with this film, just a bit short.<br/><br/>Just why it cost $200 million is anybody's guess, but it's worth your time seeing this."
"neil-476","7","1","4","5 July 2012"," Enjoyment - meet Disappointment
","Peter Parker, on the trail of what happened to his disappeared parents, gets bitten by a spider, which lets him stick to walls: not as bad as what happens to Dr Curt Connors when he strays down the same scientific path, though. Peter has to negotiate a number of tricky obstacles in this movie - the disappearance of his parents, the death of his uncle, some fancy needlework, his new girlfriend (and her father, who wants to arrest him), school bullying, and a honking great lizard.<br/><br/>I should have loved this movie. Andrew Garfield is much closer to the teen Peter Parker as originally shown in Steve Ditko's pencils than Tobey Maguire was, the high school background is savoured here rather than zipped through, an intriguing mystery is placed at the centre of the movie right from the start, Curt Conners' Lizard is both sympathetic and scary, the teen romance between Peter and Gwen works, the performances are all first rate (even Sally Field, totally miscast from a physical viewpoint, is good), the action is terrific, Spidey cracks wise, and much of the CGI is superb (although I wasn't always convinced by the Lizard).<br/><br/>So why did I merely like this and not love it? I don't think it's because it's too soon after the first trilogy, although I think the reboot element was unnecessary: it consumes time and screws up the pacing. Much as I liked Martin Sheen, I think this story could have been told better with Uncle Ben already in the ground. Pacing is definitely part of it - there were points where the movie spent time telling me things I neither wanted or needed to know when it would have been better to have got on with the story. Talking of which, having started with a mystery - which I would have been quite happy to see pursued - this was effectively dropped pretty early on (to pop up again in a sequel, no doubt), which irritated me. In fact, this movie was clearly set up as an opener and that, too, irritated me - the Lizard plot line was resolved, but everything else wasn't (OK, so it's like the comics!).<br/><br/>And, while I liked the action sequences, I didn't care for the wristcam point of view, and there were places where I felt web-swinging sequences went on for far too long with no particular purposes - yes, it would take him a long time to swing from A to B, but you don't need to show every second of it.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it was good to see my old friend C (or C Thomas Howell as he is referred to in the credits) back in action in something other than a direct-to-video piece of Sy-Fy Channel tripe.<br/><br/>So, while I enjoyed it, I was also disappointed.<br/><br/>PS I love 3D, but a lot of the time in this film you can't tell it's in 3D even though it was filmed in 3D and isn't converted in post production."
"sambitroy610","8","1","4","5 July 2012"," No Comparison with the old one -- the new Spidey rocks as well
","After a long wait for the reboot of the famous Spiderman series, finally it releases in multiplexes, though suppressed by some more big anticipated movies like Ice-age 4 and The Dark Knight Rises, and it does not quite fail to amaze people by its well-told story, acting and top-notch action scenes.<br/><br/>I don't want to tell much about the story here. Everybody already knows that this is a reboot, so Peter Parker develops the power of spider within himself. The outline of the story has some dissimilarities with the one in 2002, as well as some dissimilarities, as expected. For the rest -- one should go and watch the movie. So let's concentrate on other aspects of the film.<br/><br/>The acting of everyone is very good throughout the movie. Especially Andrew Garfield with his tall, athletic figure, together with the new slick costume offers the audience a distinctive look at the Spiderman (Personally, I would call this a better Spiderman than Toby, on the basis of acting). The stunts are better than the previous one. Rhys Ifans in portrayal of Dr. Connors does a very good job. Others are also good. However, the script does not give Emma Stone much to show her acting. Still, whatever she does within the given scope is good.<br/><br/>As expected, the action sequences were fantastic in 3D. The new Spidey is more flexible, more agile (and the suit is more action-friendly, I suppose :) ). Cinematographically, the movie has a few scenes worth remembrance.<br/><br/>This movie, of course, is not flawless. After watching the movie, two or three things may seem out-of-the-basket. Anyway, this film has four or five open ends to which new sequels can be brought up and let's hope they can make up for it.<br/><br/>It is heard here and there that the new one does not have a good story like the previous one etc etc. My suggestion: do not try to compare it with the one in 2002 as two separate films, even based on the same topic, should be considered independently. So ,if you want to give your leisure time a touch of thrill, action,romance; go to your nearest theatre and check it out in 3D. I can assure you, this won't be a letdown."
"TheDarkArachnid","9","1","4","5 July 2012"," Amazing by name....Amazing in reality,
","Everyone, including myself was apprehensive about this film. Was it too soon? Will it compare? Is it too much of a directorial gamble? No, no and........NO! This film is everything a Spidey film should be. <br/><br/>I loved the original 2002 film, not because it was a cinematic masterpiece but because it was Spider-man on the big screen. SM2 was OK but flimsy(apart from Doc Ock who was superb on the whole) I mean Spidey in trouble 'Oh I'll whip my mask off, look it's me Peter please don't hurt me'! SM3 just does NOT exist! Andrew Garfield did more acting in the first 5 minutes of TASM than Toby did in 3 WHOLE movies! As Peter he was electric, the range of emotions conveyed throughout was sublime especially the argument with Uncle Ben about his Father. Then there is AG as Spidey; sharp witted, sarcastic, smooth and natural.<br/><br/>I'm not going into plot lines too much but all of it blended seamlessly, the drama was heartfelt and intense, there was tension when it was required and the action was - for want of a better word - amazing. I was worried about the CGI as it was reported to be dodgy at best but was on a par with any other of Hollywood's better Monsters, only The Lizard still had emotion.<br/><br/>All in all, in my opinion, THE greatest Spider-Man movie, if not the greatest super hero ever!"
"Anurag-Shetty","8","1","4","5 July 2012"," A refreshing take on our beloved superhero.
","Peter Parker(Andrew Garfield) finds a clue as to why his parents abandoned him when he was a boy. He meets Dr. Curt Connors(Rhys Ifans) a man who worked with his father for many years. This movie is mainly about Peter Parker when he was in high school. It follows The Amazing Spider-Man comics much more faithfully than the previous movies. So, we have Gwen Stacy(Emma Stone) as his love interest, because Gwen Stacy was Peter Parker's first love interest in the comics. Peter lives with his Uncle Ben(Martin Sheen) & Aunt May(Sally Field).<br/><br/>First off, I want to say that I liked it as much as the original: Spider-Man(2002). I loved the fact that Spider-Man mocks the bad guys when he's fighting them, like he does in the comics. The 3D was great, especially when Spider-Man swings from building to building in New York City. However, some scenes were better in the original. The character of Aunt May was more likable in the original. Certain crucial scenes like a key character's death was more emotional in the original. Spider-Man doesn't even avenge the key character's death though a lot of time is wasted trying to find him. For a couple of minutes Spider-Man fights crime only wearing a mask. Later on, he just randomly wears a red & blue spandex suit & doesn't even give himself a name. However, later when someone asks him he says he's Spider-Man. Furthermore the New York Police Department led by Captain Stacy(Denis Leary) is desperate to catch the vigilante known as Spider-Man. But, they're not at all bothered about capturing The Lizard even though he's a bigger threat. Spider-Man willingly takes his mask off for Gwen Stacy revealing that he is Spidey himself. I thought Peter Parker was his 'secret' identity. Anyway, too many people find out that he's Spider-Man which is not very Spidey-ish. There is no affection between Peter & Aunt May like in the previous movies. In Raimi's trilogy Aunt May was portrayed as an affectionate, loving & caring woman. In this movie the only thing Peter & May do is fight, argue & fight some more. This is why Rosemary Harris' portrayal of Aunt May was much better. I missed the characters of Harry Osborn(Raimi's trilogy: portrayed by James Franco) & Daily Bugle editor J. Jonah Jameson(Raimi's trilogy: portrayed by J.K Simmons). These are minor flaws though. However, the character of Mary Jane Watson is not missed. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy is the perfect replacement. She's not just a damsel in distress but a smart & intelligent girl who's ready to help Spider-Man when she can. The romance between Peter & Gwen is adorable. The only problem I had with this movie is that Peter takes too long to become Spider-Man. The Lizard was a great villain. Andrew Garfield is amazing as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Garfield easily slips into the shoes of Peter Parker & dons the costume of Spider-Man with ease. The new costume is much more slick & stylish. I loved the concept of the web shooters, following the original comics to the T. Emma Stone is impressive as Gwen Stacy. Martin Sheen is great as Uncle Ben. Denis Leary is brilliant as Captain Stacy. Sally Field was first of all too young to play Aunt May & she was unimpressive in the role. Rhys Ifans is outstanding as Curt Connors/The Lizard. The supporting characters like Flash Thompson(Chris Zylka), Richard Parker(Campbell Scott), Mary Parker(Embeth Davidtz) & Rajit Ratha(Irrfan Khan) are effective as well. The ending definitely paved a way for a sequel which Sony announced is releasing in 2014. Stick around during the credits for a crucial scene that gives a hint as to who might be the antagonist in the sequel. The Amazing Spider-Man is worth a watch. So, grab your 3D glasses, clear your mind, stop comparing it to the old movies, sit back, relax & enjoy 136 minutes of full on entertainment!"

","I have to start my review by saying - how many times do superhero movies have to end with a boss fight at the top of a hi-tech research tower? Geez, come on writers, write! Don't just repeat what others had done or put in scenes that ought to be there because of genre! Sorry I had to get that off my chest quickly because it had really bugged me for a while.<br/><br/>Now onto the review...<br/><br/>...ok, maybe there isn't much else I would like to say that hasn't already been said.<br/><br/>Good movie but not a Super movie, simply because so much of it has already been done, not just in superhero movies, but movies in general. Nerdy boy gets bullied, nerdy boy falls in love with a pretty blonde intellectual girl; finds a way to overcome growing pains, etc, etc.<br/><br/>I am not a fan of Sam Raimi's version, and I think this one has a better visual tone that fits in better with the rest of recent Marvel entries (albeit with lamer CGI). However, I will not deny that Sam's rendition is a little more light-hearted and more fun to watch in parts than this.<br/><br/>I have no doubt that the makers wanted to get this reboot out quickly so that they can move on to fresher stuff in sequels. And for that purpose, this is a strong enough start.<br/><br/>Ultimately, it's still worth the cash to go see I guess, but just stay away from the 3D version! There's nothing 3D about this movie, it's a missed opportunity and a total rip-off!"

One day he discovers his father's work case wherein he comes to know for the first time what his parents were working on all this while (Cross- genetics research). This is where his interest with Oscorp and his father's former co-worker Dr. Curt Connors starts. On his trip to Oscorp as a fake intern he gets bitten by a spider thus making him spider-man. Amazed with this, he decides to reveal his father's work to Dr. Curt Connors who then uses it to work on test mice to initial success and later is forced to perform human trials on himself. Both trials showed initial promise but cross-genetic size effects started showing up and Dr. Curt Connors turns himself into a lizard. The goal for Dr. Curt Connors is simple now, to use a powerful transmitter to transmit this dote into the atmosphere thereby making everyone in New York into this new species and the rest of the movie is completely based on Spidey stopping him from committing this crime. In parallel, Spidey falls in love with Gwen Stacy, Dr. Curt Connors's assistant at Oscorp and a police captains' daughter.<br/><br/>Good – <br/><br/>1. Amazing CGI, to be honest some scenes were just breathtaking. Technology is just remarkable nowadays. You won't feel bored anywhere in the movie.<br/><br/>2. The actors have also done a very good job, from Spidey being a shy, beaten up college kid, to Gwen being the girl everyone wants to date, to Peter's uncle, aunt and Captain Stacy trying to be good parents, to Dr. Curt Connors being a dedicated scientist, it's all there.<br/><br/>3. The occasional comic relief is welcome.<br/><br/>Bad – <br/><br/>1. They could have worked a bit more on the story by I guess this is just a restart to the series and they wanted to keep the facts straight. Also, it's a family movie that might have something to do with it.<br/><br/>2. Things just seemed a fast-paced at times; you could feel things falling in place a bit too early on. They could have put in an extra 10-15 minutes to slow thing down between 15-35 % into the movie even though the whole movie is 135 minutes long.<br/><br/>FYI - I found this to be better than the Avengers, maybe because my expectations were very high for Avengers (didn't even get close to it) compared to this one (much better than expected)."
"ssvikas","7","1","4","4 July 2012"," Refreshing reboot with great lead-pair chemistry!
","A decade after the last 'Spider-Man' movie series starring Tobey Maguire and Sam Raimi came up; Sony Pictures have churned up a franchise reboot. With fresh faces and a new director, Marc Webb, Spiderman has become more realistic as it gets closer to its comic book roots and hits the screens with far more exciting stunts.<br/><br/>The story traces the character's origins, his transition from a shy, nerdy and aloof schoolboy, Peter Parker to a superhero, Spiderman. One day in the boring life of Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield), he stumbles upon a lost research piece on cross-species genetics his dead father was working on. In an effort to find out what happened to his father, he reaches his former collaborator Dr Curt Connors at Oscorp. <br/><br/>Connors (Rhys Ifans) is working on a cure for his lost arm based on reptiles' ability to grow new limbs and is under pressure from the corporate honcho Rajit Ratha (Irrfan Khan) to deliver results. Things go terribly wrong when Connors tests the new genetic concoction on himself and turns into the 'Lizard'. Meanwhile, Parker has been bitten by a genetically altered spider and gains superhuman strength and spider skills. <br/><br/>The bulk of the 132 minute runtime is spent on how Parker comes into terms with his new powers, how losing Uncle Ben prompts him to turn superhero, his runs-in with the law and having some fun handling school bullies; all this when he is not busy with his girlfriend Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). Towards the end, when the challenge of saving the city from the Lizard emerges, Spiderman is ready for the challenge.<br/><br/>After watching reboots, it is impossible to resist the temptation to compare the film with the previous versions, especially since they were successful in the past. Per se, it would be unfair to compare special effects since technology improves with the passing of time. Even otherwise, the latest edition is better than its predecessor. <br/><br/>One, better cast: Andrew Garfield (from 'Facebook' fame) gives a more realistic Peter Parker without making him look like a wimp as Maguire did. And it's great that the series bid goodbye to Kirsten Dunst who didn't look one bit like a superhero's girlfriend. Emma stone who was seen recently in 'The Help' is an apt choice as Parker's girl and confidante. The lead pair share some great on-screen chemistry. <br/><br/>The lead pair is effectively complemented by the villain in Rhys Ifans, Martin Sheen playing the father-figure Uncle Ben, Sally Field as Aunt May and Dennis Leary as Captain Stacy. Irrfan Khan's role is best described as understated but effective. Surely, it's way better than Anil Kapoor's unfunny gig in Mission Impossible 4. <br/><br/>The second key improvement is the emphasis on Parker's intellect as he uses technology to spin webs like in the comic books where he gets his natural web much later. Thridly, the transition from a regular kid to Spiderman is handled well. The subway train scene and the one in the abandoned shipyard are very well done. <br/><br/>A notable absence in the new film is Parker's employer 'The Daily Bugle' and its editor who portrays spider-man negatively in the media. Here, he has a disbeliever in the local police chief Captain Stacy who also happens to be Gwen's father. The famous line by Uncle Ben 'with great power comes great responsibility' is missing too. <br/><br/>The film is not without shortcomings. The weirdest thing is that the high-security Oscorp building seems to allow unfettered access to interns who seem to know everything that happens there; pretty amazing huh? In the climax scene, he may have lost his webbing machine, but why does he find it difficult to cling to surfaces? <br/><br/>Every relaunch attracts a new segment of the audience and so would this latest edition of Spiderman. What's best is that the film-makers have ensured that the usual Hollywood superhero movie fans are kept happy too. For all the exciting action it has to offer with minimal drama sans sentimental garbage, 'The Amazing Spiderman' is a go!"
"cadillac20","7","1","4","4 July 2012"," Not As Great As The First Two Films In Raimi's Series, But Still Good Fun
","I really want to give this a 6.5, but as we can only do straight numbers, I'll round up. I remember when I first saw Raimi's Spiderman. There were few films like it, a high flying, greatly produced comic book film that, even more than X-Men, created a legitimate tale about a teenager getting superpowers. It was like few films I had seen before and it really got the ball rolling on the superhero genre. Yes, there were films before it that did the superhero thing, but Spiderman was different. It had a certain feeling to it, a certain oomph those other films didn't have.<br/><br/>Sadly, Amazing Spiderman doesn't have that. Now, don't get me wrong, this is a good film. Garfield delivers a great performance, as does the rest of the cast, and there are some nice additions here that even the original three films didn't have. But, that aforementioned oomph isn't there. Now, maybe we've just become so inundated with superhero films, maybe it's the shadowing of Avengers, or maybe it's because this film comes only a few years after the last Spiderman film, but there's something missing here. Where the first two films had a great spectacle and pizazz to them, Amazing Spiderman lacks that. Where there was a somewhat campy, somewhat cliché, somewhat fantasy-like performance to Maguire's performance, and the film overall for that matter, Amazing seems to play it fairly straight. Of course, they need to keep it fresh, so new factors are added, like the thankful choice of replacing Mary Jane with Parker's first real love, Gwen Stacy. There's also, obviously, some humor, because what is Spiderman without the humor. But the overall tone is so serious at times, that it becomes unintentionally funny.<br/><br/>The film is also, I think, unintentionally bland. We don't actually see Spiderman for a good hour into the film, when Peter finally dons the trademark costume. I was continually looking at the time because the beginning just drags and drags, as if we've forgotten already from the first film who Peter Parker is and how he becomes Spiderman. I love Peter Parker's back story and his origin story is one of my favorites of any Marvel hero, but the Peter Parker here is just so normal that it's hard to find it all that interesting. Where Maguire's Parker was the animated, comic book geek, the kind I like to see in Peter Parker, here, he's just a loner who goes through a typical high school outcasts life.<br/><br/>Now, I did give the film a 7, and so there are obviously good things about it. The Peter and Gwen story is good. Garfield and Stone are terrific, especially together, and Stone stands out as the near perfect superhero love interest, as she plays the part to her strengths being funny, sweet, vulnerable, as well as strong willed. In fact, pretty much the entire cast is good, including Rhys Ifans, who plays a similar villain to Doctor Octopus in Spiderman 2. The action scenes are also quite entertaining. While they were good in the original series, the mix of special effects, camera movement, and focus are fantastic here. Though, I would still argue that Spiderman 2 has the best action of the entire series. This film, however, gives hope that the next installments in the series will prove to have even better action.<br/><br/>Though Amazing Spiderman doesn't top the performance of the first two films, it is a lot of fun. It's not without flaws, but solid action and solid acting make it worthwhile."
"anthonyadamo","7","1","4","3 July 2012"," The Okay Spider-Man
","I watched this movie knowing the visual effects were going to be bad, but not as bad as it were. For a $215 million budget it was disappointing. If you're going to do a blockbuster movie, do it right - especially a reboot. Considering the original 2002 release was nominated for Best Visual Effects, it definitely took the cake on that! Everything else I enjoyed, however I don't know how true it stayed to the comic. The casting was great. Sally Field played a perfect Aunt May, and Denis Leary was good as well. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone have great chemistry together and I enjoyed watching the scenes they shared. It was the best Stan Lee cameo in any Marvel movie. I also liked that it was a little darker than the original, and a lot more different changes to the story. Although the movie ran over two hours it kept me entertained. The 3D was okay, nothing really blew me away. All in all, if you want to watch a B-movie and pay top dollar for it, then by all means, other than that wait until VOD. In my opinion, there was no reason for this reboot because there was nothing wrong with Sam Raimi's version - it looks like Hollywood is just running out of ideas. Sidebar: watch the credits"

","This is a reboot of the Spider-Man franchise, tracing Peter Parker's (Andrew Garfield) upbringing from a small child. Feeling his family is endangered because of revelations in his scientific work, Peter's father Richard decides to leave his son to be raised with his Aunt May and Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen). Growing up as a teen, Peter is an intelligent but isolated and bullied high school geek. He is also too shy to try and grab the attention of Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). Intrigued by a document he finds at home, Peter decides to investigate his father's work, leading back to the scientist Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans). Connors worked with Richard, preparing a cross species breeding program that is meant to allow people to regrow their limbs like reptiles. When Peter is bitten by a spider in the lab, he obtains incredible feats of strength and agility. Soon after, an argument breaks out at home one night, which sees Uncle Ben searching for Peter, only to be shot dead by a street thug. Looking to avenge his uncle's death, Peter uses his new found powers to track down the criminal. Yet he also realises that in between his personal revenge and eventual romance with Gwen, there is a greater threat to the city awaiting him. <br/><br/>""We'll meet again, Spider-Man,"" the Green Goblin once said. 'And again and again,' he should have added. Marvel's most famous superhero dates back to the 1960s and has survived crossing into numerous mediums, from comic books, animated TV shows and several film adaptations. The webslinger's invention by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko coincided with the popularity of the 'teenager' at the time. The comics were designed to appeal to a specific demographic by giving a superhero a set of teenage problems that were relatable to the readers. However, it took an alleged twenty-five years of development trouble, which included a script treatment written by James Cameron at one point, before the first film arrived in 2002. Sam Raimi's films proved to be outstanding adaptations of the comics because he found the balance between the action and the humanity too. All of his characters were ordinary people, fitting their heroics into their ordinary lives, and not the other way around. That's an immensely appealing aspect for anyone easily bored by computer generated fight sequences. Like it or not, Sony have decided to reboot the franchise just a decade since the start of the original trilogy. Raimi was originally meant to make an additional number of sequels but withdrew due to scheduling. Replacing him, Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst, is director Marc Webb and his young cast. Webb emerges from a background in music, directing videos for artists like Miley Cyrus and Green Day. He made his first feature a few years ago with the romantic comedy-drama (500) Days of Summer (2009). I don't have the same admiration for that film as others do and his limited cinematic filmography makes him an unusual choice for a blockbuster. With a relatively inexperienced film director, Sony has opted to take the safe route as far as a reboot is concerned. The film is not as great or as radical a reimagining as Casino Royale (2006) and Batman Begins (2005) were to their respective franchises. This is because it does not stray heavily from the trajectory of the '02 film. It presents familiar events with a darker tone, running into a few bumps along the way, but successfully introducing a handful of attractive new elements.<br/><br/>The craft of the film alone is superb: the action is excitingly staged and the story is told with great confidence. Yet at 136 minutes the film is overlong and opens with a problematic first half. The tone shifts sometimes jarringly between melancholy, dwelling on Peter's isolation from his parents, and the slapstick transformation into the webhead. It also takes close to an hour into the film for Peter to don the suit properly, which means that some key plot points, including Uncle Ben's fate, are visible but longingly withheld. Yet once the film establishes itself it allows for a funny and entertaining payoff. In spite of much of its predictability, a significant factor in the enjoyment of the film is the new relationship between Gwen and Peter. In the comics Gwen Stacy, who predates Mary Jane Watson as a love interest, didn't actually meet Peter till he was in college. Webb has chosen to bring her arc in early to freshen up the story. It's a masterstroke. The chemistry between the leads, courtesy of Emma Stone's infectious energy levels and boundless charisma, is warm and very satisfying. Is there a more charming young talent in Hollywood at the moment? Her presence is faultless. Garfield grows steadily into the film because at first he really is a teenager: not much of a talker and slightly difficult to embrace. But when he transforms into Spidey he's funny and playful with the role and that's much more enjoyable to watch. Additionally, Martin Sheen gives his experience and class to Uncle Ben and Rhys Ifans has access to a rounded villain too, one who is interested in genetic engineering, which adds touches of science and moral questions about genetic engineering against natural evolution. Is the film a necessary inclusion though? Not really. Those who haven't watched the original films will find it most engaging but it is still well-made, convincingly acted and fun. I just hope that the inevitable sequel has a few more surprises."
"nathanhall","8","1","4","3 July 2012"," The Amazing Spider-Man review - no spoilers
","The Amazing Spider-man review - No Spoiler's<br/><br/>May not be ""Amazing"" but it damn well near comes close<br/><br/>By Nathan Hall<br/><br/>BRIEF OVERVIEW:<br/><br/>A fun-filled ride for the whole family though at certain sections with this been a 12a and some parents taking their little children to see it some children were taken out of theatre so please be cautious. A superb filled out cast, excellent portray of Spider-man via his movements, speech and actions/ effects. The lizard has excellent CGI and this CGI upholds for most parts of the film. The third act is a bit wobbly though returns strong at the end.........remember this is a Marvel film so stay during credits...<br/><br/>Full Review<br/><br/>With the release of Sony's reboot on the Spider-man franchise it only comes to stand that it is inevitably going to be compared to the previous trilogy to which had its huge up and down moments this most likely been the case with Spider-man 3, and its terrible onslaught of villain over kill.<br/><br/>Though as a huge fan of the Webheads antics since a small child and waiting to see this film a lot of promotional items were released maybe to an over extent people might believe but from what you've seen in the trailers and shorts, this is only a miniscule comparison to this title. Marc Webb who is best known for his work on the 500 days of summer movie takes the director's chair on this occasion and put across his term a more ""realistic"" Spider-Man.<br/><br/>Of course no person is going to be climbing walls, free falling 30 storeys and shooting webs anytime soon.....maybe ha ha. But when it comes to his take on this film the term realistic comes in the way he presents physics set in this world and use a lot more on camera spidey-shots than CGI add in's though taken they're are still a lot of these in there, but his more humane approach to the title character and its following cast is what brings a more emotional depth off the bat to this franchise from Martin Sheen as Uncle Ben and Sally Field as a younger portrayed Aunt May.<br/><br/>Alongside this the main hero himself Spider-Man is portrayed by British actor Andrew Garfield, whose first lead role in a film comes over almost completely superb from his frail beginnings as a naive Peter Parker and growing into the man with great power into Spider-Man who embodies all the heroic responsibilities. The comedic factor in the film has it's moments though not as many as announced would and also how its presented via it's trailers but nether the less when those moments hit Garfield really shines to how Spider-Man is always meant to be. Furthermore when it comes to action scenes and moments of suspense and acts requiring dramatic effect, with help from the script Garfield does shine as the title character. I just hope that he's given the chance to shine further if a sequel though almost inevitable will surface.<br/><br/>Cast that is also included are presented by the ever wonderful and fascinating Emma Stone portraying the role of Peter's first Major love arc character Gwen Stacy and shines a lot more more than what previous occupier Bryce Dallas Howard allowed. In the film she is is not portrayed as a damsel in distress quite the opposite in actual fact. She brings a good level head and excellent acting chops to portray a strong female lead which in this day of cinema is becoming ever more present which is a very good and big step forward.<br/><br/>Other Cast members include Rhys Ifans as Dr. Curt Conners/ The Lizard (previously portrayed by poor Dylan Baker). The film from the beginning portrays him as a surrogate father figure for Parker in some of the scenes but as the film transgresses his ""evolution"" takes a foot, not just in delivery physically but through his direct acting vocal skills also. <br/><br/>To finally finish up the cast we also have Dennis Leary as Cpt. Stacy Gwen's father and leader of the hunt for the vigilante known as Spider-Man. His portrayal of the character tries to show the balancing arc's of fatherhood trying to protect his family and the heavy scales of the law tipping him in many directions when it comes the films central plot. Though his performance is quiet admirable and fun to watch on the big screen.<br/><br/>The CGI in the film is of a top notch quality even at segments to which are heavy CG bound via the Lizard and certain scenes with Spidey's movement's but none-the-less is a top job especially the facial expressions and animations done for the lizard to which was criticized heavy for his original appearance with how people see him.<br/><br/>The storyline does however have it's down moments but practically every film does, some reviewers have called it a twilight-esc Spider-Man film they are completely wrong and just using the central love connection between the title character;s as it's basis.......though this film has a more in-depth emotion take on love than the Twilight films have in the entirety. To continue though as this been a reboot we all have the ""montage sequence"" though compared to the original Spiderman film with Tobey Maguire, it actually shows the progression of the suits creation not just oh here it is and this suit feels like it could actually be made by a teenager where as the previous films were too elaborate in my books looking good but elaborate.<br/><br/>The third act of the film is basically split into two parts and this is where the film starts to wobble a little bit in my opinion but still holds strong through its final segments."
"pacmanschulte","6","1","4","3 July 2012"," Different take on classic comic book hero
","""The Amazing Spider Man"" makes a good effort to be an entertaining film, but there are more questions raised than answered in this reboot. When i walked in and sat down in the theater i didn't know what to expect, all i knew about this movie was the fact that it had different actors, different plot, and a new villain. This movie surprisingly stays true to the comic books closely. The basic premise is this: Peter Parker tries to figure what happened to his parents (who mysteriously left him when he was young) and confronts his father's old colleague, Doctor Curt Connors, a scientist specializing in the development of cross-species medication. Parker helps Connors on figuring out the missing link for Connor's theories to work and then all hell breaks loose. The difference between this Spiderman and the Toby Mcguire Spidey, is the depth of character and the dark theme. This Spiderman is a more conflicted, emotionally, than the last, as he tries to set his priorities and seek a moral obligation to do good. (which brings humanity to the larger-than-life hero. I was also kinda disappointed by the absence of one-liners from Spidey. There was comedy, but it mostly had to do with his awkwardness towards Gwenn Stacy. I also like the fact they brought Stacy first, just like in the comics.)Like i said, it's different. But the problem is the fact that the film brings up what seems to be an important point in the movie, then they abandon it about halfway through the movie. I won't tell you what it is, but i can tell you that it definitely sets up for a sequel. Also, stick around for the credits for an extra scene, to me: it was confusing. But maybe you'll make sense of it."
"kinglewy00","8","1","4","3 July 2012"," Doesn't compare to Joss Wheadon's work, but not too far off!
","First of all, I've never been so encouraged to write a review after reading the horrible reviews this film has undeservedly been getting. And only a very few of these reviews may I add, even seemed to offer a decent input as to what good reasons the film didn't work for them. It's almost as if there's a really butt hurt Sam Reimi making multiple accounts just to completely trash the film out of spite. This film isn't with out flaws, don't get me wrong, but it's in a league of it's own compared to what we were offered 10 years ago. I really don't understand why so many people keep comparing this to Reimi's films. Amazing Spider-Man is a little darker, gritter, a little more believable, more human and offers a lot more depth and character development. Unless you're literally about 12, I really don't understand why so many reviews on here are complaining about the film being set at night a lot, or the lack of Mary Jane, or the fact that Spider-Man wasn't some over powered and over the top super hero and instead we were offered a more believable character, and constantly cross referencing back forth between the earlier incarnations like they're supposed to be carbon copies rather than a reboot. So far these negative reviews seem to be coming from viewers who don't even seem to understand anything about the Spider-Man comics.This film has also been much more accurate to the story arc that this is based on so far as well. People are complaining about the CGI on Lizard. It really wasn't that bad. I mean, hello? Plastic Goblin from the original? People are also complaining Spider-Man seemed a little weak. I liked that. He's had his powers about maybe the course of a few months in the film.. I find the film easier to believe watching Peter Parker develop into Spider-Man, and seeing that Spider-Man has a more vulnerable and human side, and it adds a real sense of danger watching him take on lizard and actually come out of the fight with some cuts and bruises because he wasn't over powering the villain in a predictable way like in Reimi's version.<br/><br/>The acting was great. Garfield did a great job and the connection between himself and Stone felt authentic, although I will admit it felt a little rushed. Sheen's short but brilliant role is worth noting. Uncle Ben and Aunt May felt more genuine and believable in this version, not overly warm and stereotypical as in Reimi's which I personally found them hilariously clichéd in, and they just felt so forced it was crigneworthy. Ifans was delivered his role extremely well and naturally, although the Lizard villain himself left the audience asking a lot of questions, and it felt like his transgression from down to earth scientist to antagonist was a little rushed or scenes were heavily cut.<br/><br/>Overall, a great film. I'd almost dare say this was to Spider-man like what Batman Begins was to Batman, though far from being as engaging and having as much depth, or as much realism, and having a teenage drama theme at times. I see no real reason for anyone to as disappointed as they seem to be in some reviews, other than the fact they went in expecting a carbon copy of Reimi's camp, cheesy, over the top unbelievable action packed superhero film aimed at a younger / family audience who don't like the darker, more emotionally driven and more believable and down to earth version."
"wesleykayne","6","1","4","3 July 2012"," It was... all right.
","I normally only review movies with friends. I have never gone online and posted my opinion about a movie so this review for me is a first. So let me start this review off by saying I'm not a comic book fan or superhero fan in the first place. The Avengers was ""Meh"" for me while it was ""Wahoo!"" for others. I walked into the movie theatre not knowing what to expect. My thoughts were ""Why are they redoing Spider-Man and why is there no Toby Maguire?"". I guess I don't watch enough previews or trailers. I basically pre-rated it and judged it thinking it was going to be a complete waste of time and money. <br/><br/>Fast forwarding now... So I watch the movie and I was very surprised and impressed with what I just watched. The beginning was fast and the whole hide and go seek thing was extremely confusing. A good movie can establish characters within the first 10-20 minutes of the movie, and I felt like this process was dragging on and on and on. I was laughing at how dumb the movie was until about half way through the movie where that laughter turned into laughter having nothing to do with a flaw. So finally things began to pick up and I actually started enjoying the movie. The acting was so-so. Mostly the one liner actors were the ones I had issues with, but other than that the acting was pretty convincing. I was impressed and I didn't feel like I was watching an overrated superhero movie(though it did have many superhero movie clichés). <br/><br/>I'm not a movie reviewer and I have a tendency to ramble, so here's how I basically feel about the movie. Dragged on in the beginning but eventually it became watchable once Spider-Man starts kicking butt. I'd recommend this movie to anyone who likes action, with some subtle humor and a little bit of romance. I do not, however, recommend IMAX 3D. 3D didn't do too much to the visuals so just see it in the regular theatre and maybe you can use the extra $7 to buy yourself one overpriced soda. The Amazing Spiderman, it's watchable, but you will notice flaws that ruin the mood at times. Also... make sure you're with friends(but really... who goes to a movie alone?O_o). Friends always make movies a lot more entertaining."

","Okay, so as a kid/teen I loved the original Spiderman movies, as did most of my generation. But the third film, with a dancing, half hipster/half emo Tobey MacGuire left me damn near in tears because of my dashed hopes and dreams of Spidey facing off against Venom (Not Eric Forman in a black suit.) <br/><br/>This film, to me, has definitely rebooted a dying franchise and I, for one, look forward to more of Garfield's wise-cracking Spidey in the future. The movie had the perfect comic book feel to it and I love that they stuck fairly close to the original story regarding Gwen, Peter and Capt. Stacey. <br/><br/>The Lizard wasn't a home run, but the way has story line got a little twist from misguided scientist to full-blown genocidal mad man was a good little kick. (pretty sure that won't spoil anything.)<br/><br/>The movie starts out kind of slow, but the crescendo it builds into gives the story a little bit more realism. Half the movie is devoted to setting up the characters and their relationship while giving a few not so subtle foreshadowing hints of things to come. <br/><br/>To me the only things missing were J. Jonah Jameson and the direct quote of ""With Great Power, Comes Great Responsibility."" but I guess the last three movies beat those to death. Besides, if there's one thing Marvel knows, it's how to leave some juicy stuff for the Sequel...<br/><br/>~James"
"BRJPinkston","9","1","4","3 July 2012"," Complete Movie! First near-perfect superhero movie
","Pushing the bounds of what Hollywood filmmakers are capable of, the amazing spider man packs both a huge entertainment value and excellent emotional pull. I went in to the movie as a skeptic because I've been let down by blatant plot holes, inconsistencies in the reality of the world, and characters whose fate did not really matter to me. However, I left this movie satisfied and full of conversation topics that did not include berating the director with criticism. This rendition captures the struggle of a young man bereft of his natural parents and lives with his relatives. His father figure was very well displayed by Emilio Estevez and when he died, I cared about him.<br/><br/>Now... Peter Parker was much better portrayed as a teenager, boyfriend, hero, and son. Andrew Garfield pulled off Spiderman in a much more relatable way than Toby McGuire did in the Rami version. The banter, physique, intelligence, and emotion were much more real as portrayed by Garfield. His social awkwardness with Emma Stone was about as quintessential an example of nervous first love as they come. You felt like you understood their relationship and interaction (Emma Stone was cast perfectly as Gwen Stacy). The combat and action was easy to follow, more tight, and seemed more real. Each action throughout the movie was understandable and not outside the range of the characters that did them. <br/><br/>The villain was Dr. Connors (Rhys Ifans), and for being a half-lizard man that acted on instinct combined with intelligence and rage, he wasn't half bad (pardon the pun). I enjoyed the character range that he displayed and the change from good to bad to not so sure was quite nice. The nature of the villain was the only thing that really held the movie back from superhero perfection.<br/><br/>Overall, This movie was excellent and really makes The Avengers look as though it is merely a straight entertainment movie. I'd watch the Amazing Spiderman again and buy it on DVD as soon as it comes out. Worth a watch."
"jordangross","8","1","4","3 July 2012"," Spidey is back and better than ever!
","I was a big fan of the original 2 Spider-Man movies, just not a big fan of the 3rd film. I am glad that someone picked up Spider-Man again and told a different origin story. My hype for this film was through the roof ever since the first trailer premiered in front of Captain America Movie last year. The ultimate thing that people want to know is if this film was better than the original trilogy. Lets just say yes to that.<br/><br/>This film stars Andrew Garfield (The Social Network, Never Let Me Go), Emma Stone (The Help, Superbad), Rhys Ifans (Little Nicky, Anonymous), Denis Leary (Rescue Me, Ice Age), and Martin Sheen (The West Wing, The Departed).<br/><br/>The 3D in the film was a mixed bag of good and great. When the action scenes were not going on, the 3D was decent with the depth, but there was nothing really popping out of the screen. Now, when there is action, the 3D gets enhanced and it pushes really far out of the screen. The 3D and IMAX 3D showings of the film are you best bet to get the best experience out of the film.<br/><br/>When Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is young, his mother and father drop leave him in the care of his aunt and uncle. Once he is older and in high school, he finds some of his dads old stuff and starts to snoop and get into it. He finds his dads old work partner and helps him finish his project to regenerate skins cells and regrow limbs and such. At the same time he is falling for Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) who's dad is the police Captain. While dealing with the cops and the results of Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) project, Spider-Man has a lot to deal with. <br/><br/>I thought this film was spectacular. I enjoyed every action scene, story based scene, and romantic scenes. There was only one real main problem and that was the pacing of the film. It felt like they rushes the begging story line scenes just to get him to be in the Spider-Man suit as soon as possible. Other than that the film was really well done and well directed. I don't think this film will do as well as ""The Avengers"" did or ""The Dark Night Rises"" will, but I think it is a great super hero film. I can't recommend this film enough. If you are a fan of Spider-Man, than this film does justice to the Spider-Man franchise.<br/><br/>Rating: 8.5/10<br/><br/>Thank you for reading my review, any feedback is greatly appreciated!"
"prateeksanghi","6","1","4","2 July 2012"," Too similar, too light.
","I had feared a not true to comic book storyline. What I got was a slow and borderline boring first half with the same story being retold with minute changes. Even the origin story of the antagonist is too similar to the Green Goblin storyline --> pressure of success and personal demons lead to a good guy taking risks of the bio-chemical kind and turning evil.<br/><br/>While the action sequences are good and the 3d is great, the storyline and the screenplay is (for the lack of a better word) extremely 'teenybopper' in nature. I know that the characters are teenagers, but at times I felt like the scene was out of gossip girl.<br/><br/>What I did like were the actors. Garfield was OK, but Stone, Sheen, Fields, Leary and Ifans are immensely likable and did a good job.<br/><br/>The light tone of the movie and the treatment ensure that it will have a an extremely wide reach. The audience was primarily made up of families in the theater where I saw the movie. This wide reach will lead to this movie making a lot of money, and it may even do better than Avengers and TDK but is not even close to being in the same league. <br/><br/>I hope that the minor changes in the origination plot will lead to a better sequel (there will be one) that is grittier and darker and tells us a new story."
"swecritic","7","1","4","2 July 2012"," A surprising improvement, that left potential
","Firstly off. The casting, and the execution of the casting was great. Garfield outplayed Maguire by miles. Most of the acting was spot on. I do though believe that Ifans and Sheen could have done better, but It was mostly because the manusscript could have been a little bit better. For example, the main theme of spiderman has always been ""With great power, comes great responsibility"". We never witnessed that on the screen. That was quite a shock. <br/><br/>Also a few scenes seemed to bee cut off from the trailer. For example a scen where Ifans character Dr Connors says something like ""Peter, you have no idea what you are"". Not in the movie. Maybe it will be on the directors cut.<br/><br/>By the way, I saw the movie in 3d and the CGI was a lot better than in the original trailers, which was something I was worried about. Also the humour was most of the time spot on the whole audience laughed together. Yet, I feel there were a lot of space for improvement. For example was some of the action scenes a little bit to long, and sometimes the story felt rushed. <br/><br/>Well, primary, what Webb and the guys did, was the best and most accurate spiderman interpretation so far. It certainly had it flaws, but it was an improvement of the old three and in my opinion overrated films. This one had humour, suspense, thriller and even though a lot of questions got answered, they succeeded buildning a story arc they can build on to with another movie, which potentially will make this one even better.<br/><br/>My guess for next enemy? Mysterious. A scene after the credits displayed something that made me think of him. But the revealed sickness of Orman Osbourne surely leaves green goblin ready for a role.<br/><br/>All in all, good movie, and great entertainmant. A solid 7 / 10 with flaws but with all that you can aspect from a precise executed popcorn flick."
"workmanb","10","1","4","27 June 2012"," Finesse
","Alright so The Amazing Spider-man... definitely redeemed the past spidey films but it's ever so slightly and mildly disappointing I can't quite put my finger on it; other than maybe i was just tooo excited going into the film. But overall its an actual movie to watch. Nearly standalone, which is to say there's more movie to watch than there is actual Spidey action! which is great. <br/><br/>overall though its the best spiderman yet! not cheesy like tobey maguire...its up to par with the, relatively new, superhero genre. It was a bit more charming as far as not emphasizing his new powers as this big huge deal. it was just a high school kid who had some physical changes happen. It was more graceful and more tasteful. You see him grow into Spider-man in this film but not as a superhero. He grows into a man with purpose who just so happens to be a 'spider-dude' Whereas the past films were heavily focused on him being a superhero and the duality of his life that it becomes too distant to relate too....<br/><br/>This movie also doesn't have a hard hitting ONE thing that needs to be accomplished, You see he has himself to figure out, uncle ben, aunt may, Dr. Connors to deal with, Gwen Staci and her father, and Parker's parents' story. I'm assuming a lot of people won't like it simply because they need to be spoon-fed their movies. The Amazing Spider-man doesn't have a million explosions and guns blazing! He doesn't develop powers and then change his entire outlook on the universe and view himself as this ultra-important god-like being that needs to save the world. He more or less uses his abilities, sometimes!, as would most of us in his position. We wouldn't just morph into this absurdly next-level being, which he is, it's just not the focus of the film and it's not even Parker's focus in the film. much more real, easy to relate to. i think the key word for this film is: finesse<br/><br/>Must See! and must remove Sam Raimi's films from memory. This is the only Spider-Man."
"hrishikesh2007","7","1","4","1 July 2012"," The Amazing Spiderman - Amazing in many ways, though digressing in some
","I count myself among the biggest fans of the Spiderman Series. So when I heard about the series reboot idea, I felt a bit skeptical about it given that Sam Raimi delivered an enthralling trilogy. The promos looked quite promising, although many of the scenes were repeated in the subsequent trailers. <br/><br/>""With great power comes a great responsibility"" - it does look that Mark Webb did a fairly good job with his directorial power. Utilizing his years experience in directing music videos and documentaries, he proved his might in directing a superhero movie on which the entire production house pinned its hopes upon (ofcourse after his wonderfully directed venture - 500 Days of Summer). The movie has its moments which mesmerize you, the moments which make you feel the anguish of Peter Parker and those which bring a smile upon your face. <br/><br/>Casting of the movie could have been no better. No character is out of place and each one plays their role perfectly. Andrew Garfield does full justice to the roles of the naive and diligent Peter Parker as well as the quick witted Spidey. Emma Stone adapts the screen well with Andrew as his love interest and delivers a fairly good performance. Rhys Ifans fits in well as a scientist cum professor Dr. Kurt Connors and the fearsome Lizard. Martin Sheen and Sally Field as Uncle Ben and Aunt May, do not disappoint either. The emotions are carried as well as delivered with fine performances. <br/><br/>Coming to the negative points of the movie, it lacks a coherent script and does not deliver as it had promised in the promos. It was disappointing to not witness a complete story in one movie. There are quite a few loose ends that are kept open (or may be even forgotten by the script writers),which perhaps could have been given a neat finish. <br/><br/>And if I have to compare to the previous Spiderman series, I'm sure everyone will miss J. Jonah Jameson. His aggressive character did win applaud in the previous series and his absence is surely felt in this new venture. The background score is not at all captivating. I believe the true essence of a scene lies in its background score, be it an action packed sequence or an emotional one. In this regard too the earlier Spidey wins the vote. The special effects in the entire movie are dismal. The action scenes involving the Lizard do not last long enough to enthrall the audience. <br/><br/>Summing it up, the movie does its job of rebooting the Spiderman Series with a bang. I hope the script writers learn their minor mistakes in this venture, and deliver a stunning script in the sequel to this movie. Two things for which the movie is watchable - Andrew Garfield's stunning performance and the 3D effect of swinging along with the Spidey. Wooooo!"
"michael-burnard","2","2","13","12 April 2014"," Good God, this movie was bad.
","Let me get one thing out of the way before I start: Yes, I am a fan of the 2000s Spiderman movies. I think they're great. But no, I am not judging THIS piece of crap as a follow-up or a remake or a rehash. I can accept that it is trying to be its own movie. And boy, does that movie SUCK. First, let's bring up the biggest problem in this movie: Andrew Garfield is not Peter Parker. Don't give me that crap about 'modernising the character'. Peter Parker is, and always has been a social outcast looking in, and he doesn't need to be a total science nerd to have that still apply. But Garfield somehow interprets the character as a sour emo kid, who skateboards and stands up to bullies and breaks into buildings. How could this happen? The entire point of Peter becoming Spiderman is that a repressed individual is allowed to become more confident in himself, but if he's already confident in himself, WHAT'S THE POINT!? Another big problem with this movie is the villain. At least the Raimi Spiderman movies had villains with actual motivations. Norman Osborne was driven insane, Doctor Octopus was trying to complete his work, hell, even VENOM at least had a reason to hate Spiderman! But in this movie, as soon as the bad guy turns into a lizard, he just automatically starts trying to take over the world. There's no motivation, no backstory, he's just like 'Hey, I'm a lizard, time to become ruler of mankind'. Also, can I just say that they COMPLETELY misunderstood the entire point of Uncle Ben's death? The original character of Uncle Ben was the one who said the famous quote 'With great power comes great responsibility', and he only died because Peter wasn't holding true to that moral. In this movie, Ben just kinda dies so that Peter has a reason to become a hero. Which means his role could have been filled just as well as any random Johnny getting killed! Avoid this movie like the plague. It has killed all hope of me seeing a good Spiderman movie come out in the next 20 years. And now I really hope that Spiderman never shows up in an Avengers movie. The idea of whiny emo Garfield polluting the single greatest superhero franchise of all time just makes me sad."
"pj-hack","2","2","13","5 April 2013"," Another Unnecessary re-make
","I spent nearly all of watching the film on TV wondering ""why did they make it?"" I'd seen the Toby Maguire version and thought it was OK. But a remake so soon??? Have they really got money to burn in Hollywood? THE GODFATHER is forty years old. Isn't it about time they did that again? When you've seen one Spiderman swinging through the New York skyscrapers you've seen them all. Remakes normally are a pain and this one confirmed that generalisation. The production did nothing in my mind to justify doing it all over again. Maybe the flying sequences were superior, technically, but does that really justify a complete remake? Are they really so hard up for ideas?"
"jerrybrsc2","8","2","13","4 July 2012"," A Solid Reboot? You bet.
","OK, so the burning question on everybody's mind is; Is this Spider-Man better than the Sam Raimi directed version starring Toby Maguire? Answer, yes. But in all fairness, that is a loaded question. Is this film a better origin story than the original ""Spider-Man""? Yes. Is it better than any other Spider-Man movie that came before? No. It's better than ""Spider-Man"" and it's a hell of a lot better than ""Spider-Man 3"", but ""Spider-Man 2"" is still (in my opinion) the best Spidey movie that's ever happened, and it's gonna take some serious wizardry to top that one in the future. I'm going to try and break down this film as best I can and tell you what's good and bad about it. Here we go: Character wise and story progression, the direction by Marc Webb is fantastic. He did a great job of capturing the character moments that really moved the plot along and kept you invested in the characters. Webb's direction is much better than anything Sam Raimi did in ""Spider-Man"", because Raimi seemed more concerned with the feel of a live-action comic book. When you look back and watch ""Spider-Man"" now, it's easy to see just how close to a graphic novel or comic book it really is. When you watch this film, it's almost like you're watching a scene from ""The Dark Knight"" it's so far removed from the comic books that inspired it. Good job Webb.<br/><br/>As far as the acting and characters go, they were all perfect to me. Andrew Garfield was phenomenal as Peter Parker, and as Spider-Man. His rendition of Peter was a very socially and personally repressed individual, who had numerous personal issues, and he was much more complex character than I was personally expecting. In the Sam Raimi film, he was a pretty straight forward character: he's a nerd, he has a crush, he gets bitten by a spider, he gets his powers, his uncle gets killed, and he sobers up immediately and uses his powers for the best. In this movie, Spider-Man is a cocky, smart ass teenager who, just because of the death of his uncle, isn't just gonna go out and fight for ""truth and justice"". In fact, the whole character arc of ""with great power, comes great responsibility"" comes later on at the end of the movie, and is the major driving force of this film, not necessarily one specific ""villain"". In fact, the villain in this movie is a side effect, of sorts, of this character driven storyline. In the Sam Raimi ""Spider-Man"", it always seemed like the driving force of the whole plot was the threat of Norman Osborn and by the time he becomes a threat to New York, Spider-Man is already out swinging around kicking ass and has mastered his powers completely. In this film, it really shows the work that goes into understanding his powers, and even shows the limitations of them, which is interesting. On a side note, I loved the concept of him having to construct his web shooters. One, it's more faithful to the comics, and two, it really illustrates the intelligence and skill that Peter Parker possesses.<br/><br/>Emma Stone was excellent. She plays the part of Gwen Stacey as a very smart, cute, and sexy love interest to Peter Parker, and the relationship is believable and sweet. That's the best way I can describe it. And here's a switch; she was actually useful to Peter and the plot line. She wasn't anything like Bryce Dallas-Howard's version of Gwen as this essentially useless damsel in distress, and was definitely a huge improvement over MJ in Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man"", because all MJ did was scream and cry for Spidey to save her every 5 seconds. There are 2 action sequences in that film where Spidey fights the Goblin and MJ is just screaming in the background. Thank God for Emma Stone and this reboot.<br/><br/>Rhys Ifans, did the best job he could have done with his character of Dr. Curt Conners aka The Lizard. This is really the weakest part in an otherwise strong film. The story focuses almost too much on Peter and Gwen, and therefore leaves most major character development for anybody else to fall by the wayside. All you know is that this man worked with Peter's father, he has only one arm, and he is desperate to get it back no matter what the cost morally or physically to anyone or anything, up to and including himself. I really think that had the script allowed for more time to focus on Conners, like showcasing his wife and son, etc., then it would have been more emotionally engaging, and as the ending is now, it just feels a little bit hollow. If the film had made it a bit more clear that Peter's ultimate goal was to save Dr. Conners from himself, so to speak, rather than to get to Gwen and save Gwen, Gwen, Gwen, Gwen. Too much on the central characters when secondary elements needed to take over.<br/><br/>There were just a couple other minor problems that I had with the film, one of them being the concept of Peter's Parents. It's very evident that his parents are key to the plot, but after the first, I'd say half hour, it focuses less on them and more about Peter and his powers. I would have liked more back story on Peter's parents and how that relationship impacted Dr. Conners as well. Secondly, after Uncle Ben is killed, Peter searches like a madman for his killer. But unlike the Sam Raimi ""Spider-Man"", he doesn't ever find the man who did it, and he just kinda stops looking after a while. I mean, you can easily rationalize it in the plot of the story, but it's just a little strange that he just stops, no matter what personal discoveries he makes and what he decides to do as Spider-Man.<br/><br/>8/10 easy."
"alexadfrazer","8","2","13","4 July 2012"," More ""faithful"" take on spiderman
","I saw the film and really enjoyed it. Maybe it's because this is the first film I saw in theatres where a kid didn't start crying half way through. Although, in all seriousness, it's quite a good movie.<br/><br/>The beginning of the film is mere exposition and reiteration of the spiderman series. It quickly mentions how Peter Parker became Spiderman in a way slightly different (but mostly the same). In classic comic book style, the antagonist is ""created"" and a classic rivalry is formed. It is a bit slow to get off the ground, because you know what's going to happen for the first 30 minutes... but hey, it's still a fun watch. One thing that is interesting to be noted is that the spiderman powers are actually DIFFERENT. It's actually closer to Stan Lee's original vision of Spiderman. He thought it was a bit silly that a man would be shooting webs, so he recommended that Peter had a machine that does it. His powers are not absolutely ludicrous like some heroes.. He can jump, react super quick, and do things like that, but nothing ridiculous. All in all, I'd say the storyline is fairly ordinary, to be honest. It's nice that they avoided the overly dramatic character development like ""with great power comes great responsibility!"" or ""I never asked for these powers!""... they have some quick mentions to vigilanteism, but done tastefully. Regardless, it does have struggles that the characters face, but their quite a bit more down-to-Earth feeling.<br/><br/>The thing that got me was the whole aesthetic of the movie. Most comic book movies go for the modern ""gritty"" or ""dark"" stylings. Batman, Spiderman, Watchmen... you know, that whole super dark thing is popular now. Instead it does a very ""classic"" feeling. It even permeates throughout the colors, you'll see vibrant contrasting colors clashing like in an old comic book. The green of the villain against the red of Spiderman. It's a lot more ""colorful"" than other movies of the same genre. That's one of the #1 things I liked about the film, their willingness to be a bit more creative and avoid what's ""popular"".<br/><br/>Another thing that REALLY hit me was the cinematography. The first person scenes, WOW. And when he is running and jumping across alleys, the camera does a beautiful job of capturing where the energy is. They always had a nice sharp focus on what was important in the scene and made the expression and emotions obvious. Fantastic job!"
"gilligan-11","8","2","13","4 July 2012"," Worth the reboot
","Despite all the hand-wrenching and teeth-gnashing over the idea that it's just too darn soon to remake Spider-Man, this film proves that there's no time like the present. Andrew Garfield, who seems born to play the role of Peter Parker/Spider-Man, delivers a nuanced and multi- dimensional performance that will erase the memory of Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man from the minds of all but the most hardcore fans of the original. The fact that most American film-goers aren't very familiar with Garfield (if they do know him, they might have a vague memory of his performance in ""The Social Network"") seems to work in his favor—he doesn't need to shed the baggage of any earlier roles to convince the majority of the audience that he is indeed Peter Parker.<br/><br/>As for the plot, it's pretty standard comic book hero/action hero/monomyth hero action fare—but the plot isn't really the reason you go to see a movie like this. The supporting cast—Emma Stone, Denis Leary, martin Sheen, Sally Field, and Rhys Ifans— is top-notch, and the action sequences are artfully balanced by dialogue that develops the characters and adds insight into their relationships. The 3D effects are very well done and used judiciously so as not to overwhelm the film, and Marc Webb (what a great name for the director of Spider-Man) does a masterful job directing just his second feature film.<br/><br/>Be sure to stick around after the first round of credits—there's a teaser scene that hints (very obscurely) at the sequel."
"jamesthecat-67828","1","2","14","22 February 2016"," When Spider-Man became pointless
","I disliked Spider-Man 3, but it wasn't so bad that the franchise needed to be rebooted and the audience delivered the exact same origin story.<br/><br/>Watching this as they try not to say classic lines such as 'with great power comes great responsibility' is cringe-inducing. When reappraising Sam Raimi's movies, you see how skillfully he set up all of the protagonists, and Spidey's relationships felt natural. The Amazing Spider-Man movies screwed-up it by attempting to alter the order slightly, to fool the audience that what they're seeing is fresh. Instead of an enjoyable, competitive friendship with Harry, Peter has no one to spark off. Instead of giving the school bully what he deserves, he just takes his basketball off of him and is even forced to apologise for that.<br/><br/>Then there's Andrew Garfield. At least Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker was a convincing nerd, what is Andrew Garfield's? He's a loner, yet popular. A science geek, yet skateboarder with perfect hair. It's like one character was made by committee. <br/><br/>What else to mention? The awful CGI rat? The sub-plots which go nowhere? I could go on, I just really hated this."
"marveldcfanreviews","1","2","14","28 January 2014"," Far From Amazing
","Where to begin? From the first trailer for this movie I was worried, and once I saw it my fears were confirmed. As far as the story goes its basically a rehashing of Spider-Man's origin story with a few changes. The famous line ""With great power comes great responsibility"" is completely omitted from the film and that line is what is supposed to inspire Peter. The acting in this film was mediocre at best with the exception of Martin Sheen. The films main villain The Lizard looks cheesy and is portrayed weakly. This film tries to hard to have a style similar to that of Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy which doesn't make sense as the characters are tonally different from one another. Also director Marc Webb tries to pander to the Twilight fans by making this version of Peter Parker a depressed kid just wanting to be loved. This film has ruined a once great character and is the beginning of a trilogy that only looks to go downhill from here. Avoid this film and watch the old Sam Raimi Spider-Man films."

","After the previous three ""Amazing"" Spider Man movies, this one is one Spider Man movie that should never have existed. The studio is obviously trying to make extra cash, and with no regard to plot or acting, made a shallow movie with the thinnest plot possible, that looks more like a video game or a comic from the 60's. Everyone was expecting spider-man to face the Lizard these past few years, and now that is finally happened it's a disaster. Peter Parker has been transformed to a cool kid super-genius set on a path to save the world. Unfortunately the only intention of the studio people was to create some nice cool looking cgi fight scenes, and hope people would pay to see them on the big screen. To their disappointment though, I am sure that many 21st century moviegoers have grown a brain and expect a plot even at a super hero movie like spider man.

The story was too simple, yet somehow confusing. <br/><br/>Of course, I have to compare it to the movies in the Spider-Man trilogy.Those 3 movies are some of my favorite action movies. But this just makes those films look bad, and if they make the two more movies everyone is expecting from this, there will probably be villains named ""Dr. Squid"", ""The Dirtman"", ""The Old Goblin"", and ""Toxin"". That's exactly what they would do in this movie. They would make it so similar, yet so different to the originals.<br/><br/>The stupid lizard guy doesn't even have an interesting side to him. I recommend saving your time and bedim on this to go see The Dark Knight Rises."

","going to watch this film my expectations was high i liked the first 2 spidermans but the third one went too far, this reboot however was just what was needed for the franchise the film is more faithful to the comic and to the cartoon i used to watch as a kid Andrew Garfield is the perfect peter parker he has humour and really seems to understand the character. Emma stone is way better as the love interest the villain is the only slight problem with the film as you never really are convinced hes evil just a very confused person but this is the first film so the villain can be dodgy overall the film is a good reboot and i cannot wait to see what happens in the sequel. P.S stay a little bit after the credits roll up there is a scene with Dr Conner's is prison."
"pzazz_hij","8","2","14","4 July 2012"," It needed to be different... And it is!!!!
","I feel it unnecessary to comment on the plot of this one because i think that EVERYONE by now knows the Spider-Man story. This ""version"", however, asks the simple question, 'Do you know Peter Parker?!'<br/><br/>Without comparing too much to the Sam Raimi films (which, for the record, I absolutely love) they had no interest in the true origin of Peter Parker, it was all about who and what Spider- Man is to the people and himself. That proved not to be a bad thing and certainly Sam Raimi's efforts to create Spidey for the big screen went down as a major success all round.<br/><br/>In order to reboot something so well loved and so soon after it was a hit you cannot do the same thing again, there simply isn't any point! This film needed to be different, it needed a fresh side of the story and a reworked main character... They absolutely did that!!<br/><br/>The difference here is that Spider-Man is only one layer of something much bigger. Peter Parker IS Spider-Man and its about him and his reason to do what he does and the responsibility in doing so. Certainly one downside is that this theme was explored quite extensively before, but this is managed to work as a fresh and not overused theme.<br/><br/>As for the new Peter Parker, Andrew Garfield, there really isn't many criticisms that you can make towards him. He really does do a great job in exploring the more scientific mind of both the nerd behind the mask and the web head himself. Even better than that he captures the emotion of a troubled teenager. He has a gift that he wants to use for revenge but instead decided to use it for good, this is perfectly played out in the scene in the car park, the way he speaks to the cops to defend himself is perfectly believable and again captures his teenage ignorance to the world he has thrown himself into. This is very nicely shown through a well written scene in which spidey saves a young boy... I think you will agree when you see it.<br/><br/>Now, I can't go without mentioning the villain. The Lizard is quite fantastically realised by Rhys Ifans, or rather Dr Connors is excellently played by him. Many will argue that Lizard is too heavily CGI, they may be right, but it never feels overdone and his overall detail is very true to its origins. The best thing about Connors is that he toys quite brilliantly with the ideal of a mad scientist without actually surrendering to the label. His brilliant mind becomes corrupt by what he accidentally turns into and ultimately this sets up a very nice showdown.<br/><br/>Clear to say that I really enjoyed this new take on the Spider-Man story and i do believe that it is set perfectly for another that would likely be even better and could surpass even that of Spider-Man 2. The Amazing Spider-Man is different. Thats not a bad thing. Give it a chance to show you why!!<br/><br/>P.S Stay for the end credits ;)"
"awkwardmatt","9","2","14","4 July 2012"," The Amazing Spider-Man lived up to its title.
","*MINOR SPOILERS*<br/><br/>The wise-cracking, web-slinging masked vigilante is back for a reboot and it doesn't fail to deliver. It had the key ingredients: brilliant actors who were believable in an unbelievable world (namely Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker/Spiderman and Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy), great chemistry, revelations, character development, good tone and balance between humour and heartfelt moments and generally an entertaining, action-packed time to be enjoyed by all.<br/><br/>This Spiderman was a lot more entertaining to watch and with each emotion or timely one- liners played brilliantly by one Andrew Garfield. It was great to see him in a leading role for a Hollywood blockbuster and this showed that he is capable of being a leading man. The character development for Peter Parker wasn't overly rushed and a lot of the unnecessary dialogue was removed, leaving a cleaner film with less clutter and unnecessary repetition of lines (there are a few clichéd or clunky moments, but nothing that really detracts from the entire film or nothing that makes you want to walk out of the cinemas).<br/><br/>I'm a big believer in ""show, don't tell"" when possible. Sometimes subtle lines, moments and body language can tell a story more powerfully than lengthy dialogue ever could.<br/><br/>Apart from that, there are a handful of stock-standard Hollywood clunky and clichéd moments that seem to go hand-in-hand with anything to do with overcoming all odds and with science which, while making more sense than Raimi's versions (cross-species genetics and why the spider was ""radioactive""), for the most part seems to be dumbed down to a basic level for the audience. However it was enjoyable to see this version of Peter Parker being slightly less of a loser and more of a child prodigy, taking after his father. Lastly, Spiderman's movements seemed much more fluid, strongly representing a man-spider hybrid. <br/><br/>Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy was also a welcome addition to the film. I liked that she wasn't the typical damsel in distress of most movies of this genre. She had her own personality and wasn't just a reactive character. She was funny and smart, jumped in and helped others, even risking her safety and life, because she believed it was the right thing to do. To me, this is a much more entertaining love interest than the droning whines of someone constantly crying for help. Stone and Garfield are always delightfully adorkable and, put together, create some magical moments. The chemistry between them in this film was intense which just added to the believability of their relationship (go figure). There are a couple of scenes that almost made me feel like a pervy voyeur, witnessing a private moment between two lovers.<br/><br/>The baddie for this film was Dr Curt Connors/The Lizard played by Rhys Ifans whose motives of ambition and desperation weren't as developed as they could have been. His to's and fro's between his motives seemed almost manic but I guess that fit the character with the ""voices in his head"". Denis Leary playing the antihero, Captain Stacy, and Sally Field and Martin Sheen as Aunt May and Uncle Ben were also entertaining to watch, adding some heart to the film.<br/><br/>All in all, I think most viewers will either love it or at least be entertained by it. It's quirky and funny when it needs to be, but is also serious and moving at just the right moments with the lead actors playing each part and moment to a T. The obligatory Stan Lee cameo scene drew quite a few laughs as well.<br/><br/>P.S. Stick around for the credits. Like all films of this genre, there's an additional short scene hinting at a sequel."
"oni_domingo","9","2","15","4 July 2012"," Best Spider-Man Origin Yet
","Note: For you to really enjoy this movie, you have to think that the Sam Raimi versions never existed and if you can't do that, just don't compare it to Spider-man 1-2-3. It's great that I was never a fan of the Raimi versions.<br/><br/>On to the review.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-man is simply amazing as the title puts it. It's a much more realistic approach for Peter Parker's Origin. The chemistry between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy is seen and felt in each of the scenes they were in. Martin Sheen's Uncle Ben is very charismatic. He may never have a great quote for Peter but what he gave was more than words as you really feel what he says. Sally Field's Aunt May isn't utilized more in the movie and in some reviews that I've read prior to watching the movie says she was one of the weakest link of the film but for me, she was not. Curt Connors/The Lizard is quite OK as the main villain. CGI looks great. How Spider-man moves and poses are brought to life well. Awesome fight scenes. Jokes are funny and not forced funny.<br/><br/>Though the movie is awesome, it is not perfect. The 2 hour long running time of the film seems a bit short and it shows. Some scenes are not as well established as they were supposed to be so I'd assume they were cut for shorter running time. I wouldn't have mind if the movie was 3 hours long since the movie is far from boring.<br/><br/>Awesome movie and definitely worth the admission ticket."

","Let's just look at the two leads. I assume they got the roles because they're very thin and received solid Cs at acting school. Cs due to extra credit for whining, sniveling, and looking constipated. Just the way Gable and Leigh showed emotion. Or perhaps Rebel Without a Cause would be a better comparison. With Stone in the James Dean role and Garfield with Wood's or Mineo's role might be better for Garfield. Wood might be too butch. To be fair there was a conscious effort in the writing and directing to make Goldfarb weak to fit a PC agenda. But Goshdarned is already weak. Compare him to a professional actor like Bruce Dern. Dern has way more screen presence. But even though Dern conveys certain things to an audience quite well, he is limited compared to an actor like Steve McQueen. Gumfair has no subtlety with facial communication and doesn't seem to know anything about body language and trick ticks to hold attention."

","OK,at first when I heard they were going to reboot the franchise I was like,''hell no,don't remake it,it's going to be crap.''Then I saw the trailer and thought it actually might be decent....and..it really is better than decent.OK so,The Amazing Spider-Man starts off with Peter Parker and Andrew Garfield plays off Peter Parker very well because you can relate to him if your still in school or you remember school.He's that kid who's smart,but does not speak up because his confidence is at a low,but when he becomes Spider-Man,his confidence boosts up so high,he actually asks Gwen Stacy out.Emma Stone is awesome as Gwen Stacy(better than Bryce Howard did)and one specific thing I love about her is that she isn't a damsel in distress like Mary Jane.She hits the lizard and try's to burn him without spider-mans help.Speaking of The Lizard,Rhys Ifans is awesome as Dr.Connors.He has that menacing grip that it needs,but then again it does not.The Lizard thinks he helping New York by releasing a toxin that will turn them into Lizards and I think that is a pretty dumb plan.I know that he's crazy,but how would turning everyone into crazy Lizards help them?I mean he is a lot smarter than that.Anyways,Dennis Leary is a great actor for Captain Stacy because he looks like Captain Stacy from the comics.I really like how they changed his death from being him smashed in bricks to him being stabbed by The Lizard with his long nails.Anyways,the other actors were terrific and this is a movie cool enough to buy on DVD."

"MarvelFan123","8","1","5","15 November 2012"," ""Amazing"" lives up to its name and is better than the original Sam Raimi trilogy.
","Spider-Man is a comic book superhero that was created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko and is published by Marvel Comics in 1962. Stan Lee wanted to create a teenage superhero considering that most Marvel characters that he has created were mostly adults. Spider-Man didn't start out in his own comic book series, he actually made an appearance in the Amazing Fantasy #15 and from that point, that's when he had his own comic book series and Spider-Man comics are still being published to this day; he became of the most popular and spectacular superheroes around. If you want to see my other Spider-Man reviews, then go ahead because I actually have strong opinions on Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy. <br/><br/>After Spider-Man 3, I was praying for a reboot for the franchise and The Amazing Spider-Man pulled it off very well. Sure the moments where Peter Parker gets his powers and Uncle Ben getting shot still happened but it's done through a different sequence of events. <br/><br/>The plot of this film is Peter Parker discovers that his father's study has been broken in two. His father gathers up the hidden documents and Peter's parents take him to us Uncle Ben and Aunt May's house to keep him safe. Peter's parents leave and we cut to the present day where he finds the hidden documents in the basement. He learns that his father works with a scientist named Dr. Curt Connors at Oscorp; not mean to give anything away but Norman Osborn is dying in the film with an unknown illness and he is unseen. (I think that could've been explored a little better) Peter sneaks his way into Oscorp as a high school intern, he makes his way into a lab of genetically modified spiders and one bites him. After that, he discovers his new found abilities on his way back home. After that, Dr. Connors gets pressured by his superior Dr. Ratha to use The Lizard serum on the humans, Connors refuses and gets fired. Connors then uses the serum on his arm, it regenerates his arm but it has a serious side effect as it turns him into The Lizard. Peter Parker, after discovering the death of his Uncle and trying to find the killer, puts together his Spider suit create his own web shooters and become Spider-Man. He then later discovers Dr. Connors true intentions and must find a way to stop him. <br/><br/>Andrew Garfield, in my opinion is a believable Spider-Man, and that is the Spider-Man I love to see. He is smart, witty and responsible in most cases. People have been complaining how in this version of the movie that Peter Parker is an idiot and is acting a bit selfish he is but to be honest, that's how his character was in the comics, he acted this way in Amazing Fantasy #15 but as the comic book series goes on, he eventually becomes a well respected character. When he becomes Spider-Man, he actually brings in his smart and sarcastic sense of humor and I think that is what they should've done in the original trilogy. <br/><br/>Moreover, another thing that was great about this movie was Emma Stone. She played the smart and beautiful Gwen Stacy and I'm glad that they didn't decide to put Mary Jane this time because she appears later throughout the Spider-Man comic book series and her character in the original trilogy was just a bit wasted. However, Gwen Stacy is the complete opposite of that. She avoids being the damsel in distress. Finally, the chemistry between Andrew and Emma was perfect, it was really awkward, but romantic at the same time.<br/><br/>Rhys Ifans played Dr. Curt Connors/The Lizard and he also did a good job of representing his character. The design of The Lizard looks exactly like the Steve Ditko design, it was more human like than Lizard like and I really like on how they went with the Steve Ditko design. The one minor issue though is that I wish that he can keep his lab coat because that's how it was in the comics and I wish the CGI on the monster was a bit better.<br/><br/>It was nice to watch Spider-Man and enjoy some action, but it's great to sit and watch The Amazing Spider-Man and enjoy a fulfilling tale of love and the cost of being a hero. They also managed to borrow a few elements from the original Amazing Spider-Man comic book series and actually managed to bring the material to life. Peter built a device to shoot webs. The spider bit not only gave him all the powers but the chemical knowledge to create webbing. The device he built to shoot it was a show of his own natural genius. <br/><br/>The flaws with this film however is that I liked the fact that they delve into the history of Peter's parents but the movie spends kind of a short time on it once he meets Dr. Curt Connors, it's like they're almost forgotten entirely. I think they're going to explore the history of Peter Parker's parents in the trilogy so I'll consider this a minor flaw.<br/><br/>But overall, I really enjoyed this film, they've chosen a really good cast. This is how you create a Spider-Man story. I really recommend this film, it managed to stay faithful to the original source material in the comic books, they've chosen a great cast, it had some memorable moments it had good action and the characters seem more likable. I think that this is really enjoyable for any Spider-Man, Marvel or even comic book fans out there! Watch this film! I think you would really enjoy it! <br/><br/>Final verdict for this film: 9/10"
"Shantell_sabbar","5","1","5","27 September 2012"," Old Spidey VS New Spidey!
","Whether it's because I'm a fan or not I don't think The Amazing Spider-Man is a winner over Sam Raimi's Spider-Man in 2002. Of course it may be raking in the profit with a gross income of $696,859,765 (worldwide) and with Spider-Man slightly ahead with $821,708,551 (worldwide) but this has no impact on my overall thoughts for the new movie. Okay, it is professional, it has attractive camera shots, the sound is amazing, and the acting is good, as is the storyline. Considering all the positive things I have just said you are probably thinking, 'Well what is wrong with it then?'. I wouldn't go as far and say that it is wrong however I feel that although the storyline differs this doesn't happen from the start of the film. The structure of the new Spidey follows the old structure from the original Spidey film. For example the mistake that leads Parker to think he was responsible for the murder of his uncle; in Spider-Man, the guy at the wrestling place doesn't give Parker the full amount of money he had won so he let the burglar go who we are made to believe is the killer of Parkers uncle. In The Amazing Spider-Man a similar situation occurs when Peter is trying to buy something from the shop and is slightly short of change but the shop keeper won't let him off so he again lets the burglar go which leads to the same consequence. <br/><br/>As well as the story having similarities I feel that true fans to the movie Spider-Man will be disappointed with the new movie because the original cast who made Spider-Man so successful have changed. Like everybody says that a film is never the same without the original cast, and although the storyline differed from the middle to the end of the film it would have been nice to see this new chapter of the Spider-Man stories with the original cast as Spider-Man 4. <br/><br/>Shantell Sabbar"

In fact, he has been my favorite superhero. I liked Spiderman 1, 2 and 3; watched Spiderman 3 twice, despite many reviewers bashing it.<br/><br/>So it's natural I was waiting eagerly for The Amazing Spiderman. I was more eager because this movie was rebooting the Spiderman franchise with new cast that included Indian actor, Irfan Khan and it was getting released in India before US! Unfortunately, it turned out to be a big disappointment. It was like they didn't make a Spiderman movie, but a caricature-remake or a spoof of it. Bad script, confused and weak characters, bad direction and bad editing are some of the major flaws. Story was too bland, no spice, no excitement.<br/><br/>The important scenes where Peter gets bitten or hones his skills or makes his suit have been hurried and short, while the irrelevant scenes have been dragged.<br/><br/>Spiderman gets beaten, defeated, injured repeatedly. In fact, the audience was laughing hard on the repeated scenes of him coming home all thrashed and bruised and his aunt talking to him about it. He keeps removing his mask for just anybody and that's not very Spiderman-like.<br/><br/>Most action scenes were non-thrilling. In a scene where Spiderman rescues a boy from a falling and burning car, he wastes almost 5 minutes trying to convince Jack (the boy) to be brave, climb up and hold his hand. He even gives the boy his mask, but the boy doesn't follow him. So in the end he has to throw his spider-thread to pull Jack up. He could have done that already and spared us of that boredom.<br/><br/>It was just an example. Most encounters between the lizard-man and Spiderman were equally boring, dragged and nonsensical.<br/><br/>There were a lot of loose ends and missing links in the story. Like the story of Peter's parents was never shown, but the characters kept mentioning it. Dr. Ratha talks about some Mr. Osbourne, but neither the man nor his story was shown. Maybe they're keeping it for the sequel, but the confusion totally spoiled this movie. A lot of inconsistencies were there too. Sometimes things stick to Peter's hands and break by little force, sometimes they don't.<br/><br/>The romance between Peter/Spiderman and Gwen looked lukewarm and forced. The scene where the burglar kills Peter's uncle looked awkward and disconnected like many other scenes.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield didn't look much convincing either as nerdy Peter Parker or as Spiderman. He was good in The Social Network but a disappointment in this movie. In many body-close-up shots he was bending forward apparently to hide his penis-line from showing in the tight-suit. That made the already weak Spiderman look even weaker. Since when have Hollywood actors become this bashful? Irfan Khan appeared in just 3 short scenes. He was more like an extra. But the audience welcomed him with a bout of whistling! Everyone seemed to be waiting anxiously for the movie to end, which ends after further boring you for some time after the defeat of the villain. So much I wish, they had made Spiderman 4 with Tobey Maguire instead of this disaster.<br/><br/>I might as well watch Rajnikant's Robot now"
"darthmatthew-442-606491","5","1","5","8 September 2012"," With great films come great risks. This movie took none.
","When I first heard of the Amazing Spider-Man, I was highly skeptical. Indeed, a reboot of a series only ten years old would need to bring originality to a character whose image is still close in our memories. However, after hearing from friends and reviewers of its above average quality, my expectations were changed. Nevertheless, The Amazing Spider-Man unfortunately was no more than what I first expected, making many mistakes that seemed elementary.<br/><br/>When the developers of this project presented The Amazing Spider-Man as a ""reboot"", what they meant to say was ""remake"". There was simply no originality to this piece, failing to differentiate from its predecessor, and as a result was dwarfed by superior writing, characters, and casting.<br/><br/>It's cinematography was make do, lacking style and was completely unspectacular for its spectacular subject. The soundtrack I've heard a million times, attempting inspiring tones, but ultimately feeling amateur and lacking in rhythm or flow. The Amazing Spider-Man is filled with lazy plot elements to rush the story along.<br/><br/>A victim of its unoriginal story and characters, the casting seemed off. Though the performances of the original trilogy were painfully bad, they were casted perfectly. Toby Maguire, though terrible at looking sad, was born to play Spider-Man. Andrew Garfield was just to cool to be an awkward nerd. It would be like Jim Carrey as the Godfather. The acting was definitely a massive improvement to the original, and it did produce one or two heartfelt scenes.<br/><br/>But alas, this was all null and void. The Amazing Spider-Man lacked direction. It aspired to be dark and emotional, but the writing did not support the move. The characters would be acting ultra serious and foreboding, but the stupidity of some of the scenes was an unbearable contrast. It was catered to the lowest common denominator. They helped the inattentive audience with blatant foreshadowing and presentations screaming, ""THIS IS HIS PLAN!!! LET ME SPELL IT OUT FOR YOU!!!"" But for the audience such as myself that has at least a sliver of focus, this felt insulting and annoying. At parts I (literally) laughed at how lame their effort was. In one scene, Spider-Man discovers Dr. Conner's evil master plan, as a result of a childishly convenient 3D animation demonstrating step by step with fun little graphics how the dirty deed will be done. Why does Dr. Conner have this on his computer? Is he worried that he will forget his plan? Really, he's much too young for that level of senility. As a result, the movie was completely predictable and by the first 15 minutes, I knew the entire plot. Except for the surprise ending, which unfortunately spat in the face of the main idea of the movie.<br/><br/>Yes, the one recycled from the original (with great power comes great responsibility), but the failed to improve on it, and for the almost the entire movie, completely neglected it. This movie was horridly shallow, which rubbed off mostly on Parker's and Gwen Stacy's relationship, which was simply laughable. It was the old, ""Oh, you like me? 'Cause I like you! Let's make out."" Face-palm.<br/><br/>Not merely does it hide in the shadow of the original trilogy, but in the shadow of every other super hero and action movie ever made. As a result, The Amazing Spider-Man was completely unspectacular and unoriginal. With great films comes great risks, but The Amazing Spider- Man took none. Having only the acting and a couple of powerful scenes to give me air to breathe, I became suffocated with boredom. This did not feel like Spider-Man. Spider-Man doesn't need mechanical web shooters.

","A friend of mine who had seen this movie with her brother asked me to go see it with her when it came to the dollar theatre in our town so she could ""watch my reaction"". We then proceeded to spend most of the movie laughing.<br/><br/>While I would still rank it above Spider-Man 3, The Amazing Spider-Man had a lot of forced acting, cheesy lines, and overall corniness. Of course, any superhero movie is expected to be a little corny (with a few exceptions) but this movie took it to the extreme. And the soundtrack had some oddities that only added to the unintentional comedy. At the point where the Lizard is running through the lab, the music jolts and it sounds like he's jumped on a giant floorboard piano like the one in Big. And at times, the rest of the soundtrack may make you feel a bit like you should be wary of iceberg's ahead.<br/><br/>The Lizard's appearance was more comical than terrifying and no explanation was every given why Spider-Man managed to keep his powers and his mind after receiving an unregulated bite while the Lizard lost control and changed into, well, a giant lizard.<br/><br/>Other gaping plot points include Dr. Osborn who is talked about but never seen or explained, what happened to Uncle Ben's killer, and how exactly the Lizard was involved in Richard Parker's death (presumably this is a topic for a sequel). However, the one person Spider-man is seen actually saving is a little boy who I assumed was there to show that the people were starting to love Spider-man even if the police did not. But that was actually a new plot point involving further corniness as a path is create for Spider-man to go through the city and get to Oscorp. Because apparently the cure to having a bullet in the leg is to have people move machinery for you.<br/><br/>Overall, as I said, better than Spider-man 3 but I can't say much more for the hipster Spider-man in The Amazing Spider-man. You can tell they were trying to tell a different story but broke a little too much from the stock, geeky Peter Parker who rarely shed his mask for fear of hurting the ones he loved (something this Peter Parker seems to care little about). It's worth a watch but be prepared to laugh."

","Mark Webb (""get it, web?!"") is a better director than Sam Raimi, in terms of the human conflict. Raimi is a cult director who's great at exploitation and camp (hence, the success of the awesome 'Evil Dead' series).<br/><br/>I'm not in any way knocking Raimi as a filmmaker. But Spider-Man was always not quite his comfort zone, which is why it was such a big deal (at the time, anyway) that he was chosen to take on Spidey and that he delivered such a blockbuster series. (Before he latched on to the project, James Cameron was ready to film, with Arnie credited as Doc Ock. I kinda like the fact that the ""Throw me the whip"" dude got it instead.) So, back to Amazing Spider-Man: the setup scenes are awful. The moments showing Peter's gradual realization of his newfound skills are terrible, and so much worse than Raimi's vision.<br/><br/>If the 'learning' period of Raimi's film was the best (and btw, yes, Uncle Ben's death in Raimi's series was WAY more heartfelt than in the new one!), then the new film takes the edge in terms of action. The last 20 minutes or so are pretty cool.<br/><br/>But that's kinda it?! I expected more, honestly."
"CuriosityKilledShawn","6","1","5","28 July 2012"," Three strikes and out, and now yet another fumbled swing
","They said it was going to be a 'Batman Begins' style reboot of a franchise that had been destroyed by studio interference. It was a promise they did not deliver.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man is well below Batman Begins when it comes to aesthetic, direction, writing, sound design, cinematography, music, and editing. In fact, I reckon that the three men who cut this film together be ejected from Hollywood. It was, by far, the most poorly edited film I have seen in a long time. It boggles the mind that Pietro Scalia has two Oscars. The fight in the subway was incomprehensible to me. Peter Parker is stuck on a girl's blouse and the next moment there are a bunch of unconscious people on the floor. What happened? And puh-lease stop using 'stutter cuts', they are getting really old and annoying.<br/><br/>John Schwartzman, who made The Rock and Armageddon look so good, gives us a fairly bland color pallet. Too afraid to be dark, and too smart to revert to Raimi's ostentatious style. It exists somewhere in between, with all the visual appeal of a TV movie. Though this might be in part due to the fact that I saw the 2D version. The effort here is phoned-in. If anything Sony have given Spider-Man a 'Batman Forever' makeover. There's so much disappointment in this new incarnation of Spidey, but it's still an improvement over Sam Raimi's garish, cartoony trilogy.<br/><br/>Newcomer Andrew Garfield is the teenage Peter Parker (despite being 27 at the time of filming) who is bitten by an experimental spider at Oscorp, where he has detoured from an intern open day. As we've seen before, the bite gives him super powers. As we've seen before, he uses them to get his own back on Flash Thompson. As we've seen before, Uncle Ben dies before Peter learns to use his powers for good instead of indulgence.<br/><br/>So far, so familiar. The one thing so many superhero origin movies suffer from is the fact that once the new powers have been established the subsequent plot of the rest of the film feels like a half-assed afterthought. Amazing Spider-Man does a slightly better job of tying the main story to Peter Parker's history, but it's completely ineffectual. Such a shame as the Lizard had the potential to be a memorable, tragic villain and yet he only comes across as a token bad guy carrying the burden of the worst motivations I've seen in a mainstream movie. The Oscorp plot is virtually unintelligible and has convenient contrivances that would make even the cheapest screenwriter groan. And that evil Asian guy was a poor character, poorly acted. I was amazed at how many completely blank expressions he was capable of. One of the three writers should have written him out completely.<br/><br/>I'm not one of these snobs who says that there is no place for CGI in movies. I ain't the biggest fan of CGI, but when it's done gracefully, and with restraint, it can be pleasingly deceiving. What a filmmaker should never, ever do is blend the photography with CGI. It's a mistake, it looks tawdry, and it robs any film of any kind of class it might otherwise achieve. I know I am not the only one who is sick to death of 'impossible camera' (a trend made popular by Rob Cohen in The Fast and the Furious with those 'ignition to tailpipe' shots). I wanted the Amazing Spider-Man to take my breath away but I only ever gasped once, during Spidey's rescue of the kid in the burning car. At least the web slinging and swinging feels and looks better. There's G-Force and gravity to Spidey throwing himself into the wide-open spaces between New York's city blocks. But this is undone by bad editing. I can't tell where the real stunts end and the CGI begins, meaning the both efforts undermine each other.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield is a huge improvement on Tobey Maguire, and Emma Stone was easily likable and a world away from her bitchy Zombieland persona. Plus it also stars Denis Leary, who I would pay good money to see reading Dr. Seuss. Sally Field and Martin Sheen offer good support too, though there's nothing for them to really get into.<br/><br/>Amazing Spider-Man tries to cram in too much, and virtually every aspect is neutered as the film charges from one scene to the next without letting anything develop organically. I'm not sure that Marc Webb, fitting surname or not, was the best choice to direct. After the gaudy excess of Raimi's unjustifiably popular trilogy this superhero really needed a bite of the cold, real world and a strong director calling the shots.<br/><br/>Maybe next time."
"KnightsofNi11","6","1","5","29 July 2012"," The Disappointing Spider-Man
","After the monumental train wreck that was Sam Raimi's Spiderman 3, a reboot of the Spider-Man franchise was inevitable. But who would have thought that 500 Days of Summer director, Marc Webb, would take the reins to bring our friendly neighborhood Spider-Man back to life? Well, he did, and now he's given a whole new look and feel to the franchise far more cartoonier and light hearted than Sam Raimi's trilogy. The Amazing Spider-Man is the first film in what will likely be a trilogy if not four or five films depending on the series' success.<br/><br/>This first film is obviously the origin story of Spider-Man, explaining how Peter Parker came to be the web slinging hero. In it he faces The Lizard, aka Dr. Curt Connors, a man who worked with Peter's father at Oscorp. And that is probably the most interesting thing about the storyline of this new Spidey film. There is a lot of backstory surrounding Peter's parents in this new rendition of the hero. Not much is explained in this first film as many questions are raised and practically none are answered. It's clear something very big is being created here and there will likely be some vast interesting story about Peter's parents that will run through the entire series. For this first film this part of the story was kind of weird and felt out of place, but it's very clear that there's something much greater in the works for it. We will just have to wait and see how it develops.<br/><br/>The backstory of Peter's parents aside, The Amazing Spider-Man certainly has it's own individual story, but one that feels very rushed and very shoddy. It just didn't feel quite right. It's obviously the story of Spider-Man and it incorporates all the right aspects of how he got his powers and how Peter Parker came to be Spider-Man. But the film just goes through all these motions of the familiar story very quickly and without much elaboration. The film was too rushed and too underdeveloped to really be a quality Spider-Man film. It's hard to adequately describe the problem at hand, but it definitely exists and there was definitely something keeping me from really enjoying this film's story.<br/><br/>Sadly, The Amazing Spider-Man has some problems aside from its story as well. Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films were very real and much grittier in comparison to this new very cartoony Spider-Man film. In some ways this is a neat effect and it certainly can work for a superhero as aloof as Spider-Man. This isn't Batman and we don't have to take it very seriously. This is the route Marc Webb went when giving this new Spider-Man film it's own distinct look and feel. I don't like it as much as the more realistic Raimi Spider-Man vision, but it serves its purpose.<br/><br/>However, what doesn't suffice is the way this cartoony style translates to the very cheap and video game looking CGI in the film. There's a ton of CGI and none of it is that impressive. Spidey's web slinging isn't all that cool, despite Webb's awesome camera work that he employs to make parts of this film quite the visual spectacle. But the graphics of this film just aren't up to speed with today's CGI capabilities. It all looks too smooth and too silly to make this film awesome. Even the film's main villain, the menacing Lizard, isn't that cool. The body of the creature is neat and his rampaging around New York is admittedly pretty awesome, but his face is what ruins it for me. It's a poorly designed creature that, sadly, had a lot of potential. The same can be said for the whole film. It had lots of potential, but poor design made the film fall short.<br/><br/>I won't say that this new Spider-Man film is a disaster, but it's not great. Some of its flaws are true flaws, like the design of the Lizard and the unimpressive CGI, and some of it just a matter of personal opinion, like the silly and cartoonish look of the film. But, overall, The Amazing Spider-Man just isn't that great. Andrew Garfield is great as the new Peter Parker, Emma Stone is awesome as Gwen Stacey, Rhys Ifans is very cool as Curt Connors, and Martin Sheen makes a great Uncle Ben. But as far as the screenplay is concerned this film definitely falls short. The story doesn't flow right and the look of the film is nothing impressive. Any comic book film fan should see this film, but set your expectations low."
"The-Sarkologist","6","1","5","15 July 2012"," Too close to the Rami movies to be anything exciting
","I must admit that I preferred and still prefer the Rami Spiderman than this newer version of the story. This is basically a reboot, and in a way I did not really see the need for a reboot, but then there could have been a number of reasons, such as Rami not wanting to do anymore, or the major actors (Maguire and Dunst) not wanting to do a sequel either. However it should be noted that what Webb has done is to try to remain faithful to the comics, and this means that there is more of a focus on Peter Parker in high school, and his first love interest is not Mary-Jane but rather Gwen Stacey, who I believe (I have not really read the comics, and it is likely to be very hard, or expensive, to get my hands on the first Spiderman comic) was actually his first girlfriend (in the Rami movies she does not appear until the third one, and only acts as competition to Mary-Jane, who has been blackmailed to dump Spiderman).<br/><br/>I did like how they made the story much grittier than the Rami movies, and while Oscorp still plays a major role, we do not see or interact with the people at the top, as happened with Rami. It appears that Peter Parker does not know Harry Osborne. Also, the movie plays on the fact that while Spiderman is a super hero, he still gets injured, and we have a number of scenes in which Stacey is cleaning up wounds that he suffered from fighting the Lizardman. I also noticed that while we know of the Daily Bugle, and that Peter Parker does like photography, he is yet to take a job as a reporter.<br/><br/>Okay, enough with what I liked, because there were a number of things that really did drag the movie down, and the major one was the casting of Spiderman. Basically Andrew Garfield looks an awful lot like James Franco (who played Harry Osborne in the Rami movies). This, in many cases, was really confusing because every time I looked at him a part of me would think of the Green Goblin, despite knowing that he is not the Green Goblin. The movie also came across a little lazy in a way because, even though the canonical comic strips have Uncle Ben killed in a mugging, the way it was done in this movie was too similar to the Rami movies, and in fact it looked as if the same plot had been taken, and a few changes were made, but in general it was much the same.<br/><br/>In the end, I did enjoy the movie, but will continue to say that the Rami movies simply outshine this reboot (unlike the Nolan Batman movies, which simply outshine all of the previous attempts at Batman, with of course the exception of that really old one where Robin gets attacked by a rubber shark)."

The film greatly benefits from its stellar cast led by Andrew Garfield (Social Network) as Peter Parker and Emma Stone (The Help) as Gwen Stacy, who shine in their roles as teenage love interests.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield brings a completely different feel to Peter Parker as an awkward but caring teen who wants to help others, but is also trying to figure out what he really wants.

I had finally had time to watch the film in my local cinema, and was very excited. And no doubt I should of been. One of the most favorite films of all time. Brilliant start middle and finish , even without MJ, Gwen Stacy was just as good, Peter tells her half way through the film, so i believe a more love connection between the two characters.

"johnronald","8","1","5","9 July 2012"," Great Movie , worth watching
","I didn't really expect much from this movie, but it was much better than I thought. Andrew Garfield played an excellent peter parker and a superb spider man. Everyone had doubts if the Social Network Star could pull this off and he certainly did it. Emma Stone was also great in the movie as Gwen Stacy. The director did a good job.<br/><br/>The movie does have its flaws. The villain in this movie is easily forgettable and much of the villain's intentions are pointless. And also the main theme surrounding the movie is about Peter's parents and unfortunately we never know what really happened to them. The scene after the credits show that we have to wait for the second movie to really see what happens. And also Peter doesn't catch the criminal who killed Uncle Ben. We'll have to wait for the sequel to see what happens. <br/><br/>The first hour of the movie is very similar to the original Spiderman, but the director added better emotional drama to this movie. The second half is action packed and the effects are very good, although the looks of the Lizard is questionable. Overall a great movie and hope the sequels will be better."

","First of all, i would like to say as a Spider man fan my expectations were fulfilled, not only because the actors were so well chosen, but also because the universe that Marc Webb created for this movie was well adapted from some universes of Spider-man comics. And from other reviews i read from some ""displeased"" fans, i would like to state that those people were ignorant and knew nothing about arcs that happened in the Spider man comic books. First of all the main plot was based on the ultimate series, but the ""vibe"" it self was more based on the classic series, like for an example, Gwen Stacy was Peter's first love interest instead of Mary Jane. To finalize i just would like to complement both the performance by Rhys Ifans but also the loyalty of the Lizard character to the comic book. Thank you Marc Webb."
"leoskyrai","8","1","5","7 July 2012"," Doesn't reach the heights of Spiderman 2, but a great movie nonetheless.
","Looking back at the previous three Spiderman movies, the 2nd one was the best followed by the 1st, while the 3rd one as we know crashed and burned. <br/><br/>This movie -- though it deserves to be looked at by its own -- beats the 3rd one by mile, is somewhat a little better than the first one, but falls way short of the 2nd one (which I consider one of the best superhero movies). <br/><br/>This movie goes back the origin of Spiderman and it does well exploring Peter Parker as a character. Unlike Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker, this Peter Parker lacks the charm and sincerity. That being said, Garfield is excellent in portraying the vulnerability and insecurity of Peter Parker, who after all is an adolescent with a big void left in his heart by his parents. This movie drops the innocence and 50's-like atmosphere for a grittier set-in the 21st century feel, in which Peter Parker has a cell phone -- remember Raimi's Parker calling from a payphone?<br/><br/>Anyway, the plot line involves the transformation of Dr. Connors into the Lizard, and how Peter Parkerand his parents fit into that. <br/><br/>Director Marc Webb has done a great job. More than the action scenes, he has aced in the emotional content of this movie. The scenes between Emma Stone who plays Gwen Stacy and Garfield are brilliant. And what can I say about Emma Stone? She's absolutely a dream."

","I enjoyed this film and I prefer it to the old film. Ryhs Ifans is really good as the villain and I cannot believe it is the same man who played the idiot 'Spike' in Notting Hill. Andrew Garfield is great in the role as Peter Parker/Spiderman. He adds humor to the role with sarcasm unlike Tobey Maguire's serious version as Spiderman. The actors are good, the action takes awhile to come but is at the level of a Superhero film, and the 3D is average until the fight scenes where you can go, ""Oh, yeah I forgot it was in 3D."" Nice to see the return of the web-shooters instead of just using his hands. This shows Parker's inventive side, I never you it existed in the other films. His parents have gone missing, something I brushed over in the old film but in this film it suggests that Parker came from a family of 'extra-ordinary' people. Nice to see that Aunt May doesn't look like a frail grandma who you expect is going to die any minute like the old film. But enough criticising the old film, this one is very different to the other one. it doesn't feel like a normal superhero film, and is up there with Avengers. I very much enjoyed this film, I recommend it to you if you want a nice night out at the movies"
"blucoon","8","1","5","5 July 2012"," The Debate Is Still Open
","I'll just say it: I thoroughly enjoyed the new Spider-Man. Yes, it was completely unnecessary, but despite it's cash-in purpose, it actually added something to the lore, rather than take away from it. It's not often audiences get to see the exact same movie, featuring the exact same plot within the exact same ten-year span. At the end of the day, The Amazing Spider-Man is a movie-making study that the audience has been invited to take part in. How does, say a masterpiece like 2002's Spider-Man, compare with its own remake exactly ten years later? How do the opinions of adults and kids defer on this matter? What does all this say about American culture or better yet, the way of the world itself now days? These are the questions that went in with me into the theater and these are the questions that I enjoyed answering while watching. It was a rare experience that fascinated me. Yes, I was a hater of this reboot form the get-go, but sitting down to Andrew Garfield's sympathetically lost, troubled teenager, (modern if you will), turn as Spidey, I found myself lost in a psychological, philosophical study on movie-making that I had never had before. However, the conclusion ended just like it always does: Hollywood is truly dying.<br/><br/>But, like I said, I enjoyed this little rehash namely because it allowed me the chance to compare and contrast with the now ancient masterpiece, (in my opinion, perfect masterpiece) that was 2002's Spider-Man. And believe it or not, new Spidey came out on top in a handful of ways: Gwen Stacy was more effective this time around, Peter's parents are somewhat explained (but did anybody care what happened to them anyway), the high school scenes don't reek of late 90's/new millennial dialogue and fashion choices, yet, ten years from now, people are going to make fun of our present little shabby-chik era because it's inevitable. And the suit! The suit was so detailed and just, well, perfect. <br/><br/>Things went wrong too, and a lot of them at that, somehow overlooked by the cast and crew. The worst for me was the Lizard. He had a handful of effective moments, but half the time his action scenes were over-exposed and just plain cheesy as the talking dinosaur with a big grin on his snout. If they had utilized shadows or steam or something to help the audience get used to a giant-talking-lizard it would have resulted in less boring close-up CGI and more movie magic. That said, that was about the only REAL problem with this installment. Director Marc Webb is used to little romantic comedies so I assume he had a whole lot to learn about big budget effects. Say what you will about Spider-Man 3, the action was incredible. Yes it was terrible storytelling, but when you compare its action sequences to things like, say, its own reboot, I found myself wishing Sam Raimi, or even Pete Jackson, or dare I say it, George Lucas was behind the CGI keyboard.<br/><br/>As for Andrew Garfield, I get it, I get that he lacked conviction, but hey, kids now days are so morally ambiguous, it was actually pretty convincing that Spidey would in fact retain a bit of a flawed compass when it comes to right/wrong. <br/><br/>All in all, The Amazing Spider-Man is a beautifully shot and acted film, especially when dramatic scenes take center stage. Some of its logic not so much, it's choice in angles with the Lizard not so much, its 3D capabilities not so much (it was pretty flat in my REAL-D theater), but if anything, its worth seeing for the rare experience noted earlier. However, if I was to sum up the amount of decent reboots and remakes in recent years, in the least I would call them interesting if nothing else. Thus, I left the theater asking myself, how long can I keep this up with these re-hashes? How long until interesting ceases to be and becomes just plain insulting?"
"skrappster","9","1","5","3 July 2012"," Amazing? Definitely!!
","so, I saw The Amazing Spider-Man today, needless to say.. I gotta give my review on it.. For starters, I loved it. What we have in this movie is the mix of the 4 core Spider-Man comic titles, which are Peter Parker / Spider-Man, The Amazing Spider-Man, Web of Spider-Man and The Spectacular Spider-Man. For those that are NOT avid Spidey fans, let me explain. Peter Parker / Spider-Man comics was the series that dealt with more of Pete's personal life, The Amazing Spider-Man was were all the characters came together in a big mixing pot, Web of Spider-Man was where all the dark, nitty gritty happened and Spectacular Spider-Man is where all the action on Pete's personal level happened. That being said, ITS ALL in this movie. The movie feels like Web of Spider-Man, has the resolve of Amazing, the action and battle of Spectacular, and the personal story, straight from peter parker / Spider-Man Now, we all know that Spidey's story is and has always been about love for family, friends and the people he cares for.. Its all here in this movie. Andrew does a PHENOMAL job playing Pete and even resembles peter parker from the cover of amazing spider-man vol. 2 #37! Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy is AMAZING. nobody could have done a better job. She was PERFECT in every way, and her chemistry with Andrew is CRAZY! i can definitely see them working on more films together. (and I must admit, I may have dropped a few tears for them ) Rhys Ifans as Curt Conners / The Lizard was excellent as well. I really felt that he did his homework for the part, as he brought the character to life straight from the comics. (and yes, we get to see Lizard with his Labcoat :) ) Aunt May (Sally Field) and Martin Sheen (Uncle Ben) also brought more to their characters as well. (although aunt may's look seemed a little out of touch without her grey hair lol) Captain Stacy (Dennis Leary) has his due too! The entire movie from beginning to end keeps a great steady pace, and does NOT go overboard at the climax of the film but keeps you on the edge of your seat (just like spectacular comics) From the previews you've seen, we get to see Pete's parents, and yes even little petey in a flashback intro to the movie which leads up to a scene where while helping uncle ben in the basement, he comes across an old briefcase that used to belong to his dad...needless to say, he begins to investigate that ends up leading him to Curt Conners in an Oscorp lab. Spider-Man's origin, is untouched pretty much, (still bitten by a spider in a lab) Hilarity ensues upon discovery of his new abilities, and rest assured, the wise-cracking spidey IS in this movie, a lot! unlike the previous 3 spidey films, we get to see a vulnerable spidey, which in the past films he just seemed to ""shrug"" his hits and bruises off. Although not completely the same, but from this point on you get a feeling of the ""Death & Destiny"" story from the comics. The special effects are top notch! and I'm sure every pose you have ever seen Spider-Man do, IS IN THIS MOVIE!! From web slinging, to jumping, to diving, to flipping and catapulting! not only that, but when he shoots a web, you can see him push his arm forward as if he was ""casting"" a fishing line to give his web that extra push. You can see the webbing wobble as its shot, and you can actually FEEL the strength of his webbing just by looking at it. There's SO much more I want to say, but I have to let you all see it with your own eyes. As much as I love the previous trilogy (yes even the 3rd movie, lol) This movie made me realize how too big and bulky, sometimes clumsy feeling Tobey Maguire was as Peter.<br/><br/>I still hate the new suit though. haha<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie to you all, including those that are big fans of Spider-man.<br/><br/>I give this movie a solid 4.5 out of 5 stars.<br/><br/>In closing, I hope that when and If you do see this film, you will enjoy it as much as I have."
"uttiyo-sarkar56","7","1","5","2 July 2012"," Quite Close To Amazing!
","Well So After Some Expectation of this and getting mixed reviews about it, I finally watched The Amazing Spiderman today and here's what I Thought about it. Entertaining, Well Acted and Smartly Directed with Good action and Very good Visual Effects, along with a dazzling Emma Stone and a Cool Spidey, this movie is bound to entertain audience and its a very good start to this new reboot of the series, and it has everything in it starting from Action to Acting to Visual Effects and Storyline which is mostly due to the hard work of Director Mark Webb and also due to great efforts from the leading actors.<br/><br/>The Story of this movie is probably known by any comic book/superhero fan but this is a whole new start to the Spiderman franchise and the film-makers have made quite a few drastic but effective changes in this movie which can make it better than its previous one. So it again shows how Peter Parker(Now played by Andrew Garfield) becomes Spider-man and also develop a crush for Gwen Stacy(Emma Stone) along with showing us some of his cool moves and also defeating the dangerous Lizard/Curt Connors( Rhys Ifans) in the way to save New York City. <br/><br/>The Acting by the leading actors are quite effectively good and the new Spidey aka Andrew Garfield has done a marvelous job in portraying Spider-man, And i personally love this Spider-Man more than Toby's Spiderman. Garfield has played this Super-hero very cool-ly and has done his everything to entertain audience right from when he becomes Spider- man and I think He's surely gonna become a fan-favourite for this. Emma Stone was Dazzling as Gwen Stacy and played the love-life of Peter Parker Brilliantly with her charismatic and good acting and she surely does justice to this character and I really loved her in this role. Rhys Ifans is quite a brilliant actor and he again does very well in this movie as Curt Connors/Lizard and he does both the positive and negative part of this character brilliantly. <br/><br/>Director Mark Webb who incidentally himself has the title ''Webb'' has done an excellent job with the start of this new series and has set the right tone for this new super-hero franchise. He Did Brilliantly with all aspects of this film starting from Acting to Visual Effects also convincingly telling the story to the audience and the movie always has some entertainment in it so that it does'nt bore the audience. He has made a really good super-hero film and not those drab only action one's. Well Done to him and I expect good things from him in the future.<br/><br/>The Visual Effects of this movie is'nt as good as The Avengers but its still very good and the effects of Spidey Flying around and jumping through the streets of New York city sometimes are really fascinating and really breathtaking at times, so I guess the Visual effects team deserve some credits for putting all their hard-work into this movie. I Thought the Editing was a bit bad and some parts of the movie would have been better not showed.<br/><br/>The Story of this movie has a all new kind of a tone to it than the Last Spider-Man and this also has some new characters to it and that makes it more interesting, and this story of Spiderman vs Lizard was shown on the screen quite well by the director and I hope that the next part will be better if not as good as this. <br/><br/>This is not exactly ''Amazing'' buts its quite close to it, And with the cool Garfield as Spider-Man and A Good Villain along with the dazzling Emma Stone, this one will definitely entertain all kind of movie lovers and specially comic books fan should also go for this one, Because i liked it very much.<br/><br/>My Rating: 7.5/10"
"TrendChaser101","8","1","5","1 July 2012"," Good Attempt , The Amazing Spiderman does deserve a watch
","If the Sam Raimi's Version of Spiderman is still fresh in your memory , There is a very good chance that the reboot will appear appear boringly familiar .This is after all the origin story all over again - Peter Parker gets bitten, he discovers his 'spider powers', he uses them first on the school bully, then goes out in the street to fight crime, finally clashing with a fearsome villain while cops and New Yorkers look on in amazement. <br/><br/>To be fair, despite covering pretty much the same ground as that earlier film, The Amazing Spider-Man still works. You could put it down to the emotional depth that (500) Days of Summer director Marc Webb brings to key scenes, or simply to leading man Andrew Garfield's refreshingly original approach to the part<br/><br/>A solid actor, blessed with oodles of charisma and unmistakable presence, Garfield pitches Peter Parker as a brooding introvert who prefers the company of his skateboard to actual friends . This new film unfolds Parker's world with more attitude. The feel-good mush of the last three films is gone, and the action is duly sexed up to suit 3D basics .Even in the scenes which resemble those of the previous versions , Andrew Garfield delivers a solid performance , So it was truly refreshing to watch a better more competent actor play the Role of Spiderman.<br/><br/>Peter Parker's love interest in the film Gwen Stacey played by Emma Stone who is sexy and intelligent appears more appealing and less annoying than Kirsten Dunst . Here Gwen appears a bold decisive person willing to risk her life for Spiderman unlike Mary Jane who was portrayed as a spineless damsel in distress and an emotional fool who kept bouncing from one person to another not realizing who she loved actually.<br/><br/>Though this film does focus a lot on the romance between the lead characters for most of the film ,Which I feel could have been reduced significantly , Its important to note that the sizzling chemistry is in a way important . It could be an attempt by the Director to show the grief that pain and the grief that Spiderman would face when he decides to kill off Gwen's character in the subsequent sequels. The biggest highlight of the film is the terrace kiss where Peter Parker drags Gwen Stacy close to him through his web shooter as she appears totally stunned before the kiss . This was way better than the upside down kiss in Spiderman where Kirsten appeared in a soaking red dress.<br/><br/>What works in the film is the manner which the scenes are shot right from the the subway scene to the scene where Spiderman saves the kid from a burning car or even the scene where Spiderman swings right across the city to Oscorp Towers . The scenes are appear spectacular in the 3d format<br/><br/>This film appears to be a realistic take on Spiderman . The concept of webshooters and the spidey suit are definitely more believable (I would have liked to see Spiderman running out of web though)<br/><br/>Spidermans swinging moments also appear far more realistic than the perfect web flights taken by Tobey in the previous versions.<br/><br/>Where the film however does not work was the portion where a huge time was spent on focussing on the mysterious disappearance of his parents which does not have any relation to the outcome of this film (Highly unlikely that it will have any relation to the sequels),The unconvincing manner which Uncle Ben was shot and choosing the Lizard as Spidermans Primary Foe. What really disappoints is that Spiderman is not able to track down the person who shot Uncle Ben .The iconic line'With Great Power comes Great Responsibility' appears no-where in the film. I do feel let down by the fact that I had really high expectations watching the trailer but was left wanting on account of the not so great script.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spiderman is definitely more dark and edgy as compared to the previous versions . I would however want the Director to play an act of balancing the film with lighter moments of comedy and wise one line cracks. The directors should make more use of Andrew Garfields fine acting skills and also focus more on showing Peter Parker's intelligence and adeptness .<br/><br/>Make sure that you stay till the end of the credits to watch the extra scene. I hope that the Next Spiderman Sequel holds more promise to give films like the Batman Series or the next sequel to the Avengers a run for their money."

I enjoyed the first two movies with Maguire (and looking back, the first one is real cheesy) but this one is far too downbeat and lacks all the charm any blockbuster could've had to make it enjoyable. Peter Parker ends up being a douchebag and every scene is awkward and contrived. It's a complete hit and miss film but the hits are okay (fortunately towards the end with obvious Terminator 2 references) and the misses are big due to none of the dozen writers of this film talking to each other about what they were writing.

","PROS:<br/><br/>+ good cast (though I didn't love him in it Garfield was good in the role, he emoted well. As someone who finds Stone annoying I didn't find that to be the case here.

The movie is also very, very much a remake of Raimi's original film which really surprised and disappointed me. I liked the original movie quite a bit, but based on the marketing and promotion for this movie they were telling us this would be going in a different direction, yet besides more scenes at night there really wasn't that much different and actually a lot of awkward note-for-note similarities almost to the point of the Psycho remake. I mean hell even though it's a different villain Ifans' Lizard still battles the evil, over the top voices in his head just like Dafoe's Goblin, though it's not as well done as with most of the similarities to the original. Annoying plot holes, occurrences and character choices also plague the script, like where all the tiny lizards came from or what happened to mouse-lizard or why the Police Captain went to the top of the tower all by himself... and finally, Peter Parker. For the most part he's a likable character--up until the very end at least where his choice makes him such a despicable, unlikable and selfish character)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>art design (I wasn't a fan of the look of The Lizard or of Spidey's suit)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>music (the score wasn't bad by any means, and actually pretty solid in general but in terms of a superhero score and in terms of the theme in comparison to the previous Spider-Man theme... it doesn't hold a candle)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>while Marc Webb does surprisingly well considering what he came from before I can't say that any of the action sequences were particularly thrilling or memorable. 95% of the action also takes place in the middle of the night, which just doesn't feel right for Spider-Man. Also the only real memorable action sequence (and it is a pretty cool one) isn't even in the movie, and that would be the POV sequence we've seen in promotional material. Only about 5 seconds of that sequence makes it into the final cut of the movie, which was surprising and confusing.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>deceiving (the marketing campaign was built all around the 'secrets' of Parker's parents being revealed as well as lines like 'do you have any idea what you really are Peter?' and 'if you want to know the truth about your parents Peter, come and get it'... well none of those lines are actually in the movie and neither are the plot points or revelations that would come with them. We literally get none of that other than a post-credits scenes that hints that we'll actually get what was advertised for this movie... in the sequel)</li></ul><br/><br/>OVERALL:<br/><br/>I was hoping, and actually kind of expecting, that it would surprise me as I really couldn't get that excited for it initially yet heard the good word (even from a family member). Unfortunately it did the opposite and actually disappointed me. It's not a bad movie, but it is a flawed one and most of the things that it does right are just damn near the exact same things we've already seen, making it a bit tedious and having me just want to fast-forward the movie at times which is never a good feeling. I was open to it, but it disappointed me. Still I think I'd give a sequel a chance at least, if we even get there that is, as the only thing truly amazing about this Spider-Man flick was the budget, a whopping $220 million that you just really, really don't see on the screen."
"rivertam26","6","1","6","3 July 2012"," Just above average spider man
","You would think someone named Mark Webb would be a shoe in to direct a movie version of Spider man with that name. You would also think a movie entitled the amazing spider man would be in in fact an amazing take on the material. On both of these accounts you'd be wrong. Not to say the film doesn't have moments and is generally entertaining but for the most part it's kind of a mess. This time around the take on Peter Parker is a more realistic one. He's a little annoying, a little selfish, a lot more sarcastic so your normal teenager. The events in the film transpire accordingly with the bite of the spider and the death of his parents and than Uncle. But the film unravels in an interesting way making the material seem fresh and mostly unvisited. What the film gets wrong mostly lies in it's direction. Despite a few stabs at the darker side of things this seems like spidey light. It's very comical, with lots of jokes and a sort of disneyish generic atmosphere. Which is all fine and dandy but the film just doesn't mesh well. It moves sloppily back and forth beneath genres and subplots without building a realistic engagement to the events depicted. The good lies in the films interesting and inspired casting choices Andrew Garfield is geekyily gorgeous in the lead and although his character is somewhat angsty he manages to make him likable and is truly gifted at being emotionally resonant. Emma Stone is cute but unnecessary as his love interest and even though the 2 share winning chemistry their relationship isn't allowed time to develop appropriately and seems a little forced. Sally Field also adds some solid support as Aunt May. The film sports nice special effects but the 3D is just so so. A better take on the material would have been a darker one such as as the dark knight is to Batman franchise. I do think they made the right decision in rebooting the material as the last installment in the previous franchise had worn out it's welcome. As Spider Man films go this one falls into being the second best. However, it should be noted that although I enjoyed the original film immensely I wasn't a big fan of the others. There's a lot to enjoy here and I would welcome another installment but I do hope Marc Webb is not a part of it as well as the screenwriters that penned this installment. Although a piece of passable Hollywood blockbuster entertainment the film admirably works better on it's human levels which is a great feat to accomplish. That being said the film ends up being a just above average spider man than an amazing one."

","Mr. Director ! You are such a noob and you have proved it very well. Who in the world would make a movie with such ludicrous script? When you are creating a movie, a Super-hero movie, then you should very well keep in mind that there are others as Iron Man, Bat Man and The Avengers against whom you have to stand. Every thing needs to be fantabulous. No flaws. And this is what you came up with.<br/><br/>The most distinguishing difference between Sam Raimi, the director of earlier Spider-man movies and Marc Webb, director of the new one is that the later one is fresh out of college of direction and has a lot to areas to work upon. Sam Raimi has proved a lot by offering a wide range of genre of cinema. And that's exactly why a monstrous challenge for Webb grew up. The Amazing Spider-Man was a great onus that was put on, let's say, an immature shoulders of Webb and there's where everything falters. In the world where we have Nolan and Joss Whedon, this guy did not find a perfect spot even to stand up.<br/><br/>Let's talk about the movie. All characters played there parts very well. A great justice to all the characters has been done. No one could be a better choice than Garfield for the lead role. Garfield is intense, smart and a genuine charm he carries with himself. Simply flawless. He brings a perfectionist's touch to the Spider-man's character. The girl, Emma Stone, has done an outstanding work. I have always adored her. I was never fond of Mary Jane who would always cry and carry a rather shabby personality. The then Peter-Jane love story was all just stupid. Here is a brand new genial love story with a girl you'd always dream of. She is smart, sassy and a perfect fit for Mr. Parker. Other characters - Parker's uncle, his aunt, the doctor and the girl's father, everyone did well.<br/><br/>The direction was not that great and the poor script extinguished all the fire the director thought of putting in the movie. The movie were meant to be grand one considering its superb characterization and some breath-taking effects but the script ruined it all. The expectations from this movie were bit higher. Spider-man 4 was scrapped because Raimi could not find a great plot. Five years' wait and we thought we would get some great kicks but sadly nothing much was dished out. <br/><br/>Watch the movie for the effects and the fresh new characters. Do not expect anything extraordinary otherwise you will end up disappointing yourself as I did."

","The Amazing Spiderman AMS starts from the childhood of Peter parker when his parents left him to Uncle Ben's house due to some unresolved issues with the science work he does in cross species genetics. And Peter parker of 19 years in science college, encounters something accidentally (afraid of spoilers!) when he reaches the Company OSCORP where his father Richard Parker and Dr Curt Connors worked to find the whereabout of his parents and the reason they left him. Human and Spider cross species (later calling himself as Spiderman) starts taking the work of Man in badge with his spider skills. The story turns into a super action fight between Spiderman and giant Lizard after another cross species genetic accident in OSCORP turning the author of ""World without pain"" into the giant devious Lizard. The movie has different angle in developing a new Spiderman than it has in the Sam Raimi's Spider-Man (2002). Though the Original Comic Hero's Character to save People from crime and evil is same, AMS has more of the genetics and the science in the new Series start.<br/><br/>Indian actor Irfan Khan in his very short role speaks less and leaves no significant presence there and I forecast him as a Villainous Comic Character in coming Part of this Spiderman series.<br/><br/>Some emotional scenes like the death of Uncle Ben, payback of a father to save Spiderman- lifesaver of his son, and the promise from Peter to NYPD captain in his dying stage puts you in tears. And the closeup of swinging action enthralls you in a different way than the previous series did. Also the last minute clip after the end of movie crew and casts name showing Dr. Connors and another person in jail, makes you curious about the next Spiderman movie Amazing Spiderman 2 to be released in 2014.<br/><br/>The Return of another start of web swinging is not enough to stand out in the war of superheroes and the Skinny Spiderman that speaks while flying Character build up has not done much to wipe out Tobby Maguire Spiderman image from your head. So, the Reboot of the Spiderman Series with Webb as the director (may be that's the reason behind the reboot...laughs!!!), does not live up with people's expectation for the new series to be more exciting and fun though QFX was full- packed with people to watch their favorite superhero in 3D.<br/><br/>http://rdulal.blogspot.com/2012/06/amazing-spider-man-review.html"

It's better than the originals with Sam Raimi, but I think there could have been a more intricate plot with better characters. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone did well, Denis Leary was very Denis Leary-esque. So, not sure how I feel about that. Rhys Ifans was stellar, but let that go rather quickly. Martin Sheen was great for the short time he was in it, Sally Field was very reserved. I guess Aunt May always was though. I wish Peter Parkers' parents had greater roles. However, still hard for me to keep my eyes open. I was out about 90 mins in, I woke up at the climactic parts and still couldn't hang, just not fascinating enough. For me, overall lacking in ""suspension of disbelief"" for Marvel, I had more fun in Avengers. I once again woke up for the end and was not thrilled.

","Plot: A young boy Peter Parker realizes his life would never be the same after his parent's sudden departure; he is raised by his uncle and aunt who are fully supportive and caring but never mention about Parker's past. When Peter learns about his father's research, he seeks Dr. Curt Connors, his father's research partner who is now experimenting with genetics to find a cure to many fatal ailments. The inquisitive nature of Parker leads to his transformation as Spiderman, after being bitten by a rare spider. His newly acquired powers overwhelm him at first but he somehow brings it under control and gains a formidable reputation in college. After his uncle's death, Parker sets out to find the killer and in the process captures many wanted criminals well before the police does. This irks Police Chief Stacy who labels him a public menace and doesn't hold a good opinion about Peter Parker (who's now Chief Stacy's daughter Gwen's boyfriend) as well. On the other side, a disastrous self-experiment turns Dr Curt Connors into a monstrous reptile that unleashes terror in the city and only Spiderman can bring an end to this unwanted menace.<br/><br/>After some memorable moments and some not very appetizing ones, could we ride once again with Toby McGuire donning the red suit or would Spiderman have to call it off forever? Mark Webb has an answer for us, a reboot that has certain benefits but also raises many questions: Did this truer comic book interpretation of Spiderman really transcend to the silver screen? By giving Spidey and the other characters edgier but more caricatural personas, will the franchise really continue? Why does Peter Parker's hidden identity have to be so blatantly obvious? What's the difference between this Peter Parker who does astonishing feats at college and yet gets away, and Miley Stewart who dons a golden wig and no one recognizes her even though her father is Billy Ray Cyrus? <br/><br/>In Amazing Spiderman, a major difference in the cast is the absence of Mary Jane, who had become one of Spiderman's most recognizable faces. We instead have Gwen Stacy, the blonde whom we got a peek of in Spiderman 3, as Peter Parker's love interest. However, Gwen does not sit cozily in the background while Spidey is battling and neither does she sulk much unlike MJ. She throws in some punches and kicks, urges Spiderman to beat them all up and is more thoughtful. It can be hard to accept this spunky, courageous Gwen because we are so used to the lady in distress act. But she may grow on us just like the fearless Elena or Chloe from Uncharted series. Spiderman is played by Andrew Garfield, who isn't a typical geek that Toby managed to be; he is a cool geek, or just a normal college guy with great scientific knowledge but poor physique. Therefore he didn't really take time to win over us with his charisma as Spiderman even though I didn't root for him as much as I did for Toby when he halted the derailed train. Toby's shy and quiet Spidey had a charm of his own in a way we take his character's well-being seriously; Garfield's Spidey meanwhile entertains us more but we find it harder to sympathize with him though I must say Garfield did nail that scene where he confronted his uncle about his father. By the way, all those who have seen the Indian film Three Idiots may notice a similarity between Andrew Garfield and Indian actor Sharman Joshi's style of acting. <br/><br/>What also played a major role in deciding the previous Spiderman movies' success or failure was the potential of the nemesis; while Green goblin didn't wield much excitement because of the sketchy latter part of the first film, Doc Oc made us tremble at his stature as well as pity his tragic story in Spiderman 2, while Green Goblin's son, Sandman and Venom were potent enough in the third installment but the film itself was enfeebled by the dull love triangle. Rhys Ifans acts well, however his character isn't exactly memorable in any way; in Batman the most feared villains are Joker, Harley Quinn, Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy, Scarecrow, Two Face but who really cares for Bane though his strength is equally formidable? Maybe Ifans couldn't play his character better, but what really made his character weak was the character itself. My mind went ""A reptile as the main villain – are you kidding me?"" and sadly it felt the same way throughout.<br/><br/>Spiderman feels like a filmed comic book, which is generally flipped through casually without getting involved with the emotional aspect of the story to a greater extent. If you look the movie this way, you'll say it's the best of the series. People buy dozens of Archie comics and read it in the same perfunctory manner. But many people who love movies find that the factor that etches a film in our minds for a long time is a moment of tension. This tension happens only when we are deeply involved in a film and for that to happen, the movie has to make the audience realize the protagonist's dilemma and want him/her to overcome it. And this cannot and does not happen in such a breezy, comic book-like adaptation. <br/><br/>Amazing Spiderman will surely get support from Beyblade-crazy children and teenagers who love saying the word 'awesome!' – It will be one of the top grossing films of 2012. But I personally think 230 million dollars are unnecessary for a movie that looks no different from the Spiderman and Beyblade cartoons that come on the television. The most suitable word that strikes me for the film after writing this review is 'filler'.<br/><br/>My Rating: The sole number that came in my mind after leaving the theater was 5.5 out of 10."
"CinematicInceptions","8","1","9","22 October 2015"," Spiderman with a web-ful of personality and spfx.
","I know there are some issues concerning this reboot coming out so close to Sam Rami's trilogy, so I'll give my hopefully unbiased two cents on that first. Perhaps the time interval didn't call for a re-boot, but I think the overall story did. The re-boot has a vastly different feel to it than the films of the early 2000's with Tobey Maguire. This is really Spiderman for a different audience, so be prepared to hate one or the other. I think the reboot did a better job with making Peter more relatable and easier to root for, acting and scripting, character writing, and general plausibility. The older versions had a more cohesive story and established Spiderman more as a hero than as a person. I personally think that TASM came out better overall, though I haven't seen the '04 and '07 installments, but the perception of which is better seems to be a matter of taste more than anything else.<br/><br/>Peter Parker, while somewhat reserved, is portrayed as likable and emotional. He's a very active protagonist: everything extraordinary that he does is a result of his own actions. He makes his own web-slingers and suit and actively initiates and pursues a positive relationship with Gwen Stacy. Even the pivotal radioactive spider bite is only possible because of his scientific curiosity and his quest to discover his past. Peter is driven equally by his emotions and morals, as we see from start to end that he is willing to do good, but is blinded by emotion in the scene of Uncle Ben's death and his quest of vengeance against his murderer. Gwen is also a very prominent figure who is important in both sides of Peter's life through her complex relationship with him, her position at Oscorp, and her being the police captain's daughter. The irritable Captain Stacy is an antagonist through his hunt for Spiderman, but he's not a really a villain since you can sympathize with him. The real villain is Dr. Conners/The Lizard, who has some interesting motives that we get a good look at. At first, we're on his side, but when he takes his desire to expunge weakness too far, he becomes a literal and figurative monstrosity. Some of his scenes as the Lizard felt a little clichéd with his taunting dialogue and roaring, both of which seemed out of character. Aunt May and Uncle Ben show up occasionally, mostly to emphasize the difficulty Peter has in balancing his life. Uncle Ben's death comes in a very valiant fashion, and I absolutely loved the new version of the ""with great power comes great responsibility"" quote. It's not as memorable, but I think it's a lot better in inspiring greatness in Peter and the audience.<br/><br/>The story begins with Peter searching for his father, which leads him to Oscorp. Eventually this story line just sort of dissipates, which could be a problem for a lot of people, but incorporating it into the rest of the story wouldn't have felt quite right either. The same happens with Peter's search for Uncle Ben's killer. It starts off as a strong motive for Peter and his gradual transformation into Spiderman, but then he just suddenly stops looking for the man without explanation. The bulk of the story involves the classic superhero/super villain face-off, though we do get to see a lot of the villain's side of the story. Of course, there's also the internal conflict of Peter and Gwen's relationship and how it is challenged by Captain Stacy and Gwen's own courage.<br/><br/>The execution was excellent on almost every level. The dialogue was motivated and realistic, but the script lacked in some of the high-school scenes that felt pretty old- fashioned. Fortunately there weren't too many of those scenes, but I would sign the screenwriter up for a crime comedy over Breakfast Club reboot. The acting was nice with lots of personality and some incredible chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone. The special effects were very stylized and resulted in some very cool action sequences. Some of the CGI didn't look stunningly realistic, but we don't exactly love superhero movies for their realism. James Horner contributed an awesome main theme that he uses throughout.<br/><br/>If you were disappointed in 2000's movies, then I would definitely give this a try. One thing to be wary of in your decision to watch it is the trailer. Much of it gives you a good foretaste, but DO NOT hinge your hopes on any of lines from the trailer because most of them are not included in the final product. That's actually a good rule to follow when watching any trailer since there are lots of tricks the editors can use to fool you into thinking there is a whole conversation taking place that is not in the movie at all. If you're skeptical, watch until Conners first becomes the Lizard and then decide if you want to continue. Overall Rating: 8.35/10."
"ChristianLeFeuvre","9","1","10","27 October 2015"," Surprisingly impressive
","I was always a fan of the old Tobey Maguire Spiderman movies.......until last night. recently released on DVD and SKY Box Office is the latest movie adaptation of the comic book super hero. I was initially dubious as i was just expecting a remake, same story, same clichés just different actors, however I was impressively surprised. Andrew Garfield takes the title role and plays it so well and so much more convincingly than Tobey Maguire, and in a row with Uncle Ben and Aunt May he shows real angst that his parents weren't there to bring him up (great scene). Unlike in the originals, the love interest isn't portrayed like some drippy geek unable to get the girl, it came across much more realistic. The baddie, played by Rhys Ifans, was very good and the CGI creature was done very well. if you are a fan of the super hero genre of films or just want a good movie to watch when there is nothing on then you could do worse than take a look, I was very impressed and with talk of a sequel in the works I think it will prove to be more popular than the originals"
"vbertola","2","1","10","31 December 2012"," Boring, and the plot has more holes than a golf course
","This movie is sorely disappointing for at least two reasons. <br/><br/>First of all, it is plainly boring; most of the time is spent in pointless, overly dramatic dialogues that possibly would like to explore the emotional side of the characters, but which are so filled up with stereotypes - being a nerd, being a nerd that all of a sudden becomes cool, and being a rebel to your (adoptive) parents that don't understand you - that they quickly become unbearable. It takes you thirty minutes only to get to the point where Peter gets bitten and becomes Spider-man - hey, that could have been easily summarized in the first thirty seconds. Also, when at last you get some action, it is the kind of brawl in the dark side alley that looks like a bland replica of a Michael Jackson video from the 80's - not very exciting.<br/><br/>Secondly, the plot has more holes than a golf course. Every minute or so you stumble upon an unbelievable set of coincidences (your hottest schoolmate and love interest, who is also the most intelligent girl in the class, is also the assistant of your father's best friend and colleague, and also the daughter of the head of the local police - how likely is that, one in a billion?) or into a very apparent lack of coherence (e.g. Peter's hands stick to pieces of paper, but in the following scene they don't stick to the pencil and book he is holding, but in the following scene they stick to the computer's keys so much that they break, but they start to stick only after a minute of ordinary typing). In a scene Peter's uncle tells him that he is absolutely identical to his lost father, but just a few minutes later Peter meets his father's best friend and he won't recognize him. This is the kind of stuff that will break the suspension of disbelief and make the movie unbearable to anyone over 10 years of age.<br/><br/>In the end, for a while we enjoyed laughing at the plot's repeated inconsistencies, but after some time the experience became totally boring; when we realized that just one hour had passed and there was still over one hour to go, we just gave up and saved us the pain."
"stevonatron","2","1","10","31 December 2012"," Dawson's got a new Spider trick
","So the ""Amazing"" Spider-man is a product seemingly aimed at the weepy- eyed romantic audience. I think the same flock who herd themselves to see Twilight in their droves would love this version. The same type of people I would assume enjoy a relaxing Sunday morning watching Dawson's Creek, 90210, re-runs of Friends, the O.C. etc.<br/><br/>It had me worried very early on when it was apparent that Andrew Garfield's acting is timid and sheepish, like a teenager painfully trying to impress a group of girls. When he becomes Spider-man and the cocky side of his character comes out, watching Garfield is really uncomfortable, especially when he starts cursing and false-swearing. <br/><br/>And to nail his Dawson alikeness, the director even thought it would be a great idea to have Peter climb up to his love-interest's window each time he visits. Hey - at least he doesn't need a ladder Dawson!<br/><br/>Peter cries a lot, but that's OK because he fights and gets bruises! The girls will love him. But be warned ladies: he doesn't shower after constantly swimming in sewage and that s**t doesn't wash off!<br/><br/>So moving on from Dawson, we've got the villain. He's of the same cut Osborne obviously came from as he loves shouting at the voice in his head and enjoys pursuing madness. Doc Croc comes off as nothing more than a distraction to Peter's love-life and is a poorly visualised CGI blimp who looks strikingly like a Goomba from the 1990's Mario movie. <br/><br/>The truth is though, I wanted him to win. I bet it would have been fun pounding Garfield's wimpy face. And speaking of his face; the director loved it so much he never has it covered. Yes, the new puny Spider-man wants EVERYONE to know his identity, even on one occasion begging a kid to take it off him and try it on. It's true.<br/><br/>No, this isn't a good movie for action fans, especially in the same year as the awesome Dredd is released as well as Avengers. It looks utterly pathetic in comparison and falls short in every category. It's a great movie for aforementioned audience though, which is why I gave it 2-stars. So it's good for something.<br/><br/>Anyone who enjoyed the Toby Maguire version might want to rent this before stumping up the cash for a full purchase. There's no reason to give Sony more money than they deserve."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","1","10","6 July 2012"," Not Amazing But Good
","The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>This reboot comes just a short amount of time after the third and final film in Sam Raimi's trilogy and features Andrew Garfield taking over the role of Peter Parker. In this film, Parker is trying to discover the secrets of his parents when he's bitten by a spider, which of course turns him into the title character. Spider-Man must then battle The Lizard while also trying to keep the girl of his dreams (Emma Stone). THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN is certainly far from amazing but I think it was good enough for a summer blockbuster. One could argue if it was too soon to start the franchise up but I'll leave that for someone else. Overall I thought the screenplay was pretty good as it mixed in plenty of drama, laughs and some good action sequences. I'm not sure how many mainstream movie goers would agree with me but I thought the high points was the personal drama. The story of what's going on with Parker was extremely well handled and I thought the screenplay devoted just the right amount of time letting us get to know this character. The Parker here is certainly a lot different than previous movies so I'm glad they really built the character up. The same is true with his relationship with Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and even the love story has some good moments to it. The performances are all a major plus as well. Garfield has no problem pulling off both sides of the character and Stone makes for a very good love interest (not to mention the mini skirts on her are great). Denis Leary is terrific as the girl's father who also just happens to be the Captain of the police. Sally Field is strong as Aunt May, although I'd argue that the script doesn't do much for her character. I thought the real standout was Sheen who was simply terrific as Uncle Ben and stole every scene that he was in. Rhys Ifans was okay as the villain but I thought this was the weakest aspect of the film. I must admit that I was bored each time The Lizard was on screen as I didn't find him to be a good villain and the doctor's backstory was also rather boring. I also didn't think there was enough imagination to the action scenes and this is the one spot that was really lacking from previous movies. Still, THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN is a winner thanks to the screenplay and performances."

After Spiderman starts to utilize his strength against crime after an hour of film, SUPERHERO could not prevent himself to identify his girlfriend of being so ! why so hurry ! was intention of the Spiderman to impress girlfriend and others, not primary focus on fight against criminals !! huh... Bent from back-neck, Spiderman himself look like Lizard. Wrong boy chosen for hero, his acting, expressions were never suitable for in-depth student. Ugly Villon character was also unattractive, could have been better. People want villon that really looks deserving and smart enough to make role of hero more impressive. On finishing part, when superhero was told by Stecy's father of getting away from her, why spiderman didn't so practically like Hulk did by going to Brazil without notifying anyone ?! Instead, our superhero stays there to make attractive dialogue and being impressive against his girl friend ! Very cheap script and poor direction. And how his girl-friend came to know about what his father told spiderman at last part to get away from her? Why she was supposed to have that in knowledge ! And the way she told that fact to Spiderman is childish. This was very cheap scripted, directed film under big title utilizing its earlier gains of the series."

Why would they create a new Spiderman that has a different storyline, from the original books? And why wasn't Stan Lee there to tell them how wrong their interpretation was? Poorly scripted and storyline was ineffective! Back in the day of Spidey, they didn't have the goofy skateboards and lifestyle genre, seems like they thought they could just throw in that trash to attract some of the newbies! Really terrible Spidey, weak looking and not sharp, and same goes for his girl! Mary Jane Watson, where are you? We miss you! Even the editor and police chief sucked!

","Although it has a couple of clever moments, this is not a good film, and basically represents a Hollywood bereft of new ideas. First of all there was no need for a reboot of this character as the other films were very recent.<br/><br/>Second, the film is BORING. It plods along at a very slow pace, going from one clichéd superhero scene to another, with seeming eternal dialogue in between.<br/><br/>I know the main character is a good actor, as I liked him in ""Little Red Riding in the Year of Our Lord"". But he is given practically no range in this role. There are no other great performances either.<br/><br/>There is very little action, except for the cliché'd, predictable fight at the end, which is basically a typical CGI sequence.<br/><br/>I was a devoted reader of the Spider-Man comic as a kid, and it saddens me to see what he's been turned into. It would have made far too much sense for Gwen Stacy to die in this film, which is what the original character is most notorious for.

"spidermanrulez6666","2","1","13","27 July 2013"," Horrible and unnecessary film
","This film was just horrible. In my opinion its a horrible adaptation and just a bad film in general, as a comic book fan and a movie-goer in general I was disappointed.( caution this review contains spoilers)<br/><br/>What I didn't like: The love between Peter and Gwen was too bland and forced. Throughout the film I kept asking ""What does she see in him?, Why does she love him?"", there isn't really a reason, its like they are together just because they were in the source material. There was no time for their love to develop, it just happens.<br/><br/>The worst thing about this film is the ending. Where Peter tells Gwens dying father that he promises to stay away from her, after her dying father asks him to, so Gwen can be safe. But, Peter doesn't even go out of his way to tell Gwen about the promise, and he doesn't even comfort her at the funeral,(he isn't even there), So Gwen goes to his front door, on the same day, and breaks up with her!, on the day of her dads funeral, he doesn't even comfort her at all. Then at the very end where Peter is late for class, he promises the teacher that he wont be late again, and the teacher says ""dont make promises you can't keep"", and Peter whispers to Gwen saying "" but those are the best kind"", meaning he is planning on breaking Gwens dying fathers promise, and still be with her any way, and Gwen smiles like an idoit. How IRRESPONSIBLE is Peter?, His uncle Ben died cause of his lack of responsibility, and thats the main thing about the character Spider- man. So he is being irresponsible again, Has he learned anything? The ending is insulting to the themes of Spider-man and the fans. <br/><br/>Another thing that sucked was the CGI scenes, it was mostly at night, and it just didn't blend in well at all. The action scenes weren't really all that either, I expected a little bit more.<br/><br/>Things I liked:(although there isn't much) Martin Sheen and Sally Field were probably the best actors in this movie, its too bad Martin Sheen and Sally didn't have much to work with, with this script.<br/><br/>This film also had tbe best Stan Lee cameo, in all the marvel films.<br/><br/>The film left me disappointed and it was hard to actually pick things I liked. As a comic book fan and a movie viewer in general, I found the film unnecessary and horrible."

"mothersworry","2","1","13","17 July 2012"," With Re-boots comes great responsibility.......
","Lets get Sam Raimi's trilogy out of the way first. Spider-Man - Awesome, Spider-Man 2 - IMO the perfect superhero movie, Spider-Man 3 - A fitting end to a fantastic series of movies. Tobey Maguire's portrayal of not only Spider-Man, but more importantly, Peter Parker was as if it was lifted straight out of the comic books. His raw emotion, his battle with his inner demons and his fight to keep his own life balanced came across in floods, and that made me believe that this character was real. The supporting cast throughout the 3 movies were top draw, and this just went on to prove that casting the right choices for the right roles, with the right script makes all of the difference.<br/><br/>I wanted The Amazing Spiderman to be up there with these iconic superhero movies. I wanted Marc Webb to take me on a journey that would make me feel as alive and excited as Sam Raimi's vision did. But i'm afraid it fell way short of doing that, and I feel so bad to say it. Whilst I admire Andrew Garfield as an actor, I can't admire his take on Peter Parker/Spiderman. There was too much arrogance in his Spiderman, too cocky when he was called into action. Yes, I admit that Peter Parker did have a certain air of arrogance in the comic books but not to this extent. That was what Spider-Man 3 was all about.....Peter getting way too cocky and paying the price for it. He couldn't seem to convey the weight of responsibility and emotional heartache that his losses and his new gifts were giving him. Tobey looked nerdy, looked like he was a person that could be bullied and he played it perfectly. Andrew Garfield came across as directed.....a good looking skateboarder who had no problems with the girls. Martin Sheen and Sally Field, whilst they perform their roles beautifully, I couldn't help seeing Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson as May & Ben Parker. At times I felt the direction in the action sequences was erratic, and badly thought out, whilst the scenes between Gwen and Peter didn't convey to me the same chemistry as Maguire and Dunst did. They were believable. The amount of bad luck and sheer heartache that Maguire delivers in Spider-Man 2 has the power to bring tears to the eyes. His exchanges with Dunst about him not being an empty seat, his struggle to keep Spider-Man out of his life, yet his final understanding that he IS Spider-man, and he must embrace it and sacrifice the things he loves the most to protect them is brilliantly delivered. Amazing Spiderman never brings these qualities over to me. I could bring up Rhys Ifans performance as Dr Connors/Lizard, Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy and many other things but I fail to see the point. Whilst this movie will make a huge amount of money, will be successful, will make stars out of it's two leads, it doesn't bring anything new to the table. It doesn't expand the story, it just tells the same thing we have already seen, but on a below par level.<br/><br/>Maybe the inevitable sequels will give Marc Webb a chance to grapple with the material and get it right, but my main point is that we are still only 5 years down the line since Spider-Man 3. It's just not long enough. Sony should have really given Raimi back all the creative control he had in Spider-Man 1 & 2 and made Spider-Man 4 the movie many of us fans know he could have delivered. I wanted to see Maguire's Peter Parker/Spider-Man come up against more menacing villains, encounter other heartaches, grow a little older and take us on his journey, but that will never happen.<br/><br/>My last point about this movie comes down to the script. James Vanderbilt wrote the script for Zodiac for crying out loud. This is a guy who can write extremely good material. Here though, I really think he fails to grasp the concept. One point that really had my blood boiling was amount of times that Garfield was required to take the mask off. They might just as well of sewn his name on the back of the suit just in case you forgot the face. Isn't this the whole point of a superhero?? Conseal your identity to protect not only your alter ego, but also the people you love? So I go back to my review title...With Re-boots comes great responsibility...and in my opinion, Sony have thrown that responsibility back into the faces of the people who truly wanted something that was going to be special.....it just isn't."
"nclka1990","8","1","13","4 July 2012"," A heartfelt comeback from Spiderman
","When Sony Pictures announced a Spiderman 4 with Sam Raimi and Tobey Maguire back one thing was sure. It could only be better than Spiderman 3, but it was still with a worried mind I read the news. Sam Raimi dropped out and Tobey quickly went the same way, leaving Sony and Marvel with the obvious choice of rebooting the series. The choice of Marc Webb ((500) Days of Summer) was brave and Andrew Garfield as Spiderman ditto. Having seen it, I can only say one thing: Thank you, Sam Raimi for dropping out!<br/><br/>The film obviously shares quite a few plot lines with the first Spiderman from 2002, but these scenes touched me way more in this version. Quite simply because the characters are more likable, better acted and more human. <br/><br/>This is not like your everyday superhero film. Now I'll admit that I'm not a big Spiderman knower, but I do know that he is supposed to be this very teeny, everyday life kind of superhero. Marc Webb succeeds in bringing this life in a way that Sam Raimi can only dream of! With the same charm, sweetness and wit as (500) Days of Summer he portrays Peter Parker with all the problems of a teenager, but also with all the possibilities that a teen sees in life. Peter Parker is suddenly not just a nerd in a suit. He is a human and for that reason you feel much more connected to him when he is in the suit facing danger.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield is the new Spiderman and he is leagues ahead of Tobey Maguire. Tobey had some charming moments as Spiderman, but having seen Garfiels portrait, he outclasses him. He is perfect as the teenager who is hopelessly in love, whose parents (uncle/aunt in this case) is on his nerves and who is seeking for a way in life. He produces some touching moments that you rarely see in superhero films. Add to that a comedic talent that secures inch perfect delivery of Spidermans hilarious one-liners. Look out, Ironman - you've just got competition for funniest superhero!<br/><br/>Emma Stone is irresistible as the love interest Gwen Stacy (played by Bryce Dallas Howard in Spiderman 3). Gwen Stacy is in many ways a much more fitting love interest for Peter Parker and Emma Stone is simply perfect! As with Summer in (500) Days of Summer Marc Webb has produced a female lead who it's hard not to fall in love with! The romantic scenes between Garfield and Stome is just as great as the ones between Deschanel and Gordon-Levitt in (500) Days of Summer. Marc Webb is a self-proclaimed romantic and that is why he is able to make sweet romance seem so cool and fitting in this otherwise dark universe.<br/><br/>Rhys Ifans is given the undesirable job of portraying Dr. Connors. Undesirable, because the villainous alter ego of Dr. Connors, 'The Lizard' ends up being a very weak villain character - much like Venom and Sand Man in Spiderman 3. The animation of The Lizard isn't on par with the rest of the effects either and he is not more intimidating than a gremlin. It's sad, because in many ways Ifans gives a performance as great as that of Willam Dafoe in Spiderman (2002). <br/><br/>Those are the major characters, but of the many supporting actors I would like to point out Martin Sheen as Uncle Ben. He had some shoes to fill after Jon Voigts performance in Spiderman. However, I completely prefer Martin Sheens version. He is much more likable, much more parental and way funnier! A very likable character. You should also look out for an awesome cameo performance from Spiderman creator Stan Lee - a very memorable scene!<br/><br/>The story is not amazing, but the script is - the dialogue is very smooth, quick and surprisingly funny. Just as a teen hero should be! The score from James Horner is quite ordinary, though especially one scene with Lizard and Gwen Stacy features some awesome musical notes reminding me of the likes of 'Psycho'.<br/><br/>I have no doubt that this film is too sweet, too charming and too romantic in between the darkness for some, but for me it worked. It succeeded in doing what Christopher Nolan has done with Batman. He has made these heroes recognizable and Marc Webb continues the tradition. Their heroes share our flaws, our feelings and our troubles. I cannot think of anyone better than Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone to do this. Consdering this realistic tone, which obviously makes the film darker, it is a shame that the villain is as cartoonish as The Lizard. For that reason I cannot give a 5/5. But one thing is sure when Webb and Garfield is swinging in to the cinemas again in 2014 I will be there and my expectations will be high!<br/><br/>4/5"

You know this review wants you to add so many words but I am struggling to find anything else to say about it! Here is my tenth line then. It is rubbish! Don't watch it!"

","If you want to remake a great movie and soon after the original was released and enjoyed, you are obliged to find something new and interesting to contribute. I didn't think it was possible to ruin Spiderman, already the subject of two excellent and one pretty good flicks but the hodgepodge of writers who brought forth this abortion have proved me wrong. Do all moviegoers everywhere a favor, guys and never write another screenplay, OK? There must be technical manuals that can survive your lack of literary skills and that will pay. Emma Stone was and will be beautiful for a long time but is wasted here. No chemistry between her and Andrew, none! Why there was even a need to cast Sally Field or Martin Sheen, I can't imagine. Less familiar faces would have given these supporting characters more depth. Andrew Garfield is so new and young, I hesitate to dismiss his career outright, but here he is leaping only as high as Ryan Reynolds in ""The Green Lantern"" and not nearly as high as Toby McGuire as Spiderman! Mostly, though, where is the action and the sense of fun in this god-awful talk fest?"

","This movie is the worst spider man anything ever made. It is Completely inaccurate and a terrible film. And here is Why i urge you to not waste your time and watch something else: )step number one: telling you all the flaws) First of all peter Parker has glasses and when he is bitten by the spider he no longer needs them. but in this film that is not the story. peter doesn't have them from the beginning which is a huge flaw! Also (no offense to Sally Field here, i think she is a wonderful actor and i think Anne Hathaway didn't deserve that Oscar at all) aunt may is not a brunet, I'm sure the only reason they made Sally Field take the job is because they wanted more people to see it. (step 2: criticism) Marc Webb obviously doesn't know the first thing about spider man, and for that i say for shame. if he didn't have the knowledge to make the film why didn't he just not make it? Hopefully the sequel will bomb, and I'm sure the only reason that anyone saw this film is because they were spider man fans, even i fell for Marc Webb's trick and watched it. And that, is why This is a Completely inaccurate and a terrible film. I urge you to not waste your time and watch something else."

","We rented it and, even at the low price of Netflix rentals, I felt cheated. I actually felt that I must be watching some low budget take of the Spider Man series. Poor writing, poor acting. Just awful. The movie was lucky that the previous movies in the series were worth watching because it made you want to see this one. Don't waste your money or time on the rental.<br/><br/>I guess I need 10 lines in order for this review to be posted so I guess I'll just ramble on about how bad it was. I'm guessing they dumped a lot of money into the making of the film so they had to go ahead and put it out in order to recoup their money. If I was running a studio and they showed me this movie after it was completed I wouldn't have put it out. But they had to recoup their money and they knew it would make money based solely on the previous movies in the series. Otherwise they probably would have thrown it in the can. Really, really bad."

"eminkl","6","0","1","17 April 2020"," The Amazing Spider-Man was all right.
","Personally, as much as I was with the Raimi trilogy, I was not very emotionally involved with that film. I thought this movie was sort of soulless to me. First I'm going to go through some good stuff then I'm going to go into the negatives. I think the cast is really good at first. I think Andrew Garfield is very fantastic as Spider-Man but as Peter Parker I don't like him. I just don't see him as this dork, he should be rolling it with the cool kids in real life with that character. Yet as Spider-Man he is very good, he is on par if not better than the depiction of Spider-Man by Tobey Maguire. Martin Sheen is doing a very good job as Uncle Ben, Sally Field is good as Aunt May while I feel she doesn't have anything to do, Emma Stone is fantastic as Gwen Stacy, even though she's pretty underdeveloped. And even though he's the most underdeveloped character in this film, Rhys Ifans is presented excellently. The visuals and the cinematography were a further plus. This film has a smooth glossy look to it. The battle scenes are also enjoyable as hell, one of the movie's favorite elements. The film is messy though and I will go through it now. These are my negatives; I haven't liked the depiction of Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker again, I felt he was too sweet and stunning to buy him as that character. Another drawback is Gwen Stacy's lack of growth, she has some romance with Peter and supports him with the antidote in the end, that's it ... Another bad aspect I have is that once Curt Connors is The Lizard he tries to turn all of New York City into Lizards, that's horrible writing for a villain. Some villains want vengeance, kill the planet, rob something, these are schemes of legit motivation that I can get behind, but his plan is awful! The death set up for Uncle Ben was always too messy and badly managed. The death of Uncle Ben was properly set up in the first Spider-Man movie and you understand that. I hated the fact that the clerk is such a * * hole and gives Peter a hard time for 2 cents, just felt so pressured here. A clerk would let you off the hook in real life for that, but it's so ridiculous and terrible here. Peter then attempts to trace the murderer after Uncle Ben dies. Sadly he can not locate him, but then the subplot is never discussed or resolved again. Laughter writing right there. Last but not least I didn't like Peter's setup getting his powers, he's just sneaking into a room without any security and then heading into the biocable with the spiders all over the place like an fool. I genuinely thought it was a lot easier for Peter to get his powers in the first film, here it makes no logical sense to me. There are also other contradictions in which I can go on and on, but those are the key ones which bugged me. The Amazing Spider-Man is an average movie overall. It's got a lot of issues but it's still a fairly enjoyable movie, it's got a nice main character and some fun set pieces. I dislike this film not, it was just disappointing, I truly wanted something as spectacular as suggested by the title but I was truly let down. I wasn't pumped up or set my hopes too high, I was disappointed frankly. If you're a Spider-Man fan you may like or may not like this movie. Yet if you're critical of game, with this game there's a lot to nitpick."

"nickrue","6","0","1","30 March 2020"," The Forgotten Spider-Man
","Before anything else, I would like my question to be answered right away: Why was this movie necessary? It's not like we haven't seen Spider-Man in a while, in fact, the last film was in the year 2007, just 5 years from the release date of this movie. Now, I would understand if they would have just continued with the story Sam Raimi had to offer, just like Joel Schumacher did with Batman Forever, following the story of Tim Burton's Batman with a new cast. Not saying Batman Forever was a good movie, but it had something new to offer at least.<br/><br/>Let's start with that. The Amazing Spider-Man starts off with how Peter Parker, the protagonist, is seen picked on, bullied, an outcast basically. He has a crush on this girl named Gwen Stacy, and the two of them have this small connection. His relationship with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May is shown, and after that he goes to Oscorp Industries, gets bitten by a radioactive spider, and lives with it. He continues to discover his new powers, but his actions one-by-one lead to the death of his Uncle Ben. Since this happened, Peter Parker becomes Spider-Man to help stop several crimes in New York, and also a big lizard causing havoc to the city. Now, what exactly differed from Raimi's first Spider-Man, besides the girl, and the villain? Absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>This review however, will not only consist of similarities, but also talk about different plot points in this movie. Let's start with Peter Parker's parents, a new topic in the Spider-Man films. At the start, it is shown that his parents drop Peter off at his uncle and aunt's place because they have some ""unfinished business"" to attend to. Later on, a reminder is given to Peter about his parents, or his dad mostly, and he starts digging for some clues to find out more about what he did. But, to be honest, there is nothing really important about this part of the story. Meaning to say, it goes nowhere (I'm leaving TASM 2 and treating this as an individual film). I guess what differs with this Spider-Man and Raimi's is that Sam's is straight to the point, sweet and simple. Marc Webb however, feels the need to go through things one at a time for no reason really. Another plot point left out is Peter's search for his uncle's killer. We go through a sequence of Peter searching for his uncle's killer one by one, and in the end where does this go? Nowhere. His problem, or his arc isn't resolved at all.<br/><br/>I would like to then shift into another problem this film has: Peter Parker's motivation. Yes, it's only natural for Peter to want to have revenge for the death of his uncle. But the point of Spider-Man, besides doing what is right, is overcoming your wrongful thoughts and actions. We see his hate for his uncle's killer never resolved, but instead left out like all the other plot points mentioned. He's not stopping those criminals because of their wrongdoing, or out his goodwill, but his taste for revenge. He only hunts down those who look like his uncle's killer and no one else. A proof of his action can be seen in his last interaction with a look-alike. When Spider-Man gets the criminal cornered, he checks if the car thief has a tattoo on his arm. When Peter realizes he does not, he clearly says, ""This could've gotten a lot worse,"" and hands him over to the police.<br/><br/>The police in this film are a also major flaw. Yes, they are a bit engineered in a way to have the same roles as those in the Dark Knight trilogy, which are to arrest the Batman, a vigilante who does not follow the rules or laws entailed to the city. But the police in this movie are upright dumb. There have been literally reports from witnesses of something large, and not human that has caused destruction in the bridge near New York City, and for some reason, they choose to focus on Spider-Man, who although is an outlaw who follows no one, ""helps"" them arrest criminals. I get why they should arrest him, but what I don't get is the fact they prioritize Spider-Man, who is a much more smaller ""threat"" than the Lizard. It just doesn't add up.<br/><br/>Despite all this, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" isn't without its good parts as well. I'd say the actors in this film were great, although I wouldn't think Andrew Garfield would be ideal for Peter Parker, a nerd and a good kid in nature, but I can live with that casting choice. People seem to like all the scenes with Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy, and I would be more okay with this if it didn't take a solid 2-3 minutes trying to talk and settle things down. I also like the fact that Peter Parker helped create the Lizard, seeing as how he helped out Dr. Connors find some formula. Finally, being a superhero movie, as expected the action in the scenes were choreographed well, and they were enjoyable.<br/><br/>But all in all, I personally think this reboot should never have happened if this is how the story would turn out to be, since we are all familiar with this. Thankfully, the Marvel Cinematic Universe's Spider-Man did not go with this familiar setting, but actually bring something fresh to the table."

","""The Amazing Spider-Man"" of 2012 is not entirely innovative, most evidently retreading on many origin beats it's predecessor series' first blockbuster instalment popularized, but ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" has its own distinctive qualities that I intermittently prefer. Perhaps I would also claim it to be the better movie of the two.<br/><br/>Firstly, I believe Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone have a much stronger and endearing rapport than Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst had from 2002's ""Spider-Man"". The sparks of sincerity and charm between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy in this movie is exhilarating; a truly complimentary constellation of energy between two souls. A particularly great scene in ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is where Peter is nervously struggling to confess that he's Spider-Man to Gwen on a rooftop, but then verbally falters to instead reveal it by swiftly wrist webbing her into a romantic embrace plus kiss. In my opinion, it's far emotionally superior than the upside-down alleyway kiss in 2002's ""Spider-Man"".<br/><br/>Secondly, the villain of ""The Amazing Spider-Man"", Dr. Curt Connors (The Lizard), rouses much empathy based on his own rapport with Peter Parker. There's a tragic ""Nutty Professor"" vibe, though obviously more ghastly and sinister, of a man yearning to physically better himself but it horrifically backfires. The narrative establishes early of the layered connection between Connors and Parker, and as the movie's conflict progresses, it enhances their tension to greater potency. I believe The Lizard was well portrayed in this movie, and he's one of the best Spider-Man villains to get the live-action treatment thus far. My only complaint as an avid fan and reader of the source comics, is that I would prefer his visual design to be of the traditional longer snout and lab-coat, but that's just personal aesthetic preference.<br/><br/>Lastly, and this isn't a compliment to the movie, but I want to mention that the costume for Spider-Man in this incarnation is admittedly ugly and dreary, barely reminiscent of the iconic costume he's famous for; stems from the dictum ""if it's not broke, don't fix it.""<br/><br/>In conclusion, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a satisfying thrill for some aspects, but it's not entirely innovative by the web it weaves."
"TheMovieDiorama","6","0","1","1 February 2020"," The Amazing Spider-Man swings its way into a corpulent yet semi-realistic reboot.
","Unpopular opinion, but that's the beauty of art in all its forms, Raimi's original Spider-Man trilogy are not top-tier comic book adaptations in my view. The acting, story-lines, character dynamics, visual effects and disregard of general physics are not to my personal taste when experiencing blockbusters. Essentially, they were clean exercises in exploiting popular fiction with no cinematic edge. Then comes Webb's (coincidental surname!) reboot a few years later, after the travesty that was 'Spider-Man 3', to give the eponymous superhero a fresh lick of red and blue paint. Whilst technically not a remake, it does follow a similar origin path for the web-swinging ""vigilante"".<br/><br/>Parker is bitten by a genetically modified arachnid, granting him ""spidey senses"", to which he must save New York City from a deranged scientist who can transform into a reptilian beast. The Amazing Spider-Man is in its own universe, separate to the previous iterations. A consequence of this, is that Parker's genesis into Spider-Man is retold. Beat for beat. Offering a monotonous familiarity that plagues the initial half of this reboot. Parker's parents abandon him, Uncle Ben is murdered and Spider-Man is born through the ashes of anger. However, what Webb's interpretation contains that sets it apart from others is the grounded realism to the superhero shenanigans. For every sprinkle of webbing shot at Lizard's nightmarish CG face, is an equally gritty surplus of drama to balance the tone. Aunt May and Uncle Ben being the strict parental figures to stabilise Parker's angst and spontaneity, creating a shield of relatability around himself.<br/><br/>For the majority of the film, the focus is on Parker's own personal adversity against his inner turmoil. The action and spectacle commonly found within the genre is a product of Parker's conquered turbulence. The character physically becomes everything that Spider-Man, as an icon, symbolises through his own hardship. Something that Raimi's trilogy failed to portray convincingly. The added grit of realism assists in enhancing the moral conflict between vengeance and justice, with the infamous line (""with great power comes great responsibility"") from Uncle Ben, constructed ever so differently in this adaptation, highlighting that.<br/><br/>The flip-side to the dramatic endeavour of the first half, is the subdued and almost forced blockbusting exhibition of the second half. The surrealistic plan that the Lizard hatched in the sewers of New York City juxtaposed the realism that polluted the streets and alleyways. Therefore, during the last thirty minutes, the lack of engagement is noticeable. The overtly clean visual style failed to regenerate any fresh limbs during the action sequences. All style, no substance. Except the POV shots of Spider-Man crawling up walls and swinging through downtown traffic. Exhilarating! Similarly the less visualised set pieces, such as Parker training in the shipyard, are accompanied by unusual song choices including Coldplay's ""Til Kingdom Come"". Sure it harks to the coming-of-age aesthetic that Webb directed, but starkly contrasts against Horner's spectacular musical score.<br/><br/>The quintessential element that makes this reboot work so well, is the natural chemistry between Garfield and Stone. It is palpable. It is steamy. And it makes me sweat. Their onscreen romance was the perfect web of personality needed to elevate all eight legs off the ground. Garfield as the titular role was, and still is to this day, my favourite iteration. Quick-witted, sharp tongued and emotionally vulnerable. The Lizard had questionable motives to say the least, with a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde persona. Good intentions, yet not fully developed as the primary antagonist. Ifans however did give a credible performance as a deluded scientist.<br/><br/>Several characters were underused and/or utilised primarily for foreshadowing. Gwen's father, Oscorp executive Ratha and school bully Flash to name a few. Various plot conveniences were littered throughout, most notably the saving a child in a burning car leading to an array of cranes positioning themselves to assist an injured Spider-Man into efficiently swinging his way to Oscorp tower. Some additional polish was required to smooth these glaring kinks out.<br/><br/>However, I will state that The Amazing Spider-Man was a much required reboot. It upheld the essence of the titular superhero with a grounded approach that made him far more relatable as a character. Too many sub-plots and underdeveloped characters were thrown into the chemical mix, yet Webb's direction just about salvages itself from mediocrity. And, thankfully, no emo Parker dancing. Phew!"
"Hey_Sweden","6","0","1","28 December 2019"," Don't go out of your way to see this one.
","Just 10 years after the first official big screen adaptation of the legendary Spider-Man comic book, Sony saw fit to reboot the series, with another rehashing of the now familiar origin story. Granted, it plays out with some minor differences, but the end result is pretty much the same.<br/><br/>Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield, inheriting the role from Tobey Maguire) is a high school photographer with an aptitude for science as well. He makes the acquaintance of Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans), a scientist who was working with Peters' father (Campbell Scott, in a VERY brief cameo). Connors' experiments go seriously awry when he injects himself with a serum derived from lizards, and therefore becomes The Lizard, one of Spidey's familiar nemeses. Peter, who's acquired superhuman abilities after being bitten by a genetically enhanced arachnid, realizes that it's his duty to stop him.<br/><br/>One might as well watch the 2002 film with Maguire, since these filmmakers don't bring anything truly fresh to this material. There's the usual smorgasbord of CGI effects (although director Marc Webb and company supposedly wanted as many practical stunts as possible), and mayhem. The writing isn't particularly good, and indeed some of the dialogue can be rather cringe-inducing. Worst of all, the film makes a waste of some of its acting talent, giving old pros like Sally Field (as Aunt May) and Martin Sheen (as the ill-fated Uncle Ben) little to do. At least Peters' love interest, Gwen Stacy (a radiant Emma Stone), gets to do her own bit during the heroism of the final act. As for Pete / Spidey, Garfield comes off better once in costume and incapacitating bad guys, nailing some of the cockiness of the character. Ifans is good as the well-intentioned (or is he, really?) antagonist who becomes the monster. Denis Leary is okay as a Captain Stacy who criticizes the efforts of this ""masked vigilante"". And Stan Lee, naturally, has his usual cameo.<br/><br/>If the prospective viewer is a superhero / comic book adaptation junkie, they may derive some entertainment out of this, as unnecessary as it all is. Some of the cast members helped raise this viewers' rating by a point, anyway.<br/><br/>Followed by one more Spidey movie with Garfield; this film is dedicated to the late Laura Ziskin (producer) and J. Michael Riva (production designer).<br/><br/>Six out of 10."

"mitchell5954","3","0","4","5 July 2019"," An Horrible Unnecessary Reboot
","Amazing Spiderman is the unneeded reboot of the Spiderman movie franchise. The very fact that this movie was even made annoys me. Firstly, I think it was way too soon to reboot the franchise. Amazing Spiderman came out in 2012, which is only five years after Spiderman 3 came out. Originally Sam Raimi was working on Spiderman 4, but due to the bad reception of Spiderman 3 Sony decided to abandon that project in favor of this movie.<br/><br/>Honestly, I would rather have gotten Spiderman 4 than a reboot. The fact that Sony decided to reboot everything because of one misstep annoys me. The X-Men franchise has had multiple stinkers but they have yet to reboot everything. The majority of the Transformers films are bad but they still continue to be made. Despite the negative reception Spiderman 3 had the highest gross of all three Raimi movies. As you can guess I did not like this film at all. I just felt it was a very boring retread that was done better the first time with the Raimi films. Say what you want about the other Spiderman films but I will take them any day (including Spiderman 3) over this film. Those movies had problems (especially Spiderman 3), but, at least, they were entertaining and had heart.<br/><br/>There are a couple things I like about the film that they improved on from the original films. Andrew Garfield, in my opinion, does a better job as Peter Parker, performance wise, than Tobey McGuire. I like Tobey as Peter Parker/Spiderman. I blame the writing for most of the issues I have with him. However, there are times when his delivery felt very forced and/or corny. Andrew Garfield has few of those moments, except one scene which felt very forced. Plus he looks much more like Peter in the comics nowadays as opposed to Tobey McGuire who, like the Raimi films in general, is trying to capture the old school Spiderman from when he was first released in the 1960s.<br/><br/>Also, Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy does a great job and plays a much better main female character than Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane. Kirsten is a fine actress but she did not capture the essence of the Mary Jane from the comics at all. Not-to-mention she was just a token love interest/damsel in distress in all three Raimi films. At least Gwen Stacy was able to defend herself and was not the damsel in distress here. Plus Emma Stone does a better acting job. Some of the action scenes are also fun to watch, but they are few and far between. The action in the original movies is miles better.<br/><br/>The biggest problem is the story. This movie is basically a retread of the original from the origin to even the villain. There are some changes but they are not even noteworthy. First of all, why did you have to retell Spiderman's origin? Spiderman's origin has already been done before (and done better I might add) in the very first film as well as various animated series that have come out over the years. The majority of people, whether it'd be comic book fans or the general public, already know the origin. There was no reason to go over it again, and there was definitely no reason for it to take up about half of the film. The origin in Raimi's film only took a half hour or a bit more while this took over fifty minutes. There some alterations but they are pointless and, in my opinion, lame. When I watched this film I was bored out of my mind in the first half.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the second half did not do much for me either. The villain is lame and boring. He is basically a poor retread of Green Goblin (Norman Osborn) from the first film. The Lizard (Dr. Connors) is basically Green Goblin but without the energy is his performance. They were both scientists experimenting with unstable concoction that ends up giving them enhanced abilities and they end up becoming super villains. They are also both green (though The Lizard is a mutation while Norman just wore a suit). This film even ripped off the split personality thing that Norman had and had Connors exhibit it as well. Can you not come up with anything new? Unlike Green Goblin, the Lizard is just a bore. Green Goblin at least had energy and you loved to hate him. The only thing the Lizard had over Green Goblin is that his motivations are clearer. Ultimately, his main goal is just a stereotypical comic book villain plot and nothing more, which would not be so bad if the villain was more interesting and more fun. I have problems with the Green Goblin in the first film but he is a much more entertaining film and Willem Dafoe brings his A-game unlike the guy who plays the Lizard who was sleepwalking through his role.<br/><br/>This film is also guilty of false advertising. The trailers advertised that Peter's parents would be in the movie and would play a big part in Spiderman's origin. This actually got me excited when I heard about it. Peter's parents had never been explore or even mentioned on screen before. Even in the comics they are rarely touched upon. I thought that this would be a great addition to Spiderman's mythos and would help this film stand out from the others. Instead this plot point was only teased to us in multiple parts of the film (mainly the beginning) and is left to be explained in the sequel. No! That's unacceptable. You cannot advertise such a large plot element in the trailers but do nothing with it. That's called false advertising.<br/><br/>Even though I like Andrew Garfield as Peter I do not like this Peter Parker. People complain about Peter in the Raimi films being too whiny but this Peter is just as whiny. He also comes off as a jerk to everyone a number of times throughout this movie especially to Aunt May and Gwen. He is too downbeat is the problem. Tobey McGuire was more upbeat than him. Peter Parker/Spiderman is supposed to be a more upbeat character that uses his wit with villains to cope with his situation, which he barely does here. All of the advertising that was released was promoting a wittier Spiderman and everyone constantly raves about how Spiderman is actually witty in this, but he's not. He tells like four jokes in the entire film. Tobey McGuire used his wit just as much in the first film. Tobey's Spiderman did not use his wit nearly as much as he should have but it is not like he never used it. I can think of three or four times in each of the three movies where he tries to be witty and funny, which is about as many times as Andrew Garfield did. This is another case of false advertising. Also, I do not like the new costume Spiderman has. If there was one thing that the Raimi films got right 100% it was the costume. The new costume does not look as nearly as cool and it is too dark, much like the film itself.<br/><br/>I have the same problem with Peter as I do with the movie in general in that he is too dark. Another major issue with the film is that it is too dark. Amazing Spiderman feels very much like Batman Begins from the majority of the film focusing on origin to the overall look of the film to the very tone of the film which is too dark. The film might as well be called Spiderman Begins rather than Amazing Spiderman. Spiderman is not Batman. They are two completely different characters. Just because The Dark Knight Trilogy is popular does not mean you can use the same tone for every superhero. Marvel Studios understands this so why can't other studios understand it. You can say that the other film (especially the first one) is too campy but they felt much more like Spiderman than this movie did.<br/><br/>Peter, in this film, is not only too dark but he is also a moron. He is supposed to be a genius but he does not come off as smart at all in this. After he discovers his abilities there are several scenes where he shows he has powers in public places whether it'd be in a subway or his school. There are also a couple scenes where he is web-slinging in the middle of the city without his costume where everyone can clearly see him. Really Peter!? How it that none of these people put it together that he is Spiderman? There are scenes like that in the original film but they are done subtler than it is here. He also puts his name on some of his personal belongings which is how The Lizard figures out he is Spiderman. Both Gwen and her father both find out his secret too. He cannot keep his identity a secret to save his life. I know he is supposedly a teenager but he is a complete idiot in this film.<br/><br/>Some of the casting does not work for me either. I like Martin Sheen as an actor his take on Uncle Ben did nothing for me and I did not care for Sally Field as Aunt may at all. To me, Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris are the definitive Uncle Ben and Aunt May.<br/><br/>On another note, the effects are subpar. I cannot believe that this film cost more than the Avengers. Some of the effects look pretty good but most of them are on par with the first film which came out a decade prior to this. The effects of Spiderman 2 & 3 beat the crap out of the effects in this movie. For example, the CGI for the Lizard himself is god-awful. He looks almost as silly as the Green Goblin's costume in the first movie. The score is completely forgettable. Say what you want about the score for the other three movies, but at least it is memorable. I do not remember the music for Amazing Spiderman at all.<br/><br/>Overall, I did not like this movie at all. I know I am in the minority but I do not care. Hopefully Amazing Spiderman 2 is actually good. Say what you want about the original film, but that film is timeless, it has heart, and it is, above all, fun. I like all of the Sam Raimi films better than this film. Yes, I even prefer Spiderman 3 over this. That film was, at least, entertaining. This movie is boring, a retread of the first film, too dark, and is not that fun at all, in my opinion."

","When I first watched it, I used to think it was good but when I decided to watch it a couple of years later, it didn't hold up.

I don't like Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker at all because he's awkward in the whole movie which killed the character. He's not bad as spider-man but he should've focus on Peter. I think it's underrated but the reason why I'm giving it a 5 is because I want to be honest of my rating, if I did like the movie I would've rate it to 8 but the studio interference is the big problem in the film.

","The amazing spiderman was an unnecessary reboot but I'm glad its come about anyway. Spiderman has always been a cheesy and weak superhero tale for me however this new take on the web slinger is invigorating. The focus on his parents is new, as is the new love interest, both worked but what worked more is Andrew Garfield as spiderman. In now way is he a believable geek, Tobey Maguire is a better Peter Parker but Garfield is a better Spiderman in more ways then one. He's funny and cool, everything a super hero should be. More importantly he's genuine, he brings some reality to the role. Mark Webb has done a superb job in re-creating spiderman and creating new paths to explore in an otherwise plain story."

","Following the release of Spiderman 3, which was a major box office hit but was seen as a high letdown by most of the fan base, Sony Pictures and director Sam Raimi sent to work on making a fourth Spiderman film that would conclude Peter Parker's story arch as Sam felt he could right the wrongs of the previous film and give the fans the proper finale they wanted. However, Sony's meddling would sadly continue as producer Avi Arad and the other studio executives continued to pester Raimi with their own suggestions such as filming the movie in 3D and insisting on having Carriage in the movie. Things were made worse as Raimi hated every draft of the script that was given to him but that wasn't the only problem he had to deal with. Besides the non-stop meddling from Sony, another issue was the fact that the film's production was shaping up to be a mess despite the amount of talent involved as the film was being rushed for a 2011 release date with a lousy screenplay featuring a bleak story that would have divided audiences and the with the film being shot in 3D, that meant that Sam would have had to start shooting sooner in order for the film to be finished on time. With mounting pressure from the studio and the amount of work increasing on the film, Sam Raimi finally decided to jump ship and with no director, Spiderman 4 was canceled soon after. However, a plan was in place at Sony that would allow them to hold on to the Spiderman property until 2015. Screenwriter James Vanderbilt had already begun writing a treatment for a reboot of the character as Avi Arad wanted to do something akin to Batman Begins for Spiderman. Later on, Sony chairwoman Amy Pascal hired indie director Marc Webb to direct the film but Avi would insist that the film was an interquel likely dreading the hostile implications the term reboot had. Nevertheless, it appeared that Sony's reboot of the webhead paid off when the film was released in July of 2012. Despite some people complaining that the plot of The Amazing Spiderman was a carbon copy of the first Spiderman film from 2002, the film still did well with critics, audiences and the box-office.<br/><br/>Now, my experience with The Amazing Spiderman is limited as I never saw the film in the theater when it first came out and given how I wasn't a big fan of comic book movies at the time, the film simply didn't interest me. However, a few years back, I decided to watch it in preparation for seeing Spiderman Homecoming and upon thinking back on The Amazing Spiderman, while there are things that I did enjoy about the movie such as the acting and the musical score, other elements like the story and characters left a lot to be desired in my eyes.<br/><br/>The story opens with a young Peter Parker stumbling upon his father's research and seeing it burgled. Alarmed, Richard and Mary Parker gather up critical documents and take Peter to the home of his Aunt May and Uncle Ben and then depart. Years pass, and Peter now goes to high school where he catches the eye of Gwen Stacy. While at home, Peter uncovers his father's old documents and finds out that his father used to work with Dr. Curt Connors at a company known as Oscorp. Sneaking his way into the building, Peter creeps into a laboratory where he is bitten by a radioactive spider. On his way home, Peter gets into a fight with some thugs and discovers that he now has increased agility and strength. Now, with these newfound powers, Peter Parker dons a new identity to protect the city of New York as the hero Spiderman.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spiderman feels like a mess of different ingredients into a pot, stir for 2 hours and yet it never comes close to other superhero films that came before it. While there are moments in the film that are great, they still pale in comparison to what Sam Raimi already did so perfectly with the first two Spiderman movies. No matter how hard Webb tries to make The Amazing Spiderman work as a film, there is just too much going on here for the story to find its' own footing. With the movie clocking in at 2-and-a-half hours, the movie feels like a superhero origins story and a separate adventure movie that isn't sure if it should tell Peter Parker's origin or just hustle through all the story points of one of the most recognizable superhero backstories in comics or if it's attempting to bring something much deeper to the table. When The Amazing Spiderman does get moving, it becomes a mildly entertaining film that tries to bring something new to the Spiderman mythos, but it still encounters the same identity crisis as Peter Parker and fails to find its' own style.<br/><br/>One of the core ideas that dominate the story of The Amazing Spiderman is the concept of genetics being spliced together from different species to create something entirely new. In a way, the film feels like a gene splice of other movies as it seems that the writers and Avi Arad just took the gritty and grounded world of Batman Begins and the romance of Twilight and threw the two elements into the world that Sam Raimi had already built. Sure, The Amazing Spiderman does escape from a lot of the problems that the Twilight films had and replaces them with a slightly more cultured mindset. Now, comparing The Amazing Spiderman to Nolan's Batman Begins is an obvious flaw that the film has as Avi, Amy, and the other Sony executives clearly thought that making the film more dark and gritty would be beneficial to the story and their own coffers. However, it seems that they learned the wrong lessons from Nolan's Batman films as dark and gritty simply doesn't work for a character like Spiderman and the film's version of New York City reflects that. Sure, the three Spiderman films that Sam Raimi directed took place in New York too, but they were never set in a realistic version of the city. The first three Spiderman movies took place in a color-saturated version of New York that felt like a four-color painting brought to life. In contrast, The Amazing Spiderman's version of New York is ugly to look at. All the lighting has been turned way down and Spiderman now swings around at night. What is he, Batman now?! There's tons of polished glass and this version of New York City looks less like a thriving metropolitan area and more like an isolated place that has been disconnected from the rest of the world. It's a city of thieves and muggers, not street singers belting out catchy songs. Yeah, and people whined about Man of Steel being too much like Batman Begins in terms of tone.<br/><br/>What's even darker is the character of Peter Parker. Now, I'm aware that in the comics, Peter was always portrayed as an orphan much like Bruce Wayne before him. Not that it's that big of a deal but the idea of Peter losing his parents at a young age means that he doesn't take the murder of Uncle Ben as personally as Bruce Wayne does as Peter just learned a lesson that he sometimes takes far too seriously. In The Amazing Spiderman, Peter is so distracted with finding out about his parents, uncovering his secret origin and attempt to find what happened to his mother and father. I've heard some people say this subplot does a decent job setting up his parents but I feel that since we never truly learn what Peter's parents are even doing and why they have to leave so suddenly, it does nothing for the overall story and just comes across as another meaningless subplot. The other issue with this plot point is that it weakens a lot of what Peter takes for granted. When people generally think about Spiderman, they think about a teenager taking care of his ill aunt, trying to pay his rent, continually gets kicked around by the world as he attempts to find his place in it. Unlike some other superheroes, Peter Parker is a blue-collar kid gifted with extraordinary abilities who has to juggle all the issues in his life, something that we saw in Spiderman: Homecoming that was done perfectly but here, we never really see this Peter Parker do that as he doesn't seem to have any motivations in the film. At first, it appears that he is attempting to find out what happened to his parents which doesn't go anywhere then half an hour later, he's now trying to control his new abilities in an ultimately pointless scene that does nothing for the story or the character. In the first Sam Raimi Spiderman film, Peter learned how to use and control his powers in a secure environment, not by beating the piss out of a few random thugs on a subway train. It's good to know that not one person even bothered to report that some teenager beat up 5 random hoodlums while climbing up a wall, but having Peter learn how to use his powers isn't enough as the film has to throw Uncle Ben getting shot in our faces again. However, this time, the film fails to make me care about Peter or Ben because Parker lets the felon go simply because he couldn't get chocolate milk. To get that angry all because he didn't have enough money for chocolate milk that Peter would allow a criminal to rob the store and get away is nothing short of the plan of three writers and a studio executive who simply do not understand the characters of Spiderman and Peter Parker and another reason why this incarnation of Peter Parker is unlikable and not worthy of any sympathy from me. So, ten minutes later, we see Peter looking for the criminal and trying to bring him to justice rather than allow the police to handle this and then after a while, the film loses interest in that subplot and jumps over to Dr. Curt Connors who has now become The Lizard. Does he have any character, any motivations, any personality? The writers, Arad, and Webb don't seem to know or care so why should I. The plot is such a disjointed mess that it's a miracle that I was able to even enjoy watching this movie but then again, at least The Amazing Spiderman wasn't boring like Batman V Superman or Frant4sic.<br/><br/>Another big issue that the film makes is having Peter's powers become a gift. He gets bitten by a spider bearing a blueprint"

","The worst representation of Spider-Man in comic book film history. The audience while watching may not pay attention to how arrogant and criminal like he is - Spider-Man. As Andrew Garfield acting makes it come across as charming. When he goes to OsCorp to try to find out what his parents were looking into, he probably steals someones opportunity of a lifetime. That does sound really bad doesn't it? And instead of feeling guilty he smirks. But because Andrew looks good-looking we, the audience, think he could get away from everything. And it's not just his good looks. It is his personality. He acts so cocky.When Uncle Ben died (which is essential since it is deemed to drive the whole movie) they argued so much I didn't properly feel a connection. But it also had something to do with the fact that they tried to get us to feel sympathy for almost everyone. But the real problem with the scene was Uncle Ben put himself in danger. The killer ran a block and bumped into Ben, and by the way, he has no idea what is going on - Ben. The killer falls over and drops his gun. Ben sees it and he strangely screams and then grabs the gun. Doesn't get to it first and gets shot. Why did he do that? That really made me hate this movie. When Peter went to find his Uncle's killer. He literally beat up anyone who looked like him no just that but he also wore a mask while doing it. You could see the look on the innocent people faces.<br/><br/>This movie wasn't pushed by 'Great power comes great responsibility', this film was motivated by revenge. And this is certainly the directors choice, not Andrews. And the parents being added to the plot was too much they should've started at the leaving Peter scene and saved the rest for the sequel. I guess you could say that this is a bad Spider-Man film, but I would like to argue that this is just a bad film. The three editors (that's right, just three) made a scene that I almost liked and weirdly turned into a near Michael Bay action scene. The constant white and black full screen flashes would show whenever he touched someone on the train. And it seemed like a mistake. The reason I almost liked this scene was that this determined what his rest of life was supposed to be like. And the editors ruined it. But the next two scenes were better at suming his rest of like up. They were funny. Something that every superhero movie is ment to show. Also I thought that the relationship scenes between Gwen and Peter were way too long - Although they were cute together. The villain was one of the best parts of the movie. Played by Rhys Ifans, the villain was Dr. Curt Connors or otherwise known as the Lizard in comics. The reason I loved him so much was how he was built up made me and probably everyone else, feel so much sympathy and was the only one that gave me sympathy for him. And it kind of made the antagonist feel justified in a way and particularly at the end, he knew what he was doing was wrong. The CGI had to be used and it was good, but nothing exceptional. But humorously he does look like the Goombas from the Super Mario Movie (search it up), but if you compare it to a comic appearance of the Lizard it looks like it would be hard to try and parody that into a movie.<br/><br/>The fight scenes were remarkable. And I think everyone can agree that the Stan Lee cameo was one of the best moments in the movie. The background settings they used for the antagonist was adapted straight from the comics. If I had to make the villain a smidge better I would have Andre Braugher play him. Rhys was fine. Andre has a stone cold character in some of his movies and shows which I think it would be an excellent fit with the villain. The costume for Spider-Man could have unquestionably been enhanced. I believe it looked to leathery and there was too much blue. Andrew Garfield brought a fantastic New Yorker accent to Peter Parker. And frankly he just had a bad script and unmistakably bad directing. Emma Stone played Gwen Stacy and she was average in this movie. The audio was alright but when Andrew and Emma were performing a scene together as Peter and Gwen, it was very quiet. Mainly there voices. Nothing ridiculously impressive. The ending was a little powerless. With this grade, I'm being really generous."

"CinematicGarbage","4","0","5","11 May 2019"," Not neccessary to have this Reboot!
","After the Trilogy from Sam Raimi, director Marc Webb started a reboot for Spider-Man for those who hated Sam Raimi's trilogy. But then, I felt a bit more disappointed. This was also a mess as big as Spider-Man 3, but then I watched a few clips of the movie again, and I thought this mess was bigger than Spider-Man 3. The movie was marked to be the Untold Story. I see nothing untold.
Andrew Garfield played Peter Parker/Spider-Man. This time, there's no MJ but as I said there's another love interest and it is Gwen Stacy played by Emma Stone. The performances were okay but the scenes they filmed, the plot they made, were kinda bad.<br/><br/>The first issue is Spider-Man. The biggest problem of the movie. He's like a bully, a punk, who wanted to skateboard when his teacher told him not to. He also bullied and humiliated Flash Thompson. I really don't like Garfield in here, I only liked him being Eduardo Saverin in The Social Network (2010). I though I'm gonna be excited for this, I thought this is gonna be better than Sam Raimi's trilogy, then it's a disappointment. The worst thing about Spider-Man in here is the suit. It's INCREDIBLY AWFUL! The eyes got yellow and the suit looked so old-fashion. The defences of the suit (people who commented to defend it) were a bunch of failures. They didn't even realize that Spidey got some cool web shooters, why can't he have a cool suit as well? That's just silly! The only thing I like about Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man is that he had a sense of humor. He usually told jokes in the movie but I don't think he's the funniest Spider-Man.<br/><br/>Rhys Ifans playing The Lizard was such an embarrassment. Then I realized ""IT WAS THE SCREENPLAY THAT MADE IFANS SO BAD AT BEING DR. CURT CONNORS/THE LIZARD!"". For example ""Nowhere to hide, Peter"" or ""I'm getting stronger everyday!"". How can he know Spider-Man is Peter Parker. I saw the screen a bit clearly and I saw there's a bit of bad CGI of the Lizard. Ifans made a really bad villain, and bad here meant terrible (with the terrible script). Who's writing this? But Topher Grace is still the worst casting choice of a villain. Don't worry Ifans!<br/><br/>The only thing I really like about this movie is Stan Lee's cameo and the scene when Spider-Man swung around the city. Stan Lee played the school librarian. He was tidying the chemicals and he didn't notice that it was a big mess behind him. He's listening to classic music. The scene was just so funny that made me laughed. The ending is good too when our webslinger was swinging around the city like Spider-Man (2002) and Spider-Man 2 (2004). This one was also as epic as those two.<br/><br/>This is (in conclusion) not a big mess but it is still a mess. There were so many problems with this movie but it's just part one so audiences would think that ""it's okay, I give it a 9/10"". I'm more of a stricter movie rater about some bad and disappointing movies and this one deserved a mixed rating from me."

","7 July 2012. Try as one might, this movie had the same impact as No Country for Old Men (2007), the plot weaknesses couldn't make up for some exciting and emotive scenes that attempted to put some substantive quality into the superhero movie genre, like The Dark Knight (2008) using a darker plot and characters. But The Amazing Spider-Man (2012), the script and director appear to want everything bot the light, mainstream populist entertainment and humor along with the more serious undercurrent of supposedly three-dimensional characters. The mix doesn't work as well in this movie as in Spiderman-3 (2007).<br/><br/>The plot suffers from too many script weaknesses and devices: (1) the overly-fancy secure lock that Peter Parker is can so easily access into an apparently bio-level 4 hazardous facility, (2) the infecting spider scene didn't seem as plausible, with so many spiders, (3) the immediacy of the change and the rapid adaptation of Peter Parker seemed overly rushed (perhaps for the script-writer's important scenes to come) which unlike Spiderman (2002) didn't offer the elegant acoustical and even first-person sense perception, (4) Gwen Stacy's boyfriend implied seems to drop out of the picture too easily in regards to trying to keep Gwen, no typical jealousy scene, (5) Peter Parker's transformation into an obnoxious teenager seems also too abrupt as well as Dr. Curt Conner's behavior and attitude which was much more well-developed by Willem Defoe as Norman Osborne in Spiderman (2002), (6) a somewhat confusing Batman like unnecessary in this movie dependence on technology for the Spiderman's webbing better revealed as part of the natural transformation of Peter Parker himself, and (7) Gwen's father's intransigent attitude towards Peter Parker and denial of the more important monster on the loose belief was also over the top.<br/><br/>There was a sincere effort to transform this movie into more than the typical superhero, blockbuster movie - the later scene with Dr. Curt Conner and Peter Parker which was suggestive, but not as effective as Blade Runner (1982) and Rutger Hauer's performance and dialogue as Roy Batty. Even the typical nerd scenes in the beginning had a more serious and dramatic presentation and yet Peter Parker's personality and sarcastic behavior later in the movie seemed to be overplayed. The movie even included some creative and exciting but only suggestive first-person perspectives of Spiderman's thrilling execution of moving around skyscrapers and buildings (but failed to take advantage of it - perhaps for some future theme part ride). Overall, the movie tried to remake Spiderman, but it couldn't incorporate the sincere attempt into a well balanced and believable movie."

Emma Stone played her role perfectly, I was always amazed by her acting and she prooved me here once more of her capabilities. Other than that, I feel like the movie needed another antagonist, an anti-hero right next to ""The Lizard"", just like things were going on in the first 3 Spider-Man movies.

","The Amazing Spiderman. The Spiderman reboot nobody wanted actually turned out to not be bad. However it did have a lot of issues.<br/><br/>We're introduced to the new characters, Peter (Andrew Garfield) starts off acting extremely weird. Honestly he doesn't feel natural, but he does get better throughout the movie. Also why is he a skater?! Anyways I thought his portrayal of peter wasn't really that good. Andrew Garfield does show some good acting in this movie, but he just acts peter out really weirdly for me.<br/><br/>I do think his Spiderman is great. He's cracking jokes (not very good ones, but it still works) while still remaining serious.<br/><br/>Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) was actually really great. In the previous Spiderman movies, Mary Jane was always the damsel in distress, but in this movie Gwen isn't, and she actually helps Peter. Not only that, but she also has good chemistry with Peter.<br/><br/>The School scenes are also a improvement, but again they don't really feel that natural, and don't look like students, but it works much better than in the original film.<br/><br/>Aunt May (Sally Field) and Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) are both once again great. They feel like actual ""parents"" to peter, and they feel believable.<br/><br/>Peter's actual parents are in the movie for no reason, I mean it's cool to see what happened, but it's never really explained, and it makes everything more convoluted.<br/><br/>Peter getting his powers was much better this time, and I love how he's actually smart in this movie. In the original movie peter never seemed actually smart, but here he really does feel like he's smart.<br/><br/>When he discovers his powers it's also done much better, in a really funny scene. The way it happens makes more sense.<br/><br/>Uncle Ben's death wasn't as good as the first time he died, but it was still pretty good. In the original movie Peter is somewhat responsible for it, and it had a great line where peter repeats what the wrestling promoter said, but in this one it's changed to repeating what the store clerk said, and it doesn't work as well. I mean Peter acts like a jerk in this scene. He's literally letting the guy get robbed because he couldn't afford chocolate milk.<br/><br/>Now peter uses his powers to look for his Uncle's killer, which was done pretty well. I also like how each time he finds another crook he learns. The first time he isn't wearing a mask, but then one of the crooks tells him ""I KNOW YOUR FACE"" so he makes a mask. And then this whole sub plot is dropped and never picked up again.<br/><br/>The Lizard was a pretty good villain at first, his motivations make sense, but then he goes all silly and has a stupid plan. When Peter fights the lizard in the school (actually a really good action scene) couldn't the cameras pick up that Peter is Spiderman? Also The Lizard makes an entire video of his plan for some reason.<br/><br/>The third act wasnt too good, but Captain Stacy's death was really good. I also think his character was great. The fight just doesn't make sense, I mean the lizard puts the Thing to turn people into lizards in the thing that shoots it up into the sky to make everyone lizard (very silly) but it takes a few minutes to get shot Up, but then peter puts the cure and it doesn't need to restart? What's the point of the thing waiting?!<br/><br/>
Anyways I did enjoy this movie. It wasn't bad, it had a lot of improvements, but it also had a lot of issues.<br/><br/>6.5/10"

Speaking from experience, its much better to defend yourself against such a wussy. But other than that, the movie was good, Toby's Spiderman was far better however.

The Lizard is one of the worst villains i have ever seen but lets begin with Dr connors.
Dr connors is underdeveloped we almost know nothing about him and we never get to see how much he struggles without an arm which is bd development.
The Lizard is worse he has no personality he gives no threat to Spider-Man.
And his one motivation for killing Spider-Man that gets ignored later on is ""He is stopping me from doing what i want to do, i will kill him.""
That gets ignored after Lizard fights Spidey in school and then he has another motive to turn everyone into Lizards which is stupid.
And you know yo made abad villain if the police the ones who are trying to save and help people are bigger threats to Spider-Man than the main villain.<br/><br/>ACTION
The action is bad.
A good Spider-Man action scene is when Spider-Man tries to find a way to solve his problems but des it in a creative way, there is none of that in this movie.
The best action scene is Lizard vs Spider-Man when they fight in the school but that scene is pointless cause the reason they have that scene is because The Lizard want's to kill Spider-Man and has a bad motivation for why but after that scene they just ignore the motivation the Lizard has for killing Spider-Man.
Action bad.<br/><br/>DEATH
I will keep this short the reason Uncle Ben died is because Peter was mad at the store owner for doing his job.
And Captain stacy's death and the Final act with him was pointless, the reason it was there cause after all the disagreements they had with each other they finally work together but they never developed how there opinions are so different so we don't really care if he dies.<br/><br/>Teacher: You are late Mr Parker.
Peter: Sorry for being late it will never happen again
Teacher: Don't make promises you can't keep
Peter sits behind Gwen
Peter: yeah but those are the best kind
Idk why i did that but who cares<br/><br/>VERDICT
This movie is a mess don't watch cause it's really bad and people who give it a high score are stupid."

","Upon first release I really enjoyed the movie, looking back I don't really like it as much. First of Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone deliver the best performances in the film, Garfield has a love for the character and he and Stone's chemistry is wonderful. The action is also very well done, with cool swinging and fighting visual effects. Martin Sheen and Sally Field also make turn in great performances as Aunt May and Uncle Ben, so what's bad about it. Well the film has a strange Dark tone, of all comic-book superheroes Spider-Man is definitely not a hero who needs a dark tone movie, I know some comics have these great dark storylines, but it just doesn't feel right to me. The story is also just a retelling of the same one we got back in 2002, which isn't terrible it just doesn't add much new. Batman Begins and even Man Of Steel added much new elements and they were also reboots, so it makes me wonder why re-tell it. The Lizard is also one of my favorite Spider-Man villains, I've wanted to see him in a film for a long time, and while Rhys Ifans performance isn't bad, it's just very forgettable and quite bland, the lizard effects also look very computerized and it takes me out of the film sometimes, and finally the fight scenes, while actually really good, are in the worst settings. Sure the bridge scene is awesome, but the night-sewer fight and the big climactic battle, just don't feel as good as they could've been, and like I've said before setting all of the fights at night look very off putting. I don't mind some night fights, but there are literally no action scenes with Spider-Man during the day. All in all the film is fine, and if you like it that's okay, but for me personally, I prefer The Rami Trilogy and The MCU."

","The trouble with this film is that it knows we don't need it. It is all too aware that it is retelling a story that everybody already knows, not only because it is possibly the most famous of all superhero origin stories, but because of its proximity to the 2002 original. Because of this, it seems caught in two minds - should the origin story be told carefully, acknowledging that it is rehashing a familiar tale but making sure it does it convincingly and with better and slicker effects; or should it be skipped through as quickly as possible to get to the real meat of the story? The answer appears to be neither. The elements of the story are all there, and are solid enough, but it is almost as though they are set pieces, chapters to be ticked off. This over-careful stacking of elements creates a perfectly logical structure (though the jerky adjustments in scene and tone leave some parts over-padded and others underdeveloped), but it is one which is sadly uninteresting, providing little in the way of tension or co- ordinated escalation of drama. In a similar vein, characters don't develop, but suddenly - and I mean in a matter of moments - entirely change their motivations, allegiances, and even personalities to suit the direction of the story. It is a whirlwind, and it gives the impression that, perhaps because it believes that their familiarity will automatically win the audience over, it doesn't care about its characters.<br/><br/>This film has some good scenes, and is generally well acted (though Andrew Garfield just isn't dweeby enough to be believable as pre- bite Parker), but that's really all that can be said for it. It is just 'ok', and I don't think those who made it were really convinced it could be more."

","The Amazing Spiderman movies were the result of Sony trying to keep themselves wholly independent of MARVEL Studio's influence or rights-holding; and the film really shows it years on from its release. This is like if a Chris-Nolan-wannabe did Spidey knowing all the basic stuff on the character and decided to cut out all the occasional humour/campiness of the Raimi movies that made them stand out from somber action flicks. Not that I really have anything against Marc Webb as a director, but you'd think that his work on 500 Days of Summer would have better reflected the teen-drama aesthetic present in the Spiderman stories. Sadly the vibrancy of Summer doesn't come up in this Spiderman movie. Though Emma Stone as Gwen Stacey is some of the best casting this side of 2010s Hollywood.<br/><br/>All in all it's a Spiderman movie; just not a standout one.

","As a big fan of Sam Raimi's films with everyone's favorite wall crawler and web slinger (yes, even the third one), I was more than skeptical when it came to this reboot. Hence it was no surprise I didn't like this film on a first watch and things didn't change with this rewatch either.<br/><br/>Why do the origin story again, just tweaked a bit, when it was already perfectly done by Raimi? Because Sony was afraid to lose the rights to Marvel, if they didn't come up with something. And because it is a reboot so they need to restart the franchise and make some easy money while at it. What they came up with though is half-baked and disappointing on almost every level. I mean, just having to listen to Uncle Ben rephrase the classic line ""with great power comes great responsibility"" in order to avoid sounding too familiar to the original goes to show how pointless all of this is.<br/><br/>This ""updated"" version for ""modern audiences"" completely changes Peter Parker into someone I don't find myself hurrying to root for. Compared to (and I know it's not really fair to compare it to the original but they basically asked for it) Tobey Maguire's character, this Peter Parker seems so shallow. In the original Peter Parker was a meek, even poor four-eyed crammer with no parents. In this, he wears contact lenses and has a skateboard. Just by giving Maguire's Parker this constant struggle with money you bring the audiences to side with him, not to mention the fact that he's an orphan. Here, it's almost taken for granted that we should root for him because he's an orphan, whereas I don't think that's enough. He seems like a spoiled brat who is too ""cool"" for his own sake. Andrew Garfield is fine for the most part but I don't find him particularly great in the role.<br/><br/>Rhys Ifans as Dr. Curt Connors/The Lizard does a good job with what he's given; he's not given that much though. From the first time you see him he already begins laying out what he's all about: his obsession with finding a medical solution for his missing arm. Not that I'm expecting deep character development or solid motives when it comes to the villain but it sure helps to flesh him out a bit.<br/><br/>I'm not going to get into the whole Gwen Stacy romance and the sub-plot with her father but they seem as poorly handled as the rest of the characters/relationships. It's not a terrible film by any means, I actually enjoyed it somewhat. I liked how Spider-Man saved the kid on the bridge, the fight in the school and in the sewers, the fact that they made Spider-Man a very agile superhero and that they went for a dramatic, almost corny tone by the end. All of that I liked. But. It felt like a rushed and unnecessary rehash of already great content."

This one is somehow worse. Mainly due to the fact that it takes a more darker tone which is something that doesn't work well with Spider- Man's character. Spider-Man's character is witty and cheesy and this Spider-Man still has that wit but there's not enough of it. The entire movie is just this really gritty and dark setting which works in some places but it isn't the Spider-Man we know and love so much. You know what I really want?

HE does not have the hapless, sympathetic nerd factor of McGuire, nor does he have the fire in his eyes of a motivated warrior of justice. <br/><br/>Rhys Ivans is well cast for a villain. He is an actor who, when at his best, is exceptional. Unfortunately he falls into the generic narrative of the brilliant scientist who becomes a CGI monster.<br/><br/>Aside from Gwen Stacy, The Amazing Spiderman brings nothing new to the material.

","There really should be a time-limit on re-boots, in my opinion. I get that Spider Man is probably the best known Marvel Comics character and that this was their own reclaiming of him under their own banner, but I enjoyed the Raimi and McGuire tilt at old Spidey and didn't think that this re-make, despite some obvious changes, completely wiped away its too recent predecessors.<br/><br/>I'm no expert on the comics front but the main changes I saw here were a different girl-friend for Peter Parker in the form of Gwen Stacey, played by Emma Stone, a different villain in The Lizard (Rhys Ifans) and no J Jonah Jameson or anything to do with the Daily Bugle. Otherwise it's the same old same old with another origin sequence, bullying scenes with Flash, the noble death of old Uncle Ben and another metamorphosing super-villain imperilling New York City.<br/><br/>I did like Andrew Garfield, incidentally a double for tennis player Andy Murray, who plays a different kind of geek in Peter Parker than Tobey McGuire. He convincingly looks young enough in the part and I enjoyed the repartee his Spidey has with the villains he battles and the familiar wall-hanging poses he adopts throughout, just like the comics I remember. Gwen Stacey dresses a little oddly for a trainee scientist in knee-high socks and boots but Emma Stone acquits herself well as the hero's girlfriend who coincidentally is the daughter of the police chief (Denis Leary), who wouldn't you know it, despite the evidence of his own eyes and countless witnesses still can't differentiate do-gooder Spider Man from the evil Lizard.<br/><br/>The SFX were excellent, especially all the web-slinging and web-swinging, with the big fight sequence at the end taking us all the way back to ""King Kong"" as a reference point. But was it better than the first Sam Raimi take on the character? The box-office returns would suggest not. I'll look out for the sequel from 2014, but wouldn't you know it, there's another re-boot around the corner later this year in ""Spider Man Homecoming"".<br/><br/>Careful you don't squash this particular spider with your (re)boot Marvel."

","""Really? Why...?"" <br/><br/>Yes, this was the general nonplussed audience reaction when The Amazing Spider- Man was greenlit. Sony, attempting to burn images of emo-haired, hip-thrusting Tobey Maguire from viewers' brains, opted for the post -Schumacher Batman route, by pretending it simply never happened. Cool. Fair. So: a paradigm shift privileging, y'know fun? Orrrrrr, resetting the clock with a patented (/already stale) ""gritty reboot"" (sigh). After all, why do something interesting or jaunty with the superhero world-famous for his cheeky sense of playfulness, when you could, once again, subject audiences to the death of Uncle Ben (spoilers! NOT), and his most hilariously cumbersome paraphrasing of ""with great power comes great responsibility"" yet? That said, given their abominable squandering of their most popular franchise here, it seems it's a lesson Sony, more than their audiences, could benefit from hearing. <br/><br/>Initially, director Marc Webb (guess how he got the job) seemed an ideal choice. Fresh off sprightly, revisionist rom-com (500) Days of Summer, his grasp of 'The Youths' seemed as intuitive as any - who better to breathe life into the neurotically lovable superhero fussing about dating and laundry while fighting crime right? Sadly, Webb's name is about as close as he gets to Spider-Savvy, with his laboured, dull, and loathsomely faux-hip super-sludge-fest. To be fair, Webb certainly embraces the 'gritty' qualifier with gusto, opting for a shady, chiaroscuro Alex Ross aesthetic, with flashes of colour streaking across the dark like paint running in the rain. It would be quite striking if he could conjure up the content to match. And no, the nauseating, instantly-dated 'first-person Spider-Cam' 3D shots (Peter Parkour?) don't count. Except for accurately emulating a lacklustre early-2000s video game. <br/><br/>Instead, The Amazing Spider-Man is a fundamentally confused endeavour (granted, it's at least more consistently gloomy than its bloated, tonally schizophrenic franchise-bait sequel - though this honestly isn't much of a compliment). It wants to be serious, but fumbles frantically between grim, obsessive vigilante vengeance (yawn) and mumblecore humour (double-yawn), ultimately belly-flopping with both. It distinguishes itself by focusing on the mystery of Peter's dead parents, then only pays dreary, expositional lip-service to them. Most insulting, though: it doesn't seem to understand Spider-Man at all. Instead, the clumsiness that Webb presents suggests hackneyed studio-generated attempts to morph Spidey into their perceptions of what would appeal to as widespread a group of fans as possible. But fans smell artifice. And you wouldn't like them when they're angry (wait - that was that other guy). <br/><br/>Our plot (evil corporation, bad science nonsense, New York in danger) is a dreary, slovenly edited remake of Sam Rami's first two Spidey flicks. Our action spurts are brief and forgettable, including a clumsy, cramped Lizard brawl in a high school, and a climax revolving around a toppling tower spire - oooh! ahh! - a set piece that even Spider-Man 3 treated superfluously in its opening action scene. Even James Horner's brassy score feels hollow and tinny rather than elating. Yet, despite its yearning to stand out, Webb's Spidey still dials up the angst and cheese factors, which drew more flack than anything in Raimi's Spiders (the cranes. THE CRANES!). At the very least, the voluminous FX budget spares no expense in making Spider-Man move masterfully, springing and swinging around like a proper super hero. Still, these are the only fleeting moments the adjective 'Amazing' remotely comes to mind, without the suffix ""ly bad"" ensuing. <br/><br/>But there's no Spider-Man without good ol' relatable, nerdy outcast Peter Parker, right? Well, see him here as you've never seen him before: kind of ...cool? Dressed like an American Apparel catalogue model, effortlessly bagging the hot girl of his dreams, and...skateboarding to Coldplay in a ship yard...?! Even worse: browsing the web (ha) with... Bing??!? Quick: another reboot! ANOTHER REBOOT!!!<br/><br/>It's not poor Andrew Garfield's fault that his Peter is a bit of an angsty hipster prat, though, bless 'im - chock that one up to Webb bleating 'The Youths, The YOUTHS!!!"" with a studio bridle in his mouth. Garfield's Spider-Man, conversely, couldn't be more spot-on: lean, springy, earnest, and constantly wisecracking, he's enormously enjoyable enough to bring into stark perspective how miscast, albeit lovable, poor Tobey was. For his time, Garfield was the first PROPER Spider-Man we'd had to date (holla, Holland!). Even if he opts for even more senseless, unmasked public face time than Tobey. D'oh. <br/><br/>Still, ASM marks the first superhero jaunt where the romance subplot is its strongest element. Yes, really. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone: by gosh they're adorable together. Their awkward, slapstick banter, and surprisingly tender chemistry practically fizzes, and breathes the only real life and energy into the film. Stone alone is already perfection, her Gwen Stacy feisty and snappy enough to practically carry a picture, but together they're unstoppable. <br/><br/>They're about it, though: Rhys Ifans lurks and skulks well, but he does little to punch up his Dr. Connors' vacuous obsessive scientist archetype, while saddled with a deplorably lazy CGI alter ego, unsightly for the wrong reasons (and no lizard lab coat, either. Hmpff). Denis Leary's sneering guilt barometer cop is more intolerably sour than inspirational, while Sally Field and Martin Sheen as Peter's Aunt May and Uncle Ben are both pleasant and capable enough, but barely factor in. The normally excellent Irrfan Khan's sulky Oscorp exec? Less so. But hey - at least Stan Lee's cameo is... fine? Chuckle-worthy, even? Yeah! Go Stan go. <br/><br/>The crown jewel of the 'senseless reboot' camp, The Amazing Spider-Man is bolstered only by Garfield and Stone's effervescent chemistry, and mites of the unquenchable joy of watching Spider-Man swinging across a screen (occasionally in third person and everything!). Still, Webb does his best to quash that joy, with his cantankerous, desperately unimaginative super-flop, choking on its own unwarranted delusions of hipness. There's no J. Jonah Jameson needed to declare this sickly smudge of a film a menace. <br/><br/>-4.5/10"

And randomly he wanted to turn all humans into lizards? It's so random. What's worse is in the end, the Lizard doesn't even die, he just gets put in jail. But on the other hand Captain Stacy dies, in which I think his death is completely unjustified.

The action and fighting was terrible and the villain is just a big unfinished looking CGI blob. The origin story was very good but the rest just seemed like the filmmakers got lazy.

Emma Stone brings The Girlfriend Experience, making Gwen Stacy endearing in her own right, not just because of how much the hero cares for her. Martin Sheen and Sally Field not only make you care about Uncle Ben and Aunt May, but they show you aspects of Spiderman that Garfield can't by himself. Denis Leary really manages to walk that fine line between pompous jerk and loyal protector right into the viewer's heart. In short, the acting is phenomenal.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the storyline is nothing special, and the movie is too often unnecessarily hokey (Really?

","If this rather quick return of the Web-Slinger has any reason to exist, it may be to just keep the Character (Marvel's Most Popular and Fan-Favorite) alive in the ever-growing Universe of Comic-Book Characters on the big screen. <br/><br/>But, one could say that familiarity breeds contempt. For example, by now just like Superman and Batman, anyone with a heartbeat knows the Origin Story and watching it played out again with Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) and Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) with Aunt May (Sally Field) is a Ho-Hum experience.<br/><br/>That's not exactly what is expected when an over 200 Million Dollar Budgeted Super-Hero Movie is unleashed on the Fans and the Public that eats this stuff up like there will never be another one. <br/><br/>But after the Origin Story is over, it settles into its Teen-Angst template. Here again, we get to see Peter Parker, previously bullied by His High School Classmate ""Flash"". The ""Revenge"" that the now Peter (Spider-Man) Parker can unleash is a lame basketball court duel that is Boring and lackluster.<br/><br/>Things pick up after the requisite and awkward Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) verbal courting where They see who can stutter and stammer the most. Peter does a lot of stammering throughout the Film and it gets a bit tiring. <br/><br/>The Movie is at its best with the Lizard Man in the Third Act that saves the Film from an utter and dismal failure. In fact, the final third of the thing when Spider-Man is on the street catching criminals and ultimately confronting The Lizard is good enough to make this darker and more serious Spidey follow up better than a disappointment and leaves hope that Amazing #2 will be much better."

"Horst_In_Translation","6","0","3","17 May 2015"," The relaunch with Andrew Garfield
","Let me start this review by saying that I really like the character of Spider-Man. I loved the first movie from the Raimi trilogy and liked films 2 and 3. This is the second time I watched the first movie with Andrew Garfield and all in all, I am satisfied with what I saw. It is not as good as the Maguire vs. Dafoe film, but still a decent movie. Occasionally, some more subtlety would not have hurt like that sick slam dunk scene was really unnecessary. Or what was with that subway scene. If his senses are sharpened, he wakes up when a drop falls on him, but not when somebody puts a bottle on his head? That doesn't make too much sense. Or the handstand on the skyscraper. All a bit too much over the top at times. Ifans (the goofy best friend in ""Notting Hill"") did a good job as the antagonist and the make-up was top-notch too. He tries to use his chemical knowledge to create a city of lizards, to transform the humans into his kind, but fails the very last second. He survives though, not a given, and ends up in prison where, at the very end, he meets everybody's favorite spider's next main antagonist it seems. Just like in Raimi's movies 1 and 2, Parker goes against a highly intelligent scientist who loses his sanity. Michael Sheen did a fine job as well. And same goes for Emma Stone. I cannot decide if I am team Gwen or Mary Jane, but I easily prefer Emma Stone (Woody Allen's newest muse) over Kirsten Dunst. Stone and Garfield also became a real life couple while shooting this.<br/><br/>This film from roughly three years ago was directed by Marc Webb ""(500) Days of Summer"". It's obviously an entirely different project compared to everything else he has done before, but I think he did a good job directing. The writers for this movie have worked on Fincher's ""Zodiac"" before and also on all the Harry Potter films, so quite an exquisite crew here as well. Another difference would be that there is no character like James Franco here (but a main character's dad dies in the end just like his) and they also did without J. Jonah Jameson, probably because nobody could come close to Simmons' portrayal. The human antagonist role that Jameson filled is dealt with for the most part of the film by Gwen Stacy's dad. Also a good acting performance by Denis Leary. All these ingredients made this one of the big box office hits from 2012, but it did not come close to the numbers of Raimi's movies, where films 1 and 3 were the winners of their respective years in terms of money. Another difference compared to the Raimi films would be that Spiderman's true identity comes quickly to Gwen Stacy and her dad as well. Maguire's Spider was more successful in hiding who he really is. The issue of being seen as the good guy and not the bad guy by the city he lives in is a crucial part of this film too and same goes for Raimi's movies.<br/><br/>Last but not least, there is a fun sequence with Stan Lee at the school. Nice cameo here. He is part of a second half that is better than the first half. The way the title character found out about his new powers and managed to live with them could have been handled more convincingly. Sadly the ending had the same nonsense like one of Raimi's movies that his superhero identity forbids him to have a girlfriend. I really wish they would have gone another path. Anyway, I am curious about the second and last movie of Garfield's/Webb's Spider Man trilogy. Just these days, I read that there will be another relaunch soon with Asa Butterfield as the central character. Until we get to watch him, we can still easily do with the old films as they are pretty good and certainly worth a watch. This is one of them. Recommended."
"Fluke_Skywalker","7","0","2","4 April 2015"," A different spin
","Despite the obvious big budget trappings, there's almost something ""indie"" about director Marc Webb's 'The Amazing Spider-Man'. From its cinematography to its tone, this is very much a Tribeca Spider-Man.<br/><br/>The lanky Andrew Garfield physically embodies Peter Parker perfectly, and though his twitchy, mumbley emo kid take on the character takes some getting used to, he makes it work. His love interest and real life girlfriend Emma Stone have good chemistry together, which is important since their character's romance is handled rather clumsily at times. The rest of the cast fill in around them okay, but are given little to do except function as window dressing.<br/><br/>The film's biggest weakness is its inability to fuse its indie, character driven sensibilities with big budget summer popcorn thrills. The action and stakes all lack the epic quality necessary to take this otherwise well made take on the Spider-Man mythos to the next level."
"brandonsullivan91","6","0","3","29 March 2015"," Skate or die
","I saw this movie about 3 years ago. What do I recall? I remember a 15 minute scene where Peter Parker used his new found powers to skateboard. Skateboard. He uses his powers to skateboard. Sure, I would have some fun trying out activities with super human abilities but that doesn't mean it would be fun for anyone to watch me for 15 minutes doing said activity. So I bring this up as an example that just because some things would be fun or look cool does not make it an interesting aspect of story telling. I did like exploring the avenue of pain and loss from having your parents leave as a child, which is why Parker lives with his uncle and aunt. You will get a full dose of action (so much that it becomes meaningless), the glossy/bright comic book feel, and occasional nice moments between actors. It is good for a one time watch, but nothing demands or warrants a second viewing in my life."
"benisof","7","0","2","29 March 2015"," Fresh approach
","I like this new version of Spiderman. The story was good, the movie was entertaining. Seeing it left me with a positive feeling. There are things that seemed more logical than in the first movie:<br/><br/><ul><li>Father disappearing because he found the mutation formula - Spider-man does not produce all the webs himself, but has a device for it. Imagine from where would Spider-man produce thousands of meters of web, if that must come from inside him...? - He is just a high-school kid, with desire to show off. - He is not bullet proof, and is not immune to damage. He can get hurt.</li></ul><br/><br/>There are some exaggerated scenes, and some flaws in the script/making.<br/><br/><ul><li>The slam-dunk scene is way exaggerated. Imagine doing that in your highschool gym, and not getting on the first page of your newspaper: Freak flies over basket court! - The ""magical"" equation contains an expression of the form log(g exp(something)). This is all they could come up with. Somme sigma, a pi, an exp and a log. They didn't bother seeing that the log and exp cancel... Do us all, who know a little math, a favor, and if you want to write a complicated formula, find a scientist and get a really complicated one. - Even if in this movie Spiderman gets hurt, the battles he has with the lizard-guy are way off balance, and if the lizard guy was such ""animalistic"" as portrayed, Spider-man would not have survived their first encounter. - They could have finished off the lizard with the nitrogen. Instead, they let it regenerate... so it could kill someone at the end. As far as I know, lizards cannot regenerate their heads.</li></ul><br/><br/>This movie is not perfect, but it is entertaining, and that's the point."

","I'm sure there are much more knowledgeable people out there in terms of Spider-Man expertise, after all I just read some of the 90's Spider-man comics when I was younger, not exactly a ""hardcore"" fan by all means, still I have to agree with a lot of the criticism directed towards this reboot attempt. Reboots or remakes aren't exactly a bad thing, but as time passes by we can verify that most of them, unfortunately, follow the global culture in which they were created. TASM is not an exception.<br/><br/>For those who have seen Raimi's trilogy it will be impossible to ignore the déjà vu that you'll be left with. Almost all of the scenes will remind you that it all has been done already, no surprise there, after all the ""basic"" source material for both adaptations was the same, i.e. the comics (although with different scripts). Expecting morality out of a movie would be ridiculous, specially these days, but if you're older than the expected target audience for these movies you'll notice and be annoyed that they made the main character to constantly lie in order to avoid problems when he wanted to follow his own will. Realistic? Unfortunately yes. Faithful to the character portrayed in the comics? As far as I remember, no... Considering the fact that most times the majority of the audience is/will be composed by very young people, and specially if you're a parent, this won't be something you'll want to expose your children to. This isn't new, Raimi's Peter Parker also had some moral issues to deal with but in a way that was consistent with the comics.<br/><br/>Then there are some inconsistencies within the characters themselves. Gwen Stacy is portrayed as being a bit snob and shallow (like MJ in the beginning). Despite her apparent concern with Peter in the beginning she never shows any romantic interest in him until he makes a little demo of his powers, something that kind of contradicts what she says in the sequel and at the same time what Emma Stone said in an interview about the character. Captain Stacy is portrayed as being the opposite of what he was in the comics as well (until he finds out who Spidey is). Overall TASM was an average movie with some good acting bits by the main cast, needing better and longer fight scenes and could have benefited with a better villain design."

","After Spiderman 3 failed to ignite the flame for a fourth installment Sony decided to reboot the franchise of the most popular superhero on earth. I've heard mixed reviews of this movie and even I'm not sure whether or not this is a good or great superhero movie. It's definitely not a wasted reboot. Andrew Garfield is the perfect Peter Parker and Spiderman in this movie. I like the progession from shy bookworm to a level of confidence. He is also witty in this movie, a trait of Spiderman, again not so much explored in the Raimi movies. He has great chemistry with Gwen Stacy played by Emma Stone. The two feed off each others ability and weakness to create a pretty cute couple. The story tries to give you the impression of the backstory of Peter Parker and his parents and having seen the sequel I was unimpressed by the outcome of this subplot. Anotber aspect that was wasted was the Lizard. The lizard is supposed to have a shade of grey but I just want the Lizard to be taken down. I don't care about Dr. Connors even though I should. In that aspect the villain lost the humanity that makes him such a compelling adversary. This movie wasn't the perfect reboot but did give a good platform for the sequel to build upon which is what first installment should do."
"bowmanblue","7","0","2","1 January 2015"," My Spidey senses were tingling, but this film was surprisingly good
","Okay, no one was more cynical than me when I heard the news that Hollywood was 'rebooting' Spiderman only a couple of years after Spiderman 3 was released. I thought it was a complete pointless waste of time. Tobey Maguire's version was so popular, I didn't see how it could be repeated.<br/><br/>Yes, The Amazing Spiderman is a repeat, but, amazingly, it's not as bad as I thought. In fact, I almost enjoyed it more than the original.<br/><br/>I read a lot of internet message boards which criticise BOTH versions from not staying truthful to the source material, i.e. the comics. But, seeing as I've never read any of those, I can't tell which one sticks closer. One of my main gripes with Tobey Maguire's version was that it felt a little too 'cartoony' with its bad computer-generated special effects and teen-choice feel.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spiderman is also centred around high school kids (from what I knew of the comic, Peter Parker was a MAN, not a boy, but anyway...). However, the whole affair seems a lot darker. The Lizard is a good baddie to start off with. It would have been nice to see the (proper) Green Goblin (i.e. not just a man in a green suit of armour), but I'm guessing he'll crop up later on in the franchise.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield is a better hero than Maguire. Despite both playing teenagers, Garfield is also moody and darker, revelling in his newfound powers and even taunting his (lesser) enemies. It seems that the makers of this film looked at Christopher Nolan's Batman franchise with its 'flawed hero' mould and decided to borrow that style to make Peter Parker a little less 'squeaky clean.' My opinion: it was all the better for it.<br/><br/>Yes, you cannot escape the fact that this film is basically the same one you probably watched ten years ago, but with a different cast. However, if you can get over that and accept that that's just how Hollywood rolls these days, you should enjoy it as a decent entry into the superhero genre."

","When I first heard that Marvel and Paramount had decided to forgo Spider Man 4 and instead start over, I was far from optimistic. After all, it had only been ten years since the first movie, and Spider Man 3, although having its fair share of problems, was far a franchise killer. Reports that cost considerations were the driving force behind this decision also did little to reassure me. But have seen Amazing Spider Man, I'm glad to say I was wrong. This is good stuff.<br/><br/>The basic storyline is mostly the same as the original film. Nerdy teen gets bitten by mutated spider, develops super powers, begins relationship with cute girl, and after failing to prevent his uncle's murder starts fighting crime. But in a major departure from the previous films, this time Spider Man finds himself branded on the wrong side of the law. Branded as a threat to the public, Peter becomes the subject of a citywide manhunt, led by Captain Stacy, who just happens to be the father of Peter's girlfriend Gwen.<br/><br/>And instead of the Green Goblin, this movie features another classic foe who's green, large, and scaly: Doctor Curt Connors, the Lizard. Connors is not a bad man. A longtime friend a coworker to Peter's late father, Connors has dedicated his life to developing new medical treatments through genetic experimentation. But when he tests a new drug made from lizard DNA on himself, he becomes a hulking reptilian monstrosity, bent on re-making humanity in his image. And of course only Spider Man can stand between him and his goal.<br/><br/>New star Andrew Garfield has done a surprisingly good job of filling Toby Maguire's shoes. His performance captures the nerdiness and social awkwardness of Maguire's earlier portrayals, along with the initial reluctance to play the hero, while expanding on the character. This version of Peter rides a skateboard, wears a hoodie, and is just a tad younger and more rebellious, bringing him more up to date without radically changing him. Garfield also has excellent chemistry with the lovely Emma Stone, who gives the impression of being every bit as bright as she is beautiful.<br/><br/>The effects and choreography are every bit as good, if not better, than the acting. There's something exhilarating about watching Spider Man web-swing across the city. The raw speed of his swing and the sound of the wind whipping by almost make you forget that you're sitting in a theater seat, and I would love to see how they shot it. Even more impressive is the Spider Man's opponent. The Lizard is an absolute marvel of animatronics and CGI, beyond anything Hollywood could have done even a few years ago. The level of detail given to his scales and face make him as gorgeous as he is hideous, and he moves and acts like a real lizard, right down to the flicker of his tongue and the swing of his tail. <br/><br/>And the movie includes all the good natured comic relief Spider Man fans would expect. There are plenty of one liners and deadpan insults, as well some hilarious physical comedy. And the scene in which Peter first asks Gwen out is so awkward for both parties that you can't help but crack up watching it. This does not mean however, that things don't take a more serious tone when appropriate. The battle in the sewer is actually fairly frightening, at times the film becomes almost somber. One scene in particular struck me as overly dramatic to the point of sappiness, but it was only a brief slip<br/><br/>I'm still not entirely convinced that a reboot was needed, but the results were better than I expected, and put the series on solid ground for the inevitable sequel. With good acting, solid action, and cutting edge effects, Amazing Spider Man is a fun ride across familiar ground."
"r_massey","6","0","1","16 November 2014"," Almost there...
","It's obvious that the filmmakers looked to the successes that were the first two Nolan Batman films and tried to imitate the darker, more grounded tone that they embraced. However, Sony made the wrong move in doing so and failing to understand that Spider-Man is not a dark character.<br/><br/>One of my problems with this film is that it doesn't really feel like a Spider-Man film; it feels like Peter just takes up the mantle of Spider-Man out of nowhere and doesn't really fulfil what it means to be a hero. What troubles me even more is that Spider-Man is conceived out of revenge; the writers made Peter Parker go to the effort of creating the full Spider-Man suit and web-shooters for the purpose of Peter getting his vengeance on his Uncle Ben's killer, no.<br/><br/>The action scenes get quite dull (especially due to Horner's unforgettable score throughout the film), the crane scene at the end was a little cheesy for my liking, the Lizard could have had a lot more potential (especially if they had introduced Connors' family) and the film just fails to capture the true essence of Spider-Man.<br/><br/>Why the high-ish rating then? The cast is great and disregarding this as a ""Spider-Man"" movie, characters are believable and each actor/actress really brings their role to life. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone share wonderful chemistry together and the Peter/Gwen romance is the highlight of this film, trumping the dull relationship between Peter and Mary Jane in Raimi's trilogy. One of my favourite moments from the film was the bridge scene in which Spider-Man saves a young boy trapped in a burning car, hanging off the side of the bridge. Andrew Garfield's charisma comes through a lot here and it's that interaction between him and the young boy that makes his iteration of Peter Parker likable, more so than Tobey Maguire in Raimi's trilogy who often came across as a little too dull and lifeless.<br/><br/>I really want to like ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" but the material and storytelling is average, suffering from having to go through the origin again and having little justification for doing so, especially with the untold story about Peter's parents which is never fully resolved and just gets swept under the rug as the film progresses. The film tries too hard to copy the grittier tone led by The Dark Knight and is consciously trying to separate itself from the Raimi films rather than being its own thing, resulting in a poor execution for a Spider-Man film. That being said, I have watched this film multiple times because of the excellent cast making it worth sticking around for the 2 hr runtime. Andrew Garfield makes for a promising Peter Parker and Spider-Man (despite the poor material he's had to work with) and Emma Stone shines as the strong female lead and love interest Gwen Stacy. If it wasn't for the cast, then this film would most likely get 6/10."
"brendp51","7","0","1","12 October 2014"," Lack of depth
","Having watched the previous spider-man editions featuring Toby McGuire, I had a huge expectation for the next remake. I was quite disappointed in what was offered in this version. The main thing lacking from this edition was the time spent on the characters - and this in both of the new movies. It felt like too many things had to happen it too short of a time, resulting in the lack of getting the audience to relate to the characters. As for the older version, the characters were plotted out very nicely and allowed the me to relate to every circumstance and situation the characters found themselves in. I personally think that one villain per movie is more than enough and that will mean more time spent on the villain to make the audience grasp the gravity of each situation. The new edition felt like a rush through characters, whether good or bad, and a rush through happenings. I enjoyed the movie, however these points mentioned above makes me long for the previous edition where we were forced to fall in love with each persona. I think that some elements in the new version are quite nice and fresh but I think a little more time before the release of this version would not have hurt anyone. All in all, enjoyable movie but the effect not as lasting as the previous edition. Watching these movies once is more than enough."
"ericrnolan","8","0","1","28 September 2014"," Did we really need a reboot of the Spider-Man films after Sam Raimi's great run? Probably not.
","""Spider-Man 2"" (2004) was one of the greatest comic book movies of all time, and even the problematic ""Spider-Man 3"" (2007) wasn't nearly as bad as its many detractors said. Besides, superhero stories are serial by nature, there's no need to stick to a trilogy. Why not just let Raimi, Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst continue to do their thing? (I never realized how much I liked Dunst as Mary Jane until she was absent.)<br/><br/>Because of the Christopher Nolan ""Batman"" films, that's why. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" (2012) is an obvious (and unnecessary) attempt by Columbia Pictures to give Marvel Comics' flagship character the Nolan treatment. IMDb.com even states that the filmmakers credit ""Batman Begins"" (2005) as an influence.<br/><br/>With all of that said, though, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is actually a pretty good movie – I'd give it an 8 out of 10. It doesn't match the charm, humor and sense of fun that Raimi and co, brought us; Peter Parker and Aunt May here and not as likable or relatable. (But Martin Sheen is awesome as ever as Uncle Ben.)<br/><br/>But Andrew Garfield is funny and talented, and he does a great job. This movie actually IS truer to the comics that I remember. Garfield's great line delivery finally gives us the wise-cracking Peter Parker Maguire couldn't pull off. And the Spider-Man I remember from my school days wasn't quite the vulnerable wallflower that we've seen in the Raimi films – especially when thrown into the mix with characters like Wolverine or The Punisher.<br/><br/>This is definitely an edgier, grittier Spider-Man story. He gets hurt. He bleeds. The script is slick, smart, understated and obviously aimed at a more adult audience. There's good sci-fi villain who is rendered wonderfully by CGI; he makes the Green Goblin seem silly by comparison. And the action sequences were damned good – we get some great, wicked-cool fight choreography that seems true to the character and even reminded me a little of great comic book fight movies like ""Blade"" (1998).<br/><br/>This reboot does suffer a bit from the superfluous and laborious re- telling of Spider-Man's origin story. How many people are unaware that Peter Parker was bitten by a radioactive and/or genetically modified spider? How much more exciting would it be to see Spidey fight, oh, say, Carnage?<br/><br/>All in all, this was a decent movie. To enjoy it, you just sort of have to take it on its own terms instead of comparing it to Raimi's flicks.<br/><br/>http://ericrobertnolan.wordpress.com/"

"iconic-sr","7","0","1","17 September 2014"," A Successful Reboot and Start of a Franchise
","Initial Review: The Sam Raimi ""Spiderman"" trilogy was hugely successful and really set the bar high for other superhero flicks, but a disappointing third installment (made in 2007) ended the franchise. Five years later, Sony released ""The Amazing Spiderman"" the first installment for the rebooted franchise. The reboot, which is the film I'm reviewing, is directed by Marc Webb and features actor, Andrew Garfield, as Peter Parker/Spiderman. I was skeptical after seeing the trailers for the film, but the actual movie changed my opinion.<br/><br/>The Positives: The first improvement Sony made from the original trilogy is the cast. When I first saw photos of Andrew, I thought he would be a terrible choice for the role, but I now believe he is the superior Peter Parker/Spiderman. Andrew's acting ability is incredible; he is very flexible and displays emotion well without coming off as cheesy or giving the feeling that he is overacting. He plays the role of the nerdy Peter Parker well and has the cocky and joking nature of Spiderman down to a science (which was missing from the first trilogy). Every time I watch him play the role in the Amazing Spiderman 1&2, I feel like I am actually in a comic book, which adds to the authenticity of the film. Emma Stone plays the role of high school sweetheart Gwen Stacy, and displays a moving chemistry with Andrew Garfield (and I guess it helps that these two are dating in real life). ""The Amazing"" brought in new angles, like Peter's parents, which added to the storyline and brought something fresh for those who followed the last franchise. One thing that I really enjoyed about this film is the new look and web shooters for Spiderman. I really was not a fan of the organic web shooters of Raimi's trilogy, and watching peter design the web shooters was fun and added credibility to his genius qualities. The new suit was also a fresh look. The slick, spandex suit has visual appeal and the eye pieces, to me, gives Spiderman a darker tone. The comedy was awesome and kept me laughing throughout.<br/><br/>The Negatives: The main problem I had with the movie (which to me is a big problem) is the lack of action. I'm not saying there was no action throughout the movie, but the scenes were short and didn't provide the vibe of Spidey having much power. His attacks didn't seem to cause much damage to the lizard (the villain of the movie). The second issue I had with the movie is the villain himself. Even though he had good back story, I was disappointed with the cgi used for his appearance. He just didn't feel very scary despite his massive size.<br/><br/>The Conclusion: Despite some negative aspects, I gave the movie 7/10 which I deem as a pretty positive review. ""The Amazing Spiderman"" brings new concepts to the table which makes the film entertaining for the general audience. I am confident that this movie will be a good experience for comic book fans and general viewers. I strongly recommend this film.<br/><br/>Also see my review for ""The Amazing Spiderman 2"""
"Tyson14","7","0","1","2 August 2014"," A reboot too soon but still good
","This review may seem a little paradoxical, but basically, here's the gist for me: the first half was messy, the second half was rushed, and it did not significantly add or achieve anything over and above Sam Raimi's original movie to necessarily warrant a full reboot like this. That being said, the whole thing kind of came together in a way that was fun, and decent overall. As a whole, I liked the movie in and of itself, but it left a whole lot to be desired.<br/><br/>First, the overall plot and pacing. The first half, as I've already set, is just a mess. It is a mish-mash of scenes trying to establish the angst and character of Peter Parker while trying to lay some backstory suggesting a conspiracy involving Peter's parents. The problem with the conspiracy backstory is that it was never really fleshed out, and just seemed to be something tossed in to try to add some intrigue to the movie. Considering Dr. Connors' background with Richard Parker, I am surprised there wasn't a whole lot more of Peter trying to learn about his dad from him. I would have expected more bonding between them, or something, so it just didn't feel real to me.<br/><br/>Many of the scenes in that first half of the film are just alternative takes on similar scenes in Sam Raimi's original Spider-Man film. We've got to have the shots of Flash picking on Peter, we've got to have the big argument with Uncle Ben to set up the big guilt trip later, we've got to have the Oscorp lab with the creepy experiments, the cute girl that is interested in Peter even though he's a dork, etc., etc. The scenes that were truly original to this version mostly dealt with a little prologue showing the Parkers, which seemed like it was setting up a payoff later in the film, which, sadly, never materialized.<br/><br/>Then, after limping along for an hour, it was if the filmmakers decided to change gears, and we get about ten minutes of transition time where EVERYTHING seemingly happens all at once: the spiderbite, the costume, the webbing, the murder of you-know-who, the guilt trip, etc. - In particular, the webbing and the costume kind of came out of nowhere. One minute, nothing, the next second, he's full blown Spider-Man, and it felt very rushed.<br/><br/>Then, the second half was a rehash of the trite old plot line - ""Hey, I'll experiment on myself. Hey, I'm a monster now!"" Because the movie limped along for that first hour, the second hour has a lot of ground to cover, in order to establish the Lizard as a baddie, and consequently it felt very rushed. Three separate battles with the Lizard, with only mere minutes of screen time between each one, setting up the next battle, kind of became tedious for me.<br/><br/>The acting was good. All of the cast members did their jobs very well. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, as Peter and Gwen, really clicked on screen. Martin Sheen did a good job as Uncle Ben, but I really wish that relationship would have been developed a little more. As it was, I never really felt any fondness or closeness between Peter and Uncle Ben, as they were always bickering with each other. Raimi did a much better job with that relationship in the first Spider-Man movie.<br/><br/>The action sequences were really cool. Although, by now, all these big budget action sequences are becoming the same. If you don't mind watching two CGI characters have CGI battles, it's fun. The web swinging sequences were effectively rendered too.<br/><br/>So, overall, I would say, fun movie, though it didn't contribute meaningfully enough to the lore to warrant the reboot. We saw all of this just a few years ago when Raimi released the first ""Spider-Man."" And since the trend now seems to be to make three movies and reboot, I'm sure we'll be getting a new origin story in just a few years. After all, look no further than the fact that they're already rebooting Batman again. That's the SECOND reboot in just the past handful of years. It's starting to become a bit tedious, you know."
"utgard14","7","0","1","30 June 2014"," Good Reboot Despite Some Issues
","Reboot of the Spider-Man series without Sam Raimi is surprisingly good, even with its flaws. It's a little more emo than I would prefer my Spider-Man. It also suffers from a sense of familiarity, being an origin story released ten years after the first movie already did that. Of course, they change a lot between that version and this but the gist is the same. I will say that no ""With great power comes great responsibility"" is a huge fail. On the plus side, it has a great cast. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone have a believable, likable chemistry. Garfield's Peter is a bit more of a jerk than I am used to seeing or reading, but I will chalk that up to them trying to make him more ""real."" Realism is the enemy of fantasy but unfortunately, many filmmakers who tackle comic book movies don't get this. The direction is nice, especially considering Mark Webb is new to this kind of movie-making. The effects are so-so but the movie takes place mostly at night, which is a convenient way for them to utilize spotty CGI. Unfortunately, that also lends to the overall dark tone the film has. I don't view Spider-Man as a dark character so the navel-gazing gets old after awhile. Still, if you're a fan of comic book movies and Spider-Man in particular, I doubt you'll regret watching this."

","Isn't it time we retire the whistling teapot from the pantheon of tension building auditory cues?<br/><br/>Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, the original writer and illustrator of the comic series, were brought on to help with the screenplay.<br/><br/>If this isn't the greatest Stan Lee cameo, I don't know what is.<br/><br/>Martin Sheen's a total chameleon in this movie, I had no idea it was him.<br/><br/>Sally Field, who I didn't enjoy as Mary Todd Lincoln, turns in an excellent performance as Aunt May.<br/><br/>Emma Stone's dependably fantastic. And I'm digging the blonde hairdo she's rocking as Gwen Stacy.<br/><br/>Emma's pretty funny. But can't we call her Mary Jane, and steadily rinse Kirstin Dunst from our memory?<br/><br/>I saw The Bachelorette. It was un-good.<br/><br/>Denis Leary's okay. He doesn't have an easy role, but does his best to make it fun.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield turns in a solid performance. I like his quieter, more hipster Peter Parker. The only place he falls short is the witty banter. Perhaps this is a function of the writing, but Spidey's jokester attitude's not up to snuff.<br/><br/>After a stupid scene where Pete gets beat up by Flash Thompson (the worst part of the film although it's probably not Chris Zylka's fault) all of the other high schoolers steadily depart.<br/><br/>One random dude kicks Peter's camera a couple feet across the concrete while he lies beaten on the ground. It's totally uncalled for and he's not Flash's friend. It's just another guy in the crowd.<br/><br/>Nobody would behave like that! It's a hilariously bad cherry atop a melted sundae.<br/><br/>There's a nice little dichotomy to be drawn between Flash and the Lizard.<br/><br/>Speaking of, I've got no complaints about Rhys Ifans as the Lizard. Although I wish he'd worn the purple pants.<br/><br/>The CGI's not perfect but it's generally very good.<br/><br/>Some plot points have been unnecessarily translated from the first movie. For example, Dr. Connors feels torn between two personalities (he's even doing the old mirror trick) and the Lizard consciousness encourages mischief.<br/><br/>It's the reptilian brain after all, so perhaps this is the better context, but the question remains:<br/><br/>Did it have to be the exact same dynamic for the transformation of the super villain?<br/><br/>Again I must applaud the writers for their choice towards the end. There is a small, unexpected moment; a great twist on the classic hero/villain relationship.<br/><br/>If there's one thing in cinema I despise, it's bad ADR, and there are a handful of moments where the auditory puppet strings lose translucence.<br/><br/>Most specifically and egregiously, the conversation between Spidey and the criminal in the car underwent tinkering.<br/><br/>The film's biggest fault is that it's retelling most of the story from the original. For example, the dynamic between Peter and Uncle Ben is the same. When he scolds Peter about revenge, it's all too clear where things are going.<br/><br/>My oh my oh my. The Amazing Spider-Man is much too similar to Spider-Man. <br/><br/>I don't know how to solve this problem, but it certainly points toward a greater truth.<br/><br/>Ultimately, after much research, I've realized Sony Pictures is a villain akin to the Lizard. They both have complex motivations; disallowing my complete condemnation.<br/><br/>Sony bought up the rights to Spider-Man during a time when Marvel needed money and was selling brands to different studios. For example, 20th Century Fox grabbed X-Men. After telling a fantastic origin story in the first film, director Sam Raimi followed up with Spider-Man 2; a movie that is widely regarded as spectacular.<br/><br/>Finally in 2007, Spider-Man 3 is released.<br/><br/>I'll argue with anyone that Spider-Man 3 is a good movie with one horrifically bad scene, and perhaps another shabby one. Part of the reason for a reboot was the increasing animosity between the director and the studio heads. Raimi was pushing for greater creative control in Spider-Man 4, after feeling pressured by the studio to force certain plot points into the third installment.<br/><br/>In my life, there has never been a more highly anticipated movie to be received with such vehement disgust as Spider-Man 3.<br/><br/>Seeing it years later, I was surprisingly pleased with what I was given. The fights alone are excellent. But that one 'emo Peter' scene where he's walking down the sidewalk, shooting the finger guns at the ladies; is nauseating. It's a pandering piece of garbage riddled with cliché.<br/><br/>It's the kind of inexplicable moment that makes you wonder: What kind of self-respecting director would mar his hard work by including such an obvious error in the final cut?<br/><br/>I doubt it was Raimi's choice.<br/><br/>So my point is, I'm suspicious that Sony is to be blamed for that particularly terrible scene. A scene that unfairly stilted public opinion against the third film. One that hurt the fan boys hardest and ruined the integrity of a promising franchise.<br/><br/>Therefore we get to 2012. If Sony doesn't produce another Spider-Man film, the rights to the brand will revert to Marvel. Presumably that means Walt Disney Pictures, who also owns The Avengers brand.<br/><br/>Given the way Sony's handled Spider-Man 3 and The Amazing Spider-Man, I'd have much preferred Disney ended up with the rights.<br/><br/>I can understand Sony's wish to hold onto the Spider-Man brand. But clearly the series was rebooted too quickly if they wanted to include the origin story.<br/><br/>Perhaps the reboot will continue into excellence, and The Amazing Spider-Man (much like Iron Man 2) will fade along with K-Dunst. <br/><br/>It's just sad to see a historically beloved and brilliant narrative quickly rehashed like a throwaway piece of ephemera.<br/><br/>It'd be nice if we got a visually seamless film this time around. Come May 2nd, we'll see how things pan out."

","We first saw Peter Parker, the kid who became the iconic hero of all time, back in 2002 when Tobey Maguire made him famous – but this goes all the way back, not just in yesteryear but during the comic book days. In 1963, The Amazing Spider Man hit the bookstores and comic strips, but now a days, we all need a hero.<br/><br/>Peter Parker, (played by new-comer Andrew Garfield) was a troubled young man from the beginning, his parents leaving him behind with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May (played brilliantly by the greatest actor and actress of our time Martin Sheen and Sally Field). During his adolescence, Peter was faced with bullies and the occasional spider bite. But it was not your usual spider bite, a radioactive spider with mutations beyond our capability.<br/><br/>But when things get a little green, Dr. Curt Conners (played by Rhys Ifans, who brought us Xenophilius Lovegood in Harry Potter 7 Part 1), all he ever wanted was to make the human race understand the importance of being treated like reptiles – lizards to say the least.<br/><br/>What an incredible timing to bring this movie before the independence of our country. What an incredible movie that Mark Webb brought us. I know Sam Raimi would be very proud, but Mark you, my friend out-done Sam in every way.

"csg93","7","0","1","23 June 2014"," Premature Responsibility
","As far as superhero movies go, ""The Amazing Spiderman"", directed by Marc Webb, was pretty predictable in how the actual plot of the movie progressed. The hero has some opening conflict—In this case it is Peter's (Andrew Garfield) search for information about his parents, who disappeared when he was younger—which starts the ball rolling on the rest of the film. When Peter stumbles upon some of his father's research, he manages to figure out whom he used to work with. Peter finds the old partner, gets bit and receives his powers, and solves the problem that the researcher was dealing with at the time. Unfortunately, this leads to the creation of the main villain of the story, Curt Connors/The Lizard (Rhys Ifans), whom Peter now has to deal with. The rest of the typical Spiderman origin unfolds as usual: Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) gets shot, Peter becomes a vigilante and finds a girlfriend, and then Spiderman fights the main villain.<br/><br/>If there is ever a message in a Spiderman movie, it is usually something about responsibility. This is somewhat of a recurring theme throughout the movie: Peter goes after the man who killed his uncle because he feels guilty for letting him get away; he fights the Lizard because he inadvertently created him; and he protects people because he has the ability, and therefore responsibility, to do so. Some responsibilities have to give way to others though, and that is shown when Peter abandons his search in order to stop the beast he has created. It may not have been directly shown, but Peter did have a choice to make, and he chose to fix the larger of his two most recent mistakes to correct. All of these things serve to drive home the idea that people who have power have the responsibility to use it wisely.<br/><br/>The only real issue that I have with the film is that it came out far too early following the end of the previous iteration of the franchise. Five years between the previous run and the reboot is simply too soon. Yes, the series needed to be saved given the awful ""thing"" that was ""Spiderman 3"", but the sudden reboot just felt a little bit jarring. That said, it was my only problem and I think that the rest of the movie actually worked pretty well for the most part. With 5 being ""average"" I'd give the movie a 7, so ""good"" but not ""great."""

","The Amazing Spider-Man is the newest version of the Spider-Man franchise. The movie is good but as the title suggests it is not ""Amazing"". If you have seen Spider-Man starring Tobey Maguire, then you pretty much has seen this movie. You do get a slightly different version though. Peter Parker played by Andrew Garfield gets bitten by a spider and develops spider-like senses. Scientist Dr. Curt Connors played by Rhys Ifans is working with the same spiders to research cross species genetics. Dr. Connors uses a non-human tested serum to try and regenerate his lost arm. He develops the ability to regenerate, but also becomes a giant lizard. There is also the love story between Peter and Gwen Stacy played by Emma Stone. Gwen is Peter's first true love in the Spider-Man comic franchise. Overall the movies is not bad, but actually good. It's obviously been done before and so it is nothing amazing."

","When I heard that they would be doing a new version of Spiderman I was not excited at first. How could you possibly replace Toby Meguire, he is Spiderman - plus I wanted to see him finish the third film with another sequel (since the last one made me feel empty). However after seeing it I'm amazed with what they did.<br/><br/>Do I really need to say what Spiderman is about? It's just Peter Parker being both himself and Spiderman. The actor who plays him: Andrew Garfield (maybe he'll be president ha ha) is terrific. He's cocky, occasionally cautious, and is learning something new every day. Like for example throughout about a good third of the film he has to learn how to get used to his powers, but he's clumsy at it for a while before he gets it down perfectly. In the old film they kinda did that but it was adjusted in 15 minutes of the film rather than a good third of the film. I love all the scenes where he is Spiderman and shoots himself in mid air, flies, swings around, and saves the day.<br/><br/>One other thing I love better than the old is the girlfriend. Face it, Mary Jane is stupid compared to Gwen Stacy, even a person reviewing with the Nostalgia Critic could only say that her hair was pretty - that's it. Gwen Stacy is an active genius and in this film doesn't even need Peter to save her, if anything it almost seemed like he needed her to save him; I almost wondered if she would be the one to save the day rather than Spiderman. The villain doesn't even kidnap her, nor does she exactly run in fear like Mary Jane, instead she fights him off with all she's got and doesn't ever play damsel in distress. I love that! <br/><br/>Both she and Peter kept the story going, and so did the villain. The villain was a tragedy and made me feel sorry for him. He wants to get his arm back but his experiment went wrong and turns him into an evil giant lizard, though like the Green Goblin in the first film he is somewhat of a Jekyll and Hyde character.<br/><br/>Overall the film was great, (too bad it wasn't in 3D) and though it can never replace the old movie, it is a great remake."

","There was a lot of things I liked about this movie and a lot of thing I think they could have a better job on. Let's start with the good stuff. First off I loved the cast. Andrew Garfield and Emma stone had great chemistry together. Garfield gave off almost a tough geek look, he wasn't this dorky looking kid, he had a cool look to him. And let's face it Emma Stone is a fox and always looks good. But she wasn't just eye candy I feel she played her part well and I think her character will come out better in the next movie. I think Spiderman's suit is the most B.A. and coolest between the spider man films. Though what was interesting was that during the fight scenes I was always unsure how it would turn out. Spider man wasn't this all powerful guy, he still has a lot to learn and I liked that about it. The one part that bugs me is that near the end there is a pretty cheesy scene of him going to the rescue that was kind of laughable. And I feel they could have expanded more on the him actually figuring out something more about his parents, but that may come in the next movie. All in all I gave this movie a seven, I did enjoy it a lot more than I thought I would and I would buy it, mainly to finish to keep my super hero movie collection but I would pop it in every now and than."
"zigzagger05","6","0","1","19 May 2014"," By the standards of the previous Spider-Man movies, decent
","This movie was mediocre. Obviously, because the previous Spider-Man movies were, well, a lot below expectations, it's easy to say that this new movie was better. But looking at in a more general view, it's no more than decent.<br/><br/>Same old plot line: Peter Parker (who is considerably less geeky in this movie than in the other series; Peter is supposed to be a nerd, so this kind of puts you off) is bitten by the radioactive spider and starts shooting webs, then Uncle Ben dies, Peter cries, and vows to fight crime. I can't imagine how the directors could have made that any less cheesy than it already sounds, so I won't hold that over their heads.<br/><br/>But one thing I have to call out is Curt Connors/The Lizard's goal. After combining his DNA with that of a lizard and transforming himself into a reptilian beast (with pretty good C.G.I., I'll give the film- makers that), he sets out to conduct ""the next stage of human evolution"" or something like that. So he abruptly decides he wants to convert every single human in New York into the same lizardly state he currently presides in?? Where did THAT come from??<br/><br/>So the guy's a little sore about being a giant green scaly mess. But would that really cause him to decide that the rest of the world needs to become lizard-men too? This rather random goal seemed kind of out of the blue for me.<br/><br/>Also, I would have really liked to see both Gwen Stacy AND Mary Jane Watson in this movie. At least 50% of the drama and complexity of Spidey's story comes from his fluctuating relationships with those two women, so not including both of them, in neither this film nor the previous series, was a disappointment. I would have really enjoyed seeing the directors take on the challenge of showing Spidey/Peter's relationship(s) with these women, because it adds much more reality to the story."
"moviemattb","8","0","1","19 May 2014"," ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is pretty good
","In honor for the the release of ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2,"" I decided to review this before going to see the sequel. So, with that said, here is my review. Five years after ""Spider-Man 3"" came out, which it received mixed reaction by critics and fans alike Sam Raimi and the rest of cast of the original three movies decided to leave the franchise, and have Sony reboot it with a new director and a new set of cast. Marc Webb, director of one of my favorite movies of 2009 500 Days of Summer comes in to direct along with Andrew Garfield taking over the role of Spider-Man and his alter ego Peter Parker. I did go see this movie in theaters, and I really like it. However, I don't love it as much as what others say. You want to know why? Well, I wasn't really that much fond of rebooting series and have Sam Raimi along with the original cast leave the franchise, and not do a fourth Spider-Man movie. I understand that ""Spider-Man 3"" left many comic book fans disappointed, and consider to be the worst of the series. To me, I don't hate ""Spider-Man 3"" as what they said. I can see what were the problems in that movie, but I still have so fun with it and I do wish if there was a ""Spider-Man 4."" Raimi did said that he was unhappy with the results, but does not hated it; he also said that he wanted go back to basics like what the original first two movies were. The unmade fourth movie was going to feature the Lizard or Vulture in this movie, and maybe feature Felicia Hardy as the Black Cat; although they were going to make her as the Vulturess instead which it sounds lame, but they can at least rewrite it and make her the Black Cat as the character should be. But nope, the people at Sony decided to reboot the franchise instead of continuing it. So much of the disagreements between Sony and Raimi had. I still would've love see ""Spider-Man 4"" happening, but nevertheless, I did accepted it as a conclusion for Sam Raimi's trilogy. So that is one of the problems that I had with ""The Amazing Spider-Man."" Also, I thought James Horner's score along with the Spider Man theme isn't as amazing as Danny Elfman's; its not bad though, but its not one of my favorites. Lastly, we don't need to tell Spider-Man's origin story again. I understand why it needed to be told because we never see Peter Parker's parents in the original movies, and trying to make Uncle Ben's killer right because of what happened in ""Spider-Man 3."" It is well told, but it still doesn't need to be told again. The movie itself is almost like watching the original first Spider-Man movie all over again, and it makes you wonder what is the point. If they just take out the origin, then maybe the movie would be a little better. So those are my problems with the movie. Despite some of the flaws that I mention, I did thought that Marc Webb had done a terrific job on directing the movie, while Andrew Garfield does a great job to play both Spider-Man and Peter Parker. No need to compare which Spider-Man is better because I enjoy Garfield's and Tobey Maguire's for each of their own take. Emma Stone I will admit is a much better Gwen Stacey than what Bryce Dallas Howard did in ""Spider-Man 3."" Howard is okay, but I prefer Stone's more. The relationship between Peter and Gwen is quite good, but I rather much prefer Peter and Mary Jane because that is how I remember as a kid growing up when there was the 1994 animated series. Martin Sheen and Sally Field were great as Peter's uncle and aunt, while Rhys Ifans does a fine job as the Lizard. The special effects are pretty darn good. The suit that Spider-Man wore is not bad, but I prefer the old suit in the original movies more. The action scenes were fine, but there is nothing spectacular about it. So that is all I got to say about whats good and bad about it. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is pretty good, and I give it an 8 out of 10. Seriously, I still wish if there was a ""Spider-Man 4."""
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","0","1","14 May 2014"," ""Amazing Spider-Man"" weaves a strong though familiar web
","Back in 2002, Sony Pictures and filmmaker Sam Raimi brought one of Marvel Comics' most popular superheroes, Spider-Man, to big screen for the first time. Peter Parker's story captivated audiences and set the record for the most money made on an opening weekend.<br/><br/>Now, let's imagine none of that ever happened. Let's pretend director Marc Webb and Sony brought movie-goers ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" for the first time ever in 2012. What's the result? A box-office record would be doubtful given the era we live in, but a powerful story that captivates audiences — absolutely. It would've been hailed as just as if not more of an incredible film in 2002.<br/><br/>Well, it's not 2002, and we can't pretend forever. As such, the one major thing that will draw ire toward ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is that it tells a story that came to the big screen 10 short years ago. It's not a conversation that would even happen if this were 2032, but this context is a reality.<br/><br/>For a child who is now a teenager, this could turn out to be a defining film with two stars of a younger generation in Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, but a good chunk of audience members will wait and wait for the film to deliver some revelatory change to the story they already know that never comes.<br/><br/>It's always important to be aware of your own expectations, but if you want to be able to appreciate the multiple strengths of ""The Amazing Spider-Man,"" it's a recommendation that can't be taken lightly. So here it goes: this is Spider-Man's origin story. There are new actors, and some new characters that make it look different, but it's Spider-Man's origin story.<br/><br/>To come clean on biases, I love Spider-Man's origin story. There's nothing more powerful in the comic universe than the way Peter Parker comes of age and into his role as a hero in a traumatic flash, losing someone he loves when he chooses to act thoughtlessly and selfishly. So on one hand, you could say I have a predilection toward this movie because it tells that story; on the other hand, I'm very particular about it. I need to feel it or I'll be disappointed. In this ""Spider-Man,"" you definitely still feel it.<br/><br/>The presentation of the movie is different than the 2002 film, but its core and messages are the same. Uncle Ben doesn't say ""with great power comes great responsibility,"" but he basically paraphrases it. Call that repetitive if you will, but it's absolutely crucial to Spider-Man. It would be dishonorable toward the comics to handle it any other way, not to mention give little reason for you to care about Garfield's version of Peter Parker.<br/><br/>Different from the original film, Peter is severely affected by a complete lack of resolution regarding his parents. He loves his Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen, who is superb) and Aunt May (Sally Field), but his parents' disappearance haunts him, so the discovery of an Oscorp file belonging to his father and a lead in the form of man who was his father's old research partner, Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans), sends Peter's curiosity into overdrive. Doing so lands him on the path to getting bit by the radioactive spider and becoming Spider-Man.<br/><br/>Peter goes from extraordinary teen to masked crime-fighter for selfish reasons after the death of Uncle Ben. Whereas Peter believes he gets his revenge in the 2002 film (we learn he didn't in ""Spider-Man 3″), failing to find his uncle's killer adds more painful irresolution to his life. It's a void he eventually realizes he can fill with heroism, and considering he gives Dr. Connors the formula that will later turn him into the The Lizard, stopping him is a chance to finally correct one of his mistakes.<br/><br/>Peter also finds a confidant in Gwen Stacy (Stone), daughter of the police chief (Denis Leary) and the man who wants Spider-Man to answer to the law. Gwen actually learns of his identity, and the two even work together to stop Connors, another refreshing change from the damsel in distress motif that permeated all of Raimi's films. Yet Peter and Gwen's relationship still has that tragic quality true to the comics.<br/><br/>From the romance to the science to the action, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" has a decidedly more realistic feel than the Raimi films (and little of their campy humor), a fact likely to go under-appreciated given that we live in a post-The Dark Knight world. To be fair to that first trilogy, however, it did ground itself in real themes and emotions, but so does this movie. The second and third Spider-Man movies share a screenwriter with this reboot in Alvin Sargent, and the way the story is constructed feels extremely similar to those previous adventures.<br/><br/>Even with all the quality writing full of strong themes and proper character motivation, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" gets long in the tooth, especially as you wait for the origins to be fully rehashed with Peter getting his powers, playing around with his powers, etc. The third act, however, turns out to be an exhilarating finish and then some. The action (both in choreography and CGI in all acts of the movie) knocks the original trilogy off a skyscraper. And when it seems like the emotional flourish won't come, the script finds some fitting and effective moments of catharsis for all the characters.<br/><br/>Yes, it's frustrating seeing something similar unfold that's fresh in our minds, but for a new Spider-Man franchise to emerge in the dust of the old one, these origin essentials needed to be covered, and they're covered exceptionally well. We have a whole new cast of lovable characters now, and Sony and Webb have earned their license (and our trust) to take the trilogy where they want it to go, which looks to be deeper into the mystery of the Richard and Mary Parker."

","Easily, one of the best super hero movies of all time, well, there have been only few of them. And of course, there has to be the obvious comparison with the earlier series of spider-man. I think most of the people will agree with me that earlier series of spider-man was better than this one. Peter Parker looked like Peter Parker in the earlier film, whereas in this one Peter Parker is shown as ultra smart, cool dude of the college. Well if you ready to overlook this fact, then you are in for a treat. The graphics of this movie is awesome. It will make your jaws drop. When the spidy releases its web, you get the feel with the force he releases it. This movie also shows how the senses of the spidy gets enhanced after he becomes the spider-man. And then clearly his lady love Emma stone looks way way way more beautiful and sexy then the Kirsten Dunst.<br/><br/>Well overall the story is good, and as you guessed, the hero defeats the villain and saves the city from his evil plans. Well, that's more or less the gist of the story. Could it had been better? Yes, but was it good, Yes definitely. Should I watch this movie? Of course. I think this pretty much answers all your question."

","Five years after the successful, but bad Spider-Man 3 was released, the studio felt a reboot was in order. Frankly you cannot blame the studio for that, as Spider-Man 3 was indeed a bad to average film. However the franchise was just ten years old when this reboot hit the theaters in 2012. Which presents a lot of problems for this film.<br/><br/>The story for the film, written by James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent, and Steve Kloves is barely better than average. The film holds onto this need of a long and drawn out back story for Peter Parker. However the back story we were told in the Sam Raimi Spider-Man films, about ten years ago at the release of this film, told us that story, and quite well. Doing that leads to a water down film overall. While the development of the characters was very good, taking an hour or so of a film that is barely over two hours to tell the entire story over again is just bad thinking. The villain in the film, Dr. Curt Connors also known as The Lizard is actually very fun, however giving him a deep back story would have made him much better. I also enjoyed how they didn't go right for the major villains right out of the gate. Sure they give hints here and there at other major villains, but that is all.<br/><br/>Directed by Marc Webb, he leads a wonderfully shot film. There are a few very fun flying scenes, shot in first and third person involving Spider-Man. These scenes look beautiful using CG. I also give him credit for using conventional filming as well. He doesn't overdo the CG like some superhero films do these days. The acting overall is amazing. From top to bottom this film delivers on its acting. Although I did feel at times Peter Park, played by Andrew Garfield, slipped out of his role. Although it doesn't really hurt the film. The battle scenes with Spider-Man and The Lizard are amazing as well. While the first battle is more over the top with the action, the final battle while still fun it did fall too short and rushed even.<br/><br/>Composing the score for this film was James Horner. Superhero films usually have this heavy handed loud coming at you score. The score for this film was very light for most of the film. At times the score is amazing, for example near the end of the film, but for the rest of the film it just falls flat.<br/><br/>Overall for the start of a new series, this film was just barely over average. In my opinion telling the entire back story in depth, and taking up a large portion of the run time was just a big mistake. I am still holding out hope for the sequel, which will be released just two days after this review is posted, but as for this film I will leave it at a barely about average. If you haven't seen the film already and you enjoy superhero films, then giving this a watch wouldn't be a bad idea. Or if you want to get caught up in time for the sequel.<br/><br/>5.5/10"
"Chuckles_OToole_PBnJ","9","0","2","23 April 2014"," I think I see the problem here.
","I'm a big fan of the Sam Raimi/Tobey Maguire ""Spiderman"" films. They were fun, light-hearted, silly, thrilling, special effects bonanzas. They were everything you'd expect from a movie based on a character from a 1960's comic book. They didn't take themselves too seriously. Even when people died, it was cartoonish enough that it didn't sting too deeply or for too long.<br/><br/>Now, enter the Webb/Garfield ""Amazing Spiderman"" film and, Wow. Holy crap. This is dark, man- *dark*. It's not at all what I was expecting from a superhero movie. This really isn't a comic book at all, is it? It's a horror movie that happens to have a superhero in it, not a superhero movie. I mean hey, I love this film and I think it's great, but wow is it disturbing. This is what you would get if you let Stuart Gordon (""Re-Animator,"" ""From Beyond"") direct a superhero film. I'm not familiar with Marc Webb's work- and his resumé seems remarkably thin- but I would be surprised if Stuart Gordon, Clive Barker and Wes Craven weren't deep influences of his.<br/><br/>It took me a long time to warm up to the idea of this film, and an even longer time to get around to actually seeing it, because I'm such a huge fan of the three previous Raimi films. I'm glad I watched it, it's very good... but it has little or nothing to do with ""Spiderman"" as I know it.<br/><br/>9/10 stars because it really is a great film, but -1 because seriously, Wow: *dark*."

","This review may contain spoilers.<br/><br/>A great franchise did it really require a reboot???<br/><br/>frankly I did love the dark tone of the film really justifying and very logical the way it goes unlike the previous Spiderman trilogy. its interesting the way plots where,lined and Andrew garfield gets bit by a radioactive spider at oscorp the movie was so logic unlike it was't so stupid as the previous spider man.<br/><br/>Andrew garfield he really justifies the role of Spiderman young and energetic and gwen stacy very pretty serving as spideys love interest, I really loved the dark tone and the plot. And truly a very logical interesting story.<br/><br/>BUT now wait where is the amazing Spiderman, where is that amazing factor why is the film so dark why doesn't Spiderman appear in day light , what happened to his spidey suit he looks more like a man in a robber mask then a spidey suit... The suit was completely dark it was so clear till end that you do see a Spiderman..<br/><br/>the villain was good corners as lizard... But still I do agree the,first spider man was not,logical neither darker but seriously it had that amazing factor it kept u entertained for next 2 hours, the wow moments when the building catches those stunts still stand in your mind, such sequences aren't in the amazing Spiderman the wow factor is missing.<br/><br/>I agree I love the story but the screenplay did lag and it was't well executed. Other than that I felt the casting was the best every one justified to,there roles Andrew garfield simply is the friendly neighbour good.<br/><br/>so before we wrap, I did like the film but I didn love it did drag, The amazing Spiderman at all, it did miss the wow factor which Spiderman carries.. Kudos to a darker and a realistic story line but a bit weakly executed screenplay hopefully we can expect something amazing from the sequel, I personally feel a reboot was't required yet.."
"jb_campo","7","0","1","13 April 2014"," Worthy reboot of spider-man series
","I liked this reboot of the spider-man series, despite some minor flaws. The new Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) did an excellent job in portraying a 17-year old filled with angst over age, death, love, and responsibility. His performance is even more amazing when you realize he is over 30 years old. Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) came off at the start as a bit smug and looked too old to portray a high schooler, but by the end, I thought she did a decent job.<br/><br/>There are minor plot twists, but if you have a pulse, you know that Parker gets bitten by a spider with special powers, and he inherits those spider powers. That part came a bit fast in this movie, where next thing you know, Parker is spinning webs and flying all over the place.<br/><br/>Martin Sheen turned in a fine performance as gentle uncle Ben, as did Sally Fields as Aunt May, though they could have tried to make her look a bit older. I remember her as a gray-haired granny type. <br/><br/>I found the plot was a bit long in some scenes, and the movie probably could have been cut down 15 minutes to be around 2 hours. However, the action kept things moving, with enough fight scenes and the obligatory destruction whenever super heroes fight the bad guys. The CGI was terrific by the way, which goes without saying again in a modern super hero movie.<br/><br/>Lastly, the Lizard character was well played by Rhys Ifans. I've never heard of him before but he was quite believable as a man on the edge, and then pushed over it by his regenerative serum. All told, fine acting, interesting enough story, and terrific cinematography make this a film worth your time. Hence, my score 7/10."

","When I heard the news that the fourth Raimi movie would be canceled in favor of a reboot, I admit that I was disappointed - my spider-sense was tingling so to say. After a while, I've come to accept it and I started to believe that a fresh start could be awesome - after all there are many different Spidey story-lines they could pick from, so I was curious which they would choose and how it would differentiate from Raimis vision.<br/><br/>Marc Webb seemed to me as somewhat of an interesting if a bit of an odd choice. I've seen his ""(500) Days of Summer"" movie and though of it as an alright, lighthearted, boy-meets-girl flick, but nothing special. Once I saw ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" however, I kinda wished we could go back to the fourth Raimi movie.<br/><br/>The main problem being that the movies story itself is too similar to the first Spider-Man, that it seems almost entirely unnecessary. The changes don't have much of an impact to differentiate it enough and it seems like their entire point is for the sake of the upcoming sequels rather than this one, which makes the movie feel bland, as if it is holding back with ideas in order to have more material for it's sequels and spin-offs (and I'm pretty sure there's a lot more planned than they've already announced).<br/><br/>Another thing that was bothering me was the directing. The more down-to-earth and personal moments are clashing with the action and comical elements. They felt as if they were from a completely different movie, something like ""(500) days of summer"" or any movie that is more grounded in reality. Normally I don't have an issue with comicbook-heroes dealing with real-life stuff, to the contrary, but here they felt quite misplaced, off, and, for a lack of a better word, quite awkward. The movie doesn't have a natural flow. Everything feels so constructed, almost cold or soulless. In Raimis movies, you could literally feel his passion for the material and the fun he had making these movies. They had a spot-on mix of self-awareness, goofiness and seriousness and that gave them such a recognizable charm. In TASM however, this is absent. The human side of the main-character didn't suck me in. The movie has more of a serious and realistic tone to it, which could've been fun too, but it's just not pulled off that well.<br/><br/>As far as the action goes... it's pretty much what you'd expect it to be. Nothing special or memorable, but alright. From the CGI I kinda expected more, especially to be less obvious in some scenes where Spidey is the only thing animated. The cast and acting was good and consistent, even though I still think Emma Stone is a bit of a miscast. Her look just doesn't quite fit the character in my mind - but it's just a minor nitpick from my side.<br/><br/>As a long time Spider-Man fan I expected a lot more from this one. For a fresh start a good chunk of the story felt too familiar, almost like a deja vu, which should've been avoided. It's not a bad movie by any means, but it strikes me just as plain mediocre, even more so compared to the Raimi trilogy. It just doesn't stick."
"stuartdonovan24","6","0","1","26 March 2014"," Another reboot? Really?
","For me Spiderman was getting a reboot way ahead of needing one. Having watched this I stand by that opinion. Having said that this was probably better than the three Tobey Maguire outings despite them having Sam Raimi at the helm. The reason for this is basically Maguire is not involved. Garfield brings a more likable element to Peter Parker, more quirky & eccentric than Maguire's wimpoid. But when he dons the mask, for me, he becomes far more cocky than needs be. The story really does not offer anything from what has gone before. Bitten by a genetically modified spider. Parker develops amazing powers and after the death of his Uncle Ben(Sheen) at the hands of an armed robber and he takes on the vigilante status. The one difference that Parker's parents had disappeared & then been murdered for reasons not then known. Rhys Ifans lends a good blend of anger & scientific madness to Dr Connors who mutates into our foe for the day The Lizard. Denis Leary also makes a reassuringly familiar appearance as Police Captain Stacy who is also the Father of Parker's love interest Gwen(Stone). Parker's would be photographer only briefly simmers and consequently the Bugle element of previous Spiderman incarnations barely has a significant role. Effectswise you get nothing less than you would expect. Not having seen this in 3D I can't comment on but I couldn't care less about 3D. the film itself always comes first. This nowhere near has the depth of the Dark knight series but will probably follow the same trilogy pattern but I doubt it will create the same anticipation of Nolan's movies. Still it's a decent blockbuster two hours."

","Having seen all 3 of the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man films and only really being impressed with the second one, mainly because of Maguire himself who I thought was very weak in the character, I bŷpassed this when it came out at the cinema and really only rented it due to it being in 3d and me wanting to test drive my new 3d TV.. The story is familiar to those who saw the original back in 2002 but stops short if being a direct retread which would, naturally, have been pretty pointless. I liked the ""villain"" character in this one, although I did miss one of my favourite characters from the originals, that of J Jonah Jameson who doesn't appear or is even mentioned in the film. I guess he was just too strong a character to rework.... I also enjoyed seeing Sally Field in the role of Aunt May, and I think this bodes well for the upcoming sequel(s), although a lot will ride on which villains are chosen and how they are used..."
"Theraxorterminate","2","0","1","18 February 2014"," I hope the sequel will fix this version of Spider-Man.
","Well, it seems that this version of Spider-Man was a big disappointment to me. I really wanted to appreciate it, but it turned out to be an unfocused superhero movie and I really don't understand how they could not make it look politely if you know what I mean. But what I can see is that the directors and the producers really tried to not copy the direction of how Sam Raimi did with his trilogy. But to be honest it didn't look so good and there are many flaws in this movie that makes Spider-Man look (don't be mad) awkward.<br/><br/>When I saw the trailers before the movie itself I was really looking forward to see the new direction of this Spider-Man, but even though I was disappointed that there wasn't going to be another fourth movie by Raimi. And after watching it I couldn't imagine how underwhelming the experience was. I mean the characters felt quite dull even Peter Parker himself. The presentation was very dull and even the tone of it. It actually didn't really felt like a true superhero movie at all, the movie was going too slowly and by not making it boring this Spider-Man were doing a few awkward jokes I didn't like.<br/><br/>And also it was a shame that this Spider-Man could not come up with a better strategy, I mean at the near end there were some potential that could have saved especially (SPOILERS) Gwen's father! It's a big shame because Peter Parker is supposed to be smart and strategic and suddenly he loses his strategy at the near end.<br/><br/>Although the acting isn't bad but too bad that they could not make the movie evolve and that also they forgot one of the most important lines from the world of Spider-Man. ""With great power, comes great responsibility"" they didn't used it and they didn't even used it in the end of the movie either.<br/><br/>Poor shame, I seriously hope the sequel that comes this year can overcome the flaws of this version. If not then maybe we should just stick to the Raimi trilogy. Not one of the worst movie's I've seen, but disappointing? Indeed."

","I was reluctant to see this reboot of Spiderman because I felt it was too early for that, Sam Raimi made his Spiderman movies 2002-2007. I thought of it as a reboot of a reboot and to be honest I didn't like Raimis movies that much. Only thing I liked there was James Francos Harry Osborn in part 2. This time we have a new Spiderman and I must say this time he is more similar to the Spidey from the comics, I always liked his funny one-liners. As for the casting for Peter Parker I'm not sure if Andrew Garfield was best choice but I don't who could have been better, I can only say that something is missing. As for the villain, he is pretty underwhelming, but that it is understandable because his main opponents from the villain-pantheon have been already been used in the last iterations of the movies. Dr.Connors lizard is too similar to the Abomination from The Hulk reboot with Edward Norton and the fight between him and Spiderman is nothing spectacular, brute force against agility, been there-done that. There are also some illogical things in the movie, for example Gwen Stacy (super-hot Emma Stone) is at the same time in the high-school and in ultra-modern high technology company Oscorp. And people say that American education system is bad. And we also have stupid scene when Peter visits Oscorp for the first time. When Dr.Connors asks the students what is the nature of his research, they don't have a clue, only Peter knows the answer and he read it in the internet!!! I thought that those students love science and know at least something, but alas they have no idea. It is directors way to present Peter as more intelligent. All in all, entertaining but forgettable movie, no more than that."

"joben-525-633946","5","0","2","6 July 2013"," Marc gets tangled in his own Webb. Little improvement on Sam Raimi's average end to his trilogy.
","In his first installment into his version of the popular web slinging superhero's legacy, Marc Webb certainly doesn't fall flat on his mush, though equally he doesn't really pull up any trees or set a high bench- marker for his more intriguing sequel.<br/><br/>While the plot covers little new ground and the only main difference appears to be the change in roles - Garfield for Maguire, Stone for Watson etc. - my main criticism revolves around a dull villain (Lizard) made up completely of unconvincing CGI. This is a real shame actually as Rhys Ifans is rather impressive starring as his alias Dr. Connors.<br/><br/>Acting from the other leading roles is respectable with Garfield proving he is every inch the Peter Parker that Toby Maguire once was. <br/><br/>However, with a dull villain and a now clichéd story, its hard to really care or get too far encapsulated into anything which Webb is actually tossing at you. <br/><br/>Still, I can think of hundreds of ways inferior to watching 'The Amazing Spiderman' to kill off two hours plus."
"poe426","1","0","15","15 June 2013"," Not so amazing...
","It IS amazing that every filmmaker who comes down the pike feels the need to reinvent the wheel when it comes to the origin story of the superhero whose franchise they've just taken over; that's known as needlessly spinning one's wheels. What's even more surprising is when the origin has been done so often that viewers know it by rote, but the latest director to take up the reins fouls it all up. That's what happens here: it's almost as if English weren't even their SECOND language. I mean, how hard can it be to rechew one's cud (which is pretty much all these remakes are, anyway)? There are some neat fx shots, but little else (and WHERE did they get this kid, anyway- was he somebody's nephew or something? What were his credentials?). THE NOT-SO-AMAZING SPIDER-MAN has to be one of the weakest Big Budget superhero movies to come down the pike since The Big Boom began. You'd think that the money men could make better choices."

","The amazing spider man was a interesting film and I just loved it before it came out I was just dying to see it and on that day when I saw it I thought was just amazed with the film because they finally got rid of Tobey Maguire and I thought Andrew Garfield was the perfect actor for spider man.

The plot of the film made sense and I also liked the costume for spider man I thought it was great the 1 problem with the costume is the eyes for the costume because they were black and when they were suppose to be white like in the comics I just hope they change it in the next film coming out in 2014. Also if you look at this link below it will give you a bit of information for the next film http://www.youtube.com/watch? v=YQ2FCqdlvBM.

"ChristianUnchained","6","0","1","23 April 2013"," Very Disappointing, yet shines through here and there
","The Amazing Spider Man? I would call it The ""Almost amazing but not quite there"" Spider Man. On one hand, you have excellent performances from Andrew Garfield (The Social Network) and Rhys Ifans, incredible action scenes coupled with some surprisingly gorgeous special effects and awesome choreogrpahy, and a funny script. On the other hand, you have a villain that could have been so much more intense and frightening, an unused pallet of comic book lore, a really ultra bad screenplay (for the first 2/3 of the film), and an overall feeling of ""this could've have been so much more grand, big, epic, and exciting"". <br/><br/>And that's just it. One phrase that a director never wants to hear: that could've been much more exciting. While the finale is undeniably cool and cinematic, that's when the movie actually starts getting good. All of the rising action happens in the latter part of the film, in an explosive fight in a high school none the less, but you don't really feel any intense emotion for any of the characters or conflicts happening on screen, nor does the villain have any tangible conflict with Spider Man. (this might get cleared up in the sequel, but for a 136 minute flick this is lame). And can't you find a better way to kill off Martin Sheen? <br/><br/>But enough bashing, The Amazing Spider man does plenty of things well. Special effects are spectacular and the stylization and colors screams ""comic book"". Andrew plays a sharp, like- able, and witty Peter Parker/Spider Man, Rhys Ifans plays an intense villain, Emma Stone is OK, and the rest of the character roster is either cliché or stupid, but mainly because of the bad screenplay. The design of The Lizard is incredibly cool and savage, and Spidey's new suit is neat. <br/><br/>If there is a takeaway from TASM, the new series reboot is in shaky hands. This origins story has an apparent identity crisis, where most of it wants to be a funny romantic comedy with some cool action thrown in. This is obviously not a good direction for Spider Man, as the last Spider Man (Spider Man 3) movie fell apart due to the love interest becoming too much of a focus. <br/><br/>Webb seriously needs to head back to the drawing board in terms of character development and story, villainy and tension. He has all of the source material, actors, lore, and style just sitting there, and it just needs the right direction. It's an origins story that never really fully takes off, so here's hoping that the sequel is truly amazing."
"jodenband21","6","0","1","7 January 2013"," Indeed amazing with a large dose of CGI and long runtime.
","It is very understandable why Sony Pictures got the idea of adding the word amazing for the next Spidey film. Probably because Sam Raimi, the director of the previous films gave up for a fourth film. Now in the helm of (500) Days of Summer director Marc Webb, the new Spider-Man gets its new magic touch. <br/><br/>Webb was also given an opportunity to direct Spider-Man (2001) before. And it's quite a welcoming for having this opportunity the second time around. His version of the Spidey reboot is embedded with sharp characterization, spoonful of backstory, and fresh performance from young and aged actors.<br/><br/>As a teenager, Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is a science student in high school where he's bullied by Flash (Chris Zylka), and later on befriends with the beautiful Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). It's obvious that the squeeze of Peter is going to be Gwen, considering that it was Mary Jane to be first on the film's predecessor.<br/><br/>Peter lives a struggled life after his parents Richard (Campbell Scott) and Mary (Embeth Davidtz) left. Now in the hands of his Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field), his ambiguity about his parents' disappearance remains unanswered. But soon, Peter is eager to investigate further about his parents' absence, and later finds out that his father is a colleague of Dr. Curt Connors. Moreover, he discovers a scientific formula that Connors and his father have worked on.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Dr. Connors (Rhys Ifans) of the OsCorp lab is working on a serum to regenerate limbs, particularly his right arm. Peter finds out that he's still working on the formula for his sake, and Connors gives Peter an opportunity to work together to develop the cure. But it turns out to be a tragedy when Peter realizes that he's collided with Connors' dire obsession and leads him to his great responsibility.<br/><br/>Dr. Connors is in actual fact The Lizard, the new villain of the film. It's quite easy to guess how he becomes Spider-Man's enemy. It's a clash of prey and predator sort of exploit. I like the fact that in reality, the spider and the lizard make good enemies on the wall or roof. It's whimsical at that point, but the CGI is bloated with it and it deceives the eye. I can't blame the film for not using too much special effects. Unlike Christopher Nolan's hatred for using VFX in his Batman films, I wish they were stimulated to make the reboot no simpler like what he did to impress me.<br/><br/>However, I like how the narrative where structured carefully to provide many details of Peter's background. It's very patient, but less stirring nevertheless, giving a painful 134 runtime. I hope they made some good exposition in the first act. In the second act, it gives a slow-burn feel, making you laugh more than thrilled. The script wasn't that bad. With three scribes James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent, and Steve Kloves (Harry Potter screenwriter), they combine an elaborative story and hilarious quips to maintain the film alive and welcoming. But the problem is, I have seen this before. There are more obvious points than original.<br/><br/>The casting is quite a surprising treat, with Andrew Garfield on board, which made a good performance in The Social Network. I admired Emma Stone more than I like her, maybe Amanda Seyfried could've been a good Gwen Stacy, but I accepted her. Martin Sheen maintains a strong character of Uncle Ben, probably better than Cliff Robertson. The same goes to Sally Fields as Aunt May as well. Lastly, the role of Denis Leary as Captain Stacy is a serious persona for Peter in maintaining a balanced relationship in character. <br/><br/>As a whole, for passing what superhero films should have, The Amazing Spider-Man is actually fine. With a well-picked cast and a stunning remake, the film is worth the shot if you're up for a new Spidey universe. But then again, the hype is becoming like Sam Raimi's."

School campus fighting scene: Young Peter is standing up for another boy, who is being mobbed by the school jock. For whatever reason, solely calling the jock ""Eugene"" costs Peter a couple of juicy punches and a kick on the ground while everyone else watches. OK, seriously, since when do ""science high schools"" even have jocks, and how come a fight on the school grounds goes entirely unnoticed by the staff?!<br/><br/>2.

The evil doc only goes into Lizard mode by injecting himself with the vaccine on regular basis. Yet, he is determined to ""share"" the gift with the broad public. So, just to get this straight: is he planning to climb that building pole and disperse the green stuff every other day or so? Because otherwise, I kinda don't see the sense.<br/><br/>...and few words on the cast choice:<br/><br/>1. Poor Andrew Garfield, however convincing in other movies (such as ""Never let me go""), has this slightly handicapped air about him, and for most of the movie looks as if he is about to cry.<br/><br/>2. Emma Stone, on the other hand, is this sexy/cool, mini-skirt, long-stockings lab gal, with access to the lab's most valuable and dangerous biotechnology. And doesn't consider neither:<br/><br/>->finding out your boyfriend has mutated into a half-spider with super powers, nor<br/><br/>->first-time spider-flying through the city a couple hundred meters high while hanging on a string<br/><br/>...even a bit worthy of an adequate reaction.

At first the movie was pretty boring but it picked up about 40 minutes in, to the point where I didn't notice the time going by. The origins of Spider-man are told again, only in a different way. This film felt like it had more emotion in it than the first Spider-man. Martin Sheen was good as uncle Ben, Curt Conners was nothing new. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone did a better job than Tobey and Kirsten in the previous entries. I still prefer Tobey Maguire as Spider-man though<br/><br/>Over all this film was good popcorn entertainment, but nothing too special. It's not the best Spider-man movie but it is a good start for the next series of films."

","I went into this movie with very low expectations, I mean who reboots after a 5 year gap... But I went away from the movie thinking wow that was almost awesome. The first part of the movie (with the exception of the basketball and lab visit seen) was actually good, or at least way better than the original. This time I actually cared when Ben Parker died. But then the movie started going down hill, the action was terrible and Spider-man felt like a wimp, I mean he is a superhero with superhuman strength yet he needs his girlfriend and his girlfriend's father to bail him out. In addition he can't seem to land one hit on the lizard. Not too mention how unfulfilling the ending was. The lizard was even worse. It looked terrible and its whole evil scheme was so stupid. That being said for once I felt like Spider-man acted like Spider-man, he was way funnier than Rami's, and generally I felt like the cast was more convincing. I left this moving feeling hopeful. This movie had a level of depth that Rami's did not, if they can work with that, and make a decent villain the next one could be better than Spider-man 2. Good: Some better acting first half real emotions (no Toby crying!!!) Bad: Garfield looks like an anorexic model and fights like one too Flash (no fight) Lizard (he felt just shoved in there)"

","There are two ways to write this review. 1.Comparing this to Sam Raimi's adaptions. 2.Not Comparing this to Sam Raimi's adaptions. I know that #1 is more fun and critical but i'll go with #2.<br/><br/>I am big fan of Spider-Man movies since my childhood. After watching the trailer and the tagline ""The Untold Story"",i became so excited for this adaption. I thought this would be different story and more fun so i was looking forward to it. After Watching the movie i was disappointed. The story is almost identical to Spider-Man (2002){Optional} What disappoints more that story is that it is rushed so much,cannot call this a fast-paced but a rushed movie. They got casting wrong,Andrew Garfield doesn't look like nerd and Peter Parker but he did a good job. Emma Stone 's character is not of great importance but she looks beautiful like a doll. Most of scenes like When Ben Parker Dies,Peter make Spidey suit etc are corny. Martin Sheen is funny and charming as Uncle Ben. acting is not that good as i expected. Main villain's appearances and evolution to Lizard is also cheesy. Action sequences are just OK except few where Spider -Man uses his Web. There was good comedy in this movie also the web machine and suit are strong points.The other likable thing is they followed the comic book. If i would've gone with #1 then i would've given it 30-40% In Nutshell,this is not the thing i expected but its good for time-pass . Just a one time watch"

","I really liked the old spiderman movies so I guess I starting to watch this one being a little bit skeptical because there were new actors etc. But as it went on I started enjoying it and the characters started to grow. I did like a lot of the new scenes, but what I really didn't like was that some scenes from the old ones were gone, some key scenes in my opinion. Overall this movie just seemed a lot more non violent and more child-friendly. I think it's worth watching but I honestly thought Spiderman 1 was way better. I think the actors did great however. But I grew up with the old movies and I really liked them, I just don't see why they didn't just make a spiderman 4 rather than remaking something that was already great. That would have been way more interesting."
"tombiddy87","7","0","2","1 December 2012"," Released too soon after Sam Raimi's trilogy
","This film is not a ultimate success but it also is not a fail either. That being said it has to be looked at from many angles to get a full understanding of why it failed to match the box office success of Raimi's trilogy.<br/><br/>Background Story- When you start any movie franchise off the most important thing is getting a solid background story for the character. The main focus is the mystery of what happened to Peter's parents. We saw flashbacks through out the movie of Peter's memories of his parents. The problem is we get too engrossed in these flashbacks which results in a slow pace when the main focus should be about how Peter becomes Spiderman and it feels too often like his alter ego (Spiderman) is a side story rather then the main focus point.<br/><br/>Characteristics- Now in Raimi's adaption Peter Parker was one of the least popular kids in the school and a bit accident prone, which is the perfect character because once he is Spiderman it shows how far he has come. However in this adaption Peter is a bit cocky and not nerdy at all. It's almost like he is too polished.<br/><br/>Villain- Now this is one of the most important aspects of a super hero movie. If you don't get your villain right not much else will go right. Now Raimi got it spot on. He brought in Spiderman's arch enemy the Green Goblin. A great start to the trilogy and makes the audience want to come back for more which is good for when the sequel comes out. There are the villain in Amazing Spider-Man. The main reason is he is a giant lizard. How more accurately it is the transformation of a scientist who is played by Rhys Ifans who's experiment went wrong so I'm afraid it's another point to Raimi's trilogy. <br/><br/>Love interest- This however is one angle where Amazing Spiderman gets it right. Gwen Stacey(Emma Stone) it a much better match for Peter. They both have a fascination for science and are more alike. The other love interest that we are comparing it to is of course Mary Jane who features in Raimi's trilogy. It is obvious in the story that Peter sees Mary Jane and thinks she is out of his league. <br/><br/>So although I credit director Marc Webb for taking the reigns of a reboot so soon after the previous set of films and taking into account the success it brought in the box office, it just didn't feel like it ever got going. Although there is room for improvement Webb has the ability to level out the bumps in a other wise decent start to the reboot."
"trannellennart","5","0","1","29 November 2012"," Spider-man 2.0
","Back in 2002, Columbia pictures took on the story of Spider-man. While the superhero hype wasn't set back then, the movie still got a lot of credit and got called the best superhero film so far. Now, Columbia pictures tries to live up the hype with ""The amazing spider-man.""<br/><br/>First off, it is clear that the new Spider-man took a lot of ideas from the old one. The famous quote from uncle Ben is, though changed, still in it. Uncle Ben still has the same attitude towards Peter humiliating someone, etc. I know it is the same comic book but I think they could have done that more original. <br/><br/>Another thing i don't like is that the new Spider-man is actually pretty childish. Andrew Garfield is trying to be very funny with his one-liners and it is OK to show that he doesn't control his abilities once but not over and over again. <br/><br/>The story of the villain is not really moving or exciting and the whole concept of someone who tries his own medicine/drug on himself, than turns into a villain is very unoriginal and cheesy.<br/><br/>The death of uncle Ben was very touching in the original but in ""The amazing Spider-man"" it is only given a few minutes and forgotten for the rest of the movie. His death involves around the origin of Spider- man. Why he turned on the suit. But with a death like this we get very little sight in that.<br/><br/>Another thing is the overload of Sci-Fi. Don't get me wrong, I love Sci-Fi but I felt is was misplaced in this movie. Lights, touchscreens and high-tech needles appear everywhere.<br/><br/>Overall, I think this movie is aimed for the younger public and they will love it. But don't get your hopes to high."

"vannak-suon","6","0","3","24 November 2012"," Not so amazing for me
","The Amazing Spider is not so amazing at all. Whatever people might have said, I still think Andew Garfield is neither fitting as Spiderman no Peter Parker. The acting and action were also so much better in the first 3 installment of Spiderman. For me, this installment just kinda screw the reputation up for the last 3. Then again, I still have friends who said this is awesome Though I don't see from which perspective this is awesome but at least it proves that they still have audience who love it. Also it's rated quite highly in IMDb as well. So I think I just probably grew up on Spiderman. Probably if I go back and watch the previous Spiderman movies I probably wouldn't be enjoying it as much as I remembered. Anyhow, watch this at your own risk."
"Mr-Fusion","6","0","2","18 November 2012"," A misstep in tone; oddly downbeat
","Admittedly, I wasn't looking forward to seeing this movie. The blockbuster success of Raimi's original ""Spider-Man"" was celebrated just ten years ago. And there's an argument to be made that one should keep an open mind to new things, but there are also plenty of superhero properties that deserve big-screen treatment. But here we are reanimating the same characters for huge Summer movie business.<br/><br/>I'm impressed (for the most part) by the casting. Andrew Garfield makes an excellent Peter Parker/Spidey (especially given the angsty subject matter); he's got the mannerisms and the lanky physique. And Emma Stone makes the perfect Gwen Stacy. She was spot-on (especially in those thigh-high socks!). Rhys Ifans goes a long way in making the Lizard interesting (a character that's never blown my skirt up), while Martin Sheen is a terrific improvement over Cliff Robertson as Uncle Ben. <br/><br/>And for even the most casual Spider-Man fan, the screenwriters really nailed Spidey's witty banter. It's not used often, but it's very effective in bringing the character to the big screen. And Webb brought his A-game when it comes to the action scenes. The fights between Spider-Man and the Lizard are hard-hitting and riveting, while the swinging through New York is an exhilarating ride. <br/><br/>But it's not all sunshine and lollipops. For one, it takes forever for this movie to get going, and only then it proceeds in fits and starts. It's way too long at 136 minutes, and it doesn't help matters that the movie drags for long stretches. Horner's score is oddly out of place, especially with the school fight scene. <br/><br/>And it's unnervingly dark for a Spider-Man film. It's great that Peter goes through some angst and anger issues, but there's not enough humor and light-hearted scenes to balance it out. You get to the point where you can easily see how things will turn out, and it's a downer. This isn't Batman - there's no need to make this character dark and overly brooding.<br/><br/>It's clear that ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a setup movie for another big franchise. And seeing as we have a terrific actor for the lead role, I'm cautiously optimistic. Garfield is great. <br/><br/>But for god's sake, let's lighten things up.<br/><br/>6/10"
"gtaustine-326-310942","6","0","1","18 November 2012"," A great action movie - but isn't Peter Parker supposed to be a geek?
","Overall, I did enjoy the movie. Andrew Garfield is a great actor. If you haven't seen him in the ""Red Riding"" series - you really should. Emma Stone is beautiful and believable as Gwen Stacy, and Rhys Ifans is terrific, as usual. The action was fun and exciting, and the story was decent. Additionally, Sally Field and Martin Sheen were excellent as Aunt May and Uncle Ben. There was one huge problem with the movie though - they went ahead and completely changed the character of Peter Parker. <br/><br/>I'm not an avid comic book fan, but I did read many of Spidey's stories back in the 70s - and if you had to use one word to describe pre-spider bite Peter Parker, that word would be, ""nerd."" Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker really pulled it off well. In stark contrast, Andrew Garfield's was more of a brooding outcast than a nerd. Sure, he was a shy, brilliant scientist, but he dressed and acted like one of the ""cool"" kids. He had the stupid, tussled, trendy hair, he was a coordinated skateboarder, he was sullen and moody - and he seemed relatively comfortable around women. That's not Peter Parker's character. <br/><br/>In the history of geekdom, no geek has ever worn hip hugging ""skinny jeans"" and exposed boxers. You can't just have a character wear his knapsack with both straps, throw a pair of glasses on him and pass him off as a nerd. <br/><br/>Peter Parker is supposed to be likable - Garfield's version seemed more like one of those annoying teenagers who hangs out at the 7/11 all day when he's not zooming within an inch of killing you on his skateboard. I came away from this movie disliking Peter Parker!<br/><br/>Also, Garfield's Peter Parker is portrayed as heroic before he was ever bitten by the spider - when he comes to the rescue of another kid being bullied by Flash. People who themselves are targets of bullies would never try to intervene when someone else was being picked on. Ten minutes earlier Parker failed to stand up for himself when Flash bounced a basketball off his head - but when it comes to other kids being harassed he turns into Mr. Bravery? Gimme a break. <br/><br/>***SPOILERS***<br/><br/>Next, we have the Flash Thompson character. In this incarnation of Spider-Man, Flash starts off as a bully, but then he barely even stands up for himself when he is being humiliated by Parker on the basketball court - and 50 minutes into the movie, for no reason whatsoever, he suddenly has a change of heart and shows compassion for Parker after the death of Uncle Ben. WTF?! The bullies I grew up with would have tormented the guy even more once they knew he had a weak spot. It just made no sense. <br/><br/>Another thing that made no sense was Uncle Ben's anger when Parker humiliated Flash. The jerk had just brutally punched and kicked the hell out of Peter, and all he did was show Flash up on the court. Why would Ben be so angry about that? Is outperforming someone in a sport morally wrong? I guess in this day and age of cyber-bullying and school shoot-ups, they didn't want to endorse or glorify violence as a means of righting a wrong. Fair enough, but it seriously undermines the relative realism of the movie. In the 1st Spider-Man movie with Maguire, Parker *did* kick the crap out of Flash - and that's definitely what a kid who had spent his life being picked on would do if he suddenly found himself with super powers. It also made Ben's moral scolding seem justified and appropriate.<br/><br/>Finally, I have to do some nitpicking. <br/><br/>1. When the father of the boy saved by Spidey (played by C. Thomas Howell) redirects the cranes to help him swing his way to the OsCorp Tower - that's just ridiculous. How in the world would he know exactly from which direction Spidey was coming? Why, if the city was being evacuated, would construction workers be allowed (or even inclined) to be at their posts? Why would massive I-Beams be left swinging from a crane's arm at night, after the shift had finished hours ago? <br/><br/>2. Why were there lizards crawling around the streets on NYC? I've lived here for 40 years and I've never seen one. Also, if you're gonna make a movie set in NYC, why not film it here? I can understand Lucas subbing Tunisia for Tatooine - but c'mon. <br/><br/>3. At the very end of the movie, when Gwen realizes Peter is avoiding her because her father made Peter promise to keep her out of harm's way - Peter implies he has no intention of keeping that promise. So in other words, he is going to break his oath to a dying hero police officer who saved his life, and just go ahead with endangering the guy's beloved daughter!? Maguire's Parker took cold showers for years to avoid getting M.J. involved - and her father was an abusive drunkard. <br/><br/>So, basically it's a good, fun movie - but the Peter Parker character was replaced with a shy, savant Bam Margera."
"drqshadow-reviews","6","0","1","16 November 2012"," A Bit Too Familiar, Spider-Man's Relaunch Struggles to Differentiate Itself
","I appreciate this franchise's need to distance itself from the missteps of Spider-Man 3, to start from scratch with a villain besides the Green Goblin, and to get back to the character's roots as an awkward kid in an adult's costume, wise-cracking to mask his uncertainty. I even like the decision go completely Mary Jane-free, as I felt the old ""girl next door is the only one for me"" story was a path the Raimi films walked far too quickly. Despite those perfectly noble, admirable intentions, though, this reboot just doesn't click for me. In the ten years since the first Spider-Man, the landscape of cinematic superheroics has changed dramatically. The Avengers family has upped the action ante, while Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy has proved a hero's story can be about more than just the mask. With the glut of action heroes now on the scene, Peter Parker needed this chance to differentiate himself, but instead he fades further into the wallpaper. Andrew Garfield turns in a laudable effort, but his renditions of Parker and Spider-Man are written to be so drastically different, it's often tough to imagine they're actually the same person. I had a hard time watching Peter doom and gloom over his Uncle while at school, then immediately toss out wacky jokes at night, in the midst of hunting his killer. Martin Sheen is the film's only real standout as poor, ill-fated Uncle Ben, but that's a role so inherently sympathetic that it would take an unmitigated disaster to screw up. All things considered it's certainly not a bad effort; the cast is loyal to the source while still seeming contemporary, the action scenes are breathtaking (if surprisingly infrequent) and enough leftovers remain on the table to feed several sequels. But several dull spots, a foil that seems too run-of-the-mill and universally inconsistent characterization stop it from being as amazing as the title would have us believe."

","This review is just as redundant as the movie itself. But I have to say it: The Amazing Spider-Man is an amazing waste of time. Not just mine, but that of the talented cast and crew.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie re-treads Raimi's original Spider-Man, while adding needless twists and embellishments that only make it less effective in every way. The second half has Spidey trading punches with what has to be the most boring super-villain ever put on the screen. As a character, this Lizard makes Gojira look positively Shakespearean by comparison.<br/><br/>The new plot points, such as those involving Peter's parents or Gwen Stacey are okay, but they're handled in a shallow, haphazard way that robs them of any interest. The new Parker personality is similarly okay, but never really developed. Why exactly does this goofball want to be a hero? Is he a nerd, or just a twit? Compared to Raimi's version, this character is vague, lacking in motivation and not particularly likable.<br/><br/>I don't regret seeing The Amazing Spider-Man. It's a moderately pleasurable waste of two hours. But nothing more."

","Honestly it's not as bad as some people make it out to be. The movie is a retelling of a story we already know, some minor flaws but no movie is perfect. In this setting Peter is a just a kid in high school you can expect things not to go as mature and smoothly so just don't compare it to the Peter Parker you know from the Sam Raimi movies. Sam Raimi's third Spiderman movie was the worst and this is nothing like that movie. What I found bothersome is how meager and unoriginal the story is. Like Spiderman only has one enemy? There are tons to choose from do something with that or ad a female super hero romance like with the Black Cat. Anyways because the story was so skinny the movie drags on too long you don't need more than 2 hours to tell this story =_=. Regardless I did enjoy the movie it's somewhat what I expected it to be, no serious high hopes but just action fun. If you're looking for a super hero, action flick and you are just in the mood for it than you should just watch it.<br/><br/>Also I think it's silly for people to go all badd @ss online comparing this movie to Sam Raimi's work and not knowing anything about the many different Spiderman comic stories or animations. It's a movie based on a comic, a lot of comics tend to have great artwork and enjoyable simple stories only a few have the high quality stories. So be grateful for what you get everything better is extra!<br/><br/>Ps:I must say if you haven't seen the Sam Raimi ones, shame on you XD. Go watch those first (the first and the second, I don't recommend the third)."

","While there is no particular reason why the film was not amazing, it seemed to be lacking the genuine excitement. The story is very well known and doesn't need a synopsis. This is the first film in the new reboot series of the Spiderman. And we have The Lizard in this as the villain. While the visuals are good, they fail to make you excited anytime. <br/><br/>PROS:<br/><br/>The superhero in this looked more authentic then the other versions of the character. He gets hurt a lot, has super strength but when a shot is fired he does bleed. The beautiful part is that he is not concerned with hiding himself under a mask from the world so much. If a boy is scared of him in the mask, he will take it out and show him that he is just a normal guy. Andrew Garfield looked better in the costume than Tobey Maguire. Also there is a very little difference when you see them without costume. If we consider the first films of both of them, than in his first film Tobey Maguire looked more better because of his more innocent look. But I bet in the sequels to follow, Andrew will be the best. The hero actually never had to behave heroically in this first part and that was the beauty. His sacrificing capabilities will surely show up later. <br/><br/>CONS:<br/><br/>The screenplay however failed a lot of times. It could not give the proper explanation of his new webbing techniques. The struggle of peter with his new powers was lacking. The chemistry between Gwen and Peter lacked the charm that was present in Mary Jane and Peter. The stunts were good but they completely lacked the emotion and story to back them up. There was no excitement even in the end. <br/><br/>VERDICT: ""Watch at your own risk."""

","The Amazing Spider-Man grossed over 700 Million worldwide this year which is 100 Million less then the original Spider-Man (2002). This is probably the very clear sign which of those two has been favored by fans. <br/><br/>The remake is little bit different from original one. The storyline develops around Peter Parker who has been seeking his parents since childhood. In previous version they are dead but now the movie does not clear up whether they're still alive or not. The only clue we've got is the reason of their disappearance, that is results of secret experiment held by Peter's dad.<br/><br/>Moving along, the greatest enemy turns out to be The Lizard - a co- worker and close friend of Peter's dad and unsuccessful hybrid of genetic experiment. I found this part of the movie too childish and less attractive.<br/><br/>What I Liked?<br/><br/>Well, Peter Parker/Spider Man itself. I have never loved Tobey Maguire as a hero. He was too nerdy even for playing nerdy student and too ""stupid-looking"" for being superhero. <br/><br/>Andrew Garfield is better in all aspects including acting and the character itself. New Spider-Man is more average boy who's got problems in school but he's not totally a loser.<br/><br/>What I Did Not Like?<br/><br/>Andrew's character is much more irresponsible than Tobey's.

On the contrary, the old Spider-Man could take much on himself and even turned down Mary Jane's proposal about their relationship. <br/><br/>Spider-Man has been an Academy Award nominee for technical nominations: Visual Effects (one win), Sound Editing, Sound Mixing and e.t.c. But this one is simply easily made, not creative fantasy film. That is what I expected at least however did not get any.<br/><br/>Do I recommend it?<br/><br/>Not for seeing in the cinema. You can get it on DVD or smth at home, or probably you should not watch it at all."
"ani-for-prez","5","0","2","28 October 2012"," The ""Not so"" Amazing Spiderman
","Yeah the title of the review has most definitely been thought of by somebody before me but I just couldn't resist.<br/><br/>After such incredible superhero movies such as Christopher Nolan's Batman and The Avengers, what could be remembered of Spiderman needed to be rebooted. It was obviously not conceived this year but the massive influx of superhero movies, and the fact that Toby McGuire probably wasn't available for further sequels, spurred Sony to try and resurrect this web-slinging hero. Giving the helm to an inexperienced director (much in the vein of Joss Whedon) we were set to be delivered the darker, more realistic and gritty version of Spiderman (much in the vein of Batman). We were deceived and the web pulled over our eyes.<br/><br/>Let's start with the good news. The performances were excellent. Andrew Garfield as an awkward high school student was much better than the ""emo"" and depressed Toby McGuire. As Peter Parker, or better yet when we could see his face, pulled off quite the act. We expected great things from him after ""the Social Network"" and he performed well. Emma Stone is a talented woman and she acts well. Rhys Ifans as the anguished Curt Connors and Martin Sheen as the immortal Uncle Ben were great though not enough was given to these characters, the camera focusing mostly on the eponymous hero, his dashing damsel and the CGI villain. Speaking of which, the CGI too was excellent though for a movie of this budget, if it wasn't, it would be deplorable. Unfortunately that's all I can scrounge to label good news. Now comes the flood of bad.<br/><br/>The plot is ridiculous and stupid. Chock-full of clichés, holes, unexplainable behaviour and topped off unabashedly with a thick, greasy layer of cheese. There was so much cheese, this movie rivals the monstrosities Epic Meal Time conjures up in their disgusting videos. Alternate plot lines are vaguely mentioned and never resolved, people do stupid things with no motivation (eg. Spiderman taking his mask off every other scene), nonsensical and irrelevant scenes stretch on to the end of time. This brings me to the length of the movie; there was absolutely NO REASON this movie had to be as long as it was. We were never given enough of Spiderman actually doing his thing, being the friendly neighbour and all that jazz.<br/><br/>Cinematography was average. This is not what needs to happen in an action superhero movie. We need excellently filmed action sequences which are satisfying. And the score, oh MY GOD the score was hellish. This was the WORST score for an action movie, evoking emotions in the wrong places, at the wrong times and sounding exactly like any other orchestral piece. Except I've heard some good orchestra and this was poor. The Director, who is completely inexperienced, has done a bad job of bringing this movie back from it's beleaguered past. We suffered through 2 bad sequels. Now we suffer through a bad remake. The worst part is we must go through this again if Mark Webb hasn't learned his lesson. And in all probability, owing to the fact that this garbage earned millions of greens, he hasn't. Thank God this isn't part of the Avengers Initiative or I would be crying blood.<br/><br/>One more gripe, what was the point of Irrfan Khan's character anyway? What is up with Hollywood hiring great Bollywood actors for 2-bit roles? They did this by straddling Anil Kapoor with a nauseating role in MI4 and now Irrfan Khan with this completely forgettable part. These are great actors Hollywood! We expect more respect from you!"

Another movie that could be good but isn't, it is too long for no reason, the actors are OK but just that, the story is too pink for a spider man movie (another application of the horrible formula from Titanic). Remained me of another colossal failure, the last Transformers, even that this one is a little better. When do this people in Hollywood start to tell good stories that do not look like soap operas with some crappy boring action sequences in the end full of computer made images In the end i could not care less about the characters, the story or the horrible acting from the girl, the 24 year old that was 17.

","An average film for the superhero genre, The Amazing Spider-Man follows the same story from the comics. Exactly as did the previous Spiderman movie, from only 10 years earlier. If anything, it amazes through its sheer mediocrity.<br/><br/>The effects are OK, the actors don't seem to be asleep half the time as in the 2002 film, the story is, as I was saying, the same. I can't possibly spoil the plot if you've seen any other Spiderman movie, animation or if you've read the comics.<br/><br/>So one has to wonder: why did they do it? Perhaps, as a literature teacher said in one of the last scenes of the film, because there are not only 10 basic plots in all of fiction, but one. Well, I don't buy that."
"crappy_punk_rock","4","0","4","25 October 2012"," How the lizard should have looked!
","The lizard should have looked like the recent incarnation in the Amazing Spiderman #633. Google it and see how awesome he is. <br/><br/>I hated the first trilogy. Mainly due to the dull Maguire/Dunst combo and AWFUL Power Ranger goblin suit.<br/><br/>This one started brightly. Garfield is a million times the Peter Parker that Toby Maguire was. A more modern, loner skater boi version who delivers his Spidey lines with a thousand times more conviction.<br/><br/>It rushed the origin, but I wasn't too bothered as I know it like the back of my hand now and felt that it didn't even really need to be explained again.<br/><br/>The real ratings-killer? The Lizard.<br/><br/>The Lizard was always going to be a challenge to bring to the screen. He was always going to come across as a second rate Son of Godzilla so in some ways I feel he was the wrong choice to kick start this reboot. The CGI and character design are just awful. Really poor. His face looks ridiculous, he's far too big and he should never have been able to talk (even if that goes against the comics). Every time he opened his CGI'd mouth I cringed. It was poor. He looked like something from a crappy 90's sci-fi flick."

"ragingbull_2005","6","0","3","22 October 2012"," The romance drags down the movie
","I am a little ambivalent towards the movie. There are many good things in it. Like the part when Peter(played well by Andy Garfield) slowly begins discovering his powers and causes destruction at home. Or like the action scenes between the lizard and spider man which are very well done. Spider man here is funny. he talks to the policeman and occasionally also taunts the cops, just like in the comics. However, the movie devotes a large amount of time in the romantic scenes between Gwen Stacy and Parker which after a period of time just begin to drag the movie. The story is different in the beginning and there is the convergence only when Peter's uncle is killed. Rhys Ifans as the lizard is impressive. However, he does not hold a candle to even the lamest villain of Batman who are generally evil to their very core. Entertaining but not relentlessly so. A sincere effort but could have done much better with a shorter and tighter movie. 3 out of 5 for this. The Spider Man is not really amazing but still manages to hold on to the special spot in your heart."
"joshineuropa","4","0","2","21 October 2012"," If you have seen one Spiderman movie, you've seen this one.
","Here is the latest re-boot of the never-will-die franchise of Spider-man. This time, the protagonist Spider-man/Peter Parker is played by Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy? Why not Mary-Jane Parker I do not know. Both played their part adequately. The cast is rounded out by some REAL actors whom, I'm sure just thought, why not, for a quick cheque. The always wonderful Martin Sheen plays Uncle Ben, and delivers his performance flawlessly. He plays a kind yet stern, fatherly figure for Peter. He makes you want him to take you for ice cream. He is great actor and a brilliant choice for this iconic role. Auntie Em is played by the great Sally Field. Loving and concerned, she makes you feel like if you skinned your knee, she would make it better. Having Sally Field and Martin Sheen as Peters Auntie Em and Uncle Ben, was great casting. The main antagonist this time is Dr. Curt Connors/Lizard. Played by Rhys Ifans, he does a fairly decent acting job. He is believable as a one armed scientist gone mad. Decent and likable in the beginning as Dr. Connors. And he does the transformation and CGI work well. But I think he could have given more as the lizard. Comic book super villains need to be NUTS!! Finally Denis Leary rounds out the main cast as Captain Stacy. And he does it great. He is his usual quick tongued, sarcastic, Irish cop self. It's actually pretty funny watching Denis going out of his way not to swear. It funny to think that Denis Leary's kids have never heard the word ass around the dinner table.The real stars of this movie, and this is true about most of these superhero movies are, the CGI people. Bravo folks, you did a wonderful job! As it is supposed to be, this movie is oneupmanship in regards to the art of comics. The scenes with Spiderman swinging through the city, and fighting crime, and battling the bad guy are well done and quite entertaining. The scenes with Dr. Connors turning into the lizard creature were really good, and the fight sequences were top notch, in the school scene in particular. But again I think the Lizard creature could have been badassier. The other real superheros of this movie were, as always, in movies like these, The Stunt people! There are some real athletes doing these scenes. If that parkour guy grabbed my wallet, it would be gone. Swinging around on ropes spider-man style. Jumping down from heights, beating each other up, I'll bet these guys had a pretty fun day at work. And they looked pro doing it. <br/><br/>But the problems I had with this movie were mainly with the plot and the storyline. I like the dad was a geneticist at the company idea and Peter could be connected that way. Good idea. He sneaks away and gets bitten. All major plot points that need covered. And then there is Gwen?, his crush/girl who sits in front of him at school/intern with top level access/daughter of the cop chasing Spiderman/now girlfriend who knows spider-mans identity character. Seriously what ARE the ODDS of this? Why doesn't Peter or Spidey just nick an ID from the professor or something. I doubt a 16 year old intern that does the public tour has the key to every door in the HQ of a major corporation, and is proficient in their fancy holographic computer. I realize I have just said something based on a comic book could be doubtful, but seriously The Peter finding out he's Spiderman scenes are pretty funny and are good uses of CGI and stunts. And back at school later Peter beats the crap out of the school bully, 'shockingly' named Flash. Could there be a sequel coming? They are cool scenes though, especially the basketball in the gym scene. But the first time Peter returns home after being bitten, could have been better. Andrew plays the scene well as does does Martin Sheen and Sally Field of course. But the director should have let this scene and become more integral by letting these two brilliant actors run with it more. They should have known who he was earlier and helped. That would have been a good use of those two actor in this movie. The way that uncle Ben was killed off by the guy who Peter let rob the store was good, but I would have rather him survive and it be a father son revenge storyline. The main problem I have with Peter becoming Spiderman, was the web spinning devices. Part of becoming Spiderman was the ability to spin webs. Not with a gadget. Batman would like that toy. I'm being geeky, but too bad. There are also just some silly eye rolling moments like the door to the super secret spider lab looks like the door to my old science class room. Complete with 4''X18'' glass window. The Lizard seeing 'Property Of Peter Parker' literally labeled on his camera. The weird cops shooting Spidey just after he has his talk with Capt. Stacy thing was strange. And all the crane operators that came around to help Spidey was, uhh... a strange attempt at something maybe Sept. 11ish? And why did the antenna fall over at the end and they landed on the roof? I might have missed that part as I was getting ready for it to be over. At over two hours long it was a nothing to special kind of way to spend a Saturday evening. It was good CGI and stunts, with a silly plot and character misuse. I think they need to give the Superhero stuff a rest for a decade or two. Stan Lee has more money than he could spend for the rest of his life. Time to move on from this genre for a while."
"paul_haakonsen","6","0","4","20 October 2012"," Was this really a necessary movie?
","I saw this movie despite not being an overly keen fan of superheroes or spiderman in particular. Why? Well because I had the time and had nothing else to see.<br/><br/>Having seen it, I must say that I sit here wondering just why they had to go and start the spiderman movies all over from the scratch? That just made no particular sense to me. Wasn't the other movies good enough? I can only speculate and guess, and it wouldn't get anywhere. I can just say that I think that this movie was somewhat of an unnecessary movie in many ways. Sure it was a good movie, fun and entertaining, but it is not something that was vital to cinema to have it remade and reinvented.<br/><br/>Visually, then ""The Amazing Spiderman"" is quite a treat. It is nicely made and looks good. But as with the previous movies, I just wonder with all that webbing he shoots about him as he swings through the streets of New York, wouldn't the city eventually become a tangled mess with all those strands of web? Or is the web somehow magically degradable by itself, yet strong enough to support hanging cars from a bridge? It just doesn't really add up.<br/><br/>Story-wise, well there were some deviants from the storyline in the first movie, and I guess that is the major difference between ""Spiderman"" and ""Amazing Spiderman"", but then again, I am not familiar with the story lines in the original comic books series, so I am just guessing. But again, it just adds to the point that this movie wasn't really a necessary movie to have made, in my opinion.<br/><br/>The movie bolstered some great names to the cast; such as Martin Sheen, Sally Field, Denis Leary and Emma Stone. I am not familiar with Andrew Garfield's work prior to this movie, but he did a good enough job with his role as Peter Parker/Spiderman.<br/><br/>I am sure for die-hard fans of the Spiderman franchise, then ""The Amazing Spiderman"" is a super great movie. And I will say that it was actually good entertainment. But for us regular non-spiderman fans, then there wasn't' all that appeal to this."

","The Spider-Man franchise is launched again, only five years after Sam Raimi wrapped up his highly successful trilogy. After watching the latest installment it makes you wonder why.<br/><br/>Other than the obvious reason of making more money, the latest installment brings nothing new to the table that the Raimi versions didn't. So the reboot starts up with Peter Parker in high school and Uncle Ben is still alivebig whup. The writing is cheesier and the special effects seem virtually the same.<br/><br/>Director Marc Webb, who worked his magic in the 2009 indie hit (500) Days of Summer, missed his chance of leaving a lasting impression as Raimi did. Raimi gave us iconic scenes like a car flying through a coffee shop window in slow-mo, and the infamous upside down first kiss between Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst. Webb gives us a montage of Peter Parker learning more about his new Spidey powers whilst skateboarding to a Coldplay soundtrack (this is no joke), and the most awkward first kiss since Harry Potter hooked up with Ginny Weasley.<br/><br/>The trio of big time writers, James Vanderbilt (Zodiac, The Losers), Alvin Sargent (Spider-Man 2 & 3), and Steve Kloves (All the Harry Potter movies), show that too many chefs in the kitchen can sometimes only leave a big mess. Andrew Garfield (The Social Network, Never Let Me Go) and Emma Stone (The Help, Zombieland) make a valiant attempt at bringing the lead characters to life, but the pathetic script leaves them coming off like the B-version of the chemistry put together by Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow in Iron Man. The actors also seem to be out of place in high school. Buying Garfield (28 years-old) & Stone (24) as high school kids requires a large commitment from anyone with a brain. Maybe the people who cast the original 90210 series had their hands in this one too.<br/><br/>If you don't compare The Amazing Spider-Man to Raimi's trilogy you can probably find enough positives to enjoy it and find it somewhat entertaining. But for the most part the latest Spidey flick is just another example of Hollywood forcing out another big budget stinker that they know they can make a quick buck from. I would rather see a comic book reboot for characters that need it. Can someone please do justice for The Fantastic Four? For more quick reviews check out www.FilmStallion.com"

","Fearing the loss of very specific property rights, Sony Pictures rushed out ""The Amazing Spiderman"", a retelling of the origins of a Marvel superhero by the same name. Those familiar with Sam Raimi's recent Spiderman trilogy (or Marvel's Spiderman lore) will find little new here, but the film, directed by Mark Weber, nevertheless moves well. Knowing that its audience has very strong negative preconceptions (""A Spidey reboot, so soon!?"") it rushes through familiar plot-beats and tries to veer in original directions when possible.<br/><br/>Still, Weber's film is different only in areas which don't matter: the backgrounds of Spiderman's parents are altered, our hero's love interest is changed and Weber tries to shake things up by having our hero reveal his identity early to both his bosomy girlfriend and her father, a police officer whose last act death swiftly makes his entire character absolutely pointless. The film's less personal than Raimi's, more anonymously directed, its action sequences aren't as classily framed, is less bloated, and expectantly degenerates into big budget CGI fisticuffs, this time with our hero trading blows with a computer generated man-crocodile. The film has one good scene in which Spidey constructs an underground spiderweb to ""detect"" subtle micro-movements.<br/><br/>This incarnation of Spiderman is played by Andrew Garfield. Like Tobey Maguire, Sony's previous Spiderman, Garfiend possesses a mix of geekiness and athletic sexiness. As today's interactivity-indoctrinated net-wired audiences are tired of CGI, and spectacle itself is largely dead, it's the film's soap opera moments which work best. But why invest in Spidey-soap when there's a two-to-three year gap between each blockbuster? And why invest when every Marvel franchise, both on-screen and in print, has scuttled continuity and ultimately betrayed its audience? Nobody cares about Raimi's Spiderman 1 and 2 because 3 was god-awful. Meanwhile the X-men franchise was contaminated the moment ultra-hack Brett Ratner was given the reigns. All these spandex franchises are treated as being disposable.<br/><br/>Incidentally, Spiderman is spelt and trademarked as ""Spider-man"", unlike Batman, Superman and Iron Man, all of whom lack a hyphen. This supposedly was done to distinguish Spider-man from Superman. Superman, meanwhile, originally had few super powers, but writers began pulling random powers out of his ass in the 1950s to differentiate him from other super heroes. So to distinguish himself Supes gets laser vision, super-speed, super hearing etc, whilst Spidey gets a meagre hyphen. Marvel's so cheap.<br/><br/>7.5/10 - Worth one viewing."
"jeremyhwernli","7","0","2","22 August 2012"," Why so soon?
","Why so soon? Many are asking this and the answer is simple, money. Sam Raimi's Spider-Man's made too much money for Sony to give up on Spider-Man once Sam Raimi and his cast dropped out. It was decided to revamp the spider-man franchise by starting a new; hence Marc Webb's The Amazing Spider-Man.<br/><br/>The movie starts with Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) as a child and his parents leaving for some unknown reason. Then we move to Peter as a high-schooler and of course very curious about his father's work and his parent's disappearance (they have been missing ever since leaving him as a child). Peter lives with his Aunt May (Sally Field) and Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen).<br/><br/>Peter finds his father's old briefcase. Which is how the cross species research is introduced and he learns his father once had a partner named Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans. So Peter seeks him out to get answers. He finds the building where he is working and sneaks his way into a tour group. He actually steals a name tag of someone in the tour group, which in most films would raise an unanswered question, what will happen to the guy who had his name tagged stolen, won't that lead to security coming to tour group and finding the impostor? This film answers it and I won't ruin how. At this building Peter is bitten by a fictional spider that the scientists have been working on. He leaves and the next day he wakes up and is suddenly super strong and has no control of it. This I really enjoyed and appreciated. First it was funny to watch, but I saw it as a more realistic take in comparison to the original movies way of going about someone who suddenly gains strength on a gargantuan scale. So Peter goes to school and shows off on the basketball court getting revenge from a bully who he roughed him up earlier, Flash Thompson (Chris Zylka). Which leads to a talk with the principle and Uncle Ben has to come to the school. More importantly after talking to the principle, Uncle Ben reveals to Gwen that Peter has a picture of her on his computer as they pass her in the hall. This leads Peter to asking Gwen out, well kind of. That scene is well done; it captures the awkwardness of high schoolers and trying to act cool and so busy.<br/><br/>But unfortunately the different techniques they us to make the actors pass as high schoolers doesn't quite work. It's probably because Andy Garfield is 28 and Emma stone is 23 (just maybe). But of course most actors playing high schoolers in movies are older than 18. In the original Spider-Man Tobey Maguire playing Peter and Kirsten Dunst playing Mary Jane didn't pass as high schoolers either. Which is why I thought it was very smart that the original had the majority of the story take place once they had graduated from high school. But in this remake they did not go that route and the entire story takes place with them in high school. Which means no Jonah Jameson, too bad he was a great addition to Sam Raimi's Spider-Man movies. Although it's my understanding that the entire cast agreed to not be involved in a spider-man project without Sam Raimi anyways.<br/><br/>Despite being too old, Andrew Garfield is engaging and convincing in his display of emotions and as spider-man. Having Peter be a skater-boy was a smart choice in making him more engaging to present day teenagers. And there is a very entertaining scene with him testing out his new abilities while skateboarding. Emma Stone does a good job as well. She and Andy were a cute couple in the film. I will say there a couple of scenes that take their awkwardness together a bit too far and it becomes off putting.<br/><br/>That had little to no significance though. What was significant was the pacing. In the first half when they are covering the same grounds of the original, pacing is fast. To keep people from getting bored with what they had essentially already seen 10 years ago in the original I suspect. The pacing then slows, the overall shot run times increases in the second half. It made the second half fell drawn out and slow at times. And I'm not one a viewer that has little patience and just wants things to blow-up. I think it was just the rhythm that gave the drawn out effect as well as maybe some needed excluded scenes.<br/><br/>That was one of the weaknesses of the film but there are many strengths. Amongst what I already mentioned I found the visual effects to be impressive and the overall entertainment value was good. I liked both how the characters Ben and May were handled and the acting of the characters. I think this film was an effective spider-man film. Too soon in my personal opinion though. And a second film is in the works. I will say I liked this one enough to check out the next one."
"toontownprettycandy","7","0","3","17 August 2012"," The Pros and Cons, May not contain Spoilers after all.
","Now, you see that I have seen many reviews for this movie on the website, it's either you hate it or you don't. Then there are some exceptional reviewers who do indeed mention the pros and cons of this movie. For example, obviously everyone here has expected that Spiderman 4 should have came out, but it didn't. Instead, the producers decided to create a reboot of Spiderman, therefore discontinuing the 10 years about 8-9 years of Samuel's work. Instead, and ironically, they hired Marc Webb to film this new ""amazing Spiderman"" which is supposed to grab viewers from all over the world to see what today's technology can do opposed to 10 years ago, when the first actual Spiderman movie came out.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spiderman does not possess true emotion that you can find in some movies, yet it does have a slight corny effect on what you predict is going to happen next. It is understandable that you may not like this new movie at all, for people have different opinions on what types of movies they prefer and what they would expect from a 5-year break. Yes, this movie doesn't play off your emotions as they would from perhaps a different movie, but I suppose that this movie is a combination of action and romance, but focusing a little bit more on the action part of it's behalf. The most saddening moment that DID play off my emotions slightly was when a tragedy happened that also happened in the original Spiderman.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spiderman is obviously based on the original first Spiderman film if you have seen it. The trailer however, conceals the fact that this is a reboot. Also, the trailer focuses mainly on the fact that of Peter Parker's parents, which it does a little but it's not the main focus of the movie. Apparently, the reviewers on this title are particularly NOT happy with the trailers ripping them off on the whole point of this little reboot. Honestly, if kids were watching this movie, and they saw the trailer, they might have thought that this wasn't a reboot and that they only switched the actors to make it seem for whatever reason they had to replace the original cast members.<br/><br/>I am not a very good critic. In fact, this is my first one. But this movie does contain a sense of sadness, romance, uplifting relief, and action-packed adrenaline. There are some scenes that remain calm at first but then jump right out at you, but it should be predictable enough to not make you jump in your seat. This movie does fill in gaps, and has an insensible amount of time, trying not to rush but in MY point of view, cannot replace the interesting curiosity I held for the first movie. This version of the Spiderman however, does contain more action but less romance (of course from my view) than the original.<br/><br/>However, based on how I view it, it may not appeal to all viewers, but it probably can make a summer favorite of a little 10-13 year old kid. <br/><br/>~Angel."
"TheUnknown837-1","6","0","3","12 August 2012"," Mr. Webb is certainly not an untalented director; he just might have been the wrong guy for this project
","Considering that only a mere ten years have passed since Sam Raimi rebooted the popular Spider-Man franchise to the big screen, one does wonder why Hollywood has decided to start afresh once again rather than just continue what Mr. Raimi had begun. Part of the reason, I suppose, would be the anger and disappointment—which I shared—over Mr. Raimi's Spider-Man 3. The other reason might be the disappointment over the casting of Tobey Maguire as the titular, web-spraying superhero—disappointment which I did not share. But why start over? James Bond has gone through many incarnations without going back to the beginning again. Imagine how repetitive and frustrating it would have been to see him get his double-O status every time a new actor decided to play him. So I saw no real need for this Spider-Man reboot beforehand; my reluctance is enhanced in hindsight, as The Amazing Spider-Man is a valiant but mostly unimpressive effort.<br/><br/>It would seem as though the trio of screenwriters (James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent, and Steve Kloves) shared the general audiences' disappointment in Tobey Maguire playing Peter Parker/Spider-Man ten years ago, but were utterly in love with the first movie's story. Obviously, I am fully aware that both movies are based on the same comic book, but they do follow a rather similar narrative pattern. In fact, it's much too similar. Our hero starts off as a tormented dweeb, gets bitten by a genetically altered spider, starts suffering strange side-effects, watches his uncle die in the streets, goes on a vengeance mission, makes a costume, runs from the police, sees a previous father-figure turn into a vile green monster after injecting himself with some kind of solution, and so on. Both climaxes also conclude with a supporting character being stabbed clean through the torso and dying, and the hero making a moralistic call regarding his love interest.<br/><br/>Every twist and turn in the plot seems all that familiar, because again, it has not been that long. History has shown that familiar stories can be effectively told when done with a certain level of style or discipline. The director of The Amazing Spider-Man is certainly a filmmaker with style and discipline. His last movie was (500) Days of Summer, which I regard as one of the very best of contemporary American love stories. In supervising an action-packed spectacle, however, Mr. Webb seems to lose his head. He is not yet much of an action specialist and a number of the fight sequences seem choppy. A squabble onboard a subway train, with every shot filmed much too short and each camera sweep far too blurry, lacks the sense of humor and surprise that was obviously intended. Even the CGI shots of Spider-Man whisking over the rooftops of New York have an unfinished feeling to them, as if key shots were missing. At one point, he throws himself off a high-rise, catches a wall with his web, is about halfway down the building, and in the next shot is just two feet from the pavement and already slowed down. It is in the quieter moments—a scene where our protagonist ponders over a genetics algorithm in his bedroom—that his montage and gift for camera angles falls into place. Mr. Webb is certainly not an untalented director; he just might have been the wrong guy for this project.<br/><br/>The film also suffers from a schizophrenic screenplay: one that toggles between overwritten and underwritten. It is overwritten in its dialogue; would-be comical banters between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, as his love interest, go on much too long, repeat themselves too often, and do not deliver the touching bits of humor they were meant to. Underwritten are the plot points: the chemical developed by the villain as a means to regenerate amputations; Peter Parker's dynamic with his doomed uncle; the dynamic between Parker and his love interest's hard-as-nails father, who works on the police force. As played by Mr. Garfield, this new Peter Parker is rather irritating; this good actor's talents come to life in more subtle roles—the way this character should have been written. But his frantic dialogue delivery and quirky mannerisms seem phony, unlike the more plausible performance that Tobey Maguire gave ten years before. We don't learn much about the character; the most interesting thing I learned was that he was obviously a Hitchcock fan, as I spotted a poster of Rear Window on his bedroom wall. Yes, that was the most interesting thing that came to my mind after considering the film. Worse still is a completely uninteresting villain. Spider-Man's adversary this time around is the Lizard: a dinosaur-like brute with a permanent smile on his face. The computer graphics are decent enough; but the character is not given ample screen-time for us to really feel the impact of his motives. The Lizard has been written in a way as if the filmmakers really did not care who Spider-Man went up against, as if they only included him because the world expects a bad guy in every superhero story ever told.<br/><br/>In fact, that's the feel of this picture entirely. I got the impression that the filmmakers really did not care whether or not The Amazing Spider-Man was a success or not. The audience apparently wanted a big, lavish reboot and they got one. But is this picture really necessary? I don't think so, as I could have easily spent half the money to rent Sam Raimi's first Spider-Man picture, which featured almost the exact same story, same surprises, same twists, and all done with more energy and excitement."

","When I saw the appearance of Gwen Stacy early in this film i thought 'ah, this is the classic story where she gets killed by the Green Goblin and Spider-man avenges her death by killing the Green Goblin. I should have remembered unfortunately how much Marvel likes to distort and change their story lines when making film to comic conversions. Gwen Stacy was relegated to secondary importance and instead of trying to tell a classic story they completely confused the storyline by adding not one but two new villains. The way the symbiont creature was introduced was completely different (but then again I guess trying to retell the Secret Wars would have been too complex and expensive). As it was they reduced Venom's appearance who is one of Spidey's major foes to a subplot. The introduction of Kane Marko as Sandman was OK but once again which villain were we meant to be focussing on. When are Marvel going to realise that the original story lines have stood the test of time and don't need to contorted and amalgamated to create some kind of abridged version of the Marvel universe."

I knew what was going to happen throughout the film which disappoints exponentially. I sincerely expected that if the makers were daring to redo spider-man again, they must have something different for a change, but i was proved wrong in the first half an hour of the movie.<br/><br/>Had this been the start of the trilogy which would have been released before the previous trilogy, i would have said the movie was really good and effectively made but now, it was totally forgettable and a waste of money to produce the same stuff again and again."

","Watched a 2D version in the cinema, and now the aftertaste is quite irony since the redux deliberately put an ""amazing"" in its title, the storyline basically sticks together with Sam Reimi's first instalment, parents left him, grew up with uncle and auntie, bitten by the spider, uncle died, a mad scientist with a genetic mutation, blah blah blah (and finally, save the world and lose the girl).<br/><br/>Bully scenes are as stale as anyone could imagine, and what makes me sick is the blatant boosting of worship of ""the strongest the best"" principle (e.g. Flash's inferior stance of friendship after being humiliated by Peter Park's basketball antics), if this is the canon Hollywood mainstream products consistently not only inculcate Americans' minds, but also export to elsewhere, for which the dictatorial tone really should come under the lash. Competitiveness is beneficial in certain amount, but it is not the most chief way to gain success and fame, period!<br/><br/>The biggest feat of this reboot is that they find a rather right couple to enliven the tedious plot, Garfield and Stone both have captivating charisma even though they all have long passed the high-schooler's age, and they are plainly adorable on screen, they can hone up all the hoarse dialogues to a much pleasant tier which one can properly endure with a blithe smile. The villain, Rhys Ifans does make an impact, but hurdled by the role's curbed dimension, barely could be claimed memorable. Let me skip Sheen & Field pair thereafter. <br/><br/>About the CGI visual stunts, I remembered the teasing trailer did impress me with its close-up intimacy with all the spider-jumping and swinging, but in the film, luckily the night-time environment has an edgy to the spider-man dangling among the concrete jungle. even without 3D glasses, the vertiginous effect is pretty intimidating, but cannot be completely satisfied. <br/><br/>Director Marc Webb, from (500) DAYS OF SUMMER (2009, an 8/10) proves to be no more than a qualified hacker, no superimposition shots this time. Anyway it's typical Hollywood prerogative, we detest it while being ensnared to its resource cornucopia, a dilemma which we have to ruefully swallow."
"Matt_Layden","7","0","2","7 August 2012"," Is it really amazing?
","The biggest hurdle this film has to jump is that it can't seem like a cash grab to keep the studio owning the rights to the character before it reverts back to Marvel. So the question I ask myself and I ask those who've seen it. Did it feel like this movie needed to be made, or more importantly, does this story need to be told again only ten years after Sam Raimi's Spiderman? The answer, for me, is no. <br/><br/>The problem is the film treads familiar ground for too long, we've seen this story before. What does this film offer that differs from the original series? Well, the main thing is that his parents are more present and that gives a mysterious element to the film. Clearly all a ploy to set up a new trilogy. There are a lot of things introduced into this film that scream sequel. It's a thin ice, on one hand it will ultimately serve the viewer better down the road...if they care to continue the journey. At the end of the day, the feeling that I got with this film was this: an excuse to keep the franchise at Sony. <br/><br/>One of the biggest missteps this film has is the relationship between Gwen Stacey and Peter Parker. The fault lies within the script and the chemistry between the two. On their own, they are both great, together, it's a mess. I never bought the relationship from the set-up, to the conclusion. It felt forced and when they were together, I was asking myself why do they seem so awkward on screen? So the casting works on varying levels. Leary is given little to do, but this isn't his story anyway, then we have Rhys Ifans as Dr. Curt Connors a role that was played by Dylan Baker in every Raimi Spiderman film. Had Baker been the villain in the 3rd Spiderman, maybe we'd be enjoying their fourth collaboration and not this revamp. Ifans relationship to Peter in this film is lacking and his turn to the villain is underwhelming. There are scenes that feel ripped out of the original, specifically Connors battling his inner self exactly like Dafoe as the Green Goblin. It felt out of place as it only happened I think once, maybe twice. I never really found Spiderman to be in any danger during this film. We have a giant lizard creature attacking him and I never felt any suspense. This leads into another fault of the film.<br/><br/>The action sequences are messy. Not once did I think ""Oh, that was cool/interesting/neat/new/inventive"" anything along those lines. Marc Web (yes, his last name is Web) was the wrong man for the job. He had a brilliant debut film 500 Days of Summer and I figure Sony was trying to go the Marvel route and try out more ""unconventional"" directors for the gig. Yet his inexperience shows a bit with the action sequences, all of them lack the thrills the original trilogy had. <br/><br/>So where does this film succeed? As I said before, when they are not on screen together, both Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield are quite good. The scenes showcasing Spiderman swinging through the city are huge improvements over the original trilogy. They look real, feel real and he moves like the character would in the comics. I surprisingly liked the more realistic feel to this one. It works for and against it at times. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, there is a bit of mystery added to the overall story here. Peter's father, his story and his relation to future possible villains in something that I am actually looking forward to. <br/><br/>Despite feeling underwhelmed with the entire production, it does feel a bit more polished than a thrown together superhero film. This is no Iron Man 2. But I would have much rather of seen another Raimi entry, a redeeming entry to the 3rd, than this one. This would probably be on par with the original Spiderman, but the question of whether or not this particular story, one which we are way too familiar with, should it have been told again? My answer is no."
"BeholdTheBloodshed","7","0","2","27 July 2012"," The Not-so amazing spider-man, but far from a terrible effort.
","FIrstly, I think it's fair to say that, whilst I love the Marvel universe, I am by no means a hardcore fan. With that said, however, I still can't help but feel a little disappointed by The Amazing Spiderman. <br/><br/>Directed by the suitably named Marc Webb, TAS falls somewhat short of expectations for a viewer. Perhaps this is due to the fact that it immediately follows The Avengers, which set the bar impossibly high for superhero movies, or perhaps it is the fact that, for a Superhero movie, it is sorely lacking in the key parts- a memorable villains, exciting action sequences, a moral dilemma.<br/><br/>Rhys Ifans is a very talented actor, and his role here is a suitably written comic book villain, but in the Spiderman universe, The Lizard is not a particularly stand-out nemesis. With that in mind, the Gwen Stacy storyline is a much more believable love story than that of the Mary Jane one from the Sam Raimi efforts, and Andrew Garfield shares real chemistry on screen with her. The main problem is that Marc Webb is more effective at the romance scenes than he is at the action sequences. Whilst the fight scenes are entertaining enough, they simply don't hold the screen, and they are quickly forgotten. The original trilogy, directed by Sam Raimi, was packed full of memorable fight scenes which have stood the test of time. This movie is a solid effort, but it simply does little other than entertain, and it simply doesn't hold it's own alongside some of the other Marvel films. <br/><br/>Ultimately, it is a little confused by what it wants to be. The love element of the story is handled respectfully but the action sequences, whilst far from terrible, do not hold the audience's attention as much as should be expected. <br/><br/>You can't blame Sony for digging up the Spider-Man franchise for a reboot, as to this day it remains one of their most lucrative projects, but you also can't help but feel that this was an unnecessary addition to the Marvel Universe. Frankly, had The Avengers not been so fantastic, this film would still have been lacking that final spark. It's not poor- it just falls short of the hype that was surrounding it.<br/><br/>The Spider-Man isn't so amazing, after all."
"ryanofearth","6","0","3","25 July 2012"," A little hard to be impressed by a lack of re-imagination.
","I saw this with low expectations, but, like many, wanted to see what they had done differently from Sam Raimi's trilogy. I honestly believe it would have been great to see the story continued, rather than restarted and barely re-imagined. The pacing was painfully slow, and took way too much time to gain momentum with a story that was too bubble-gum pop to be taken seriously, and with about as much substance as watching an episode of Pretty Little Liars. The chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma stone was a high point, though at times Peter seemed a little too twitchy, and a little annoying when in costume. The second half of the film was much more enjoyable after being bored by the first, with some nice special effects. Unfortunately the film score, which should have complimented the screen action, lacked. I did however enjoy one of the last scenes with the blue snow and felt that the music in that scene was perfect for a great looking shot. All in all I wouldn't spend over $10 to watch this, and with the lack of action wouldn't bother with 3D but will probably watch it again when it comes out on DVD."
"Seymourzeynalov","1","0","2","22 July 2012"," Review of The Amazing Spider-man
","The Amazing Spiderman directed by Marc WEBB, get it? First of all I heard people say that The Amazing Spider-man is much more darker and grittier and realistic (some even like to throw a term - Nolanized) take on the easy going web slinger. I say, it is false. Surely, it LOOKS darker because most of the key scenes happen during NIGHT and filmmakers used darker colour palette. Besides, there is a 3 meter tall-naked-mutated-Lizard/human hybrid CGI running around. (OMG does he look generic). If you ever wanted to see Lizard on the big screens, you will be greatly devastated. They turned Doctor Connors into one dimensional generic villain. WHY?!! Have they not read the original source material? Nevertheless, I was glad to see that this NEW Spider-man story is not trying to copy Batman Begins like the trailer showed me, there are still plenty of jokes. IT IS SPIDER-MAN! He does not need to be dark or serious! Are you going to make Deadpool serious too? BUT in the end, I would have enjoyed the movie more if I did not seen it before. That is right ladies and gentle men. We all saw this movie before. And I kinda predicted the plot from the trailer and was hoping that I would be wrong (yeah I am that good). So... have you guys seen Spider-man 90's cartoon. Remember the episode where the audience got introduced to Lizard? Well, I remember. AND THE PLOT OF THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN (THE MOVIE) WAS TAKEN FROM A 90'S SPIDER-MAN CARTOON. I AM NOT LYING YOU. There first third of the movie is copying Sam Raimi's Spider-man and the last two thirds is copying the cartoon, A CARTOON. Is this what we have come to? I mean I love 90's Spider-man but taking the story line of a 30 minute long that is over 20 years old and stretching it into a 2 hour movie is idiotic! Alright I am exaggerating for the sake of entertainment. But you will be surprised how similar they are. Here is the link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKnhwGoUw2U"

The first 2 movies were very good and although the third was a bit of a let down I was still looking forward to the next instalment.<br/><br/>It came as a bit of a surprise when the franchise was rebooted with Garfield and Stone taking the lead roles. The feel of the Amazing Sprider- Man is very similar to the earlier movies with the romance between the leads being a fairly important focus of the film.<br/><br/>Overall the film is fairly enjoyable. Not sure what the 3D version was like, but some of the special effects looked ropey on the normal screen. It is way better than the last Spider-man film, but not quite as good as the first couple of the Maguire/Dunst films. Still fairly enjoyable though and worth a watch."

So was it as good as it seems? With a new Peter Parker, played by Andrew Garfield the story takes a new path and twist! When Peter's parents leave him at a young age to stay with his Aunt and Uncle, he takes it upon him self to find out what happened to his parents. He winds up finding Dr. Curtis Connors (Ryhs Ifans) who will soon become his enemy. Also in the mix of this is of course the romance involving Peter Parker(Garfield) and Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). The movie is filled with laughs and yet still manages to have the iconic story and action. For example the photography portrayed in the original Spider Man films are mixed into the story quite nicely as well as the relationship with Peter and his Uncle Ben(Martin Sheen). As for the Spider Bite, be prepared for a very interesting time. The Graphics are very well put together both 3D (recommend) and non 3D with the Director (Marc Webb) choosing some very interesting camera shots! The Twist on Spider Man was for the better and is an overall good film. Definitely a must see movie!

","'The amazing Spider-man' is an entertaining remake of the original spider-man films. Despite the fact that it has contradicted parts of the previous three movies; it includes moments that link with them. For example, the wrestling arena that Peter Parker fights to win money in the first film is used briefly. However, his powers to use the web from his wrist do not come from the spider bite at the beginning which contradicts the first film. <br/><br/>Despite this, I highly enjoyed the film but feel that making a remake is giving the wrong impression. I feel that making a new and improved spider-man pushes the originals aside.I am a big fan of the first three films but would love to see a sequel to 'The amazing spider-man' as the ending included a perfect opportunity for one. <br/><br/>Also, in every spidey film, Parker's costume improves slightly. I feel that this improvement is the best one yet. However, the change in actor is not of my liking; I much preferred Tobey Maguire's performance to Andrew Garfield. <br/><br/>The film's cinematography and mise-en-scene is excellent! The camera movements used during the climax during the swinging from the webs from building to building is amazing. The colour pallet really makes moments more exciting and the whole film a lot more gripping. <br/><br/>Overall, the film is worth the watch but not as good as the originals in my opinion."

There are certain films which you assume good CGI and the 3D will greatly enhance. Spiderman is one of them. I expected to see Spidey swing and scale the New York city scape, in glorious CGI and in 3D. I wanted to come out of the cinema with at least a fear of heights, but no, the CGI and the 3D effects are not great. The most amazing thing about ""The Amazing Spiderman"" is the question, what the hell did they spend 220 million on?. Perhaps they developed and used real Spider web instead of CGI, I don't know, does anyone else?<br/><br/>But I am being unfair, I did enjoy the film and my 2 nephews whom I brought along are still trying to run up the walls, they absolutely loved it.

","I enjoyed this movie. I thought it was fun and mostly well-written. I liked the casting and the visuals. They took many of the familiar elements of Spidey's origin and did two main things differently: they went further back into his childhood, involving his parents (particularly his father), and they set the story very firmly in the present. The scenes that take place in the school felt especially contemporary, as did the science lab. The equipment and technology were some of the better visual elements, showing colorful touchscreens and three-dimensional projections that are not yet in use, but felt like they might not be far off. I liked the character of Curt Conners, and I liked Emma Stone's Gwen Stacey. I felt like the movie got fairly formulaic in the last act, when the hero has to save the city in a battle on top of a skyscraper before the bomb goes off. But the first 3/4 of the movie were different. It didn't feel tired or clichéd, and it didn't feel like they took any shortcuts in the story, so it was a good setup. I would look forward to another installment by the same cast and filmmakers."
"Nbrayton17","8","0","3","14 July 2012"," Great movie that won't stick in our memories
","Is it possible to forgive a man who has now seen the light? That's what I ask of you now. I, your humble reviewer, got a chance to see The Amazing-Spider Man for a second time. Only, this time it was in IMAX 3D and the last time I had been to the IMAX was in 4th grade on a class field trip. I know what you are thinking, ""You mean to tell us you didn't see The Dark Knight or Avatar at the IMAX?!"" Well, no. But, I hear you and those are on my list of shame, along with never seeing the Indiana Jones films. Jeez, I heard you gasp through the computer. Now, after basically destroying my reviewing credibility, I will try to redeem myself.<br/><br/>The best thing that I overlooked the first time I saw this film was the score. The music in this film takes the audience on such an emotional journey that if you pay attention to it, it will enhance the overall experience. I think the brilliance in the score is that it's very subtle. It's not constantly bashing us with a theme over and over again.<br/><br/>One of the things that I believe swayed my first review was my view as Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man. For some reason, I could not picture him playing the part and while I am still not completely sold on Garfield for the role of Peter Parker or as the Lizard says with great alliteration, ""Poor Peter Parker"", I do believe he is a great Spider-Man. His voice is perfect; he sounds like the Saturday morning cartoon. So, after finally giving Garfield a chance, I will say that he is better than I originally gave him credit for.<br/><br/>Since I did see it in IMAX 3D with my great friend over at The Brew (you can check out his review here), I feel an obligation to comment on it even if it's the same story with the 3D. If you are watching an action sequence it's very difficult to follow and often blurry at times. However, when the 3D is used right, for depth and landscapes, it's extremely effective, especially on a screen as large as an IMAX. There are sometimes, though, when Spider-Man looks very glossy. That's not something I noticed in normal 2D.<br/><br/>After reading many other reviews that say how poor or cheap the Lizard looks, I'm still not buying it. I think he looks good. The detail on his scales very textured and his facial expressions are priceless. During this second screening, some of the audience was actually chuckling at the Lizard. But, I think it was a good execution.<br/><br/>One thing that did bug me was the misleading marketing campaign where the audience was supposed to get the untold story of Spider-Man. That never happened.<br/><br/>But overall, after watching The Amazing Spider-Man for a second time at a different venue and with most of my preconceived notions gone, it was an excellent film. I think I knew that all along and just didn't want to say it.<br/><br/>So this time I will give it a<br/><br/>9.0 out of 10<br/><br/>""Crooooooooootch!""<br/><br/>O, and Emma Stone is still hot."

Not really a huge comic book fan, but from time to time, I have been keeping up to date with the various teaser trailers, and know enough to keep me wanting to see it.<br/><br/>I did, and, to be honest, I was slightly disappointed by the lack of action. Don't get me wrong. By itself, this movie is great, visually, as well as story-wise. However, with the last Spiderman done just 5 years ago, one can't help but make comparisons between this movie and its predecessors. And this is where the movie falls short. I expected really more bone crunching action from this Spiderman. After all, the villain is another wall crawler with amazing powers of recovery, ie, he can't be hurt! Rather than having an intense action sequence, the director chose to have action interspersed throughout the movie in bits.<br/><br/>But, despite my little gripe, this is a spectacular movie. The star of the show is Rhys Ifans, who gave a 101% performance, balancing between the rational and the maniacal. This is great acting, and you can't learn it."
"TravS94","8","0","1","13 July 2012"," Does He Deserve The Name ""Amazing""?
","*Review Contains Spoilers* <br/><br/>PLOT: Peter Parker has been bitten by a radioactive spider which gives him wall crawling abilities, acrobatic skills, and a ""spider"" sense. With the help of web shooters he invented, he becomes ""Spider-Man"". As all this is going on a scientist at Oscorp named Curt Conners finds a way to grow back his missing arm.In the process however, he becomes a giant human-like lizard and begins terrorizing New York. Can Spider-Man stop him before he succeeds in his plan to turn the majority of New Yorkers into giant lizards?<br/><br/>MY THOUGHTS: The Spider-Man in this movie, I find, is a little more dimmed down than he was in previous films. I didn't like how he would tear up as much as he did because it to me he seemed like a wimp. Several scenes in this movie didn't need to be there or could have been done better and different. I disliked the scene where he trains himself (his wall crawling) while he is skateboarding and doing ollies all over the place. It just didn't seem right. I did like it however that the film was more ""current"" with Parker using the internet and his phone because you could connect with it more.<br/><br/>Even though it is a new series of movies, I don't think the origin needed to be in it, or if it was, not make it take as long as it did. Don't get me wrong, It was cool to watch a different take on it, but it was boring because we have seen it many times again and again.<br/><br/>The main villain, The Lizard, was good for the most part and looked pretty cool. However, I would have like to see a more lizard like face with a longer nose as well as see him in a lab coat like in the comics. The Lizard was not done as well as Doctor Octopus or the Green Goblin for that matter. Needless to say, he did wear the lab coat in two scenes, but, it was ripped off him both times in just a few seconds.<br/><br/>PROS / CONS: It is good to see a new look on the character of Spider-Man as well as be given a newer origin story. His suit was alright, not as good as the previous one, but still alright. The Lizard was done well with just a few nitpicks like the nose and the fact that he didn't have his signature lab coat. The main problems though are almost all associated with the Spider-Man. He was whiny, his suit was passable, and his skateboarding was just out of place.<br/><br/>OVERALL: 7/10"
"bnjmn","7","0","2","12 July 2012"," Very good characterization, but off at other points
","First off I gotta say that I liked this version of Spidey better than the Raimi movies, although they could've done a lot better. It seems like nobody's really able to get it THE right way, but then again, what comic adaption can provide that (I mean, not even Nolan's Batman movies are what I would consider THE right way).<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the buildup of The Amazing Spider-Man, they took their time introducing all the characters and developing the story, but the problem with retelling an origin story is - wait for it - that it has already been told (duh). So you got to change it as much as not to be repetitive and not too much to be able to stay true to the original. The outcome then is basically the same motives and action with just the outer story elements changed slightly. You could really see how they, at some points, desperately tried to avoid to sound too much the same as Raimi's Spider-Man; take for example the scene where Uncle Ben dies: I think they already did a great job telling it in the previous Spider-Man movies, so this just seemed a little bit like a worse version.<br/><br/>Although I thought the cast was very I good, I couldn't quite fit Emma Stone in the character of Gwen Stacy at first, but in the end I couldn't deny that she was a superb choice. Unlike Andrew Garfield, who was an as good - if not to say better - Peter Parker/Spidey than Toby Maguire. I could've used a bit more wise-cracking from Spidey (yeah, the car thief joke was good, but apart from that...). He even managed to do a better job in ripping his mask of at every opportunity... I mean, seriously guys, you just overdid it there, after the second time it was just plain ridiculous.<br/><br/>Speaking of masks the suit looked cool in its own way, but I would've gone with a more comic-like look. In making it look more ""dark"" and ""realistic"" the designers managed to actually make it look less realistic, because which teenager can sew this suit on his own? Regular spandex would've been more realistic, but okay, that's a problem every superhero with a costume has, I guess. Overall I think they overdid it a little with wanting the movie a darker and more adult look, it all seemed a bit forced.<br/><br/>Nonetheless they mostly managed to stick to the comics where it made sense (I couldn't stand watching Toby Maguire swinging through town without having to use webshooters) and thus generated the right atmosphere to have fun with this movie. The Lizard was the right choice for a villain, even if by his look he appeared to be more of a bad Killer Croc rip-off than a lizard (by the way I liked how they let him wear a scientists cloak at two points as a homage to the comic's version). Another thing that just personally bothered me with this version of the Dr. Connors/Lizard is that he's not depicted as this Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde kind of character, but rather as a bad person overall after injecting the serum, but people not that familiar with the original character may not be concerned with this.<br/><br/>Writing was slightly off at some points, meaning things were made too easy for the characters with obvious clues (i.e. lizards crawling towards New York sewers; ""Property of Peter Parker"") and also everything came across just a whit too interconnected and planned out, but that was just in the back of my head when watching the movie.<br/><br/>I don't know who they hired for the score of The Amazing Spider-Man and I honestly couldn't care less for his name, but I just hope they won't give him another job. Because the music in this movie was just too damn average, if not to say awful in some scenes. I mean, Spidey fighting the Lizard in school to crappy epic/heroic skirmish... what were they thinking? All in all I guess the reboot is enjoyable not only for fans of the comic, but also for the casual movie-goer. I for my part had a lot of fun during it. Storytelling concerning Peter's background was very good and you could really feel for the characters. Overall they did a lot of things right, but it definitely needs a little polish around the edges. I hope they will solve some problems with the sequel (especially introducing some of the typical Spidey characters). I'm looking forward to it."

","Yes, it was abundantly clear throughout the movie which company bankrolled much of the production ;) <br/><br/>Anyway, smashing movie and considerably better than I was expecting! When I saw the trailer for this about a month ago, my first thought was ""They're remaking it already?"" Having now seen the movie, it's not really a remake... more of a great reboot.<br/><br/>In my personal opinion, Garfield is a far better, really likable and downright more fun Peter Parker (not that Maguire wasn't any good). His goofy character was entertaining and certainly added a few stars to the rating. The casting crew did a great job when they selected him and did themselves proud with the rest of the cast as well.<br/><br/>I was also delighted that the writers focused more on the character development and did not rely exclusively on neat CGI tricks (something that many movies of late cannot claim to have achieved). The plot was fairly basic and was guilty of the odd Hollywood cliché, but was enjoyable enough, easy to follow and complimented the characters well.<br/><br/>Emma Stone was an ideal love interest. She was delightful and had just the right amount of screen time (as did most of the cast), as not to detract from Garfield's story. The chemistry was believable and appeared genuine.<br/><br/>The CGI was really solid and they tried some new techniques to differentiate the movie from the 2002 original. There are some great sequences where we see the world from Spider-man's point of view, as he swings around mid-town. It gives you an appreciation of his incredible abilities and how just how fast he moves.<br/><br/>It really doesn't matter if you're a comic book fan or not, this is a great wee film and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone.<br/><br/>Now... I'm off to buy a Sony Xperia. ;)"
"inner_val_117","8","0","3","10 July 2012"," Sam Raimi's version is still better. (Contains Spoilers)
","Rebooting the superhero movie that has been so familiar is exceedingly risky. ""With great power, comes great responsibility"" was the main theme of the first film while the new one tells about having the ability to be committed to your responsibilities. These lessons kind of stayed with you after every film. Seriously, the first has more impact for me than the latter.<br/><br/>The new Peter here is a genius with ability to solve equations and invent cool stuffs instantly yet in school seems to be an average guy. He got his powers the same way Tobey had it then. Tobey had MJ, Andrew has Gwen.<br/><br/>In the case of storytelling, the first film did a very solid way of connecting the dots while TAS forgets how to bring the puzzles back together. It's hard to explain how I never seem to appreciate his life story here. I was never rooting from him. It's like he's not fighting for a really worthy cause. Tobey's reason to protect his loved ones has become his driving force, while Andrew's aim to kill the Lizard has no sense of passion in it. Tobey saves lives because of his Uncle's resounding last words, while Andrew's reason to be a hero isn't that clear here.<br/><br/>The first film tackled friendship while the new one didn't, while the romance is kinda more expressed well by Andrew and Emma than by Tobey and Kirsten. TAS tried to be emotional and serious, which made it, I think, unfit for a superhero film. It has its emotional tearjerker moments where the actors really pulled it off better than the original.<br/><br/>The Lizard is scarier than Green Goblin but is less dangerous. Green Goblin's bombs kill dozens while the Lizard is only after his agenda to make everybody looks like him, a lizard. GG wants power, L wants equality. GG's son, which is Pete's best friend, has even made the story even more interesting for the first film while Lizard's connection to Pete's original father wasn't so special here. The director could have pulled a more villain concept of the Lizard.<br/><br/>The web actions in TAS are fantastic! It's as if you're with Spiderman in every jump he makes. But the fight scenes between him and Lizard weren't satisfying. He never had enough bruises the way a hero should have. In the former films, I like the Spiderman 2, with Peter fighting Dr Octopus' scenes, than him stopping Green Goblin in part 1.<br/><br/>All in all, TAS was never better than Spiderman, but is equaled with X-Men First Class. It tries to be Dark Knight but failed to give enough dark moods in it. The comical antics is a bit funny but not as funny as the first film and Avengers. Andrew and Emma did well!"

","Not so amazing but as you get over the first 30 minutes bore of, ""I have seen this before"" you get sucked in to the fun and the bumpy drive of Spidy getting started.<br/><br/>The movie to me is more of a money making franchise and a keep the character right scheme than a plan to entertain. But if I look at what is being dished out this year some movies have been more on a making money agenda than entertaining.<br/><br/>Sony debunked the Spider-Man 4 idea, maybe because of cast or could it be because the story will cost too much to be made. The trio of Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and Sam Raimi (as director) has been replaced with Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone and Marc Webb (as director). Now Emma Stone plays Gwen Stacy in this flick and I figured we got an intro to our new Mary J. Watson.<br/><br/>Sony decided to reboot the Spidy series with Garfield as Peter Parker / Spiderman. The movie goes back a little as we get to see Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) and with Connors comes the ""The Lizard"" something I was eager to see and I have to give credit to the CGI as the Lizard had a lot of close ups and still looked good.<br/><br/>A little change in things concerning the web slinger and some more addition in story that was never there before, that is why the 30 minutes intro will make you feel, ""what the heck!"" Another thing I have to give credit to the director for is the well-choreographed introduction to the web slinger's powers. He discovered his power in a train that led to a series of accidents that saw him beat guys up, and kept apologizing each time.<br/><br/>Unlike the conventional shy and laid back Parker of Maguire, Garfield's Parker is a little sly and dark and wears a hood as much times as possible.<br/><br/>He is left behind by his parents and his father could be alive, as Dr. Connors somehow knew him.<br/><br/>Conventionally we know the story; Peter leaves with Uncle Ben and Aunt May, he gets beaten by a radioactive spider and voila! But here Peter actually disobeys rules and sneaks into the lab where he got beaten, and after Ben was gone we get to see a dark Parker walking around in a hood.<br/><br/>Then when the director got bored I guess he throws down the hood, puts aside the revenge persona and changed into a hero.<br/><br/>And as usual Dr Connors was trying to grow back his hand which led to ""The Lizard"", he then decides to turn the whole city into creatures like him and then he was stopped by our hero.<br/><br/>Was Marc Webb better than Raimi as the director? Well wouldn't say so because Webb had to make me like what I have seen before, and in a way he did.<br/><br/>Was Garfield better that Maguire? That I will live for you to point out yourself and you can then tell me what you think.<br/><br/>But the movie is not a total waste, but it is an obvious unnecessary but I still say go see it."

This is a superhero movie not a chick flick.. few lovey dovey..scenes were totally unnecessary....ina movie of 2.5 hours there where barely half an hour of action scenes...there was a moment when I forgot I was watching spiderman...okay enough with the negativity let's sere the positive aspects..... some 3d scenes were mind blowing but there weren't enough of them....the story was much more realistic than the previous franchise....because it showed peter parker just an average man..with extra ordinary abilities..and the technologically more realistic...however there tad excess emotional drama in some scenes there was total absence in some important ones ...not to mention it also managed to pull out some laughs.... so all in all if you are looking for a emotional and mind stirring superhero movie....see how absurd it sounds...then go see it our of u have a3d TV at home I recommend u watch out on bluray.."

","It all started in 2002 with the 'Spiderman'. The movie was very well received by the viewers and the critics. But, then came 'Spiderman 2' a more funnier sequel to the first. We then expected that third will suffice to our expectations. Unfortunately, that never happened. At that moment I realized that there was a need for a reboot with a better way of story telling. However, guys at Sony Pictures realized it much later and that too when they fear losing the franchise.<br/><br/>Marc Webb, aptly chosen name for the new franchise then came into existence. He promised us with the trailers that something 'untold' will be served. So, I went up straight to the theater to see what was 'untold'. Well, the way I see there's nothing new in it. But I hope that loose strings will get attached in 2014. The direction is below par especially if you have liked '500 Days of Summer' earlier. The pacing of the scenes are very fast. There's hardly a time given when you realize that 'Oh! Peter Parker is now a Spiderman. But that's natural if you know and often watch a documentary. But wait this ain't a documentary.<br/><br/>As a movie its still not amazing for me but from a comic book adaption, it does its job well. The way we have read and adored Peter Parker is all natural in this movie. The quick and witty jokes are adequately placed in the scenes. For me, this would be the actual adaptation of the character 'Peter Parker' up till now. But the 'Spiderman' is still to be explored.<br/><br/>Now, I personally don't need a reboot in 2022 and would rather expect a more mature direction from Webb in 2014. As a Nolan's fan, I hope this expectation is natural. <br/><br/>For the note I would request all viewers to wait up till the movie credits end, you may get an idea for the loose strings that I mentioned earlier. And if you want anything close to the word 'Amazing', it has to be 3D."
"rohit-k","3","0","4","7 July 2012"," The amazingly ""one dimensional"" spider man
","Being a die hard fan of spider man ever since the comic book, my expectations were pretty stratospheric to be honest. The fairly newbie director Marc Webb managed to float the idea of brand new, snazzy looking reboot of a franchise which has like any other superhero franchise a loyal legion of fans, but does he deliver which is point of debate. Ever since the promotion of the movie had started introducing the cast and the preproduction it portrayed a picture of generation ahead of Sam Raimi's series. Going into the actual movie it does have the high-octane action sequences and endearing uncle-nephew sentiments which spidey series has been famous for, smashed in are the comic capers of peter parker portrayed by Andrew Garfield quite convincingly, Who brings down the nuances of a troubled teenager and a witty athletic superhero to the T. His portrayal of peter parker as a confused yet determined teenager seems more convincing than Tobey Maguire's in the earlier movies. Like the basketball court scene where he wrecks down the basket leaving everybody around gasping, or the scene in the subway where he unintentionally beats up couple of citizens and nearly molests a lady due to his suddenly developed ""spider-sense"" and heightened reflexes. Performance by Emma Stone as Gwendolyn Stacy shows she can emote on cue beautifully like the scene where she confronts peter at his home after her father's death. Sally field and Martin sheen were as expected from the veterans a class apart. All these characters lend to the movie the perfect combination for a great superhero movie but the script which can hold them together has to be equally strong. Expected are the points with the twists which rattle you up and you think the movie is building momentum but it again slows down like a roller-coaster going uphill, It vexes you to see the continuous high and low in the pace of the storyline which are NOT the makings a great superhero movie. For every scene which goes by you think couldn't it have been tweaked to make it maybe a little bit more funnier little bit more hard-hitting. In every spider man saga we have heard of the nemesis was a close acquaintance of peter parker, which makes it even more hard for spider man to encounter, Rhys Ifans as the disturbed scientist and the surprisingly clever Lizard keep you at the edge of your seat and spider man on his toes. In a attempt to ""be different"" from from the earlier movies the movie throws some light on untouched aspects of peter's past life like his parents and their mysterious disappearance, they had also decided that peter will be throwing synthetic webs which he shoots from his watch/web thrower unlike in the earlier movies where spidey's web was bio secreted.<br/><br/>The cinematography of John Schwartzman like his previous works on movies like pearl harbor, Armageddon suits the tone of the movie. The mood set by Schwartzman compliment the movie in each aspect. Of course the movie was taut in all the technical aspects including the amazing visuals. I feel i should talk more on the visuals. On the whole the movie moved quite one dimensionally and left the audience wishing for much more. Hope Marc spins a better Webb for his script and treatment of the next spider man movie if the production house intends to keep him."
"Troy_Campbell","7","0","4","6 July 2012"," Worthy franchise starter.
","Everyone whinged like spoilt brats when Sony announced it was rebooting Spider-Man only 5 years after the Sam Raimi trilogy was completed. Those sooks need to eat their words: Marc Webb's film is a worthy franchise starter and one which is darker and more akin to the comics than the previous movies, without relinquishing the unbridled blockbuster fun that is synonymous with the webslinger. It's not remotely close to perfect – in fact it has a few notable flaws which stop it from surpassing Raimi's second instalment as the best Spidey flick yet – but what it lacks in a decent villain and a tightly wound narrative, it makes up for with superb central performances, great character development and some breathtaking action set-pieces that prove 3D can be used wisely. Easily the finest enhancement though is the leading duo of Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, playing Peter Parker and Gwen Stacey respectively. They nail the late-teen way of interaction and share a marvellous chemistry that keeps the picture afloat during a few of the duller patches the bloated runtime produces. We all know that there will be a sequel, the question is, can it elevate this new series into more memorable territory?"
"rattdpp","8","0","3","6 July 2012"," Different take - but still Spidey
","It took me a while to get used to the new cast, Especially Sally Fields because she doesn't look like the typical older than dirt Aunt May, but they all seemed much more natural in their roles than the previous movies. The acting was top notch putting the heart and soul into the story. Some changes were a bit weak - like the death of Uncle Ben, but I can see them not wanting to have to repeat the whole wrestling thing, so it didn't detract too, too much for me. Sheen was terrific in the part, but I also was waiting for him to say ""With great power comes great responsibility"" <br/><br/>I really liked the new moves Spider-man did, and the different ways he used the webbing. Garfield was great with the jokes - that was sorely missing from all the Raimi movies - the snappy patter is an important part of Spider-man's actions - not only does it get the ire of many villains so they make mistakes - but like Spidey said, If he didn't crack jokes in the middle of danger, he'd probably cry. I also liked seeing the web shooters return - I always thought that was a bad decision in the last set of movies to make them ""organic"", because if they were natural - logically, they wouldn't be shooting from his wrists, and he'd be swinging through the city by his butt.<br/><br/>The Lizard looked different - but I can understand why, and it made sense because he's a hybrid - not a true lizard. I hear some people complaining about unresolved story threads, but perhaps they will be addressed in a sequel.<br/><br/>I really had a good time at the movies seeing this, and would like Webb to return for the sequel. Good movie."
"prameetkumar","7","0","3","5 July 2012"," 'The Amazing Spider-Man' (2012) vs. 'Spider-Man' (2002)
","It is a truth universally acknowledged that the best superhero story is an origin story. Comic books can get complicated, with too many villains and alternate universes to keep track of. The stories everyone remembers are the simple ones. Superman was sent to earth just before his home planet of Krypton was destroyed. Bruce Wayne's parents were killed by a mugger, and he used his wealth to transform himself into Batman. Peter Parker was bitten by a radioactive spider and became Spider-Man after his uncle was murdered.<br/><br/>'The Amazing Spider-Man' is a fine origin story. Marc Webb does a good job of telling the tale. Andrew Garfield makes a convincing Peter Parker. The problem, though, is that we were told this story just a decade ago. Not enough time has passed for it to be retold.<br/><br/>I went into the movie trying not to compare Sam Raimi's 2002 'Spider- Man' with Webb's reboot. I soon realized the task would be impossible.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire (2002) as Peter Parker had a more natural and believable progression into the role of Spider-Man than Garfield (2012) had. This wasn't a fault of Garfield or a credit to Maguire, but a failing of the new script.<br/><br/>The succinct words of Cliff Robertson (2002) as Uncle Ben -- 'With great power comes great responsibility' -- had much more of an impact than those of Martin Sheen (2012) -- ""If you have the ability to do some good in this world, you have a moral obligation to do so.""<br/><br/>J.K. Simmons (2002) as J. Jonah Jameson was a much more memorable supporting character than Denis Leary (2012) as Captain Stacy.<br/><br/>Even the typical scene of New York solidarity was done better in the older film. Someone in a crowd of New Yorkers shouting, ""You mess with Spidey, you mess with New York! You mess with one of us, you mess with all of us!"" (2002) was more touching than a group of crane operators who aligned their machines to provide Spider-Man with a path to swing through the city in the climax (2012).<br/><br/>The only thing that was undeniably better in the new film was the addition of Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy. Stone is an amazing actress who simply lit up every scene she was in.<br/><br/>Garfield did his best; indeed, he makes a great Peter Parker. And Webb did his best; 'The Amazing Spider-Man' is a great origin story.<br/><br/>But we had a slightly better one just ten years ago."
"IamJeffHolt","6","0","3","5 July 2012"," If you want to....we can change.
","First if I may I would like to give you a good review over this film on both film and story wise. Both good and bad. <br/><br/>Fist i will start with the bad. <br/><br/>It was completely un-original. Now is that a bad thing. No not even a little bit. At least we know what to expect when we go into watch this film. But that in itself speaks for itself. We do need to come up with better ways to tell this story especially if we are going to reboot it every 5 years or so. Story line. Boy is in high school. Boy meets blonde, boy falls in love. boy gets a power, finds responsibility, has to grow up quickly. We have a good guy and a bad guy, with not a whole lot in between. Even the dad story is very vague. (However I do realize they will prolly make 7 of these movies. so that story will hopefully come later.) It was creepy predictable and anybody that knows anything about film was going to guess what was going to happen next and you knew that the stuff he was going to have to face through out the story. And even borrowed lines from not only previous Spiderman movies but other comic book movies as well. So we can't help but wonder why they couldn't come up with a story line that is somewhat original and needed to find a way to see the difference of old spidy and new spidy. Film wise. They had a bunch of mistakes that involved bad direction or just plain Ole forgetting backpacks, where your hand is placed on a cup when cut to a new angle. So needless to say the editing was not good when it came to jump cuts. Through out I counted a total of 8 out of focus shots and I know enuff to know when they are on purpose for effect. but when you have a pivot swing from a crane shot you have to do well enuff job to see you will go out of focus. Sure enuff. Now I know an amateur like myself won't even come close to being able to pull off that shot but I do expect them too. I absolutely hated the ending. Especially with the cranes and once you see it you will know what I am talking about. I do not like the bad guy story line. Its too simple and not good. And it ends awkwardly. We don't get enuff of the Aunt and Uncle in my opinion. We see them enuff to give them some good wisdom points to Peter but that is it. <br/><br/>So because of those things I would of given it a 4 out of 10. <br/><br/>But here is the good. <br/><br/>When it comes to the story I did enjoy the fact they finally touched on the parents. We have missed out on so much not knowing anything about the parents. What little we find out about them we finally see them. So I hope we see them come up more in the next few movies. Villain wise, we finally see a character that didn't just come out of no where. We see emotion and character. However not good, its finally good enuff to see on the screen to care about to follow along with his story. The idea to make his own webbing was cool. However originally that was apart of his powers when he was bitten. They just don't give it to him. But it is different. However brief it was I do like the Sally Field and Martin Sheen as the Aunt and Uncle and I love them as actors and they did such an amazing job. Which leads me into my next thought. The cast did a really good job. Andrew Garfield is a better spiderman and I have a small crush on Emma Stone so this was good to see her with blonde hair. The idea of bringing in Gwen instead of M.J. was better and if I am not mistaken, accurate to the comic book. (I haven't read spidy adventures. sorry fans) But I believe that is correct. Sorry if i am not. Editing from this aspect was really well done. There wasn't those awkward transitions, a little darker filter, and the last movement through New York, there is a shot that is slowed way down and it is absolutely fabulous. I can't stress that enuff how amazed I was when the frame rates went way down and it was the best shot in the entire movie. Major props to the editing crew Alan Edward Bell, Michael McCusker, Pietro Scalia for doing that move. The special effects in this movie were tons better. I can't express enuff how much better they were in this film. The score was good as well. Enticing and kept you interested in the action. Towards the end there is a scene where they use hard piano chords and it was great. I loved it. That was perfect <br/><br/>The director left big gaping holes in the story, but, we do have many more to come. One thing I do want to give him credit. The idea of Spidy/Peter Parker, finally, having wounds. He doesn't get hit and is miraculously healed instantly. He is bloodied up and bruised. And finally someone noticed it. <br/><br/>All of this is what made me give it a 6 out of 10 stars. It was good, could of been better. But it is a good start for something to be rebooted. Even tho it was just like the other movies. But still good to watch in theaters. <br/><br/>(I do want to apologize to all those who made it through this review and caught all of my mistakes grammar wise. I am not the best.)"
"Schnayblay","5","0","3","5 July 2012"," A Very Enjoyable Superhero Film, But Several Major Things Handled Terribly Detract From It
","""The Amazing Spider-Man"" had many people skeptical from day one. A reboot of a franchise that'd only been absent five years, redoing the origin story, and just a way for Sony to keep the rights to the character from reverting back to Marvel. But as more and more news came in about the project, I became more and more hopeful. I was hoping that with the excellence of recent superhero films like ""Iron Man"", that ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" would join the list of critically-acclaimed and commercially phenomenal adaptations that fans and mainstream audiences would love. Sadly, we got our hopes too high.<br/><br/>""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a retelling of the origin story. Peter Parker's parents mysteriously vanished when he was just a boy. Now, Peter is a teenager and while looking into his parents past is bitten by an experimental spider, giving him newfound abilities. Peter also meets Dr. Curt Connors, an ex-partner of Peter's father who is trying to regrow his arm by splicing the DNA of lizards into other animals. When Connors loses his patience, he injects himself with an untested serum and becomes the the Lizard. Now, Peter must stop what he is partially responsible for and become the hero he is destined to be. If I went into every little detail about just the first hour of story in this movie, the whole review could be taken up by just the synopsis. When you're watching the movie though, they go through all of this really fast and it doesn't feel rushed, it's just expertly written.<br/><br/>One of the reasons I did not enjoy certain aspects of this movie is first of all, the two main plot lines the marketing for this film pushed to be the molding of Peter Parker into a hero are dropped. After about 45 minutes, Peter stops looking for clues into his parents past. And about 20 minutes after Peter becomes Spider-Man, he stops looking for Uncle Ben's killer. Both of these plot lines have potential for strong emotion and character development, but they're forgotten and hardly mentioned ever again. Just like in ""Spider-Man 3"", it feels like there were several sub-plots thought of for this movie, and instead of picking just one, the writers threw them all in. That's not to say that like ""Spider-Man 3"", it feels like there's too much going on in this movie. It never feels like there is too much, but just the right amount of other things going on besides just Spider-Man vs. the Lizard. What I mean is that all the sub-plots were used fine, but two of them were just dropped suddenly. And that really bothered me.<br/><br/>Now the acting in this film was great. Looking back, I now see how poor a casting choice Toby Maguire was in the Sam Raimi trilogy. I grew up watching the Raimi trilogy, and as a kid I never questioned it. But now looking at Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man in comparison to Toby Maguire's Spider-Man is pointless. They're just completely different. And not just with Spider-Man, but with Peter Parker too. Toby Maguire's Peter Parker was very cliché in that he's ridiculously smart, he's awkward, and he wears nice shirts and glasses. Whereas Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker was very modern. He rides a skateboard, he dresses like a hipster, he wears contacts, but he's deceivingly brilliant. He's just like that quiet smart kid that hardly talks and sits in the back of your class. He's extremely likable and funny and you relate to the guy so much. Everything his character does is what a normal teenager would do if given the powers that Peter has. I could never relate to Maguire's Peter Parker, but now we have Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker, and he is awesome.<br/><br/>Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy was nothing more than Emma Stone's usual amazing performance. She's very natural, very funny, but can also carry herself emotionally. You can't help but love her character and you care for her. When I love an actress that much, that means that she never lets me down when she portrays a character and I always love that character. Emma Stone does that. That's something that no matter how hard they tried, I couldn't do with Mary Jane in the Raimi films. Whenever she was captured, I just always thought ""well here goes Spidey to save cliché superhero girlfriend #25"". Thankfully, someone else thought that too.<br/><br/>Rhys Ifans as Dr. Curt Connors was so cliché in my opinion, it was ridiculous. I never felt sorry for his character and I never cared whether he lived or died. He is such a stereotype scientist it drives me insane. The Lizard talks, which I didn't expect. And you could've blamed all his actions up to this point on the Lizard like a Jekyll/Hyde scenario, but once he talks, you realize that Connors is actually in control and has just turned evil for no reason. Towards the end of the movie, his evil plot is to morph the entire city of New York into Lizard people. And you're really wondering how a guy with an insane IQ like Connors thinks that turning everyone into monstrous killing machines will fix humanity. It doesn't make sense to me at all, especially since Connors is in control as the Lizard and he can still utilize his intelligence.<br/><br/>You probably think I hate this movie. I didn't at all, actually it was really enjoyable. But I can't help nitpick this movie because I was really excited to see it. Whether or not I'm to blame for setting my expectations too high, or the writers are for not paying attention to certain aspects, I would still buy ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" on Blu-Ray for $15 maximum. It's a good movie, and I'm sure on repeated viewings I'd enjoy it a lot more, but as it stands right now, it didn't satisfy what I was looking for."

The only things that will make it perhaps a bit better to some are its leads. Andrew Garfield is a great choice to play the character, and having Gwen Stacy as his love interest seems to have fans happier than they were before, with Emma Stone doing a decent job. Altogether the romance here is sweeter, funnier and more believable. But is that really what people wanted from a ""Spiderman"" reboot? The Biggest complaints I heard about the original trilogy were that they were too soppy. And it looks like instead off getting away from that here, they are going to delve even further into it in this new series.<br/><br/>So they've improved it where it didn't need improved. The Story desperately tries to retell the origins as differently as possible, but it still turns out as overly familiar. There's some decent action, but you'll be waiting a while (We have to get through the whole origin story again remember) and the villain is OK but could off been done way better. Just like the villain in the original ""Spiderman"" film then?<br/><br/>What I think saves ""The Amazing Spiderman"" though is it's sense off humour. Its pretty funny, and you can tell there's a lot off effort been put into making it what it is. Even though I still can't get over the feeling that they've restarted the series way too early. If they'd just made ""Spiderman 4"" with different actors it would off probably had the same effect. When I heard a kid saying ""they ignored the other movies"" on the way out. I knew I still wasn't alone in thinking this."

","I'm not going to be the only one admitting this but I went into this movie expecting the worst. I've been a Spider-Man fan as long as I can remember and though Raimi's series certainly had its flaws it was pretty damn solid, though it certainly ended on the weakest note. Each trailer for The Amazing Spider-Man made my expectations sink a little lower, they play it as a conspiracy plot about Oscorp and Peter's parents and in my opinion they made Peter out to be a punk whose wise- cracking was just a little too mean-spirited for my taste.<br/><br/>Fortunately the movie is not simply a trailer but a full length film that fills out far more nicely than the trailer lets on. The conspiracy plot is there of course but it is a layer underneath the whole movie rather than the focus of the film. I was glad they kept his parents and their disappearance somewhat ambiguous only hinting at their possible fates rather than forcing the conspiracy into the forefront of the plot.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield does a decent job as Parker, though at times you can feel his accent coming through. The biggest improvement over Raimi's series is the romance. Dunst and MacGuire always felt like a stale bland cookie-cutter romance, but here there is an earnestness and many of the sequences where Gwen and Peter flirt feel improvisational and unscripted. Peter stumbles over his words and struggles to form a coherent sentence while Gwen's eyes do all the talking. Emma Stone out acts most of the cast, but maybe I'm biased by being wildly attracted to her.<br/><br/>The origin story aspect of the film does feel a bit rushed and the plot overall tends to be one of convenient coincidences as though set up to save the writers time in telling a more in-depth story. For one Gwen happens to be a high school student interning at Oscorp, where Doctor Connors (The Lizard and film's main villain) is her mentor and also the only link Peter has to his parents. Oscorp just so happens to be the place that has manufactured the spider that will fatefully bite Peter. Despite being in high school Peter is such a genius that with only some cursory internet research and a few books to read he manages to crack the secret to a formula that Doctor Connors has been working on for more than a decade. This leaves us with a rather one-dimensional story rather than the web of conspiracy that seems promised in the trailer.<br/><br/>All in all though the plot is serviceable, not Amazing or Spectacular but good enough, C plus . The earnest moments of Gwen and Peter forming their romantic bond all while Peter learns to control his powers and use them for good instead of revenge works well. I feel like some movie fans will be bored though, like Raimi's films there are a lot of character moments, between Uncle Ben Aunt May and Peter, between Gwen and Peter, etc and the action sequences are few and far between. <br/><br/>There is a real feeling that Peter is growing as a person as well, moving from Geek, to Jerk, to beginning to understand what Uncle Ben meant by responsibility and moral obligation. The character arc is somewhat subtle to be sure but it's definitely there.<br/><br/>Now I have to do the obligatory comments on the new suit and the Lizard design. Quick capsule review: The Lizard looks TERRIBLE, the suit I can live with. Thing about Garfield is he is thin and this gives Spider-Man a very agile appearance and feel which Tobey simply didn't have. Special attention is paid to the webslinging and free-running Spider-Man does, rather then in the comics where his web seems to be disappearing into thin sky there is a more realistic approach dedicated to the idea that Spidey HAS TO be swinging off of something. He can't perform that endless floating rope trick we've seen in cartoons and just swing off of the clouds.<br/><br/>The Lizard, as I said, looks terrible. Oh don't get me wrong the CGI is perfectly fine down the last scale, it's simply such a terrible character design that I was glad they didn't focus on his face too much. It's really the face that does in the Lizard, he has this stupid half- grin plastered across what is a far-too-human face. I know in the original comics, at least at first, he didn't look all that fierce or convincing but this is 2012, surely they knew this looked stupid and if not the guys who chose the design than the animators working on it had to know.<br/><br/>Despite the ugly villain design the film still works overall with enough humor, enough romance and enough action to keep you interested. It's not perfect, FAR FROM IT, and I still feel like Raimi's original 2002 film is still a better Spider-Man movie. I was expecting this to be a train- wreck, but like I said it was decent C+ material, you could do a lot worse. As much as I'd love to see Spidey's rights go to Marvel so he can be added to the Avengers I'm also kinda curious to see if they can improve on this in a sequel and hopefully actually deliver something Amazing, instead of just okay."

","Spoilers ahoy! No reason to give any back-story-details of the cast and crew (beyond their input in the Amazing Spider-man), as this review will be revealing things that anyone who has seen this movie should already know. Neither will I reiterate the Sam Raimi version, or even compare them to one another, as I firmly stand by that with all different incarnations of Spider-Man, while comparison is natural; it is also both unfair and irrational. But of course, I will render through the story arc to the best of my remembrance, and fully focus on the film at hand, whilst humbly apologizing for any incoherences that might appear. <br/><br/>I can't think of any superhero as personal as Spider-Man; by the start it was directly aimed towards its prime target of audience, mid-late adolescents, something that you're either in right now or can call back to (and if you're not quite there yet, the spectacular action-scenes will do). That's a dead given for any Spider-Man comic-book enthusiast, the basis that he lies on, making him a distinguishable character in the Marvel Universe. That, above anything, needs to be mentioned before anything else. <br/><br/>And to cut through the paper, this rendition of Spider-Man was, to me, quite overwhelming; as it had all of the properties of Spider-Man that I've ever wished to see all rolled into one. Spider-Man is about some degree of identity crisis, and he's exposed to his superpowers during his most personal struggling yet, and it is uncovering. He is championing through not only his adolescence, with hormones running wildly, but also his newly appearing powers. This was proposed to us in an extremely good pace. It was as if though he had taken a very long lasting drug, and it was something that adapted very well to the cinema. His powers were exhibited a little, piece by piece, and that's where the whole matter of relation comes in; we had a chance to take part of it, to actually want to be Spider-Man. <br/><br/>The drawbacks lie with how some scenes are performed. At times, it can be a little claustrophobic, for better or worse. It doesn't explore the Big Apple, but it shouldn't have to either; it's a personal story (with a near ending quote defining fiction with the simple, but oh so difficult question ""Who am I?""), where Peter Parker can come through, as a distraught teenager, in an introspective nature. It was somewhat stale, like watching a play, but the performances from the actors during these moments were incredible. And, where these claustrophobic moments were for the better, it explored some monster-movie elements, as we see a terrified Gwen Stacy hiding, while the Lizard is perpetuating his devious plot. <br/><br/>The Lizard is an interesting medium. It's not a villain in the basic sense that we imagine a villain. This is highlighted in ""the Amazing Spider-Man"", but not thoroughly; he is convinced with what he does as the Lizard, even when he is Curt Connors. There's a light connection to the Hulk here – Bruce Banner doesn't want to be the Hulk, just as Curt Connors doesn't want to be the Lizard, (in the common deviation of the Marvel Universe) – but here, Connors finds the superior physicality of ""the Lizard"" to be ""beautiful"" – and then, well put, as Lizard is enhanced with the intelligence of Curt Connors (whilst corrupted, an unusual trait), although, lacking the humanity and empathy that Curt Connors has. This appears to be a disaster for New York City. So, it upholds the drama.<br/><br/>And with all that being said, there's really not much that could add to it. All else is a great composition of music, effects, CGI, acting, editing, performance, and some small scenes I would love to just explain in detail but that has to be seen in its wholeness – (that could be Emma Stone's performance, that I think should be debated). Anyway, it's well worth your time and money, and it's a delightful experience, and I intend to see it again. 8/10."

","The Amazing Spider-Man: Enjoyable, albeit too familiar, action/adventure/fantasy deftly directed by Marc Webb. Darker, cooler, retread of the comic-book inspired Spider-Man origin story. Peter Parker, an awkwardly hyper-intelligent teen, dealing with abandonment issues, new-found powers (due to a radioactive spider bite) and trying to find his place in life while dealing with his feelings for Gwen Stacy, happens upon a formula (his father's), which could provide answers to the perplexed Dr. Curt Conners (his father's former colleague), and win him a place in the world of ideas. All goes terribly awry, however, when Dr. Conners begins human trials upon himself, motivated by corporate pressures, which turns him into a giant lethal lizard, with a giant reptilian complex to match.<br/><br/>Good performances by Andrew Garfield (as a more cerebral Peter Parker/Spider-Man) and Emma Stone (as love interest Gwen Stacy), the stand out being Rhys Ifans (as Dr. Curt Conners, the most interesting character by far) - led by an artful script (James Vanderbilt & Alvin Sargent), which hones in on darker, yet more believable characterizations than Sam Rami's 2002 Spider-Man.<br/><br/>Memorable action sequences, and excellent cinematography at times putting the viewer into Spidey P.O.V mode, which was a great touch.

"otongo3","8","0","3","5 July 2012"," NERDYFLIQ - Amazing Spiderman IMAX Film Review from a 90's Kid, Nerdy jock perspective.
","With this one coming so close after the other Spiderman it is hard not to compare the two. I tried to keep my blinders on but I realized that there is no way that I can accurately describe the movie to others that have seen the original movie from 2004. However I was a little let down because I really wanted to see #DonaldGloverForSpiderman. Hopefully someone will at least create the #MichaelCeraForShaft that we all want to see! Either way here is my breakdown of the movie. The plot was so extremely different that it served as an interesting twist. I don't want to spoil it so I'll just say the basics. It starts off earlier and builds the relationship between uncle Ben and Peter so you understand the depth of that relationship better. At the same time they glanced over his father's relationship that seemed odd because everything else was so well developed. I will let you make your own opinions on the rest of the plot but the way it started was a positive for me and let me get into The Amazing Spiderman's psyche a little better. The Amazing Spiderman is a nerd but he is not a geek. I think this was the major difference between the two movies. He is really smart in this movie and when he get's his powers he learns how to use them, practices, reads, studies and develops the webs himself. In the other Spiderman Peter was a straight punk that you hoped would win a fight. It didn't show the maturation process and he seemed like he got lucky with everything, and he always had an awkward situation with Mary Jane. In this one, he get's beat up early and doesn't have many friends but he still is pretty good at skateboarding and has a sense of humor. He also puts his game down tight with Gwen Stacy (they changed her name) and uses his powers to do cool stuff like skateboard tricks and dunk a basketball on the bully. The humor through the movie was dodgy, some parts were situationally funny, and sometimes the lines were good but for the most part I had an awkward want-to-laugh-but- they-cut-out-the-right-punchline-to-make-it-PG13 feeling. I am not the biggest fan of 3D because of the extreme fields of focus that it forces but they used it pretty well. The graphics and animation were seamless and I can honestly say they were top of the line and helped Spidey move in a realistic way. The cinematography was pretty good. I don't remember a lot of parts where I noticed and said, ""this is an amazing shot!"" but our level of expectation is so high right now, that is not a bad thing. Overall it was a good movie with a new version of plot and different character relationships. I think Toby McGuire was probably the best person to actually get the look down and the acting/casting wasn't perfect but they still delivered a good show. Spiderman was cooler, Emma Stone was hot, and graphics were dope. I recommend it and I would like to see the next in the series because I am not sold on ityet.

"bigcalkenobi","8","0","3","5 July 2012"," While treading familiar territory, The Amazing Spiderman manages to bring a fresh and more rounded take on the origin story of Spiderman
","In 2002 Sam Raimi launched the first Spiderman movie which along with 2000′s X-men pioneered the modern superhero genre. It has been 10 years since then and 5 years since the mostly disappointing Spiderman 3 hit theaters in 2007. In the years since 2007 The Dark Knight was released and Marvel launched a fleshed out multi-film universe; both of which have greatly influenced what is do-able in the genre. Sony is now rebooting the franchise by bringing in a new cast and director Marc Webb to put his own spin on the origin story of Peter Parker as Spiderman. Can this new take on Spiderman bring enough new things to the table to leave an impact or is this movie simply going through the motions?<br/><br/>Read the full review here: http://wp.me/p1tyJd-cO"
"mikeymcdo","7","0","4","5 July 2012"," Good film but it should have been called ""The Amazing Peter Parker""
","It is clear from the trailers that The Amazing Spiderman is cutting off all ties with the old silly Spiderman 3 with a new, more serious Spidey. Of course everyone will be comparing this to Sam Raimis take on the wall crawler so re-telling the origin story of the young college student Peter Parker needs to be fresh yet familiar. So does Spiderman swing to new heights or does it get washed away like a spider in the bath?<br/><br/>The Amazing Spiderman echoes the plot threads of Sam Raimis Spiderman with the origins of these unusual powers which Peter obtains and how peter recklessly uses them for selfish gain and then thanks to his Uncle Ben Peter atones his powers to become a hero rather than a vigilante. What Marc Webb emphasises in his version of Spiderman Peter Parkers struggles having mysteriously lost his parents, having a tough time at school and losing his uncle. This fleshes out Peter with the first act introducing the insight to the struggles he carries even before he becomes Spiderman. But in the few moments we see Peter in the iconic costume the film doesn't know what to do with its self and the film swings (if you would pardon the pun) from one story arc to another making everything feel less connected.<br/><br/>The performance from Andrew Garfield is defiantly the highlight of the film. I can't believe the guy is 28 years old he looks like a teenager so he pulls of the look as well as the portrayal of his introduction from a typical ruff day at school to worrying his aunt and uncle with his odd behaviour. Garfield conveys Peter similar to Maguire accept more restrained in his awkwardness and perhaps more timid which makes him a captivating brainy character who keeps himself to himself. One of my favourite scenes from the film which is in the 4 minute trailer is when Spiderman is saving a little boy and throws him his mask and says it would make him stronger this emphasises the humanity of Peter Parker and is a very suspenseful and touching scene. It's just a same there isn't more scenes where Spiderman is being Spiderman. Sally Field and Martin Sheen who play Peter's Aunt and Uncle are very versatile characters who play the kooky yet concerned guardians. Of course the same tragic events occur just like in the 2002 Spiderman accept with a rather different outcome.<br/><br/>Other performances, that leave less of an impact would be Emma Stone as the brainy Gwen Stacy. Her portrayal was nothing great nor nothing terrible it's just a little dull how there are breaks in the action for a scene about coco. The romance isn't as developed then the first Spiderman also and is blended in well with the other plot points in that movie. Rhys Ifans who plays Doctor Connors is also a rather one dimensional villain they try and make him interesting by throwing in that he's got schizophrenia at the last minute but it's too little too late. Plus I found the effects on the Lizard to be more cute then threatening with that permanent smile on his face he looks like the snake from The Jungle Book.<br/><br/>Marc Webb also doesn't fully utilise the vistas that New York has to offer it is also a lot more domestic then the 2002 Spiderman. The soundtrack is also lacklustre and distracting and at times it doesn't complement the scene but it's only a minor nitpick.<br/><br/>Overall The Amazing Spiderman has now got everything setup for hopefully a worthwhile sequel where we get to see Spiderman doing what a Spider can. It's slightly annoying that we must sit threw another tiresome and somewhat predictable origin story but Marc Webb just barely manages to keep things fresh with his leading man Andrew Garfield pulling it off. Out of all the superhero films that are coming out this summer The Avengers is for those who are looking something larger than life and straightforward, The Dark Knight Rises is for the Drama and the psychological battle as well as the physical one and The Amazing Spiderman is for people looking for a coming of age story with someone who has everyday problems along with supernatural problems thrust upon them. 7/10"
"theycallmemrglass","7","0","3","4 July 2012"," Spiderman: The RETOLD Story is enjoyable with plenty of heart but just not fresh enough
","I enjoyed this, it offers just about enough to set it apart from Raimi's trilogy but I didn't feel there was anything really outstanding about it. There are no moments in the film which made me go, oh wow. If it was a decade ago, I might have but not today, now that we are saturated with CGI effects movies. It simply moves along amicably with spots of charm, a tiny bit of humour, plenty of teenage angst and a heavy dose of anger all of which is framed within a washed out dark toned colour palette as opposed to the vibrancy and rich colours of Raimi's trilogy.<br/><br/>There are some decent big action set pieces but they lack invention and none of it has the visceral energy and savviness as say Avengers or Raimi's trilogy...oops, you know I did promise myself not to make comparisons to Raimi. But I cant help it. So much of the this film is a retread of 2002 Spider-Man and Spiderman 2 that I simply cant ignore it. You really have to be patient with going through all the blasted exposition again. And not just that but an all too similar journey of Octavia as well, albeit in the form of a Lizard. Having said that, it IS all done well, there is plenty of heart and the performances are sincere. Andrew Garfield is born for the role, he is a major reason for watching this film. I always felt the wrong actor won the best actor award in Social Network. Should have been Garfield! But anyway, he nails Peter Parker's flippancy, geekiness, and angst perfectly. His awkwardness and playful relationship with Gwen Stacy are some of the highlights of the movie for me. Emma Stone gives Gwen an attractive spark despite ultimately not differing too much to the Mary Jane of Raimi's films but Gwen has more geek in common with Parker and a little more brains too.<br/><br/>One of the areas this film disappoints in is dialogue. Not that its bad, it just lacking some spark. There is a couple of quips from Spiderman but nothing more and if you've seen the trailers, you've heard most of them. Its the only thing I'm actually disappointed with the Spiderman character himself because otherwise I love this version of the web slinger, he is a lot more vulnerable and less all round powerful than Raimi's version. I also see the benefit now of having the separate electronic web slinger narrative wise, as Spidey depends on it, if it fails, our hero is in trouble...I like that extra vulnerability, we feel more anxious for Spiderman here, can he really cope with the mighty dangers ahead? That's all done well. <br/><br/>The Lizard is pretty good but all too similar to Octavious in terms of motive and character and the effects are seamless. But I have to make comparisons again. The Dr Connors/Lizard is a paler version of Octavious in Spiderman 2 who was by far the more superior and complex villain. The Connors/Lizard character is a not given enough depth for us to empathise with or even fear for that matter.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is serviceable, there is no standout theme for Spiderman, well there is but its a bit meh, certainly not James Horners best work. <br/><br/>Storywise this film lacks imagination and seems too frightened to take risks somehow. It introduces a mystery but then completely abandons it and only returns to it midway through the end credits! The rest of the story is simply old themes already covered in previous films. The Untold story? More like The Retold Story. Whatever we get of this untold story, is absolutely minimal and I get the feeling its meant to be a story arc which might be spread over perhaps a trilogy of these movies.<br/><br/>I know I've emphasised the film's negative points but I did still enjoy what it had to offer and to be honest, most of you might prefer this to Raimi. If Raimi's spider-man is milk chocolate then this is the dark chocolate version.<br/><br/>I'd still look forward to a sequel but I'll say this, I don't have an urge to see this again. With films such as Avengers, X-Men:FC, Spiderman 1, 2 and yeah even 3, I have an urge to see them again or at least anticipate watching it again on Blu Ray. Unfortunately I have no such urge with this film.<br/><br/>These are my personal comparison ratings for all the Spiderman films in this millennium:<br/><br/>Spider-man 9/10 Spider-man 2: 9/10 Spider-man 3: 7.5/10 (yeah I had blast with this one, to hell with the haters ) The Amazing Spiderman: 7/10"
"csingh-2","7","0","2","4 July 2012"," Too soon?
","It doesn't seem long ago that Tobey Maguire created history as Spiderman and here we are witnessing it happen all over again as Andrew Garfield tries to defend New York against Dr. Curt Connors, also referred to in some circles as 'The Lizard'.<br/><br/>The story is familiar. At a very young age Peter Parker's parents leave him with his uncle Ben and his aunt May for his own benefit. Years later he starts to uncover the reason for their mysterious disappearance when he finds an old briefcase that belonged to his father. A little research brings Peter to Oscorp, face to face with his father's old partner Dr. Curt Connors who, given his handicap, has spent his life trying to perfect cross-species mutation. Of course in the process an eight legged friend manages to give our snooping protagonist a little peck and his life changes forever.<br/><br/>Marc Webb, (appropriately named for this venture) manages to provide the audience with an enjoyable experience overall, despite a few flimsy sequences but it is Andrew Garfield who stands out as the movie rests completely on his shoulders. Inevitably there will be comparisons but he holds his own, giving Spiderman that 17 year old boyish charm and bewilderment. Emma Stone fits in perfectly as Gwen Stacy but doesn't really have much to do. Overall, the film doesn't have the impact that it intends to deliver and comparisons with Sam Raimi's version may not go in its favor but for Spiderman fans it is definitely worth a watch as it gives us the opportunity to see our friendly neighborhood Spiderman battle a new nemesis, this time in the form of 'The Lizard'."

","What makes Spider-Man, or rather Peter Parker, such a great character is that at heart he's just a kid. But what this kid, this Peter Parker, more than any other, emphasizes is what a lonely, angry, frustrated, horny, punk teenage orphan he really is. And Garfield does a nice job presenting him as such.<br/><br/>But after screening it, I can't help but feel empty... that it's all just icing. There's no overarching message that preaches 'with great power comes great responsibility'. It constantly undercuts the significance of a promise. Its position on vengeance and vigilante justice is left ambiguous...<br/><br/>For all the visual wonder, especially in IMAX 3D, I can't help but note how it seems so shallow."

","'The Amazing Spider-Man' is a new take on the origin and early days of hero Spider-Man after teenage genius Peter Parker is bitten by a genetically mutated spider. Peter lives with his aunt and uncle after his parents, who includes Richard Parker in following the ""Ultimate"" universe in the comics, was a scientist who was working on a secret project with partner Dr. Curt Conners before he leaves Peter with his aunt May and Uncle Ben and disappears. Andrew Garfield is a good actor in general and acts very well with his role as Peter Parker with the exception of some weak jokes he throws out during battle sequences. The main thing I had trouble figuring out was the character of Peter Parker himself. While being famous in comics and media for being a nerd or geek who is at the top of his class, Peter didn't seem so nerdy or even an outcast in general which led to some of the strange amount of bullying he is going through in the film. Garfield seemed a bit too pretty and Parker did not seem as much of an outcast as the film was trying to make him seem. He just seemed like a regular high school teenager who had a huge affection for skateboarding for the first half of the film. Emma Stone plays Gwen Stacy, the love interest and classmate of Peter and fellow science enthusiast; she interns for Dr. Curt Conners at the company Oscorp and has a strange infatuation for Peter. The two grow close in a short period of time and start a relationship rather early in the film. Garfield and Stone have chemistry and pull off a believable couple in the film even if the start of it seemed a bit quick. Emma lives with two little brothers, her mom and her dad, Captain George Stacy, Captain of the NYPD and the man leading the search to arrest Spider-Man. Denis Leary plays George Stacy and perhaps gives one of the best performances of the film with his performance as a tough, wise cracking police officer. Martin Sheen and Sally Field are cast as Ben and May Parker, Peter's aunt and uncle whom he lives with after his parent's disappearance. Both great actors who give Aunt May and Uncle Ben new character work and makes the roles their own. In their house, Peter finds a briefcase that belonged to his father which contains clues to his disappearance and leads Peter straight to Dr. Curt Conners, a scientist at Oscorp who was working on a project with Richard Parker on genetically altered species. While searching for information, Peter is introduced to Connors and receives a life changing spider-bite from a genetically altered test spider. Rhys Ifans plays Connors and plays him well. His performance was well acted and crafted and was shown to progress into madness out of desperation and dedication after he injects himself with a test formula that Peter had corrected from his father's notes to help re grow his lost arm by using DNA from a lizard. The formula fails and turns Connors into a nine foot tall muscular lizard bent on releasing the formula over the streets of NYC to create a new ""Super Race"" of reptilian creatures. Parts of the film seems to try and make itself more real and darker than the past Spider-Man films and to carry in on the success of 'The Dark Knight' while others seem to try and make the film more teen and hip. The tone is something that shifts throughout the movie a bit too much for my taste and made a lot of scenes much more memorable and just better in general than others. Pacing in the film is another thing that stood out, at many points it seemed as if the film moved a bit fast with things like Peter and Gwen's relationship and the death of Uncle Ben. Many big points of the storyline moved quickly to show the point of them and their effect on Peter. However my biggest problem with the film was character development, in total what really seemed to change with Peter Parker at the end of the film was that he was a little more confident in school. His relationship with Aunt May didn't change and he got a girlfriend while gaining super powers, seeing his Uncle die, and taking down a giant lizard that he was partially responsible for creating. He seemed like the same kid throughout the film and that kind of bothered me even more than the fact the Peter Parker spent so much time looking for Uncle Ben's killer and never finds him in the film. Character development also goes with Peter's transition into Spider-Man, he is never truly a vigilante in the film as stated but rather a kid looking for the guy who killed his Uncle over and over again. His sense of justice and doing the right thing as said by Uncle Ben is never really explored. The furthest it goes is when he saves a child from a car because Curt Conners as the Lizard knocks the car over before it sets into flames. Parker gets a super-hero spandex suit that he designs himself, just to find the man who killed his uncle and later fortunately has it to wear while having to take down Curt Conners. The directing is pretty great in the movie and has a lot of great shots, cinematography, and just some very pretty environment shots. The film in all is well-acted, well directed, has some truly amazing fight sequences and starts a new interesting new beginning to the Spider-Man film franchise but at times just doesn't feel like Spider-Man and has some big issues that really need to be improved upon and fixed in the upcoming sequels."

","The Amazing Spider-Man dresses up a story that everyone in the country already knows, and most have already seen. It achieves a better, less happenstance vision of the origin of the Spider-Man character than the 2002 Spider-Man, which launched Marvel's entire strategy toward brining their catalogue of characters to the screen.<br/><br/>Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is in high school when he's bitten by a radioactive spider, which gives him superpowers so he can fight crime. He lives with Aunt May (Sally Field) and Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen), but only for so long. This time his love interest is the less iconic but more comic-oriented Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone).<br/><br/>Director Marc Webb—what a name—makes every effort to make this the series fans want. Spider-Man is the comic book's smart alec. The visual effects are Oscar worthy, featuring fluid combat and artistic attributes that would make the comic book colorists proud. Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker isn't the all out dweeb played up by Tobey Macguire. Still, I have to take some issue with how this film's villain, a lizard mutant played by Rhys Ifans, hears voices in his head. I also can't get past how Spider-Man is skillful enough a tailor to stitch his amazing garb unassisted; maybe instead of scenes showing his skateboarding prowess we could have gotten him knitting.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man is presented in 3D, and I did see it as thus. In the more static scenes of dialog I lifted the plastic frames to see if anything was 3D at all, and the screen was almost entirely clear to the naked eyes. Even during the more intense moments the 3D didn't push to the extremes, where I find double vision occurs. For the most part there were maybe three moments where 3D filmmaking was really an objective and two of these bookend the movie. <br/><br/>The Amazing Spider-Man is considerably better than Spider-Man (2002) and the latest Marvel flick The Avengers. The people tasked with making it deserve praise, but the process for which it came to be is entirely unscrupulous. Marvel and Sony purposely crafted an awful Spider-Man 3 to build support for a reboot effort. This movie is the child of a bean counter's inartistic, unapologetic effort to make a sure buck. I'm sick of what the industry has become. Shamed to have bought into the notions, I now see that a movie which gives a too familiar origin tale can not be truly recommended.

","This review will contain spoilers for the old spider-man with Toby Maguire. I will reveal some minor-moderate details about the new one, and only less minor things that shouldn't be surprising (e.g. spider-man doesn't die).<br/><br/>When uncle Ben dies in the 2002 Spider-Man, it's heartbreaking. It's the culmination of a slow build up of hubris on the part of Peter Parker over the course of a few weeks or so. He starts out trying to win money, lies to his aunt and uncle about it, tells his uncle he's not his father, and eventually lets a criminal go free because he couldn't collect his winnings. Parker has become arrogant and selfish in his newly found identity, and when he finds his uncle dying on the street he has a REASON TO FEEL GUILTY. You can feel his shame for how he's behaved for the last few weeks, and the last real conversation he had with his uncle was one he will always regret.<br/><br/>The Amazing Spiderman stomps all over that. I have to agree with the telegraph.co.uk reviewer who says this is a movie for the Twilight generation. There's some 'you don't understand me' drama and a similar selfish lapse that lead to uncle Ben's death, and although Parker and his uncle don't part on the best of terms, one of the last conversations Parker has with his uncle is telling him he's been a great dad. Is this supposed to finally quell that beautiful sorrow we felt when Parker left his uncle thinking he was a terrible father in 2002? It's cheap. It's like making a new Titanic movie where they blow up the iceberg and everyone survives. What I'm saying is: Uncle Ben's death was NOT sufficiently heartbreaking, and did not supply the same kind of motivation to Parker's selfless heroics as it did in the 2002 version (Remember, ""with great power comes great responsibility?""). Side note: The actors who portrayed uncle Ben and aunt May were good, but did not fit the roles absolutely perfectly as the 2002 actors did.<br/><br/>One aspect in which this movie greatly improves on its predecessor is in the treatment of the love interest. In 2002 Mary Jane spends most of her time screaming, getting kidnapped, standing in the rain with a soaking wet white shirt... basically she's helpless eye-candy. In The Amazing Spider-Man, Gwen Stacy is smart. In fact there's a bit of dialogue where we find out she's smarter than Peter. This is where appealing to female movie-goers (a trend that, again, started with Twilight) does the movie a great service. We have a smart female character that plays a major role in stopping the film's villain, and despite the fact that Emma Stone is breathtakingly beautiful, she is never sexualized. We do have a just little showing off of Parker for the ladies though (that suit is way tighter than before). There's more relationshippy stuff throughout the movie. Make of that what you will.<br/><br/>I feel that Parker's relationship with the bully Flash was also Twilight-ized. One minute Flash is literally kicking Parker on the ground, and then they weirdly seem to become friends for insufficient reasons. It's not believable.<br/><br/>Now I'll just mention one other thing that bothered me: Parker's stupid phone. We get it; he has a Sony XR500000 or whatever. The product placement is just a bit overdone. I felt like they were finding excuses for people to mention Parker's phone, for him to check his messages, get phone calls etc. There's one point where he's laying there waiting for something (I won't spoil what) and what do you know, he's playing a game on his Sony cell-phone.<br/><br/>Closing thoughts: There will definitely be a sequel, because a specific question was brought up that was never answered.<br/><br/>Wait through the first bit of end-credits for a little extra scene, but don't bother waiting through all the credits after that. There's nothing.<br/><br/>The movie has good action sequences, but Spider-Man's martial arts are, in my opinion, less awesome than in the 2002 version. I'm recalling specifically the move Maguire does to disarm the knife from the guy who killed his uncle, and whip it into the ceiling.<br/><br/>The villain is much better, and maybe it's just the imax, but it was a lot more stressful to watch Parker fight this villain than was the Green Goblin. This villain reminded me of The Hulk from the Avengers movie. He's got that great sense of unstoppable power.<br/><br/>It's a good movie. The new take on Spiderman's origin is cool, and more satisfying than ""Oh he got bitten by a genetically altered spider and his DNA went ftfftftftftftftft."""
"TheMovieMark","8","0","2","3 July 2012"," The law of creativity trumps the law of gravity
","As a child growing up in the 80s, I was fortunate that my imagination was not burdened by as many technological trappings that plague kids today. Sure, I had my Atari and Nintendo, but beyond that I had a group of creative friends and a few backyards that became various universes. And while I was blessed to have many real heroes in my life, I still had a fascination for a few superheroes that weren't limited by the laws of gravity and physics. Batman and Spider-Man were always my favorites, and I may or may not have had the footie pajamas to prove it.<br/><br/>That sense of wonder didn't end as a child. The magic of the movies can still create a bond with those memories of old when it's done right. On one hand, Christopher Nolan has found a way to expertly filter the Batman universe through the perspective of my adult mind. On the other hand, my inner child still relates to a character like Spider-Man. Not only did I love the fact that he was just a geeky kid who stood up to bullies, but let's be honest – his mask is awesome.<br/><br/>But, like many, I was skeptical about a new franchise so soon after the Sam Raimi and Tobey Maguire incarnation. Those films had their flaws (particularly Kirsten Dunst and the lack of any semblance of chemistry between her and Maguire), but the first two were highly enjoyable. Was a reboot necessary? Was it needed this soon? Then I thought about Maguire's stupid disco dancing in Spider-Man 3 and I began to think, ""You know what, why not? Let's give somebody else a shot at this."" That thought and a couple of promising trailers later, and I was a little more on board. Now I had to be sold.<br/><br/>Consider the sell complete.<br/><br/>Sure, this is familiar territory. So what? Director Marc Webb has found a way to take a story most of us already know and put a fresh spin on it. I have many friends who will probably call me a traitor for this, but I loved Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. In fact, I think he's even more believable than the aforementioned Maguire. He creates a likable, relatable character who is as awkward with the ladies as most of us guys were in high school, and he gives Spider-Man just enough sense of humor without stepping over the line into cheesiness. The scene where he ""cowers"" at a small knife demonstrates what I mean.<br/><br/>We also get a better glimpse at just how intelligent he is. For example, we see that Peter's web-shooting ability is his own creation, as it was originally presented in the comics.<br/><br/>Garfield's chemistry with Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy is handled with both believability and subtlety. I couldn't care less about the absence of Mary Jane. In the comics, Gwen was Spidey's first love, and Ms. Stone portrays her with just the right combination of intelligence and sass.<br/><br/>Rhys Ifans is also a stand-out as Dr. Curt Connors/The Lizard. He takes a character that isn't as widely beloved as others in the Spider-Man universe, and he creates a villain that is downright menacing at times and sympathetic at others. We get more than just a one-note bad guy with little more than world domination as his goal. Ifans delivers a character struggling with severe inner conflict who has both evil and redemption at his fingertips.<br/><br/>With a budget estimated at more than $200 million, the cinematography and action sequences are as beautiful as you would expect, providing the excitement and wonder that kids and adults alike desire when sitting down to be taken into a different world. And while the film hits all the right adventurous notes; it's the relationships and the actors who develop them that give the film its heart.<br/><br/>Call me sappy, but I couldn't help but feel the film's climax is as heroic as it is thrilling. Not only was I immersed in what was happening on screen, but I was briefly transported to my backyard when burdens were light, stress was low, and imagination was high.<br/><br/>Complain about reboots if you want. Whine about inconsistencies with the original comic if it makes you feel better. As for me, that stuff never bothered me as a child, and it's not something that bothers me now. All I ask for with a movie like this is to be taken to a different world where the laws of gravity and physics matter less than the law of creativity, and The Amazing Spider-Man does just that.<br/><br/>Batman is still my all-time favorite superhero, but Spider-Man is close behind. Even if I don't still have the footie pajamas to prove it.<br/><br/>Honestly, I don't! But I will take the mask..."

","Amazing Spiderman is a reboot of the Spiderman movies by Tobey Macquire. The film is about Peter Parker who as a young child lost his parents cause they had to flee so Peter stayed with his uncle and aunt. Peter sneaks in a lab with a Spanish name who haven't showed up, Peter then gets in a room with full of spiders. Peter makes every spider fall down and one is on him. He then talks to Gwen Stacy which is his crush and gets bitten by a spider who gives him power so he can shoot web. Peter gets home and makes his uncle angry because he didn't pick up his aunt. Peter gets angry and just go away. Peter then goes to a store and he has no money so a guy behind gives the drink he wanted and runs away. The guy then shoots Uncle Ben and Peter want revenge by find this guy. Peter then gets a idea to make a costume and become Spider-Man. While Curt Connors finds a thing that makes his arm grow back, it makes him into a Lizard and is the main villain of the movie. Spider-Man now has to defeat Lizard to save the day.<br/><br/>The movie is a very good movie, better than Spider-Man 3 but not better then 1 & 2. But this is a very good movie and i recommend it. Cant wait for the second to come out but its not the best movie but still a very entertaining movie. Just that the Tobey MacQuire version is better but this movie is much better then Spider-Man 3 and i like that. This movie is a kick-ass movie and worth too see. This is a movie that you don't wanna miss this year so go and see with or without 3D. I recommend it on 3D.<br/><br/>8/10 Spider-Man is Amazing and awesome, i recommend it."
"enggar_13","7","0","5","3 July 2012"," The Franchise is back, but not Amazing as expected.
","I won't tell the plot because you can found it on Wikipedia. <br/><br/>My thoughts are:<br/><br/>I think the problem was on script and continuities. <br/><br/>1. What happened next with Irfan Khan? what's his role?<br/><br/>2. Then if many objects were broken or stick with Peter's hand, why it didn't happen when he hug and kissed Gwen, or when he used his cellphone?<br/><br/>3. If Webb wanted to make this Spidey being real as possible. But how come a teenager like Peter can make very complicated spidey suite and web shooter? OK he is diligent, but where he got the money to make such things? He isn't rich like Tony Stark or Bruce Wayne. Peter is from mid-low family. So it just like give a poor boy an Armani and try to make us believe that he buys it by himself. Ridiculous. <br/><br/>4. What is the Lizard motives in his act? to make everyone being like him? After very long research, wasting money, time etc. How come he just want to give everyone ""free service"" ?<br/><br/>5. Peter' motivation to be Spider-Man is really disgrace (in term of Superhero idealism) So Peter became Spider-Man, just want to find the murderer of Uncle Ben? Revenge? 6. When Lizard made a mess on the bridge, Spidey rescued a boy and it was good scene. But its ruined into pointless when Lizard ran away then Spidey wasn't chasing him, instead he met Gwen then he said he must stop the Lizard. 7. Its not logic , if a girl who just met a boy, just 2-3 times then they aren't a couple yet, then she invites that boy in family dinner. <br/><br/>Andrew's acting as Spidey was very good. Even i think he can deliver Parker's emotion better than Tobey did. Andrew was amazing as Peter Parker in this movie more outspoken and bit of arrogant. Emma Stone was so so. Rhys Ifans was poor. Almost every villains in Superhero movies were delivered great acting and could play the audiences' emotion (ex: Ledger, Nicholson, Hackman, Spacey, Defoe, Molina etc) but somehow Ifans was less better, plain, and not total.<br/><br/>The movie is quiet good. But, brought this Spidey into darker tone like Batman Begins to avoid being campy and real wasn't the answer. Spider-Man is not Batman. They are different <br/><br/>As Spidey fanboy, i am happy that this reboot can extend the franchise. But not as Amazing as before. :'("

","The movie was great, and as I can say, BETTER than the Sam Raimi version, less serious than Raimi's one took. its less serious and more Teen-is style, since it focuses on the teen audience...<br/><br/>There are moments where your heart will stop beating because of the fast- paced action and touching moments that'll touch your heart. Garfield and Stone had great chemistry in the movie too, adding romance to the action packed reboot. However, some plot points remind us of the original...<br/><br/>I can't say anything more, The movie was overall AMAZING, to the old and new fans of the series, and i thought remaking a decade-old movie was a bad idea, MAN I WAS WRONG! Marc Webb directs the movie as good as Joss Wheddon did to The Avengers."

He introduced a Spiderman who acts like a Spider. None of the Sam Raimi's version portrayed him this way. Marcs genius work could be clearly seen during fight sequences.<br/><br/>Of course this movie has its flaws. Loopholes in plot line. Scenes don't link up well together. Some of the characters are not well developed.<br/><br/>Andrew Garfield the new kid on the block played Peter Parker Brilliantly. You ll not forget his performance.

"SforSmile","7","0","2","1 July 2012"," Nothing new on the Marvel front
","Ten years ago – I must have been 14 around that time – the world of cinema witnessed the beginning of a new, glorious superheroes era as Sam Raimi's super awesome ""Spiderman"" conquered the big screen, an era, temporarily culminated in the box office success ""Marvel's: The Avengers"", which swamped us with so many good and less good comic book adaptations and flushed so many billions of dollars into the coffers of the film production as well as comic book companies – such as Sony and Marvel in this case – that it seemed hardly ever to end, or more precisely, it was not allowed to end anymore. What enormous fun I had, how thrilled I was watching the fabulous Tobey Meguire swinging as Peter Parker, the friendly neighbourhood Spiderman, through the vertiginous street canyons of New York City fighting his own inner demons, his weaknesses, the guilty certainty of being responsible for his Oncle Ben's death, fighting for Mary Jane's love and against mighty villains that were never entirely evil but rather misguided. Spidey was carried by a simple message that with great powers there also comes great responsibility. Sam Raimi even managed to top it all with the sequel ""Spiderman 2"" which brought the action scenes to a whole new level in terms of tempo and choreography taking place in prodigious heights most of the times. This was original, unique and most of all, entirely new to the audience. However, the third and final part ""Spiderman 3"" could not reach up to the same quality of its predecessors, the end of Spiderman's film era seemed inevitable, yet Sony Pictures didn't want to lose their rights on the franchise, too much money was at stake, so they fired Raimi and Tobey and all the cast. The end became the beginning, the era continued, only five years after the finale, the producers started anew and created a remake titled ""The Amazing Spiderman"" with an incredibly sympathetic as well as well fitting Andrew Garfield for the leading role and Emma Stone as Peter's first high school love Gwen Stacy who is not only extremely sexy in her knee-long boots but also very smart and self-confident.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, as a remake this version by director Marc Webb retells a story that was perfectly fine the way it was without adding anything significantly new to it except for maybe some deeper insights of Parker's troubled self thus destroying a lot of former plot elements. For example, I was shocked to see what remained of the story concerning Oncle Ben's murder and the resulting consequences for Spidey. What the writers have left of it is as thin as a spider thread. The introduction of Parker's parents is an undeveloped idea leading to nowhere. The love story between him and Gwen ends before it even started properly. His new enemy ""The Lizard"", convincingly played by Rhys Ifans, cannot compete with Dr. Octopus when it comes to the action scenes that rarely take place over ground but which are still good enough to be exiting. At least, he is realistically animated. The film appears altogether in a much darker, dirtier shade and the 3D technology gives it a better sense of spatial depth especially when Spidey jumps from a building. I really missed the funny moments of the original trilogy. Peter Parker is known for his witticism and good sense of humour which the current teen Peter somehow seems to have lost over so much troubling. The second half of the film was far more entertaining as the pace started to grow affording one or two goosebumps moments like the one on the bridge when Spidey saved a child. Compared to that, the first half before the intermission felt like a burdensome necessity they easily could have done without just because no one needs another origin story of how Peter got his superpowers due to a spider bite. <br/><br/>In summary, I come to the conclusion that Webb's ""The Amazing Spiderman."" is a good,solid, well played and animated teen action film, partially amazing,never outstanding and always in the shadow of the first adaptation. You may enjoy it, especially if you're 14 as I was ten years before. The spirit of that time I could not feel again, Peter's message is somehow softened by a not fully developed script, however, the era of superhero films will live on and Spiderman will definitely return."

The Direction of the movie is quite good. though the pace of the movie is a little bit sluggy ! the pace slows down at many points and the Director lets you Get into the situation and Emotions which works most of the times but then other things distract you there !

To the Performances Andrew Garfield has done a Totally ""Amazing"" Role and totally gives Peter Parker a new Bar the geeky side isn't well justified. Emma Stone does her job and stays Beautiful even Justifies her role ! The Spidey Costume is well detailed and better ! Lizard could have been made more horrifying and a Better Villain. the SFx is pretty good but less as the action scenes are to say ""Avoided"" and the focus has been kept on the story and Character details ! The Action Scenes are well shot and fun to see ! we miss Spidey Mocking and taunting while Fighting ! The Movie is a must see for its 3D well captured every scene and Amazing 3d ! The Sound Track is decent but a little irritating ! There are many humorous scenes in the movie and spidey has been kept realistic ! Though all these Amazing things of the movie !

"csung","7","0","5","30 June 2012"," Mainstream Nerd Culture meets Romantic Comedy for Decent Summer Flick
","Similar to how Daniel Craig had to win his audience as the new James Bond, Andrew Garfield took on his own attempt as Peter Parker.<br/><br/>The last franchise of Spiderman with Toby McGuire was well received and this version had low expectations (I mean, why so soon?). It was a surprising delight, but relied on CGI, 3D, and quite a lot of new technology/scifi.<br/><br/>This adaptation had a sense of humour and took advantage of Andrew Garfield's cute nerdiness that wins girls over with his adorkable crooked smile. Garfield plays an awkward teen, who gets bitten by a genetically-modified spider. The angsty teen, who lost his parents and was at fault for having his uncle killed, had me tearing up (but really I cry at almost anything remotely sad). He then becomes a bit of a cocky teen, who's still a little lost and slowly evolves as he begins to understand responsibility and power. He gets injured a lot, apologizes a lot, and has a few father figure moments. <br/><br/>The filming was nice, but the CGI was gorgeous. Unfortunately, the first person shooter style shots (all CGI) gave me more of a headache than a thrill ride and failed to make me scream of the drop (as Mission Impossible 4 did with less obvious CGI).<br/><br/>The blatant product placement of Sony & Mercades had me cringing, but I did enjoy Stan Lee's cameo in the middle of a fight scene, it was hilarious and unexpected. There was also a scene that Andrew Garfield put on his father's glasses (which happen to fit perfectly) had me whispering ""hipster"", then laughing at our ""modern"" fashion.<br/><br/>Emma Stone added a small romantic comedy element (that made me want Andrew Garfield more) and a bit of a storyline convenience (more empathy for dying characters, fear, a magical antidote, and a connection to Captain Stacy). It also appeals to the male audience by having a girl in a short skirt & thigh highs.<br/><br/>Technology & science had a huge role, which appealed to my geekiness. The DIY aspect with a breadboard and Andrew Garfield together, every geek girl's dream (I swear I wasn't that in love with him before).<br/><br/>Things I enjoyed: geekiness, Stan Lee's cameo, having real shots of New York (especially filming in the Hearst Building), Andrew Garfield<br/><br/>Bottomline: The movie takes mainstream nerd culture and mashes it with a romantic comedy to make a good summer movie."
