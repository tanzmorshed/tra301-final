","Every action has a reaction, and watching ""Capote"", we can't help but wonder how it ever got made. ""Capote"" is entrancing, dark, depressing, and quite satisfying. It benefits from Hoffman's perfect performance. He embodies the physical and psychological make up of a man who was the toast of the nation before and after the publication of its classic novel, ""In Cold Blood"". As a human being, he appeared to be an intelligent, fascinating, and manipulative creature. He could have gotten away with almost anything. Then he found the two criminals behind one of the most heinous crimes of the century and might have gotten to the realization he could also be trapped by their own dark existences.<br/><br/>It is difficult to ascertain what happened to Capote after he developed a relationship with Smith. He grows attracted to the actions and revelations behind this killer, and we never really know what is exactly going on. There are displays of guilt and detachment at different parts in the film. What we do see is that something really affected the man, and it changed his life for good.<br/><br/>The film moves slowly but never loses its audience. Along with Hoffman, a remarkable supporting cast keeps us interests going, and enough is presented to make us want to know more. That will probably be the film's only flaw. It fails to deliver everything it promises. It is a big satisfying tease, but after all, we are left with an endless number of questions. Keener is wonderful as Capote's supporting friend, and in his lover's role, Bruce Greenwood intrigues us as well, with the dubious character that never gives enough information to explain his attraction to a total opposite.<br/><br/>""Capote"" is a really good film and should be admire for it achieves. For those who want to explore more in depth what lies behind the protagonists of the movie, there are several books that will give you a more detailed background on their nature. The truth, will however, remain, a big mystery."
"dglink","10","173","219","28 October 2005"," Mesmerizing Performance in Complex, Contradictory Film
","Like the non-fiction novel and the Richard Brooks film that was made from it, ""In Cold Blood,"" ""Capote"" focuses on and sympathizes with two killers at the expense of the four murdered members of the Clutter family. Once the viewer gets beyond this sticking point, however, all three works are outstanding, unforgettable experiences. Unlike the book and the original movie, ""Capote"" does explore the contradictory feelings that author Truman Capote wrestles with as he researches and writes ""In Cold Blood."" His feelings for Perry Smith, the more ""sensitive"" of the two killers, are particularly problematic as Capote becomes emotionally close to Smith and helps the men with legal aide that postpones the executions, while at the same time Capote cannot finish his book until Smith and Hickcock are hanged. Praise for Philip Seymour Hoffman's uncanny performance as Truman Capote cannot be overstated and, come awards time, if he does not collect enough accolades to fill his mantel, indictments for film critics and Academy voters would be in order. Hoffman not only captures the mannerisms and voice of Capote, he inhabits the man's soul and expresses his feelings and emotions without histrionics or the type of caricature that mimics often have made of the notoriously fey writer in the past.<br/><br/>Fortunately, Hoffman's performance is only the jewel in a gilded crown of fine writing, excellent direction, and solid supporting performances. ""Capote"" will send viewers back to their bookshelves to re-read the book and to their video libraries to re-view the 1967 film. Considering the time that Capote spent with the two convicted murderers, questions arise as to why the Richard Brooks film did not have Truman Capote as a character, but rather presented a bland, nameless investigative writer, who wanders through the proceedings without much purpose. The film is so good and so intriguing that questions such as that, and what happened to the writer that Capote lived with? and did Harper Lee write anything beyond ""To Kill a Mockingbird?"" and did Capote's presence at the execution lead to his alcoholism, his lack of further writing, and eventually his death, and other questions will send viewers to Google as soon as they get home. ""Capote"" is an outstanding film and possibly the first of the year to be assured of a place on the ""10 Best"" lists for 2005."
"mklein-4","9","359","467","27 September 2005"," Mr. Hoffman, you are Truman Capote.
","The easiest role for an actor to play is a historical figure - we have no idea how Julius Caesar really sounded, how he moved his body, punctuated his speech, bit his lip, walked into a room, held his cigarette. The hardest role is the living, or recently deceased, celebrity whom we watched, heard, studied, mimicked and thought we understood. JFK, Martin Luther King, Ray Charles, and, above all, the inventor of self referential celebrity, Truman Capote (with apology to Andy Warhol and, of course, Noel Coward)..<br/><br/>After exploding to meteoric fame with his novella Breakfast at Tiffany's, Capote became the New York café society's darling, heir to Coward's gay-man-child-bon-vivant. He drank and held court with the best of New York, which just also happened to be the nexus of television in the early 60s. Before long Capote was the quintessential modern celebrity, famous for being famous. And he did it all before our eyes.<br/><br/>Philip Seymour Hoffman does not so much play Capote as become him. And not just in mannerism, no mean feat, but in personality, because we are convinced that Hoffman feels what Capote felt, cries over the lies, accepts his moral failings. For a short story writer-raconteur from New Orleans, Capote found himself at the center of a nationally enthralling multiple homicide, facing the ultimate journalist's Faustian dilemma: if he perpetrates a lie for the sake of exposing the truth, is he ever worthy of redemption? Capote, in the end, concluded that he wasn't; he never wrote another book. He descended into drunkenness and died a lonely soul. This is not the stuff of Holly Golightly.<br/><br/>I saw this picture at the Toronto Film Festival with Hoffman, Catherine Keener and director Bennett Miller in attendance. Though they had seen it many many times before, it was obvious even they were moved by it and by our reaction. As we stood and applauded them, we turned to one another, glowing in the realization that we had witnessed an amazing performance.<br/><br/>We knew Truman Capote. We watched him live on television. Truman Capote was (we imagined) our friend. Mr. Hoffman, you are Truman Capote."

","I saw Truman Capote dozens of times; he was a staple of the talk show circuit. One of the greatest TV moments was when he called Wilbur Mills a racist in the most subtle way that the Georgia governor took about half a minute to realize what had happened. This man was a firebrand. He never backed down from anything, despite his effeminate ways and small stature. Unfortunately, he word his celebrity on his sleeve and was often overly harsh and full of himself. This is a great movie. The subtle methods he uses to draw out the story from the murderer shows that he would do anything to get a story, even lie to a person with whom he had begun to fall in love. He pictures himself as compassionate at times, but he is often unwilling to go that final mile. It's surprising he was in attendance at the hangings, the events that probably contributed to his death. What a complex man. His canon of American literature is small but he was a master stylist and commentator. See this movie for Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance. It is one of the greatest in cinematic history. We remember Capote. He is Capote!"
"madbeast","10","241","340","11 September 2005"," Humanizing Capote
","This moving film lives and breathes on the powerful shoulders of Phillip Seymour Hoffman's stunning performance in the title role. Hoffman captures all of the unique physical characteristics that made Capote such a familiar public figure in his lifetime and invests them with a humanity that is almost unbearably poignant. The film focuses on Capote's research on the book ""In Cold Blood"" and the personal journey that his relationship and identification with killer Perry Smith became (Capote says at one point that it was like they grew up in the same house, and he went out the front door while Perry went out the back), a compelling and complicated relationship that this uncompromising film presents in moving detail. But what truly makes it a unique work of art is the brilliant work of Hoffman - always an interesting actor - whose performance as Truman Capote should elevate him to the pantheon of film giants."

","Brilliant portrayals are chilling. Philip Seymour Hoffman's invocation of the essence of Truman Capote is mesmerizing. I suspect that most of the readers on websites such as these may not have stored memories of Capote in the 60's. An unlikely media darling, I vividly recall his flaunting gay affectations and cosmopolitan barbs. Hoffman's detailed and incisive performance implores, ""And the Oscar goes to........"" <br/><br/>Beyond his performance is a riveting and eerie story directed with flawless craft and impressive restraint. It is a film that left me sitting and discussing its nuances and its depth, until the theater's lights flickered to oust me. The film surrounds the time when Capote wrote ""In Cold Blood,"" a book nearly everyone read in the late 60's, its title seeming obvious. This latest movie inserts Capote into the original crimes that inspired ""In Cold Blood"" and challenges us to revisit that title."

","Beautifully told, masterfully performed, harrowing, amusing, cruel, moving. A sensational achievement. I sat there disturbed and transfixed. Witnessing the impossible.

Living his life, life as work, work as life. An ego bigger than his talent and all talent and no ego. Feeling without feeling. Cunning, innocent, blasphemous, a child, a monumental son of a bitch. Philip Seymour Hoffman surprising us again. Charles Laughton I thought. What a thought! Charles Laughton 2005. That kind of talent that kind of boldness and brains.

I can't wait to see it again."

","What PSH has pulled off here simply cannot be overpraised. First he accomplishes a perfect imitation- the voice, the gestures, the walk. Then, within this caricature, he delivers a startlingly complex and subtle performance. First he's the preening bon vivant, indulged by friends and lovers, intimately tied to the world of the rich and famous. Then during some of his self-absorbed monologues he becomes something else, genuinely penetrating on the subject of the human condition. Then you see how cynically he uses that ability to get what he wants. So much sincere emotion demonstrated in the service of lies. His cruelty is such that one feels indignation for the murderous sociopath who becomes his muse. But at the same time, his ambition to do something great is totally understandable, and the cost to his psyche so visibly demonstrated, that he remains a sympathetic character.<br/><br/>Catherine Keener plays Nelle as the perfect foil, warm and caring but so perceptive and cruelly honest. Clifton Collins Jr.'s Perry is mesmerizing, a vulnerable and sensitive and desperately yearning young man who knows he's no good. His confession is breathtaking, cold, devastating. Chris Cooper and Bruce Greenwood are also excellent in smaller roles.<br/><br/>In a film with acting this sublime, it would be easy top overlook the technical accomplishments of evocative cinematography and measured, confident editing. The rhythm of the film is slow, with spaces provided for the viewer to fully absorb what's happening, and the accumulated effect was such that I had a difficult time stopping myself from shaking as I left the theatre.<br/><br/>This is it, the real deal. It is difficult to imagine a more powerful film being released this year."

","Director Bennet Miller's ""Capote"" is a film that shows great intelligence in the way it captured the essence of Truman Capote, a man who achieved fame and notoriety with most of the fiction he wrote. This film concentrates in the period of his life in which he got obsessed by a notorious murder case of the fifties about the murder of a family in Kansas.<br/><br/>Dan Futterman has written the screen play based on the book by Gerald Clarke. The film is an account about the writing of the novel ""In Cold Blood"" that showed how the two young men who committed the heinous crime are caught, processed and hanged for their actions.<br/><br/>If you haven't watched the film, perhaps you would like to stop here.<br/><br/>When the film opens we get a vision of a lonely house in the distance. This being the Midwest, we are given a flat expanse devoid of elevations anywhere. The camera takes us to that lonely house as a young woman comes calling for her friend that lives in there. Not getting any response, she goes in to a room upstairs where she discovers her friend has been killed. The colors are dark, as is the tone of the film.<br/><br/>Truman Capote, who had been connected to the New Yorker magazine, sees the article in the N.Y. Times and gets interested. This case that shocked the country, at the time, shows a promise for the writer. The next time we meet him, he is in the small town in Kansas accompanied by his good friend and steadying influence, Nell Harper Lee, a writer.<br/><br/>By becoming friendly with the sheriff's wife, Mr. Capote gets a privilege by having access to the two murderers. Truman is clearly deeply affected by his relationship with Perry Smith, a handsome dark man who shows a lot of intensity. By gaining their trust, Capote is able to put together his best selling book ""In Cold Blood"", which will revolutionize American letters in the way the two criminals are portrayed.<br/><br/>Truman Capote, while pursuing the completion of his book, doesn't come clean to Perry Smith. In fact, when questioned about things he has learned, Capote gives evasive answers because he is not prepared to share with his main subject things that clearly should have been clarified from the start.<br/><br/>Watching the brilliant take of Philip Seymour Hoffman as Truman Capote on the screen, brought to mind another great actor, Meryl Streep, who like Mr. Hoffman is a chameleon in the interpretation of a character. Mr. Hoffman is perfect as the writer because he has captured every mannerism and the speech inflection of Truman Capote. Catherine Keener is perfect as Nelle, the true friend and companion. Bruce Greenwood plays Truman Capote's companion Jack Dunphy. Chris Cooper is totally wasted as Sheriff Dewey.<br/><br/>Adam Kimmel excellent cinematography contributes to the atmosphere the director gave the film because of the use of muted colors in what appear to be the bleak winter of the Midwest."

","Capote Reviewed by Sam Osborn<br/><br/>Rating: 3.5 out of 4<br/><br/>Director: Bennett Miller Cast: Philip Seymour Hoffman, Catherine Keener, Chris Cooper Screenplay: Dan Futterman MPAA Classification: R (some violent images and brief strong language)<br/><br/>It seems that once a year we're treated to a performance so staggeringly magnificent that it seems as if the actor's a shoe-in for the Academy's Best Actor prize. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is just that actor for 2005. His portrayal of Truman Capote was best described by Telluride Film Festival's Galaxy Theater host as a ""resurrection"". Like Jamie Foxx's Ray, Charlize Theron's Monster, and Nicole Kidman's Virginia Wolfe, Hoffman's Capote is simply devastating. He stated at Telluride that after first accepting the role and watching a recording of Truman Capote he frankly thought he was in over his head. But throughout pre-production he gathered and compiled all of Capote's mannerisms and began practicing them, slowly and truly becoming Truman Capote. And from the first line of Hoffman's dialogue, with his squinched high voice, and self-absorbed tone we know he's succeeded. The actual film is nearly eclipsed by Hoffman's performance. But Director Bennett Miller and an impressive supporting cast manage to keep up with Hoffman's breakneck achievement. Shot in monochromatic, nearly black and white starkness, the film inherits a raw power that builds to its stunning climactic sequence. And although the film drags some in the middle, it finishes strong and leaves us with much to discuss. It's provocative, stark, and powerful. <br/><br/>Capote opens with the discovery of a family of four murdered in the small town of Hokum, Kansas in 1953 (don't quote me on the date, please). Coming off his second novel, Truman Capote (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) is searching for his next project. Intrigued by the murders, he takes the investigation, agreeing on authoring an article for The New Yorker. Meeting with the town's Sheriff, Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper), he's met with opposition in the town for his peculiar manner. But his companion on the investigation, Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), offsets his homosexuality with terse, homegrown professionalism.<br/><br/>Months later the two killers, Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.) and Richard Hickcock (Mark Pellegrino) are apprehended by Sheriff Dewey and soon sentenced to death. Finding himself increasingly drawn to the story by the sentence, Truman begins personally interviewing the murderers, particularly Perry Smith, at their maximum security prison. Avoiding discussion of the murders themselves, Capote learns more about their lives outside of crime, finding a humanity never put into print before and causing him to extend his article for The New Yorker into the full-length novel, In Cold Blood. It would be the first True Crime novel ever written. His extensive interviews with Smith lead to a strange relationship open to many terms of controversial interpretation. He feels compelled to assist the men and lead the world's opinion away from demonizing headlines. Capote even goes to lengths to find them a decent lawyer for their Supreme Court appeal. <br/><br/>The screenplay deals with this controversy between Capote and Smith with beautiful ambiguity. Screenwriter Dan Futterman leaves it to Capote's character to interpret their relationship for the audience, instead of the story doing so in a ham-handed way. And with Hoffman's performance so obsessively complete, the result is magnificent. We oddly understand Capote's pain and his unique love for Perry Smith. He obviously sees the monster inside, but realizes the human entirely. Some even speculated around the festival that Capote fell in love with Smith. It's incredibly profound. <br/><br/>But at the same time, Futterman's screenplay relies too much on Capote's obsession with Smith. Audience's in the 50's were terrified by Capote's humanistic realization of the murderer, but now, that sort of True Crime journalism is accepted, and even expected, from murder investigations. This reliance causes the film to linger too long on Capote's build-up interviews before the shocking, twisting confession he needs to finish the novel. Also, audiences have recently grown tired of the biopic, probably because of the last year's heaping pile of them. This mutes the typical drama that occurs in all dramatic biopics, with the character's slow deterioration. <br/><br/>Despite these flaws, Capote is still an arresting portrait of a murder. And to go along with this portrait is the complete resurrection of Truman Capote in Phillip Seymour Hoffman. The film works to succeed beyond a simple biopic. It also hits on the difficult topic of true crime, delving into the imagination and conscience of a man that killed in cold blood."

","CAPOTE, first of all, is a well written film by the talented Dan Futterman, whose performance in URBANIA we will always remember, and for Philip Seymour Hoffman, this is his ""Golden Globe and Oscar Award"" all in one. From the first scene, Hoffman creates the essence of the acid tongued, tremendously talented, yet damaged, Truman Capote.<br/><br/>Having read IN COLD BLOOD when it first came out, CAPOTE really captures on the screen the horror of what took place on that Kansas farm and the cinematography, costumes and locations are wonderful to behold. Miss Keener's performance is such a subtle and intelligent contrast to the hysteria of Capote, and his perfect foil.<br/><br/>In the scenes with Perry Smith, they are haunting and disturbing, as if it feels like two cobras are circling one another, waiting for the first one to strike. And in this context, I ask, ""2 Capote, or NOT 2 Capote?, that is the question"", because both are on the take-Smith to use Capote for obtaining a pardon, Capote, to nail the story that will gain him the adulation he so adores. And then, Capote slides downhill, while Perry rots in prison.<br/><br/>CAPOTE captures the essence of the 1950's, the horror of a brutal killing in the vast farmlands of Kansas, and delivers a knock out performance from Philip Seymour Hoffman. If only IN COLD BLOOD had not seemed like a manipulation by a writer out for glory at the expense of a prisoner who believed in him."
"FilmSnobby","9","18","24","22 October 2005"," The Truman show.
","Philip Seymour Hoffman, who we first noticed in *Scent of a Woman* some 13 years ago when he turned a fairly clichéd character into a memorable character study, finds his apotheosis -- some would say his inevitable apotheosis -- as Truman Capote in Bennett Miller's *Capote*. The writer died in 1984, and furthermore had spent the last 15 or so years of his life in relative seclusion, if you disregard his addled presence at Studio 54 and the occasional ""Tonight Show"" appearance. Therefore, to someone like myself, reared in the Seventies and Eighties and carrying no burning memories of the fellow, the exactitude of Hoffman's mimicry of Capote is neither here nor there. This is, above and beyond any caviling about how precise Hoffman's impersonation is of Capote, a full-bodied, well-rounded character, whose primary interest in serving the film is to make us consider the wages of art.<br/><br/>Older members of the audience, by which I mean those who remember the Sixties, may be forgiven a degree of burn-out: after all, there was Capote's book ""In Cold Blood"", the movie on which it was based, and the writer's own self-referential celebrity. Been there and done that? Not quite: this time, we view the story ABOUT the story from the writer's perspective. It is a credit to Gerald Clarke, who wrote the book on which the film is based, Dan Futterman, who wrote the screenplay, and director Miller that this well-worn material becomes urgent and interesting again. On a wider social level, *Capote* makes a damning statement about our current fascination with ""true crime"" stories, which had been reinforced by Norman Mailer's ""Executioner's Song"" in the Seventies and has finally become noxiously regnant with cable TV's endless hours of coverage of the Peterson case and others like it. I'm not suggesting that people were not interested in this tawdry material before Capote, but the movie implicitly blames him for the shameless modern-day intertwining of writers (or TV reporters) with the crimes and criminals that they're covering. The movie also has something to say about how self-centered writers can be: Capote can only say ""What's the fuss all about?"" in reference to friend and fellow novelist Harper Lee's success with ""To Kill a Mockingbird"". After watching Smith and Hickock get hung for their crimes, Capote whines, ""I'll never get over it"" -- to which Lee (played by the great Catherine Keener) replies with deadpan malice, ""You're still ALIVE, Truman."" Amen! <br/><br/>However, Capote's self-pity also contains the mere truth. *Capote* is the tragedy of a man who scrapped his own decency in order to write one of the great American novels of the 20th century. We observe the incremental milestones along the path toward greatness and damnation: Capote ingratiating himself with the Kansas locals; befriending the more sensitive and intelligent of the two murderers, Perry Smith; helping to arrange appeals for the murderers so that they'll stay alive long enough for him to collect enough information to finish his novel; smoothly lying to Smith about what he's actually writing about the case, even down to the book's title; and finally living with the consequences of his exploitative behavior. Art is achieved with devastating cost to the artist. Of course, this theme isn't exactly new, but Philip Seymour Hoffman makes it visceral with a performance containing a kaleidoscope of human behavior: cocky and in his element with his high-brow drinking pals in New York; smooth and charming as the ""funny fag"" stereotype (modeled on characters in the Thirties' films of Ernst Lubitsch and others) in Sheriff Dewey's home; gentle and nurturing to, and even spoon-feeding, Perry Smith during the latter's attempt at suicide-by-starvation in prison; abruptly turning the tables on Smith when Smith continues to remain close-mouthed about the night of the murders. This latter scene, in which Capote lashes out at his subject in that carefully modulated castrato voice of his, will go down in the annals of film history as perhaps the prime example of just how much contempt one human being can demonstrate to another. Granted, Perry Smith was an abomination of a man who deserved execution . . . but Hoffman's icy contempt still stabs us. Inhumanity is not always physically violent.<br/><br/>A difficult film. You will walk out of it feeling uncomfortable and contemplative. There's still some time remaining in the calendar as of this writing (10/22/05), but I doubt I'll see a better American movie this year. 9 stars out of 10."
"debblyst","6","46","73","27 February 2006"," Outstanding performance, witty dialog but visually unimaginative -- it will play better on TV
","""Capote"" is a film with undeniable assets: it's got the best performance by an American actor in the last decade and some of the wittiest dialog in an American film in recent years. Philip Seymour Hoffman's once-in-a-lifetime performance is simply jaw-dropping (and he's aware of it): it's a triumph of vocal and body work, with a huge range (mentally and emotionally), but above all it sparkles with supremely intelligent acting in portraying the lizard man with the 215-point I.Q. and the 1,000,000-point ego.<br/><br/>The film focuses entirely on the circumstances concerning the genesis of Truman Capote's masterpiece ""In Cold Blood"" (the title that had, of course, a double meaning, as it described both the set of mind of the 1959 Kansas harrowing criminals and of Capote himself in his Machiavellian saga to finally complete his book). The film concentrates on Capote's transformation from lightweight literary wunderkind and jet-set wit to trend-setting, seriously talented writer, depicting the Faustian/Mephistophelian process he goes through as he realizes that, in order to produce his ground-breaking ""non-fiction novel"" -- which helped consolidate American media's fascination with violence, death and crime -- he has to sink deeply in muddy waters of manipulation, adulation, mendacity, bribery, omission, ultimately having to face the ugliest side of himself, like a modern Dorian Gray. In ""Capote"", the horrifying Kansas crime, the murderers and the circumstances that led to their execution are the background scenery allowing the filmmakers to question the author's autistic egotism, gargantuan ambition and tortuous, perverse morality (just in case anyone forgets: Capote's novel benefited who, again?)<br/><br/>If ""Capote"" ultimately impacts less than it could/should, director Bennett Miller is probably to blame. Visually, it's bland and unexciting: it's a real shame to see such an unimaginative handling of such potentially thrilling material. ""Capote"" has some of the dullest courtroom scenes in movie history (and the competition is high, as we know). And what about those gigantic, paralyzed close-ups? And that static, lifeless camera? The audience goes to see the film pretty much aware that Capote's (and the screenwriter's) wit and Hoffman's performance are the core of it, and no one was asking for an action movie, but did it have to look so bland? Maybe Miller just lacks mileage (this is only his second film); or maybe he's simply not visually oriented, maybe he's an actors' director. Despite the fascinating subject, a great performance and above-average dialog, Miller's ""Capote"" disappointingly looks like a TV movie.<br/><br/>Apart from those (not trifle) objections, ""Capote"" is recommended for all of us who thought wit, subtlety and acting excellence had all but disappeared from American films. PS: Richard Brooks' irregular but visually striking 1967 version of ""In Cold Blood"" is a complementary companion to this one."
"the_entropist","7","66","109","7 September 2005"," Well done, moving account of Capote's life during the writing of 'In Cold Blood'
","I saw a press screening of this film recently, and was highly impressed by its moving account of the period in Truman Capote's life during which he wrote 'In Cold Blood'. The direction by the relatively unknown Bennett Miller is personal, evocative and affecting, but without being over-dramatic or saccharine. This is helped immensely by Philip Seymour Hoffmann's incredible performance as Capote, as well as solid acting from Catherine Keener, Clifton Collins Jr., and Chris Cooper. Cooper plays K.B.I. Agent Alvin Dewey with perhaps a bit too much intensity, given his relatively small amount of screen time, but the portrayal nonetheless comes off as heart-felt.<br/><br/>The cinematography by Adam Kimmel is suitably gray and moody, with many evocative views of the flat Kansas plains, but most of the screen time is spent with the camera focused on Hoffmann - all of it time well spent.<br/><br/>While I haven't read the biography by Gerald Clarke on which it's based, the script seems to hit enough salient details to evoke Capote's frame of mind, without inundating the audience with more than would fit in a feature-length film. I suppose one of my only complaints about the film would be that at times the conversations take on a sheen of Hollywood, saying things for dramatic impact that perhaps might not have been said in real life. But then again, I never met Capote, so who knows for sure.<br/><br/>All in all, this was a deeply engrossing film, and one I would highly recommend, especially if you're a fan of Truman Capote."
"Tecun_Uman","9","4","4","7 November 2005"," Life's Work
","Basically, ""Capote"" is a study of Truman Capote's greatest accomplishment and eventual downfall, which happens to be one in the same event, the Clutter killings. Capote on a whim decides to prove to people that non-fiction can be every bit as creative and dramatic as the wildest fiction. So he opts for doing a magazine article on the murders of the Clutter family, a kind of observation on what the murders did to the small community in Kansas. Interestingly enough, his secretary/assistant on the trip was his close friend Harper Lee (""To Kill a Mockingbird""). After the arrests of the two killers, Capote has a chance meeting with Perry, he is amazed at this ""cold blooded"" killer. Perry is not a violent mad dog killer, but an intelligent, peaceful and timid soul. Even during the savage killings, Perry did small things to comfort his victims. Capote can't help but sympathize with Perry and build a relationship with him (they do have a lot of things in common). Of course, part of this relationship is to get Perry to open up more and more to Capote, so Capote can get the information he needs to make his article into a book. There is a fine line in this relationship. You sense that Capote does have a compassionate feeling for Perry, even so far as hiring them an appellate lawyer. However, you also get the sense that Capote's motivation might be more commercial and business in purpose. As the story progresses, Capote starts to come to the realization of just how horrific these crimes were and that through his actions (getting the lawyer for them), he just might be letting two murderers go free. Moreover, he is constantly hounded by the two killers, who sense that he is their only friend and are relying on him for their own survival. Capote is in hell. Here is this book that will be his defining moment, but to finish it, he must stay involved in this perverse relationship with two savage killers. His life as come a long way from his happy days of endless parties in New York. Capote starts to drink excessively to escape the reality he has made for himself (and never stops). This movie is a very interesting character study and better get Hoffman a Oscar award for best actor, because he really does deserve it."

","'Capote' is an excellent film, in some ways as excellent as 'To Kill a Mockingbird', in that it makes you think about how we, personally and as a society, attempt to brush under the rug the disturbing events that force, if not indeed blast, their way into our lives.<br/><br/>Truman Capote becomes captivated by the senseless murder of four members of the Clutter family in November of 1959. He travels to Holcomb in Western Kansas with his good friend Harper Lee (Truman Capote was the inspiration for the character Charles 'Dill' Harris - the overly precocious and fey - Summer friend who lives next door to Jem and Scout in To Kill a Mockingbird) It is Harper who is able to allow Truman to enter into the world of Holcomb and after a time - Truman is questioning any and everyone he can about whom the murderers might be and why they would kill the Clutters. After the murderers are arrested - Truman befriends them and begins to write the book that will become 'In Cold Blood'. 'Capote' captures the strange relationship between Truman and Perry Smith - one of the two convicted murderers whose life resembles Capote's except - as Capote states: He walked out the front door of their mutually dismal upbringing and Perry walked out the back. <br/><br/>The book 'In Cold Blood' brought Capote the recognition he long sought but at what price.<br/><br/>Beautifully filmed and written. The acting is superb and Philip Seymour Hoffman is the incarnation of Capote - which should win him an Oscar - but since Capote is a small film it may not garner the support it so deserves. <br/><br/>One suggestion the film's final shot might have been a long shot of the broad Kansas horizon - (imitated by Manitoba's vast skyline) slowly closing in on the Clutter common grave where Kansas Bureau of Investigation detective Alvin Dewey coincidentally meets Laura Kinney. Dewey is there to visit a family member's grave and Laura was there to visit Nancy Clutter's grave - they were best friends and had planned on going to the University of Kansas together. Then a slow pull back capturing the wind as it blows over the high plains and events that can never be taken back. (This is how the book 'In Cold Blood' ends.)"
"Lechuguilla","Null","10","13","15 May 2006"," Hoffman's Terrific Performance
","This is a fine character study of Truman Capote whose professional desires collide with his personal desires, as he researches and writes about the 1959 murders of a Kansas family. The film examines how these conflicting desires arose, and how Capote, the person, handled the ordeal once he realized that these desires were mutually exclusive.<br/><br/>Hoffman mimics Capote's posture, voice, facial expressions, and overall mannerisms quite well. It's a great impersonation. But, towards the film's end when Capote has to say goodbye for the last time, Hoffman's portrayal of Capote's grief and helplessness goes well beyond parody. It's an example of genuine acting ability.<br/><br/>Other performances are also good, especially Chris Cooper as Prosecutor Alvin Dewey, and Catherine Keener as Capote's friend, Nelle Harper Lee. In addition to the fine acting, the story itself is gripping, because it is a true story. It's been told before, most convincingly in 1967's ""In Cold Blood"", from the POV of the killers. That film was photographed in B&W. ""Capote"", by contrast, is in color. But the colors are all muted, reassuringly so, in view of the subject matter. The tone of ""Capote"" is solemn and earnest, almost funereal. The pace is slow and deliberate. Music is restrained.<br/><br/>Viewers with little or no interest in the central character may find the first half of the film slow going. It plods along without a lot of tension or suspense. But as the writer bonds with the convicted killer, tension picks up, and then further builds en route to a profound destiny.<br/><br/>My only critique, beyond a slow beginning, pertains to the minimal attention given to era atmosphere. Given that the story takes place in the late 1950s and early to mid-1960s, I would have preferred more cinematic cues of that time period, especially with regard to music, decor, and cultural themes which are curiously absent, aside from obvious props like cars and telephones.<br/><br/>The Clutter killings were, and still are, unsettling and haunting, even after all these years. ""Capote"" is a high quality film that describes Truman Capote's research into the case, especially as regards the mindset and motivations of the killers, and further examines the effects that Capote's investigation had on him, both as a writer and as a human being with feelings. Though the story is good, Hoffman's wonderful performance is the real reason to see this film."
"Davidon80","6","9","12","12 August 2006"," Some what disjointed
","Prior to watching Capote I had very little exposure to the actual works of the writer, I have read Breakfast at Tiffanys and was not bowled over. However I approached the movie with optimism, I liked Philip Seymour Hoffman in movies like The Big Lebowski and was curious to see how a leading role would suit him. My feelings now having seen this movie is that he is and still remains a good supporting actor.<br/><br/>I understand that many feel his portrayal of Truman Capote was spot on and true to every nuance of Truman himself, but there is something about the movie which I feel doesn't do justice to the themes and the man who is being portrayed. The movie hinges on whether you can tolerate Truman Capote as a personality and it is my opinion that this is where the movie fails. Philip Sermour Hoffman portrays Capote as cold and career driven but has the emotional sensitivity to cry at his subjects execution. This alone is not enough to convince me that Capote is as complex and intelligent and perhaps scheming as the movie makes out.<br/><br/>Here is the main conflict of interest in the movie, at no point in the movie did the director sympathise with the murderers, neither did we feel Capote truly sympathise with the two men on death row, yet we are made to believe that Capote was battling with his conscience and by the end of the movie was eventually destroyed as a writer by his inability to come to terms with his actions towards these culprits. I have assumed this was the intended message of the movie but at no point is this battle of wills, or guilt ever portrayed on the screen. What we have is a very physical transformation of an actor into a Capote character that acts in a way that we assume reminds us of the great writer. There is no exploration of the theme of capital punishment, no reflection on the content of his novel 'In cold blood', no volley of ideas between subject and writer, but only a by numbers recount of events and perhaps a feeling of irritation towards Capote as a cowardly, egotistical, lime light hugging snob of the New York elite.<br/><br/>This is not award winning material, this is an average account of an interesting figure during an integral time in his career. Perhaps reading In Cold Blood would add some clarity to the subject but for a movie which seemed to promise so much in premise, it is disheartening that we have to go back to the source to make up our minds."
"fertilecelluloid","2","34","57","4 February 2006"," Stillborn, self-important Oscar bait
","This is one dreary, inert, self-important bore. When the only thing that suddenly gives a film life is a hanging, you know the venture is botched. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Truman Capote as a narcissistic, tic-ridden, self-indulgent, cartoon-voiced, insect-like caricature. Why he is this way is never explained and we get scant background information. The script focuses on Capote's writing of 'In Cold Blood' and his attachment to the damaged brothers who murdered a family of four. The acclaimed writer of 'To Kill A Mockingbird', Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), accompanies Capote in his initial inquires into the crime, and her presence immediately suggests a far more interesting subject for a biopic. Unfortunately, Lee is quickly sidelined in favor of endless scenes of Capote bemoaning his pained existence. Watching him is like watching Dr. Smith from 'Lost in Space' complain about his ""delicate back"" to anybody who will listen for two hours. The difference, however, is that Smith was fun to watch while Capote is not. The film's precious self-importance kills it, as does director Bennett Miller's reluctance to add any kind of shading. Like the morose piano score, the film is a one note wonder, providing no contrast, no emotional coloring, and no intimate drama. If Capote really was this irritating, why make a film about him and expect audiences to watch it? Though the supporting roles are well performed (Chris Cooper is his usual stalwart self), they serve such little dramatic purpose because, ultimately, it's all about Capote(!) Director Bennett and screenwriter Dan Futterman fail to emotionally engage their intended audience because they were clearly overwhelmed by the cultural baggage of Capote's ""legend"". Their product is stillborn Oscar bait...and is more evidence that one great genre pic has more ""truth"" in it than a dozen piles of oh-so-sincere crap like this."

","It's pretty rare to find yourself facing a screen, watching a film for the first time, and knowing without a single conceivable doubt that you are witnessing precious moments that are sure to define an actor's entire career. I felt this when watching Phillip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote. It is undeniably his best performance ever, and will be nearly impossible to top. He deserves an Oscar for this and his chances of winning are already more than excellent.<br/><br/>Capote is a movie that just keeps getting better with each passing minute. Dan Futterman, a friend of Hoffman's, wrote the movie, which is one reason why he expressed an interest in playing Capote. He has also said that another reason, the main reason he wanted to do it, even above the challenge of playing this eccentric and fascinating character, was that the story was just so good. As a movie fan I initially saw it for Hoffman's performance, and for the first half hour that's all I really needed, but as the plot continued I found my self drawn in deeper and deeper. It's really an absorbing film with intriguing characters and superb acting.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, I came for the acting, but I stayed for the story. Capote is one of 2005's highlights.<br/><br/>My rating: 10/10"
"RIK-22","3","22","38","13 February 2006"," Well made, but super boring
","Like many Oscar movies, which are nominated on merit for the technical art of film-making, there is little to no consideration to if the film is actually interesting.<br/><br/>I watched both Good Night & Good Luck and Capote recently and in both cases wished I hadn't bothered. It's not that there is anything technically wrong with either film; in fact they are both very well made. It's just that there is no entertainment, no emotion, and no passion at all. In fact they were both very boring and painful to watch.<br/><br/>In my opinion Capote was such a pointless film. How can anyone find this rather uninteresting tale of a period of someone's life that can only be described as rather dull; an interesting thing to watch.<br/><br/>Films can be intelligent, well acted and well made, but ultimately they have to give something to the viewer. This does not do that."
"noralee","8","10","15","31 October 2005"," A Slow But Chilling Portrayal of The Toll It Took To Understand the Horror
","""Capote"" opens up as a ghostly recreation. Trepidation and dread haunt the screen from the glimpses of the crime scene, deep in the heartland (Manitoba beautifully standing in for Kansas) where we gradually become aware of violence frozen in isolation, recalling that this crime helped set up the template for portrayals of horror.<br/><br/>The sudden shift to Truman Capote's milieu in New York City is a jarring juxtaposition but is equally spooky because with Philip Seymour Hoffman's brilliantly uncanny portrayal we are literally seeing an apparition. While it is a bit frustrating at first as we get almost no insight into what attracted Capote to the story, especially as we see the details of him getting organized, embarking on a long train ride into his heart of darkness and being initially brushed off by the locals, but the pay off eventually comes, if very slowly.<br/><br/>There's initial jokes on the puffed-up dandy in anti-wonderland who owes a great debt to his old Southern friend the soon to be noted novelist Harper Lee (a no nonsense Catherine Keener) for regularly puncturing his pretenses and briskly bridging the cultural gap so he can begin worming his way into the community's trust (and getting condescended to in return about her book and the movie adaptation and dryly dismissed by his lover as more ""manly"" than he is). <br/><br/>I didn't start to take seriously that the point of the film was ""In Cold Blood""s effect on him until we see him sneak into the funeral home and start to psychologically absorb the murders and challenge folks to take him seriously despite his way of talking and affected mannerisms.<br/><br/>A key transitional scene is almost bizarre when Capote's fame does help him here, as the wife of Chris Cooper's solid, clear-eyed, suspicious sheriff, Amy Ryan in a very atypical for her '50's housewife role, gushes over the writer in their midst (even though his books had been banned from the local library) and brokers credibility to get him crucial, exclusive contact with the still not charmed investigators and, suddenly, with one of the murderers. Amidst perfect recreations of the late '50's, we see Capote learn to manipulate his fame to get him further access, that is a harbinger of celebrity journalists to come.<br/><br/>The film then shifts to an extended ""Dead Man Walking"" chapter, as Capote enters into a symbiotic relationship with Perry Smith, seductively and captivatingly played by Clifton Collins Jr, particularly in the build up to trying to understand the actual crime. We see Capote begin to develop a new kind of journalism even before he writes a word as he gets personally involved in the physical, mental and legal health of the murderers -- all for the benefit of his book. Key actions of his recall the cynical reporter in Billy Wilder's acerbic ""Ace in the Hole (The Big Carnival),"" first released eight years before these events, as we see Capote intentionally lie, manipulatively get involved and selectively let out bits and pieces of his own past to get others to trust and confide in him. His life itself becomes a nonfiction novel.<br/><br/>But the last chapter of the film goes into unique territory, as we see the two worlds Capote has been experiencing collide in his head and take a toll on his relationships, productivity and health. The completion of the book has a relentless parallel with the cycles of justice and legal revenge with no spiritual release, just a book release, and self-aggrandizement, even as he invents a new form of personal reportage to great acclaim. The film searingly emphasizes the internal haunting Capote experiences, with his photographic recall, by leaving out that he did continue the public appearance of his wild ways, as 1966 was also the year of his notorious black and white masquerade ball. <br/><br/>The atmospheric music heightens the spooky feeling that there's more happening below the surface and helps keep us thinking. <br/><br/>The cinematography is exquisite throughout."

"your_only_belle","1","27","50","5 February 2006"," One of the worst and most boring films I've ever seen.
","First of all, I was expecting wonders with this film. I spent my ten dollars happily and expected a film better than Brokeback Mountain. I expected to be dazzled by Philip Seymour Hoffman because I was blown away by Heath Ledger, and so many critics seem to have chosen Hoffman over Ledger's amazing performance in Brokeback Mountain. I think my first mistake was allowing myself to have expectations. In no way did this film move or amaze me. I have just finished a film class and every aspect I had studied shone through (terribly) in this movie. The cinematography was, at times, completely flawed and fake, the music was simply awful, the plot was overly presented, and Hoffman annoyed me instead of capturing me. The movie is a little over 2 hours, but I felt it was five. The film is supposed to take place over a period of five years (they even skipped a year) but it seemed to drag on and on. Less than halfway through the film, I found myself bored and wondered when in the world it would end. The worst thing about the film was the extremely short scenes that would begin to offer a sparkle of good information about Capote's life, but instead stopped and left the viewer wondering what in the world just happened and why the scene even existed. Yes, Capote was a show-off and often a liar, but this was shown extremely poorly. Hoffman's effeminate voice and lisp were annoying, but I could look past it as this was Capote's real voice, but also, he over acted at times. Instead of being amazed, I was horrified. For some reason, the critics are in love with this man's performance, while I saw little that qualified this as ""the performance of his career"".<br/><br/>Truman Capote was one of the greatest writers of the 20th century and also one of my favorites. I was so excited when this film finally entered our theaters, but right now, I just want my money back. I'm sorry, Truman Capote, that such an important part of your life was cut to absolutely terrible dribble."
"keyslaw2","3","22","40","21 November 2005"," Pic about ""In Cold Blood"" is cold potatoes
","I've said for years that there are three classes of movies. The first class is comprised of movies that are pure art. They generate new thoughts in your mind or feelings in your heart. They affect you. The second class of movies are just nice stories. They're worth the ticket price for a couple of hours of escape-the-real-world entertainment. The third class of movie, of course, is that which is neither art nor a nice story. We've all seen one or two Class Three movies.<br/><br/>Like Truman Capote may have invented a new and wonderful style of writing, his namesake flick may have invented a new, fourth class of movie. Unlike the sensational ""In Cold Blood,"" I call this new class of movie the ""Shame."" Indeed, it's a shame that such a deep and creative subject, the writing of ICB, was wasted on such a cut-and-paste, one-dimensional picture.<br/><br/>For whatever reason, 46 years after Richard Hickock and Perry Smith entered a farmhouse in Holcomb, Kansas and murdered its occupants, the story of that awful night still intrigues many. Since that event, ""In Cold Blood"" was written, a blockbuster 1967 movie was made, a 1996 television mini-series was produced, and countless other television specials have aired. In fact, in a recent newspaper article easily available over the internet, the present owners of the Clutter house complain that their farm is visited by hundreds of Capote fans each year.<br/><br/>Taking all of this into account, it stands to reason that ""Capote's"" audience will be made up largely of people who have read--or even studied--""In Cold Blood."" Although the movie is not about the murders, but about Capote's writing about them, ICB-ites will be disappointed to find ""Capote"" plays fast and loose with the facts.<br/><br/>To begin with, Nancy Clutter's body was discovered by Nancy Ewalt and Susan Kidwell, not the fictitious Laura Kinsey. ICB readers will also see that Bobby Rupp has been replaced by some vague character named ""Danny."" Even more offensive is some interview (the only one of its kind in a movie about researching and writing a book) the movie stages between Capote and Kinsey in which Kinsey hands over Nancy Clutter's diary. Any researcher will tell you that Kansas Bureau of Investigation Agent Alvin Dewey turned over the diary. So does common sense: after all, are we really to believe that after discovering Nancy's bloody body, ""Laura Kinsey"" rushed back into the house and grabbed the diary? And speaking of that house, it's worth noting that the house--just some old farmhouse--depicted in ""Capote"" looks nothing like the real Clutter house, many pictures of which are readily available on the internet and in which the original 1967 movie was filmed. I don't know how much money was spent on making ""Capote,"" but it appears that a ticket to and a few nights in Holcomb, Kansas talking to the people the real Capote interviewed were not in the budget.<br/><br/>The list of inaccuracies goes on and on. As anyone will read in the Lawrence World Journal's 45th anniversary series on the crimes, Alvin Dewey, the consummate politician, became quite close and remained close to Capote. Indeed, the newspaper is flush with photos of Capote and the Deweys. Perry Smith, as the real Capote notes, although uneducated, was very conscious of his grammar and would have never spoken in the manner his character presents in ""Capote."" ""The Corner"" part of ICB is full of dialogue with Richard Hickock, who, in the movie is so ignored by Capote that he conspicuously sulks. The biggest fraud of all, however, is that the movie puts Truman Capote at Smith's execution. Capote, as is well-documented, attended Hickock's hanging but couldn't bear to watch Smith drop into eternity.<br/><br/>The flow of the movie is rough and unnatural as well. Everybody knows that each scene in a movie is a building block for the climax, but in well-written pics, the scenes flow together and the audience doesn't think of each scene as mere construction work. In ""Capote,"" quite the opposite is true: each scene and the dialogue therein accomplish only what is necessary and, having made their point,hastily move on.<br/><br/>Finally--and my reader now probably thinks I just can't be pleased--I have to comment on the story itself. Is this about Truman being attracted to Perry Smith? If so, why was he attracted? Was it the way Smith asked him for aspirin that made him find Smith so stunning? How did Alvin Dewey morph from a man offended by Capote's cavalier attitude toward whether he solved the case to being Capote's friend, shepherding him through the investigation? What made Dewey--in one minute--move from nearly threatening Capote to allowing him to review his notes? None of this is answered.<br/><br/>What is the point of this movie? I guess it was to show that Capote felt guilty about not doing more to save the life of Perry Smith. First of all, the movie is unclear about whether Capote really tried to get Smith a second attorney and had anything to feel guilty about in the first place. Second, if the movie wants to tell us Capote felt guilty, it needs a lot more than Harper Lee's one liner telling Capote ""You didn't really want to save him."" Good advice to screenwriters: Don't tell us your message. Show us your message. The message of a good movie does not come from a line delivered by or to the protagonist. It is made obvious in far more subtle ways.<br/><br/>At the heart of a story based on truth is the truth. If a movie maker wants to give their movie any credibility, they should research the facts first. Not to do so gives rise to a shame.<br/><br/>/s/Jack Bridges Key Largo, Florida"

","I have watched the movie after (and only because) the academy awards. I can't deny Hoffman's amazing performance. But I also can't deny how boring the movie is. I am interested in Drama movies and I tend to like most of them but this one is HORRIBLE. It's too long for its frivolous story. The events in the movie are not coherent. We don't even know what kind of relationship was born between the two men. Was it friendship between two men, or friendship from one side while Capote loved him.<br/><br/>In short, the whole plot is weak, the movie is boring and extremely slow. The only positive is Hoffman's performance but your impression will last 15 minutes then you get bored of it. It's a MUST AVOID movie for everyone. Trust me on this."
"dfranzen70","4","17","30","10 February 2006"," Grandstanding piffle
","To begin with, how you feel about Capote the movie will depend almost entirely on how you feel about Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of him. Some will find his highly mannered performance to be highly grating, while others will note that that's how the real Capote looked and sounded.<br/><br/>I fall into the former group. I just couldn't stomach Hoffmann's high-pitched whine. I also didn't care for the breakneck editing, or even the long, tiresome shots of nothing in particular happening. I felt the movie was pretty poorly put together, to be quite frank about it.<br/><br/>Although it's a biography of the writer, the film covers the time Capote spent researching and writing his magnum opus, In Cold Blood, from his assignment by The New Yorker to cover the legal proceedings to the final publication of his ""nonfiction novel,"" several years later. The focus is on Capote's relationship with the murderers of the title, particularly Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.). Capote figures if he gets close to Smith and Dick Hickock, he'll get information he can use in his book. Is he using the killers, or does he really care for him? You wouldn't know from a movie whose script has Capote constantly talking about himself, no matter what the topic is. What, you killed four people in their beds? Pshaw, you should hear about my upbringing. And on it goes.<br/><br/>As I said, Hoffman's performance is quite mannered - some might say flamboyant - and there will no doubt be plenty of you out there who will think he was spot on, quite a show, and all that. And there will be plenty others who think about five minutes of hearing him ""talk Capote"" would be about four minutes too long.<br/><br/>So on to the others in the cast. Catherine Keener, who's been so great in movies like Being John Malkovich and The Interpreter, acts circles around Hoffman. Yes, circles. Keener plays novelist Harper Lee, she of To Kill a Mockingbird fame, and she absolutely disappears into the role - with two exceptions, her dazzling, dancing eyes. Keener is superb, clearly deserving of her Oscar nomination. Lee has a pretty good idea of what Capote's all about, as does his lover, Jack Dunphy (Bruce Greenwood). Chris Cooper is along as the sheriff in charge of the case, and Bob Balaban is Capote's publisher.<br/><br/>There's far too much focus on the Wonder That Is Truman Capote for a film that insists on covering only one period in his life. Capote is manipulative, egotistical, and constantly condescending. Not an appealing guy, to be sure. And that's fine, but we never really get a sense of what he was about, just how this one event affected him.<br/><br/>Interminable and overwrought, Capote is not worthy of its many accolades."
"bkoganbing","9","4","5","19 March 2006"," Philip Seymour Capote
","I finally got to see the Best Actor performance of Philip Seymour Hoffman as the late writer and icon Truman Capote. It's based on the biography published in the Eighties entitled Capote by Gerald Clarke.<br/><br/>The only part of the book the film deals with is the creation and completion of Capote's landmark docunovel In Cold Blood. And the film is remarkably faithful to the details described in the book. In 1959 in his Brooklyn Heights apartment, Truman Capote read about the slaying of a Kansas family named Clutter in some small town called Holcomb. He decides to go west and investigate every aspect of this gruesome tragedy. That includes numerous interviews with both the suspects that are eventually caught, tried, and convicted.<br/><br/>With one of them, Perry Smith, Capote forms a strange relationship as he tries to get the real story about what happened in that Kansas farm house that night in 1959 by the only two left who can tell it. And Smith who is flattered by all the attention this celebrity is giving him. It's sad, but Perry Smith becomes almost a celebrity by reflection at a time when he's facing execution. Clifton Collins, Jr. plays Smith and it's a subtle piece of acting he does. We see a lost little boy in those scenes with Capote in prison, but we also never forget this man is a stone cold killer who went to this farm house in the mistaken belief that Mr. Clutter had squirreled away a large sum of cash because he didn't trust banks. <br/><br/>Not as foolish as you might think. In the generation before during the Depression when banks did fail, a lot of people lost their faith in financial institutions. In fact an uncle and aunt of mine had that happen to them before they passed on the last decade.<br/><br/>But the film belongs to Philip Seymour Hoffman. I first saw Hoffman on screen playing Scotty G in Boogie Nights. It was also a gay character, but light years from the sophisticated and glamorous Truman Capote. Scotty G was the backward kid who crushes out big time on Mark Wahlberg in Boogie Nights. Hoffman is an player of extraordinary range to successfully essay both Capote and Scotty G.<br/><br/>This was an extraordinary year in the Academy Awards with nominations going to performers who played real life people. Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash, George Clooney as Edward R. Murrow, and Philip Seymour Hoffman as Truman Capote. And every one of them gave a performance that made me think I was seeing old film clips of their characters.<br/><br/>I recommend the film. As a story it can stand on its own. But I also recommend highly the book by Gerald Clarke. For those of you liked the film and like Philip Seymour Hoffman in the part, the biography Capote is a fascinating read, a glimpse into gay America, both pre and post the Stonewall Riots. And it's a good social history of the times."
"roger-pettit1","6","5","7","21 May 2012"," A good film that is dominated by Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance in the title role
","""Capote"" is a curate's egg of a film: it is very good in some parts, not so good in others. It is a complex movie that is somewhat unbalanced by the unquestionably excellent performance of Philip Seymour Hoffman. Hoffman dominates proceedings to such an extent that his performance tends to detract from other aspects of the film. <br/><br/>The film covers a period of 6 years from the very end of the 1950s to the early years of the 1960s. Writer Truman Capote (Hoffman) has already gained literary success and prestige with his book ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"". Basking in the adulation that has come his way as a result of that work, he becomes interested in a violent murder that has occurred in Kansas in which two young men have seemingly killed an entire family. One of them, Perry Smith (played by Clifton Collins Jr.), is a thoughtful person who is reticent about the precise details of the crime. Capote travels to Kansas with childhood friend, Nelle Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), the writer of the Pulitzer prizewinning novel ""To Kill a Mockingbird"". They begin research on a book that Capote is planning to write on the murder. (The book is subsequently published under the title ""In Cold Blood"".) As part of this research, Capote is granted personal access to the two men, who are imprisoned while the court process is under way. His relationship with Smith becomes a very close one as a result of his interviews with him. The film examines the conflict of interests that Capote has to confront: his burgeoning loyalty to, and friendship with, Smith; and his desire to complete his book at all costs and the impact that that has on their relationship and on Capote himself.<br/><br/>The crisis of conscience that Capote faces is portrayed very effectively. The conclusion of the film is extremely moving. And, although Hoffman is undoubtedly the star, the other leading actors are all excellent. There are, however, some problems with the film. In particular, it is at times turgid and very slow-moving. I was extremely bored on a number of occasions. The film also labours its main point, which is that an artist may have to trade humanity for ruthlessness if he or she is ever to get their job done satisfactorily. <br/><br/>So, ""Capote"" is a reasonably good film, but is certainly not a great one. It has given me the urge to read ""In Cold Blood"", which I suspect is rather better than this film is. 6/10."
"Camera-Obscura","Null","5","7","7 November 2006"," Not very gripping, but watchable, mainly because of Philip Seymour Hoffman
","I must admit Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance is impressive and he IS dead on as Truman Capote, with all his typical mannerisms, his nasal whiny voice, the way he held his cigarette. But as far as I'm concerned, these Oscar-worthy performances are of minor importance if an intriguing story is lacking, especially for a film as cold and distant as this one. There wasn't a single moment that really stood out, that really grabbed me by the collar. Just about everything about the film seems perfect, great performances all around, great cinematography some sharp observations, but the result is - contrary to what director Bennett Miller claims - very sedating. Basically the approach was, 'let's keep it simple.' In many cases, this is a wise tactic, but I longed and kept waiting for a gripping story, that never took of.<br/><br/>When Truman Capote befriended Perry Miller, one of the killers, I expected some kind of confrontation between them. There was a certain build-up, a tension, but in the end of the film, their relationship halted. No show-down or deeper character development. It just seemed to fade away.<br/><br/>Perhaps CAPOTE is just a little too perfect. Based on the usual criteria, it's hard to dismiss the film, but I stopped caring about these screen biographies (I know it's not a screen bio, strictly speaking) coming out of Hollywood. Watch it for Philip Seymour Hoffman, but don't expect much fireworks.<br/><br/>Camera Obscura --- 6/10"
"Jamester","8","18","35","12 September 2005"," Capote -- wonderful opening sequences
","Overall, this is a good movie with some good acting moments and strong narrative. It was refreshing to watch the Capote character (wonderfully played by Philip Seymour Hoffman) come to life. In fact the opening sequences of the movie do a great job in setting the visual and period tone of the movie -- you quickly get a sense of societal views to blacks and gays in the 60s US. Very important given this is a historical piece that takes an in-depth look at the case and events leading to the writing of Capote's book, 'In Cold Blood'. It's told with suspense and holds the audience easily to the end.<br/><br/>There were allusions to a 'love story' between Capote and one of the characters. I would have liked to see this aspect of the story fleshed out a little more, but still, there was enough in it to make its point.<br/><br/>Overall, this was a good showing with a strong narrative, entertaining character interactions, and strong acting. I haven't read 'In Cold Blood', but for those who are interested in this, or of seeing a slice of Harper Lee's on the screen, this would be worth seeing."
"FreeFallFlow","1","14","26","3 May 2006"," empty film!
","Well, the question is....what is in this film? Nothing. The characters are completely shallow, and the film speaks about only one (and not really credible) aspect of Capote's life, which i believe, was much more interesting than this. The infatuation of Capote for this murderer, who was obviously guilty of the killing of four people, is not understandable. The actor who plays Perry Smith is ridiculous, his acting seems to consist on stupid mimics on his face, like blinking with one eye five times in a row, and oh, he is a brilliant drawer, how incredible. Philip Seymour Hoffman is usually a good actor, but he overplays the homosexual character with an unbearable voice and mimics. The things is, nothing in this movie is credible. A convict that supposedly has a great depth (he looks up in the dictionary how hung convicts die; it's time you knew about your fate, man!)but who looks like a perfect creep is something difficult to link to Capote's interest for him. And then, since it's an American movie, we HAVE to see the morbid of the death sentence, the hanging with shaky body and everything, and Capote who is supposedly ""in love"" with this Perry Smith while he lets him down and does not seem to suffer that much about the forthcoming death of him (when he learns about the verdict via Smith's voice, he just says 'I'm sorry'...). Just the fact that he finds some food for thought in this man we can only have contempt for, is irritating; at least in the way it is narrated. I didn't believe anything of what the director and the actors tried to make the audience feel. I found it was an empty movie that stays in the surface and explores nothing of its characters' personality."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","6","9","4 March 2006"," An absolutely first class performance
","The summary line is essentially what one local critic asserts. I'll try to answer that at the end of my comments.<br/><br/>But first to the performance. Until recently, most people recognize Philip Seymour Hoffman, if at all, from his supporting roles in ""The talented Mr. Ripley"", ""Almost famous"", ""Red Dragon"", ""Cold Mountain"" etc. I have been fortunate to see his almost flawless performance as a compulsive gambler in ""Owning Mahowny"" (2003), for which he should have got at least an Oscar nomination. That excellent movie, unfortunately, went almost unnoticed, attracting only 61 user comments in IMDb.<br/><br/>In a recent ""60 Minutes"" interview, Hoffman (or some called ""the other Hoffman"") intimated that he does not want to be a celebrity because that takes something away from his ability to be whatever the character he happens to be portraying. He quoted a very convincing case: his close friends watching his performance will not see the same thing as a member of the general audience sees. We only have to think about Tom Cruise to realise how true this is - have you ever seen a Tom Cruise movie in which you don't remember that it's Cruise who is on the screen. There may be some exceptions when you have an actor in the calibre of the other Tom. Hoffman may well be an actor of such a calibre but what he said in the interview shows how much of a professional he is.<br/><br/>I won't say anything more about Hoffman because if you are in the least interested in movies, you would have already been tired of reading comments on how he inhibits Trueman Capote, even when it's all so true. I'd rather look at the movie itself instead.<br/><br/>Its premises alone makes this movie intriguingly fascinating. When was the last time you saw an eccentric but brilliant writer pitched against a to-be-convicted murderer, each trying to use the other? This is almost like watching the struggle in the baseball pit, with the pitcher and the batter maneuvering to outsmart each other. Capote wants to get Perry Smith to tell him about that fateful night when Smith and Hickock (who received little attention in this movie) murdered a family in Kansas in cold blood during a robbery. Smith clings on to Capote as his savior. The subtle battle is on.<br/><br/>Despite a pitiable childhood, Smith is a cold blooded killer. Even his own sister warns Capote that under the sensitive and sympathy-winning appearance, his brother is not to be trusted and can kill any one without blinking. Capote, on the other hand, dangles the carrot of getting the best lawyer while all the time aims straight at getting Smith to tell him first-hand what happened on the fateful night. Then, as we are almost ready to believe his tearful plead (to himself essentially) that he couldn't have done anything to save the life of the murderers, his best friend, honest, sensible (and almost just as good a write in her own right) Harper Lee (Catherine Keener) tells him, quietly and calmly ""But the truth is, you didn't want to"", because only the execution will allow Capote to complete his book.<br/><br/>The beauty of the movie is that it retains the ambiguity. We do not know for sure, one way or the other, whether the two had indeed developed a genuine friendship over the six years from the arrest to the execution. We do see a dissymmetry. During his six years in prison, Smith's only real meaningful connection with the outside world is Capote. To Capote, however, Smith is only a part (albeit a very important part) of his life. The movie makers make sure that we remember this, by showing intervening scenes of Capote being the centre of attention, as he always is, to a crowd of admirers, monopolising a self-indulging conversation, always ""in love with himself"", as Lee once put it. At the end of one of these scene, after another round of roaring laughters, Capote turns to one of the loyal listeners and quipped ""And what have you been doing lately?"" More roaring laughters in approval of his sense of humour. There's our man. And yet, in the end, we are left wondering if Capote had really been touch by this whole incident and the eventual death of Smith, thanks to the superb portrayal by Hoffman.<br/><br/>While most of the scenes are indoors, there are, well placed throughout the movie, beautiful shots of the expansive heartland, often with a tiny object (because of the distance), a car or a train, moving slowing across the horizon, accentuating a sense of loneliness.<br/><br/>So, Hoffman aside, is this a good movie? You bet."
"richardmeadfsu","9","2","2","8 November 2017"," One-man band
","Short and sweet: Capote is a stark and perfectly visualized work that highlights film's most underrated actor, Philip Seymour Hoffman, in all of his character-actor glory.<br/><br/>I love this film for two reasons mainly: Hoffman's literally perfect performance in his portrayal of a complex journalist, Truman Capote, and the (also) perfect cinematography and editing. This is a bleak and mature picture that takes its audience as smart individuals who can make decisions on their opinion on characters by themselves. Each actor gives a very human performance, which is refreshing.<br/><br/>The only thing that stops this from being a 10/10 is it does tend to drag a bit in certain spots, and I believe a good 15 minutes could have been trimmed from the run time. But, in the same breathe, I can see others defending that the extra time (used primarily to show Capote's personal life) lends to character depth.<br/><br/>All in all, great film that primarily services the film snob, which is OK with me."
"avik-basu1889","9","2","2","7 October 2015"," A complicated man investigates a complicated crime !!!
","'Capote' directed by Bennett Miller is based on Gerald Clarke's biography 'Capote'. It stars Philip Seymour Hoffman as the titular Truman Capote and also Catherine Keener as Harper Lee, Clifton Collins Jr. as Perry Smith and Chris Cooper as Alvin Dewey. Capote notices an account of a horrific crime involving the murder of an entire family named the Clutters in Kansas on the newspaper. He decides to write a non-fiction novel on the mentioned real event and so he goes to Kansas to gather more and more information about the case. While he is in Kansas, the two murderers namely Perry Smith and Dick Hickock get caught and he starts visiting them in jail.<br/><br/>I had already seen Richard Brooks' film 'In Cold Blood' which is directly based on Capote's novel of the same name which he ended up writing about the mentioned crime. So, I was already aware of the basic aspects of the story and the plot. But, while Brooks' film was a film that told the story by following Perry and Dick on their journey, 'Capote' is a film where the story gets told with Truman Capote being at the center of the narrative. Although having said that, Bennett Miller never resorts to melodramatic means to make us relate to Capote or humanise him. To a great extent, this is a story told in a subjective way about an idiosyncratic individual. His actions and decisions can be interpreted in various ways.<br/><br/>As a viewer the first impression of Truman Capote that I got when I started watching the film was one of unrestricted narcissism. Capote clearly was a narcissist. He paid people to throw him compliments in front of friends. He always had to be the center of all gossip in his social gatherings, etc. The reasons behind his obsession with compliments and hogging the limelight in his gatherings could have roots in his childhood. The trauma and the extreme hardships he faced during his childhood made him insecure. So even though he achieved success using his intellect through his writing, he could never let go of his past and his insecurities which led to him becoming a huge narcissist. <br/><br/>I think it is hinted that Capote became so obsessed with the newspaper account of the Clutter murders because it gave him an opportunity to spend some time in a place like Kansas which will remind him of his childhood in Alabama. Then he comes into contact with Perry Smith and Dick Hickcock, the murderers when they get caught by the police. Capote becomes more and more intrigued by Perry in particular. Through their conversations and his research, Capote manages to notice an uncanny similarity in the nature of his own and Perry's childhood and the manner in which both of them were brought up. Capote becomes so interested, that he even gets them a lawyer to help the 2 convicts with their appeal after they are sentenced to death. Now the complexity of Truman Capote's nature and the film's plot as a whole comes to the forefront after Capote and Perry start opening up to each other. Why Capote starts visiting Perry more and more frequently can be up for debate. On one hand some will say that his sole priority was to gain the confidence of Perry, so that he would divulge everything about the crime which would immensely help Capote to enrich his novel with more intricate details. One the other hand, some might say that he genuinely fell in love with Perry and cared for him. But I believe both view points are justified. He certainly did manipulate Perry into telling him things for the sake of his novel, but I also couldn't help but sense the development of a romantic attachment between them. This duality in the nature of his relationship with Perry, in the end drives Capote to complete emotional breakdown, when he juggles between wanting Perry and Dick to hang so that he could finish his novel and his actual compassion towards Perry. This morality test ends up breaking him emotionally and we see him reduced to tears when he faces Perry minutes before his hanging. He cries because he realises that maybe he had compromised his morality by using Perry for his novel. The fact that Capote couldn't finish any other book after 'In Cold Blood' shows how much of an effect these circumstances had on him. Clearly the hanging of Perry crushed him. The funny thing is although Capote wallows in sorrow with the hanging, I'm not sure the viewers will do the same, as after all Perry was still a murderer.<br/><br/>Philip Seymour Hoffman can never be admired enough for his turn as Truman Capote. He could have easily been very annoying with the peculiar voice and the mannerism. But that never happens because instead of mimicking Capote, he completely internalises him and becomes the character. I could only see Capote on screen, not Hoffman, and that is fantastic. Clifton Collins Jr. as Perry Smith is also brilliant. I think Catherine Keener as Harper Lee and Chris Cooper are a bit underused in the film.<br/><br/>Bennett Miller has a very characteristic way of portraying peculiar characters by keeping the viewer at a distance. His films follow these characters, they are never from these characters' points of view. He leaves it open for the viewer to interpret and come up with reasons to justify the actions of the characters in his films without judging them on his own. Truman Capote in the film is neither glorified nor portrayed as an evil human being. He is just portrayed as a complicated man with issues. <br/><br/>'Capote' isn't the generic biopic which wants the viewer to fall in love with its protagonist. Bennett Miller captures a few crucial years in the life of a complicated man and asks us to make up our own minds about what he truly was like. Highly Recommended !!!"
"foreverairofmystery","9","2","2","13 February 2014"," Review of Capote
","The creation of one of the most memorable books of the 1960s -- and the impact the writing and research would have on its author -- is explored in this drama based on a true story. In 1959, Truman Capote (played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman) was a critically acclaimed author who had earned a small degree of celebrity for his own work, when he read a newspaper item about the murder of a small town family in Kansas. For some reason the story intrigued Capote, and he asked William Shawn (Bob Balaban), his editor at The New Yorker, to let him write a piece about the case. Capote had long believed that in the right hands, a true story could be molded into a tale as compelling as any fiction, and he believed that this event, in which the brutal and unimaginable was visited upon a community where it was least expected, could be just the right material. Capote finds himself, throughout the movie, forced to confront the moral implications of his actions with regards to both his role in the case, and the way that he would be remembered. Most of the story takes place in a small town in Kansas, though scenes of it are in Capote's various residences. He is accompanied to Kansas by his close friend, Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), herself becoming a major literary figure with the success of To Kill A Mockingbird. While Capote's effete and mannered personal style stuck out like a sore thumb in Kansas, in time he gained the trust of Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper), the Kansas Bureau of Investigation (KBI) agent who was leading the investigation into the murder of the Clutter Family, and with his help Capote's magazine piece grew into a full-length book. Capote also became familiar with the petty criminals who killed the Clutter Family, Dick Hickock (Mark Pellegrino <3) and Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.), and in Smith he found a troubling kindred spirit more like himself than he wanted to admit. Capote also co-stars Bruce Greenwood as Capote's longtime companion Jack Dunphy, and Amy Ryans as Mary Dewey, Alvin's wife who became a confidante of Capote's. Capote is as much about the relationships and the morals behind Truman Capote's (and any other reporter or author) actions while researching for his book, In Cold Blood. The pace could be described as a bit too slow for the average movie goer, and after the movie is nearly half over, it feels like it is coming to an early end. Most people would back out, finding the story evolving too torpidly for their liking, but those who sludge through the low-paced beginning, will be pleasantly surprised when the pace picks up and the movie becomes even more captivating than it previously was. Right from the start, Capote shows off Hoffman's astonishing acting skills. His performance is more than awe-striking, further demonstrating his ability to make us believe that we are watching a documentary, where he is not an actor - in fact that character is not a character at all – it is the subject playing themselves in a story of their lives. Hoffman has a talent, with those fluttering gestures, the rolling eyes and the voice simultaneously soft and high-pitched, the sense of egotism and defiant confidence. When the movie first started, I was not sure that I would be fond of it. Actually, I was positive that I would not like it at all. Capote isn't the sort of movie that I would pick out on my own, and it isn't the type of movie that I usually enjoy. I believed that it would be a pretentious and saucy flick about an arrogant and annoying writer that I wouldn't relate too in the slightest. Let's just say I was proved wrong. Truman Capote, despite being egotistical and morally unjust on occasion, is a character that I grew to sympathize with throughout the film, and the film itself was so brilliantly done, I fell in love with the camera work as much as the writing. The thing that caught me more than the talented camera work, or the captivating storyline and plot, was the writing and acting of the movie's 'villains.' I always say that if a movie can make me feel sympathetic for the person that I am supposed to see as a bad guy, it's done a good job, and this movie did more than make me a bit sympathetic. Mark Pellingro (who played Dick Hickok), did an amazing job of playing a cool and collected criminal, who had never actually killed anyone, and would never show how much he cared about his friend. Clifton Collins Jr. (who played Perry Smith) was the baking soda that made this delicious cake of a movie rise, though. He took the lines and the script that was given to him, and a character that he was chosen to play, and he did amazing things. I have fallen in love with many a villain in my lifetime, but I think this is the first time I have ever actually sobbed for them, and believe me, did I sob when Perry Smith died at the end of the film."

","I write this review, as I found out that actor Philip Seymour died. R.I.P.<br/><br/>This was one of the excellent films which came out in 2005.<br/><br/>Amazingly plot deals with death and death sentence. When you deal with a subject of death it has a way of creeping into your life, which it was well portrayed in the film Capote. Capote, although trying to stay neutral in his tryout of writing a book about prisoners and death sentence, he is drawn into it. You simply can not stay out of that horrible circle in which you are drawn when working on such a subject.<br/><br/>No wonder Philip won an Oscar for the portrayal of Capote, he does it so well. The moment when he tells us that scarf he is wearing is of a certain brand will always stay in my mind.<br/><br/>It is a must see, especially with a demise of Philip, for he has left a masterpiece behind."

"rbloom333","4","2","2","29 November 2008"," Gripping
","Bennett Miller's biopic about author Truman Capote and based on the Arthur Clarke biography of the same name. The film focuses on Capote's time spent researching the killing of a family in Kansas at the end of the 50's which would later be the subject of Capote's classic ""non-fiction"" novel In Cold Blood, which quickly rocketed the young writer to super-stardom. The film's structure is a bit perplexing; a film could easily be made from a number of segments in Capote's fascinating life and this version chooses to elaborate on the 10 years he spent on this particular work, which is essentially the middle of his life. This period certainly yields a lot of interesting material, yet I feel that those who have not read Clarke's biography may feel a little lost as there is very little context included. The most awesome facet of the film is Phillip Seymour Hoffman's incredible impersonation of Capote; he managed to capture all of the complexity and vulnerability of Capote's character, and the film is very interesting in revealing how the young writer's efforts on this project may have ultimately destroyed him.<br/><br/>The film is very engaging and often disturbing. However, a few inaccuracies are worth mentioning. The film seems to depict Capote as being uncaring and disinterested in Dick, the less intelligent of the two killers, yet the biography makes it clear that Capote devoted a great deal of attention to both killers as they awaited execution, despite his clear affection for Perry. Also, the film indicates that In Cold Blood's reception was universal acclaim; quite the contrary, many mainstream reviewers and writers such as Norman Mailer denied the book's literary merits. And thirdly, the title card at the end of the film states that In Cold Blood made Truman Capote the most famous writer in America (which is disputable), and that he never finished another book, which is blatantly false. Capote published Music for Chameleons in 1980, a collection of short stories clearly conceived as a complete book. Despite these problems, Capote is a very compelling film, and Hoffman's performance is one of his best yet."

","The film's title suggests that this is a ""biopic"", but on hearing the plot - Capote's experience of writing his ""non-fiction novel"" about a Kansas murder - it is natural to think, how can this be a biopic if it only deals with a four-year period in Capote's life? What about Breakfast at Tiffany's? His sexuality? His premature death? <br/><br/>Yet on watching the film it becomes clear: Capote's experience in this time, and his relationship with the murderer, characterises his entire life and identity. A brilliant, intelligent treatment of the life of a brilliant, intelligent man.<br/><br/>Capote says in the film that he hopes ""In Cold Blood"" can define a new type of novel. It could be argued that this film defines a new type of biopic."
"Buddy-51","9","2","2","14 February 2006"," chilling and complex psychological study of the author
","With his trademark curling lisp, high-pitched, squeaky voice and flamboyant mannerisms, it would have been easy for almost any actor to build a portrayal of Truman Capote on a foundation of studied mimicry and impersonation alone. But in ""Capote,"" Phillip Seymour Hoffman goes far beyond surface recreation, plumbing the core of the inner man and bringing him to palpable life on the screen. Most eloquent in his silences, Hoffman mesmerizes us with his performance.<br/><br/>Based on a book by Gerald Clarke, ""Capote"" deals with the period in which the author struggled through to create his literary masterpiece, ""In Cold Blood,"" a book he claimed as the beginning of a whole new genre of writing, the ""nonfiction novel."" In November 1959, a family of four was brutally slaughtered in their Kansas farmhouse by two drifters in search of cash, Richard Hickock and Perry Smith. Capote, a successful writer and bon vivant of the literati set in Manhattan, found himself drawn to the case, venturing to the heart of the country with his lifelong friend, Harper Lee (author of ""To Kill a Mockingbird""), to interview the accused killers and try to make some sense of the whole thing. The screenplay by Dan Futterman zeroes in with stiletto-like precision on the complex relationship that develops between Capote and Perry, the more ""sensitive"" of the two killers. Capote is drawn to this man in so powerful a fashion that even he is unable to figure out exactly why. Is it because he senses something in Perry's past that reminds him of his own (both suffered from abandonment issues), thus creating a sort of kinship between them? Is he attracted to Perry sexually and romantically? Or is he being subtly manipulated by an evil man who senses in this author a weakness and vulnerability he can exploit for his own nefarious purposes? It is a tribute to the complexity of the film-making that we feel that none of these and all of these possibilities may be true simultaneously. And what is so great about Hoffman's performance is that he builds on this ambiguity. We are never entirely sure if Capote truly cares for Perry or if he is merely using him to get what he needs for the book. And the way Hoffman plays him, Capote never seems quite sure either. He is obviously drawn to Perry with a sort of grim fascination, as anyone might be who encounters a person whose actions are as inexplicable and yet larger-than-life as Perry's. But when it all becomes too much for Capote and he begins to ignore Perry's demands for attention, is he doing so out of indifference or disgust at himself for being so drawn to this person in the first place? Is this fascination with Perry revealing dark truths about Capote that the man himself is unwilling or unable to acknowledge? The film never answers those questions - as well it shouldn't.<br/><br/>Clifton Collins Jr. is also very powerful as Perry, providing the sensitivity and charisma the character needs to make the story convincing. In a rich performance as Harper Lee, Catherine Keener serves as the moral center of gravity to which Capote must continually return in order to finish his work and maintain his grip on reality.<br/><br/>In his first non-documentary film, Bennett Miller demonstrates remarkable control as a director. His spare film-making style perfectly reflects not only the harsh Midwest setting but the chamber-like drama that is unfolding within it. It is a very ""interior"" film, and Miller is not afraid to linger long on his scenes, allowing the actors free rein in establishing their rhythms and building the drama.<br/><br/>Although come Oscar night, I will be rooting for Heath Ledger to take home the trophy (I believe his performance in ""Brokeback Mountain"" is the high point of acting in recent times), I will certainly understand it if the Academy chooses to honor Hoffman's work here instead. It would definitely be my second choice."
"leppakt","10","2","2","15 December 2005"," A penetrating performance by Hoffman
","Hoffman disappears within this character and a depth of emotions filtered to the portrayal of Capote to evoke an insight of unspoken thought and emotion meandering their way within around and beyond the dialogue of this screen play. The direction and editing are patient and ponient and the score and cinematography are a treasure to behold. <br/><br/>The story illuminates the callous nature of the focus of popular writers who are driven by the determination to express their creativity and have a somewhat disassociated and dispassionate relationship with the subjects of their work. Ethical compromises and their impact and ramifications are what are examined here in a portrayal of a seeming detachment between the dispassion of the drive to accomplish and achieve and the compassion of Capote for a convicted mass murder of four.<br/><br/>This is a powerful performance at the center of the film, and definitely worthy of Oscar consideration."

","If Phillip Seymour Hoffman does not get the Oscar for best actor, there is no justice. His total immersion portrayal of the brilliant but haunted child-like genius writer Truman Capote is a living homage to the late author. I sat in a small venue, so mesmerized was I that I was leaning forward in my seat propping an elbow on the back of the seat in front of me. I was with a friend, and the theater was lightly occupied. You could have heard a pin drop in there. Even the munching of popcorn or slurping of soda was kept to a minimum, nobody wanted to miss a line, or be distracted and miss a gesture.<br/><br/>The laughter from the audience was genuine, not mocking and very savvy. I was in a good group that afternoon.<br/><br/>The angst and dread and anxiety and the conflicting emotions of pride and revulsion mixed liberally with a sexual undercurrent so strong you would feel like being in a rip-tide, yet he knows his subject matter must die in order to fulfill his destiny as the first writer of ""true crime"" genre nonfiction.<br/><br/>You can taste the drinks, smell the cigarettes, see the depression overwhelm him as he realizes he must hope for death to consummate evolution to another level of creativity.<br/><br/>Interestingly, the color treatment of this film cleverly intersperses with stark high-contrast lighting to simulate black and white like the gory crime scene pictures or the press and publicity stills taken for the book, In Cold Blood.<br/><br/>I hate to say this, but Robert Blake will always be Perry Smith to me, even though Clifton Collins, Jr. does a marvelous job translating the child-like friendliness and simmering rage inside this cold blooded killer. Blakes Smith will always seem a bit more sensitive, terrified and at the same time exhilarated and turned-on by the whole spectacle of his murderous self-immolation.<br/><br/>The scene showing Smith staring out a grate in the wall to watch ""Andy"", the best boy in Kansas, swollen with self-indulgence waddling out to the ""corner"", trying to beat the rope by weighing enough to break it is a great homage to the original Blake ""In Cold Blood"". I thought the forklift for his corpse a nice touch.<br/><br/>This is a marvelous snippet of time, expanded and stretching the emotional fabric of the period in Capote's life to grab our attention and keep it wrung out like a wet rag....cold and damp, creepy almost but riveting, like a bloody auto accident. You can't look at it, and you can't look away.<br/><br/>Totally Awesome."
"lea-1","9","2","2","17 November 2005"," CAPOTE is a movie of conflicts and contrasts
","The opening shot shows the sober silence of a Midwest Sunday morning. The quiet idyllic countryside with the stand of trees on the horizon as the divider between properties in contrast to the brashness of the city with the row of wrought iron railings dividing the brownstones. The unhurried pace, soft palette and rounded corners of country life in contrast to the city life with it's hard edges and sharp corners. A visually stunning way to begin a film about a man who sets out to write a book about the power of destruction that an act of violence can have upon a small Midwestern town where things like this just don't happen. A visually subtle way to begin a movie that ultimately reveals the conflicts and contrasts between our past and present worlds.<br/><br/>As a writer, Truman Capote (Philip Seymour Hoffman) was a keen observer of people and found ways of getting people to tell him things they probably never would have, or should have. Of Laura Kinney (Allie Mickelson) he observed that she would be now and forever looked at and thought of differently, Truman had always been looked at and thought of as 'different' and so in his feeble attempt at compassion, he tells her of his experience of being 'different' to help put her at ease. You see the girl process this and she goes off to get Nancy Clutter's diary as we see Nelle Harper Lee (Catherine Keener) look at Truman with a mixture of amazement and disapproval. We see him locate the most vulnerable spot of his subject and then pick at it like a scab until the wound begins to ooze the material he needs for his book. Truman made no apologies and Philip Seymour Hoffman's Truman doesn't either. He knows who he is and he is fully aware that he is lacking in sincerity yet there is no guilt or apologies offered because he's not trying to make you think he is anything other than what he is, unabashedly and shamelessly self-serving.<br/><br/>The film doesn't spend a lot of time on Truman's relationship with Jack Dunphy (Bruce Greenwood) but it spends enough time to let you know that this was mostly a give and take partnership - Truman would take whatever Jack was willing to give. There was some genuine affection between them early in the story but we see how Truman's experience with Perry Smith (Clifton Collins, Jr.) and Richard Hickock (Mark Pellegrino) takes a toll on that relationship and on Truman himself. The deeper his involvement with Smith the more withdrawn he becomes with Jack. We witness Truman's destruction and devolution throughout the process of writing this book that initially he thought would make him but essentially destroyed him. His drunken self-indulgence and insecurities show during the scene of the premiere of ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" written by his friend, confidant, and research assistant, Nelle Harper Lee. There were a lot of elements to the real story that the film's running time just did not allow to be fully developed or discovered; I would be interested to see follow-up movies, not really sequels, that take a closer look at some of these elements, such as, what happened to Jack Dunphy and Nelle Harper Lee? And what about that other death row prisoner, Lowell Lee Andrews (C. Ernst Harth) who brought home the cold hard truth that Smith and Hickock were next in line for the hangman's noose, what was his story? I know the history of the Midwest is rich with stories similar to this and I think Bennett Miller and crew have the eye and sense it would take to make these stories come to life in as richly textured a way as they did with CAPOTE.<br/><br/>This is a good story and among it's strengths is the superior acting, photography, costuming and set decoration. It is all so well done that at times I wasn't sure if I was seeing the actors or the real people. The town felt as though it had been shocked into a state of suspended time and never moved on, it was eerie in that sense. There was real commitment within the production and it shows. <br/><br/>I have seen this movie twice and both times the theatre was sold out and the audience was captivated and silent from the beginning of the movie all the way through the credits - now that is the mark of a well told story!"
"moutonbear25","8","2","2","9 November 2005"," Lesson Learned
","CAPOTE Written by Dan Futterman Directed by Bennett Miller<br/><br/>Admittedly, I am not the most literate fella. Consequently, the name Truman Capote means something to me but simply for its notoriety and not for his work or anything else of worth that should continue to give his name meaning years after his death. I expected Bennett Miller's film to be something of a crash course on Capote's life. I would leave there with the half-sense of being educated on the man  an expectation so many of us put on the movies. Dan Futterman's script takes a different approach though as he chooses to focus on the six years Capote spent writing his last novel, ""In Cold Blood"". The editorial decision sways our judgment and forces us to view the man's entire life in this one blip in the grander scheme. Despite the narrow scope on Capote's life this presents, there is still a rich sense of character, encompassing history and heritage as well as a conflict in the present that hints at an imminent unraveling. <br/><br/>This challenging feat comes to fruition thanks to Philip Seymour Hoffman's metamorphic portrayal of Capote. Again, not being familiar with the actual Truman Capote, it's hard to say that Hoffman embodied him but I can say that he was definitely not himself. His round frame is draped in understated style; his thick, dark-rimmed glasses fit perfectly with his slicked, blonde hair. We first meet Truman at an upper-class party. He is the epicenter of the conversation and all are transfixed on his stories of gossip and innuendo. We can see on his face how much he enjoys the audience and hear it in his high-pitched squeak of a voice how much he revels in his successful life as anyone with that mousy and effeminate a voice must have been the one gossiped about previously and not the one doing the gossiping. As Capote, Hoffman enters rooms with gusto and presence but there is a hint of hesitation as he is aware of the reaction his demeanor and clearly identifiable homosexuality incites from people, be they in New York City where he lives or Kansas, where he is researching his novel. He is completely oblivious to nearly everyone else's existence and this ultimately commands the attention he deserves but there is a small boy's fear that causes him to overcompensate by playing it up to see how far he can go as well as protect his fragile nature.<br/><br/>Hoffman balances two distinct sides of Capote so well that by the close of the film, even he appears to not understand how his life ended up where it did. These two sides are sincerity and artifice. In order to gain the trust of Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.), one of the murderers who will serve as the inspiration for his novel, he must pretend to care about Smith as he waits to die on death row. After their initial meeting, Smith behind bars and Capote offering him medication like a banana to a monkey at the zoo, Capote continues to see him as just that, an animal, a paycheck. As their relationship persists and they spend more time together, a bond inevitably forms and the lines between despondency and compassion blur. As Smith's time on death row nears its end, Capote seems overtaken with something he cannot process, an emotional attachment to another human being.<br/><br/>Watching Capote's descent from confidence and control is both painful and uplifting. It may not be a pretty picture but realizing that you have a lot in common with a cold-blooded murder is definitely humbling."

","Capote is a MUST see film for any film lover. Look for Philip Seymour Hoffman as Truman Capote,to receive an Oscar, with nominations for Cathrine Keener as Harper Lee and Clifton Collins Jr. as Perry Smith. Fine performances by Chris Cooper and Bob Balaban in two thankless roles as the lead investigator and Capote's publisher, respectively. This film instills tension throughout by the use of taut direction and a wonderfully realized screenplay by Dan Futterman (actor in TV's ""Judging Amy""--a fine actor, but a truly talented writer). Futterman will be remembered at Oscar time as well, I believe. This film will be one of my choices next spring for my DVD collection..."
"shnperry","10","2","2","6 November 2005"," watch it with the original movie
","I have been a fan of Seymour Hoffman for some time. I was not surprised to see this performance, only grateful that he was finally given the chance to show what he has always been capable of. I think the Academy Award scene is the interview with the girlfriend of the daughter--the ""I was different, too"" speech. Breathless.<br/><br/>Being of a demographic that remembers Truman Capote--both the incisive talent and the sad parody, yes, I agree with other reviewers that one cannot tell the difference here between the icon and the performer. This is due in large part, but not exclusively, to Hoffman. The structure of the story also is amazingly insightful, paralleling as it does the novel itself as well as the movie. I felt transported into the world of Bertold Brecht, for here truly, the artist becomes his story--culminating finally in an ironic interpretation of the title ""In Cold Blood."" Two worlds, indeed, but not the worlds of the conservative and the criminal--rather the worlds of selfish celebrity and heartland authenticity--exploited in cold blood. I strongly recommend reviewing the novel and the movie with this movie in tandem. I am left with the question--can there ever be such a thing as a non-fiction novel?"
"poolshark89","10","2","2","24 October 2005"," Excellent movie.
","Capote is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The charismatic, amiable side of Truman Capote shines through almost as well as the devious, manipulative side. Philip Seymour Hoffman expertly emulates Capote's famous mannerisms, idiosyncrasies and countless flaws as he moves throughout the movie.<br/><br/>We watch as Capote becomes entrenched in a world of darkness and deceit, and observe him making his own difficult decisions regarding two dangerous strangers whom he studies and eventually truly befriends; his less than reliable character as he deals with his lover (Bruce Greenwood) and childhood best friend (Catherine Keener); and his denial and disbelief when faced with his own problems and faults that consistently keep the audience empathetic and understanding. Capote's struggle with his writing, love life, and morals really visibly battle on screen, taking the viewer on an interesting and enlightening ride.<br/><br/>Capote is brilliantly acted and produced, and the story is riveting and, yet, somehow, inherently unsatisfying (although in an altogether believable and seemingly satisfying sort of way). Please. Go see this movie."
"siontracer","10","2","2","22 October 2005"," Hoffman Is Capote
","My daughter and I traveled for one and a half hours to view Capote because it is in limited release. I can only say that Capote is one of the best movies I have viewed in past 20 years. Character portrayals were excellent, though I would have liked to have seen more information concerning the Clutters and more information concerning Alvin Dewey and Richard Hickock. The movie was filmed in Canada but whomever picked the locations did an excellent job because the the area looked like that of Kansas. Harper Lee was a close friend of Capote and the movie made an attempt to show that. The only negative factor is the fact that Capote's homosexuality was not presented in too much detail, just hinted at. This movie is the one movie that you must see. I highly recommend Capote."
"gollytolly","9","2","2","10 October 2005"," A wonderfully directed film
","The director, Bennett Miller, had only directed one other feature, The Cruise, a documentary released in 1998. His fiction feature debut is a remarkably accomplished feat of directing. Not only are all of the performances top notch, but the cinematography is beautiful and the editing is unhurried and precise. The production and costume design are simple and flawless, always capturing the period setting without overselling details or overemphasizing authenticity. Everyone is talking about the great performance of Philip Seymour Hoffman, but I think that Clifton Collins Jr. should also be recognized for a layered and delicately nuanced performance as Perry Smith. Long portions of this movie actually focus down to intense two character scenes between these terrific actors.<br/><br/>Along with Brokeback Mountain and Conversations with Other Women, this is one of my favorites at Telluride this year. A great film. I hope the director doesn't wait another seven years to make his next movie!"

","I am sorry but 'Capote' is one of the worst films I have ever seen. It is slow and the acting is positively comedic in places. The main character is irritating and unlikeable to say the least ( was the man really so creepy? ) I fail to see why anyone likes this film? Maybe it's just popular among the art-farty types to say it is a good film? For me all the things that make a good film are missing and I found myself hoping it was going to improve at some point ( which it did not ) I am also sure that the story itself could have been made more interesting, but it is hard to know how accurately it was all portrayed? Maybe Capote was such a creepy irritant and for this the lead actor could be congratulated for an accurate portrayal. But this in itself would not make a good film. Just how it even got nominated for any Oscars is a mystery to me. I was not alone in thinking this as those watching it with me all failed to enjoy it in any way whatsoever."

"Gabriella1316","10","7","12","6 November 2005"," Stunning, brilliant, chilling and provocative.
","Phillip Seymour Hoffman gives depth and complexity to a controversial cosmopolitan that will always be remembered through his books and the movies that came out of them (not to mention his wild man reputation.) Capote examines Truman Capote's life during the writing of perhaps his most celebrated work, In Cold Blood. He develops a complicated and deep relationship with one of the felons, Perry Edward Smith (Clifton Collins Jr,) This film humanizes Truman Capote and forces the audience to see through his eyes to the point where you want the murderers who so brutally killed the happy Kansas family of four escape punishment. PSH gives his most brilliant performance yet but the rest of the cast is also fantastic. Catherine Keener who plays Nelle Harper Lee, the celebrated author of To Kill a Mockingbird and close friend to Capote, also performs beautifully as well as Clifton Collins Jr. who plays one of the murderers.

"Rogue-32","10","6","10","8 February 2006"," Long day's journey into complete darkness
","Atmospheric, chilling and bleak, this film is a stunner from beginning to end. The mood is brilliantly set during the opening credits, and it never wanes. At the center, of course, is Philip Seymour Hoffman's magnificent portrayal of Truman Capote. Speaking in his wistful baby voice, with its overpowering narcotic effect, Hoffman evokes the man from the inside out, virtually disappearing into the role. There were just a couple of times where I could see that sly little Hoffman grin in there but only for a few fleeting seconds. This is an Oscar-worthy performance, right up there with Jeremy Irons' cunning portrayal of Claus von Bulow in Reversal of Fortune.<br/><br/>Capote, however, is a much better film overall. The excruciatingly dark subject matter is handled brilliantly, with all its conflict and complexity displayed with superb subtlety. As a writer myself, I know all too well about walking that fine line between serving your story and serving yourself - allowing yourself to say and/or do whatever it takes to get what you need, to become whatever you have to be in order to gain trust, sometimes at the expense of one's own morality and judgment. Truman exploits and manipulates Perry relentlessly, even though he does have genuine feelings for him; this destructive conflict of interests is at the heart of the film, and it's depicted with chilling clarity. You understand from the get-go, the second that Truman sees the pictures, with the pillows placed under the victims' heads, that the cold-blooded criminal who did this can be manipulated, because he is 'human' on some level, and as soon as he gets his chance, he pounces. Quietly, with insidious intellectual premeditation.<br/><br/>The thing I appreciated the most was how Perry understood Truman's compulsion to exploit him and he didn't mind. This made it even harder for Truman to deal with, and it ultimately destroyed him - artistically, and, even sadder, as a human being."
"mercurythumb","10","6","10","1 February 2006"," Loneliness, Shame, Compulsion
","Capote is a devastatingly lonely film about a highly sensitive and celebrated Southern writer sinking deeper into shame as he moves in ever closer to a subject he thinks he's on top of, but is simply not emotionally equipped to handle. I have never seen this emotional territory explored in such uncompromising terms. <br/><br/>Like Icarus, Truman Capote flies too close to the heartbreaking, murderous truth. Adulated and indulged by the literati inhabiting the circle of William Shawn's New Yorker, we see Capote wallowing in cosmopolitan narcissism, reaping the worldly rewards of being endowed with an extraordinary ear for language and eye for observation.<br/><br/>Aptly, these last two gifts are also possessed by the actor who plays him - Philip Seymour Hoffman. Hoffman's combination of focus, presence and interpretive genius has been a screen wonder for almost a decade. He is quite simply, Hollywood's most versatile character player. This time, director Bennet Miller blocks and shoots Hoffman in a way that summons unprecedented color from his star's already formidable skill and presence. No one should overlook the empathetic support Catherine Keener provides Hoffman in scene after scene, as she plays Harper Lee, Capote's friend and research assistant. Clifton Collins also turns in a compelling performance opposite Hoffman as multiple murderer Perry Smith. His scenes are full of simmering heat, nuance and subtlety.<br/><br/>Over all, a disturbing and memorable film."
"pookey56","5","5","8","1 February 2007"," Kaput-ee
","i'll begin by saying that i am a huge fan of Philip Seymour Hoffman. I loved his work in Boogie Nights, with a sensitive and moving performance; i loved him in Twister; his enthusiasm and animated character; and his brilliant turn in The Talented Mr.Ripley. I've never met Truman Capote. I knew him only through watching his interviews and taking a glimpse at his media image. I didn't like him. Perhaps this colours my feeling about Hoffman's portrayal of him. I credit him for his dead-on mimicry of the author of IN COLD BLOOD. But i didn't enjoy it. I found the scene with Clifton Collins jr much more intriguing; and the subject matter of his book far more interesting, in a ghoulish sense. Katherine Keener is always a marvel, and her under-stated portrayal of the great though non-prolific perfectionist Harper Lee was great to see. Chris Cooper is always good. To be true to my own feelings about this film, i didn't enjoy it. And i didn't think Hoffman was better than Heath Ledger. Not by a mile. Capote is on television now and i may or may not watch it again. I don't really want to. The questions as to why both Harper Lee and Truman Capote never topped their original and/or only works aren't compelling enough for me to care, just based on this film. Judging from it's accolades as a film and the awards for Hoffman's performance, i could be the only person on the planet who has watched this film that didn't like it. Oddly enough, the supporting characters peaked my interest more than the central character. And as i have already said, i am a huge fan of Mr. Hoffman. But not here. i watched this film last year and had difficulty with being motivated enough to even make a comment about it.... *check out the OTHER Capote film, INFAMOUS"

Murder of 4 people is just nothing comparing to what happened in Rwanda over 10 years ago for example (just keep shooting your citizens, folk in USA) so I didn't feel for them. Neither does Capote receive any sympathy even though character is well act. Or should he be despised? And the murderers.. just hang them if they are likely to commit same crime again or let them walk if you think they won't. There are a lot better movies that rise emotions, which was the point of this film i think? Why does he talk that way, btw? Did Capote really, couldn't he otherwise? Not very charming style.

","In this film, we're invited to observe the descent into a moral and emotional funk of someone who isn't likable to start with. What was the point of making the film, then? To show that it would have been better not to have had IN COLD BLOOD - a book I admire, incidentally - in order to have kept our hero's integrity intact? Hardly. He behaves at the party at the start of the film exactly in the same way he behaves after his triumphant reading from the book, so his degradation is a matter of degree. Are we supposed to care enough about Capote to take seriously his claim that he and murderer Perry Smith are kindred spirits, with the former having had all the breaks while the latter had none? Mr Capote's plight didn't touch me at all, I'm afraid, so if that was the central idea it was wasted on me. But even if I could fathom why the filmmakers visited this pointless project on us, the clunky storytelling would still have bored me as it did. Hoffman gives a bravura performance to no emotional effect, while Keener and Cooper are so warm and interesting that I was yearning for more of them. Dreary beyond belief."
"morakanabad-1","10","5","8","13 October 2005"," Capote's Cold Blood
","*Please don't read if you haven't seen the film yet.* <br/><br/>We must hear Philip Seymour Hoffman's name come Oscar time. He was born to play the role of Truman Capote and his exceptional acting ability is at its ne plus ultra in this film.<br/><br/>Having said that, I must say the story itself does a bang-up job of creating a very complex character. On the one hand we have a writer whose talents we admire and whom, as a person, most will find witty and terribly likable. On the other, we see a manipulator who consistently lies to his interviewee (Perry Smith) to gain his trust and thereby gather material for his book. Granted, Smith is a murderer who did indeed take the lives of his victims in cold blood. But Capote desperately wants, almost in a premeditated way, Perry and his accomplice to die--not for the sake of the family whom they murdered but for the sake of his book, which, without the killers' execution, has no ending. So, while his nonfiction novel ""In Cold Blood"" relates the story of a brutal, senseless murder and its perpetrators, the film ""Capote,"" ultimately, is the story of Truman Capote's willed murder of the killers--the story of his own ""cold blood."" By the end he is clamoring, in a sloppy, drunken way, for their death. Yet (and here's the catch) he also cries--disingenuously?--at their execution.<br/><br/>What ""Capote"" gives us then is a complex narrative of a different kind of ruthlessness--that journalistic hunger for the story that must be written, whatever the cost. Hoffman, however, does not let us off that easily, for by the end, we really have come to like and admire Capote, to relate to him in some way, despite the decidedly unlikable things that he does. Which is what Capote himself wanted to do in his book--give a human face to human ugliness."
"NancyBoySF","5","8","15","29 October 2005"," Hoffman's Truman is at most a 2-note wonder
","I wish this were overall a better movie.<br/><br/>If you are not very familiar with Truman Capote, Nell Harper Lee, The New Yorker, To Kill a Mockingbird, or In Cold Blood, this film does not provide enough context. If you are, the movie feels incomplete and not very illuminating.<br/><br/>This is an actor's movie. Screenplay by an actor (Dan Futterman of Urbania and Angels in America on Broadway), produced by Futterman and Phillip Seymor Hoffman. All of the roles are played by actor's actors...people who are more well-known and respected among their fellow actors than the general public.<br/><br/>But all of the performances and the movie overall are just too somber and subdued. Hoffman's range runs the gamut from witty and subdued, sensitive and subdued, curious and subdued, and depressed and subdued. To gauge by what's on screen, Truman spends almost five solid years in an unrelieved state of quiet depression...apparently much of it laying in bed. No one in the movie ever shows anger or elation or grief or barely a hint of any passion of any kind.<br/><br/>Capote was larger than life and an important trail-blazer for gay Americans and for sissies in general. Unlike his contemporaries and sometimes rivals Tennesee Williams or Gore Vidal or James Baldwin, no one could ever, even for a second, pretend that Truman was anything but a flamboyant, very fey, homosexual. He was so overly and unmistakeably gay and sissified and yet so successful in New York and Hollywood literary circles that he likely did more for homosexual visibility than any other American during the fifties. He was a very passionate man...with enormous energy and love of life. He loved deeply, including his partner, the never successful writer and straight-appearing Jack Dunphy, he cackled, he loved beautiful places and interiors and worked hard to create comfortable environments for himself, he was a darling of some of the wealthiest socialites in New York and Hollywood...in all, an amazing life. We get barely a hint of any of that in Capote. Thus, the picture presented by the film is baffling...a man so consumed by his ""art"" that for five years he thinks about little else, never makes love, never enjoys anything...just broods.<br/><br/>Thus, the movie does not explore, I believe, some of the most interesting aspects of the creation of In Cold Blood. That anyone wrote that book at that time is astonishing. That Truman Capote...the creator of Breakfast at Tiffany's, the man who threw the most successful high-society party in New York, a best friend of Elizabeth Taylor...is triply so. The movie doesn't explore that contrast and barely gives the audience a sense of it. It would have been exciting to see Hoffman portraying Truman having a temper tantrum, or a really good time, or planning a party, or expressing love or affection for his partner, or enjoying life in some way.<br/><br/>All that said, Dan Futterman, after this film, should be named Fag-Stag of the year. I am gratified that even after playing gay for years on Broadway and playing gay in his most successful leading-man film (Urbania) and playing the son of two queens in The Birdcage, Dan, a straight man, remains interested enough in gay men to write a screenplay about Capote. However, while the choice to never directly examine or refer to Capote's homosexuality or anyone's reaction to it was an interesting one, it was the wrong one. While In Cold Blood has had no lasting effect on how Americans feel about prisons or criminals or Native Americans or the death penalty, Capote life and TV persona had a major and lasting effect on how many Americans viewed homosexuality. In a film named ""Capote,"" not dealing with those aspects of his life is a major omission."

The first time I watched this, I fell asleep during it because I was just unable to follow. But then I read the book, one that is considered a great piece of American literature.

"RossRivero99","10","3","4","3 March 2017"," One of the great directorial debuts I've seen in a long time
","Bennett Miller's ""Capote"" was his first movie as a director and it is one of the best movies that I have seen that were directed by him (my favorite being ""Moneyball"" (2011)), and the movie ranks with ""Reservoir Dogs"" (1992), ""12 Angry Men"" (1957), and ""Heaven Can Wait"" (1978) as one of the best directorial debuts I have ever seen. The movie focuses on Truman Capote (Philip Seymour Hoffman) while he was working on his most famous book called ""In Cold Blood"" about a mass murder in a small town called Holcomb, Kansas on November 14, 1959. After Capote hears about the crime in a ""New York Times"" article he decides he wants to write an article about it and very early into his research process he decides that there is too much information for an article and it is right to write about it as a book which is what he tells his editor in chief of ""The New Yorker"" William Shawn (Bob Balaban). Capote's partner in the research is another author who would write her first novel ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" which is Harper Lee (Catherine Keener). Then we see Capote and Lee take a trip by train from New York to Kansas to meet with a policeman named Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper) in order to get more information about the crime such as crime scene photographs as well as who committed it in order to put that into his book. During the course of the movie Capote and Lee also meet Alvin's wife Marie (Amy Ryan) and they have a good couple of visits together. Then Capote meets the two men who committed the murders Dick Hickock (Mark Pellegrino), and Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.) and then he starts to befriend them both and fight hard to get them off of death row. While I was watching this movie during the scenes where Capote was trying to get these two men off of death row because he wanted to get more information from them for his book reminded me a little bit of Michael Clarke Duncan's performance in ""The Green Mile"" (1999) in the ending scene where he was crying before his electrocution. Hoffman's Oscar winning performance in this movie was so good that I felt as if Truman Capote was actually resurrected into Hoffman's very body and Dan Futterman's screenplay did a very good job on focusing on the characters of the movie instead of making the criminals look like morons. The most effective scenes of the movie are the scenes where Capote is talking to the two convicts on death row and all of those scenes are filled with so much emotion that you actually feel empathy for Hickock and Smith. Bennett Miller's direction for this movie as well as ""Moneyball"" (2011) made me even more excited to see his latest film from a few years ago called ""Foxcatcher"" (2014). This was a great movie and is one of the best movies of 2005."

","Why ""Capote"" did not receive the Oscar for Best Picture is beyond me--""Crash"" was so wholly inadequate by comparison. I can only conclude it was due to America's homophobic view of the world.

Having just recently read ""in Cold Blood,"" I found it gratifying to see this story unfold. It unlocked the puzzle of how the book was written, and so much more.

","This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen that can still be extremely obnoxious and uninteresting at the same time. This, perhaps is its achievement. A well-mounted and expensive piece of crap.<br/><br/>The main character, author Truman Capote, comes off as a self-applauding intellectual twit verging on flaming queen, albeit a talented one. Played by Hoffman with all the depth of two-line obituary, Capote leaves us wondering just what on earth he sees redeeming in this murderer. Hoffman resembles Capote, but does not sound like anything more than a lounge comic doing a poor impression.<br/><br/>The movie is lovingly filmed with extreme attention to detail, and emulates The Shawshank Redemption right down to the tinkly piano notes and camera angles. The director clearly thinks that good cinema is found in actionless long shots, held for excruciatingly long periods of time.<br/><br/>I must confess to having watched only 3/4 of the picture, not being able to withstand another moment of my life lost on this dreck and its completely uninteresting subject matter. Perhaps Mr. Capote was a brilliant writer (the movie pounds that down our throats), but as the subject of a movie he fails to excite. That is odd, as the real Truman Capote was rather fun to watch, animated and witty. This guy comes off as the gay reaper.<br/><br/>I rated it a five for its good production values and cinematography."
"Doylenf","8","3","4","24 April 2006"," Fascinating portrayal of Truman Capote by Philip Seymour Hoffman...
","Philip Seymour Hoffman does a remarkable job of bringing to life every gesture and utterance of Truman Capaote without ever verging on caricature. This extraordinarily sensitive tale of the strange relationship between Capote and young Perry Smith is absorbing from start to finish. It does not let Capote off the hook for the way he exploits for his own gain a cold blooded murder that somehow resonates with him because of his own dark past full of mistreatment by an uncaring mother. He gains the trust of Perry Smith but is not always truthful when it comes to some basic issues he withholds from the killers.<br/><br/>Capote, of course, wrote IN COLD BLOOD, and this is the subject of the screenplay which tells how he came to write the tale that forever changed the image of him as just the gin guzzling playboy who wrote BREAKFAST AT TIFFANYS. There are fine performances in all of the supporting roles, particularly Catherine Keener, Chris Cooper, Clifton Collins, Jr. and Mark Pellegrino--but it is the solid central performance of Mr. Hoffman that holds the film together. His final confrontation with the killers as they await their hanging is a good demonstration of just what an extraordinary actor he really is.<br/><br/>Clifton Collins, Jr. cannot be praised highly enough for his Perry Smith and Mark Pellegrino makes a strong impression in the more underwritten role as the other young killer. They both register strongly in their final scene when all appeals have been denied.<br/><br/>Highly recommended, especially for those familiar with the Capote novel that forms the basis for Gerald Clarke's book on which this is based. The ambiguous nature of the Smith/Capote relationship is left up to the viewer, as it should be. The striking cinematography using muted colors is especially effective in creating the right mood for this darkly disturbing story."
"gradyharp","10","3","4","22 March 2006"," The DVD Package Makes CAPOTE Even More Gripping
","CAPOTE is a great movie. Let that be said at the beginning of this review. The superb screenplay by Dan Futterman based on the book by Gerald Clarke in turn based on that part of the life of Truman Capote when he was obsessed with writing his final and finest novel 'In Cold Blood', and the extraordinary directing by Bennett Miller who influenced a fine production crew and coaxed brilliant performances from his cast is all a well established fact. That all of this could be brought together in the featurettes that accompany the film on the DVD release is an example of just how fine additive commentaries can be. This is not only a superb film; it is also an equally superb DVD package.<br/><br/>Philip Seymour Hoffman as the idiosyncratic author Truman Capote probes the psyche of this strange but gifted writer from his first newspaper clipping of the November 15, 1959 brutal murders of the Clutter family in Holbrook through his immersion in the tiny Kansas town accompanied by his friend and fellow writer Harper Lee (Catherine Keener) absorbing the atmosphere where such a deed could happen, ingratiating himself with investigator Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper) and his wife Marie (Amy Ryan) to gain access to information that will eventually result in material for his projected book. He becomes obsessed with the murderers Perry Smith (Clifton Collins, Jr.) and Richard Hickock (Mark Pellegrino), connecting with Smith in particular on a very basic level and providing the men with lawyers to appeal their conviction for a long enough time to eventually hear the truth of the night of grisly mayhem that fascinates Capote so. The story ends with the execution of Smith and Hickock in 1965, an occasion that further bewilders the now fragile mind of Capote as he gains the end to his story while simultaneously watching the loved Smith dangle from the scaffold in death. Each actor is exceptional here: Hoffman does indeed deserve his Oscar for a brilliant portrayal.<br/><br/>But it is the aftermath that brings even more poignancy to the film. Hearing Bennett, Clarke, and Futterman discuss the origin of the cinematic idea blends naturally with the production crews' commentary about the choice of Winnipeg, Canada as the location to depict Kansas, the thorough preparation of the design and costuming and color palette and camera techniques, and then the comments by four of the main actors (Hoffman, Keener, Cooper, and Collins) illuminate not only the characters they depicted in the film but also the dynamics of entering into this strange world of bleak winter murder. The effect of the featurettes is staggering and makes the viewer want to immediately replay the entire movie.<br/><br/>This DVD package should serve as the template for future releases: the disc in its entirety is an art form that has few peers. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp"
"swaindominic","8","3","4","19 March 2006"," Stunning performance, compelling viewing
","I was already a big Phillip Seymour Hoffman fan so I awaited this film with much excitement. However I knew nothing about Truman Capote beforehand and I had never seen any footage of him. Therefore I can't examine just how well Hoffman becomes Capote, but I can remark on his performance. It truly is a stunning piece of work from Hoffman once which really brings the character to life, he conveys the conflict within Capote quite beautifully. He draws on a wide range of emotions each of them brilliantly brought to life with a performance which is at times flamboyant and at others understated.<br/><br/>I found this film very challenging, more so than any I can remember seeing recently. Should we seek to forgive the killers and could we dare to like Perry Smith after his crime, just like Truman Capote seemed to. But then there is so much conflict within Truman Capote, does he really like Smith or is he simply using the killers for his book. We empathise with Truman Capote and then suddenly feel challenged whether we should, he lies to Perry Smith so he must be using him. However there seems to be a genuine bond between them so maybe Truman Capote was not simply using him. These kinds of arguments sprung up in my head throughout the film and it is a great element of the film to allow the viewer to connect with the conflict of those on screen.<br/><br/>It is a harrowing story and one which I got more and more drawn in to as the film progressed, I could feel the desperation building up as it did in the life of Truman Capote. All the while my emotions and thoughts were being challenged by the events as they unfolded. As the film concludes with a particularly harrowing scene I was left with a multitude of questions running round my mind.<br/><br/>This is a master class of acting by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, from what I have read he really does become Truman Capote, I hope to see some footage of the talented writer so I can decide for myself. I know this film was excellently constructed because I often find myself evaluating it in my mind almost a week after seeing it. This is a truly gripping, fascinating and amazingly challenging film and one which I can recommend to those seeking a genuinely remarkable movie experience."
"isabelle1955","Null","3","4","5 March 2006"," Just about perfect
","It's very rare that I watch a film that truly mesmerizes me. It's even rarer for me to write a review that doesn't have me reaching for the thesaurus to find synonyms for ""cliché"". I often feel that everything I watch is just a re-hashing of something else (possibly a sign of encroaching middle age?). But I truly thought this was one of the best films, and one of the most original, that I've seen in a long time. I don't know enough about Truman Capote to be able to comment on the veracity of Philip Seymour Hoffman's interpretation of him. But you don't need to be a Capote expert to appreciate the film or the performances, because it stands by itself as an interesting portrayal of a writer and the writing process. I really can find almost nothing to criticize  very unusual for me, cynic that I am! The story is simple and true. It's 1959, and four terrible and apparently motiveless murders take place at an isolated farmhouse in Kansas. An entire family wiped out brutally. Truman Capote, already a successful novelist and screen writer, reads about the murders while in New York and, intrigued, decides to go to Kansas to investigate not just the murders, but the background and the whole process which produces a man  or men - who could do such a thing. Not so much a Who Dunnit? as a Why Dunnit? The effete New York socialite hardly blends into the small Midwestern town, so he takes his best pal Nel Harper Lee, herself about to become famous for To Kill a Mockingbird, to act as an assistant. The murderers are quickly caught and put on trial, but that's only the beginning.<br/><br/>Over a period of five years, through appeals and stays of execution, Capote extracts from one of the murderers, Perry Smith, the guts of his most famous work, In Cold Blood. Switching between Capote's New York life, and the stark, grim prison within which Smith is awaiting execution, we watch the relationship between them develop and try to assess who is using whom. Capote wants his book, his story, his adoring public and his satisfactory ending  the explanation for the crime. Smith wants a decent lawyer and repeated stays of execution and maybe the recognition that he is someone, not just a nobody.<br/><br/>If Capote cruelly manipulates and uses Smith for his own literary ends, then Smith keeps him waiting, for that crucial exposition of what took place inside the house on the night of the murders. Smith appears intelligent and artistically talented but warped by childhood neglect. Capote himself had a miserable childhood, and realizes how easily their roles could have been reversed. In the end there is never any doubt that the men were guilty, but maybe  or maybe not  Capote has fallen in love with Perry. Certainly he never finished a book again after this defining period of his life, and he died of the side effects of alcohol. Did he enjoy some kind of icey pleasure from seeing Smith hang? Was he utterly amoral in his approach to using Smith as the source for his book? The performances are all outstanding, not just Philip Seymour Hoffmann's, but the supporting actors too. I thought the cinematography excellent, and I wouldn't have changed a single word of the script. We see the patronising attitude of 1950s men to women and the clever, arch and artsy society within which Capote moved, and wince that, for my age group at least, this may look like another age, but it's all so close to home. Very good. Very, very good. If only more people had seen it. Addendum: I've now seen the second Capote film, Infamous. That too was excellent but personally, I think Capote just has the edge. A purely personal opinion."
"Chris_Docker","9","3","4","27 February 2006"," A brilliantly multilayered, sophisticated and understated melodrama about an incredibly complex character
","In 2002 Nicole Kidman played one of the most memorable portraits of an author ever committed to the screen. Her introspective rendering of the troubled genius that was Virginia Woolf gave us an insight into the thought and literature of that great woman. We saw, through Kidman and the ensemble cast, the effect of one of Woolf's books, and a token of the rarefied insight she had made into human relationships.<br/><br/>Woolf, like Truman Capote, changed the course of literature by developing a new way of writing: with Woolf, it was 'stream-of-consciousness'  and with Capote it was the 'non-fiction novel'. Like Capote, Woolf remained isolated within her world, but in her case the isolation was created by mental instability and a society that was unready or unwilling to embrace her ideas (such as women's liberation). Capote's isolation was maybe due more to his own unresolved personality issues, to being badly treated as a child, and then finding that he did not 'fit' in the socialite world he inhabited; but mostly it was due to the conscious way that he approached his writing.<br/><br/>Capote is a slow, multilayered, sophisticated and understated melodrama about an incredibly complex character, and is brilliantly accomplished. It avoids the pitfall of trying to sensationalise the visually uninspiring action of typing or writing, but equally circumvents placing the 'creative process' into some stereotypical niche. The film is less of a biopic than an exploration of a mind, and the commonality between the mind of Capote and that of the convicted criminal he is writing about. On another level, it is about moral dilemmas of journalistic research and, on yet another, the psychology of the killer.<br/><br/>While glancing through a newspaper looking for ideas for a short story or article, Capote happens upon a report of a good, decent family in Kansas that have been cold-bloodedly murdered. He gains access to police reports and eventually the murderers as they are apprehended. One of them, Perry Smith, is literate and intelligent. Moreover he had a difficult childhood. Whereas Capote was fairly well-to-do, Smith had fell in with a bad crowd  he was from the 'dark underbelly' of America  people that respectable folk knew little of and cared even less. Capote spots details the police miss  why was a pillow placed under the head of the victim before being shot? Capote realises there is enough information for a major novel. He works Perry for details, examines the corpses, studies police photographs, and even achieves a delay in the sentence while he finishes researching. We start to see his methods and his remarkable mind. One of his party tricks is to demonstrate that he has ""94% recall of any conversation"", observing and recalling the minutest detail. He studies people, he sees their motivations, he asks himself why, and often he automatically knows by logical inference. He does all this in a professional capacity as an author, accurately researching, but on the way it gives him immense power, of which he is also aware and doesn't hesitate to use.<br/><br/>When Capote receives a standing ovation for a preview reading of his book we see him barely able to contain his emotion  he wants to be acknowledged  needs to be acknowledged  and it is a driving force that is also an overriding obsession: he will write the book of the decade, it will be a literary masterpiece (modesty is not something that troubles him), but he also needs to write it to feel wanted. It mirrors the need felt by Perry in a diary entry where has written an acceptance speech 'just in case' anyone ever recognised and thanked him for something.<br/><br/>Capote uncovers a beautiful human side to Perry, one that is at direct odds with the murderer mentality. We can see 'there but for fortune' (or if nurtured) Perry might have become a writer or artist. Should such information have been used to commute the sentence? Was the murder really 'in cold blood'? How such contradictions exist and their implications are realised too late.<br/><br/>But Capote is especially susceptible to his own discipline, as he has ignored his own need for friendship. Even at the greatest triumphs of fellow authors who support him, he is oblivious to their success, unable to join in their celebrations, just getting drunk and wallowing in his own self-torture because the stars of his book have not been executed. Why fuss about the trivial achievements of others? (including some not-so-trivial successes, such as To Kill a Mockingbird). Capote's self-obsession and fixation with writing the novel of the decade is total. In ignoring his need for friendship, Capote is at the mercy of the fact that he professionally wants, or wanted, someone who was close to him executed. He has missed out on the joy of giving that is at the core of friendship  genius is not enough.<br/><br/>Philip Seymour Hoffman as Truman Capote has pulled off a triumph of acting that goes beyond a simple life story. He has brought the genius and the misery of Capote to the screen in a way that is more transparent than one could hope for in the depiction of such a multifaceted and unusual person. Catherine Keener, as the ever-supportive Harper Lee (To Kill a Mockingbird), is a superb balancing act. Her character is the opposite of Capote, empathetic, warm, and endlessly forgiving of his faults. Keener does an admirable job  and as self-effacing a one as her character might.<br/><br/>Like 'The Hours', Capote comes across as a labour of love and one eminently worth the trouble and several viewings. But the lessons we can take from it are less about the greatness of Capote and more about his shortcomings. As he was later to recall (in the midst of the terminal decline that set in after the novel was published) more tears are shed over answered than unanswered prayers."
"mstomaso","7","3","4","25 February 2006"," Spellbinding performances
","This is not a biography of Truman Capote, but rather a biography of his last complete major work ""In Cold Blood."" I read this book as a teenager and thought it brilliant and disturbing. This film does a wonderful job of depicting the moral ambiguity of Capote's work, his egotism, and the life history and inner conflicts which allowed him to create this great work. All the same, the subject matter here is really not explored in the depths it deserves, and the film sometimes loses its focus in the depth and quality of its performances.<br/><br/>Hoffman has already won a number of awards for his performance. I have no qualms about this - he's a great actor and this is a challenging and powerful role played to the hilt. However, I also want to point out the tremendous supporting cast. Catherine Keener and Clifton Collins are both deserving of recognition for their intense portrayals of Harper Lee and Perry Smith.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of Capote, or a fan of In Cold Blood, you will enjoy this, though it isn't really going to show you anything that you were not aware of. If you are the sort who goes to movies you're not necessarily that interested in just because a great performance is involved (like me in this case), you will likely enjoy Capote."

"roland-104","10","3","4","7 November 2005"," * More tears are shed for prayers that are answered than for those that aren't
","""Capote"" is, so far, the best American film of the year 2005 (though ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" isn't far behind). It is an arresting docudrama about the eccentric author/celebrity Truman Capote that focuses on the period when he obsessively investigated the slayings of a prosperous small town Kansas family by two low level crooks and then wrote his magnum opus, ""In Cold Blood,"" about the killers and the killings. <br/><br/>Capote called his book, published in 1966, a ""non-fiction novel"" and predicted, with his typical flair for immodesty, that it would be highly influential. It was. Indeed, it established a new hybrid literary-journalistic genre, and, for a time, made Capote the most well known writer in America.<br/><br/>Philip Seymour Hoffman, one of the busiest and most versatile actors working today (25 films in the last 10 years), further demonstrates here the immense range of which he is capable, transforming himself - as if somehow he had literally shrunk his rumpled, stocky, 5-10 frame - to become the diminutive Capote. His performance goes well beyond the physical illusion of petiteness he creates.<br/><br/>As Oregonian critic Shawn Levy puts it, Hoffman gives an ""...uncanny impersonation of a man famous for his squeaky voice and catty mannerHoffman is note-perfect. The wheezy laugh, the pain of work, the prying nature, the cold eye, the self-obsession, the ability to perform and ingratiate and wheedle - it's Capote you're watching up there, not some actor doing an impression."" <br/><br/>The screenplay is brilliantly conceived. Rather than the conventional, slogging biopic approach, in which we would have been led through Capote's entire life to show us the man (who died of complications from alcoholism in 1984, just short of his 60th birthday), instead we get just a five year slice. But it's enough. Pitted against an equally complex man, the murderer Perry Edward Smith (Clifton Collins, Jr.), the further reaches of Capote's deeply convoluted personality are mobilized and thus revealed.<br/><br/>Beyond the qualities Levy catalogs, we see Capote's arrogance and vanity, his shocking capacity for manipulation and disingenuousness (Capote just plain lies to Smith at times), and yet also the intriguing juxtaposition of both callous indifference and seemingly genuine tenderness toward the murderer (though the latter quality could be explained simply as a narcissistic gesture, self love extended outward by means of projective identification). Capote is willing to abandon all scruples to get the information he wants from Smith, but he also seems, at least some of the time, to care for the man.<br/><br/>All of that said, this movie is not simply a showcase for Hoffman's talent. It is a fully rounded drama in which both the structure and the acting ensemble shine. Collins, as the killer Perry Smith, is often a match for Hoffman's Capote: by turns chilling or vulnerable, but for the most part quietly opaque, Smith is literate, soulfully melancholic, quite possibly even lovable for Capote. Their relationship provides the core of dramatic tension.<br/><br/>Fine supporting turns are offered by Chris Cooper, Bruce Greenwood, Mark Pellegrino, Bob Balaban, and, especially, Catherine Keener (as the writer and Capote's ""research assistant"" Harper Lee). (Lee and Capote were lifelong friends and childhood next door neighbors in Alabama. Lee's own classic novel, ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" was published in 1960, during the period covered in this film. It is virtually indisputable that the character of Atticus Finch's young son Dill in her book was modeled after Capote. Now 79, Lee, like Capote after ""In Cold Blood,"" has not published another novel since ""Mockingbird."") <br/><br/>Technically, ""Capote"" is splendidly crafted in every sense. An amazing facet of the film's realization is that the director and screenwriter brought almost no prior experience to their tasks. The screenplay was adapted by Dan Futterman from a 1988 book, also called ""Capote,"" by celeb biographer Gerald Clarke. Futterman heretofore had been a film actor in small roles but hadn't written a screenplay.<br/><br/>Bennett Miller had directed only one previous film, the 1998 documentary ""The Cruise,"" about a quirky Manhattan tour bus guide. Miller and Futterman were high school classmates, and both were also boyhood friends of Hoffman's. Hoffman had not sought out this project, but was invited by his friends to consider it.<br/><br/>In contrast, the cinematographer, Adam Kimmel, and the editor, Christopher Tellefsen, are veterans of their trades. They rely on close-ups in the contest of wills between Capote and Smith, and exchanges between Lee and Capote, but otherwise establish a good mix with middle distance shots of characters in conversation. The camera is always steady, the shots assured. Now and then, as if to add a further note of sombreness, there are long, wide, silent, utterly flat prairie horizon shots, silhouetting dark tree rows in the far distance (Manitoba stood in for Kansas). These occasional scenes are bleak, wintry, foreboding but also starkly beautiful.<br/><br/>For those interested in background reading about Truman Capote, I suggest a volume of first hand observations of the man, compiled by the late George Plimpton, entitled ""Truman Capote, In Which Various Friends, Enemies, Acquaintances, and Detractors Recall His Turbulent Career"" (New York: Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, 1997). Having thought about it more, I would rank Capote among my 200 all time best films (a mythical list that, for all I know, is up to 400 films by now). My rating: 9.5/10 (A) (Seen on 10/22/05). If you'd like to read more of my reviews, send me a message for directions to my websites.<br/><br/>* One of Capote's favorite aphorisms, he took this saying, attributed to St. Teresa of Avila, for the title of his novel, ""Answered Prayers,"" that was published posthumously, in 1986. Capote had his prayer for lasting literary fame answered with the success of ""In Cold Blood,"" but the project seemed to have left him virtually a wreck for the rest of his life."
"thatwriterguy-1","9","3","4","7 November 2005"," Some Questions Can't Be Answered
","In today's world of comic-book heroes, reality-TV, Red and Blue States, artistic pretense and a movie culture that seems intent on trading subtlety for predigested thought, Capote is more than a breath of fresh air; it's an artistic resurrection. It is why films are made.<br/><br/>To be sure, Phillip Seymour Hoffman's performance is brilliant. In a role that could have been mere caricature, he invests so much into the character of Capote I wonder if he has more depth to him than the original. For those who remember ""the real"" Capote, there are plenty of scenes paying homage to the New York culture of the fifties and sixties that basked in the glow of the legendary Capote wit, style and bon vivant attitude that became his trademark. At the same time, just below the perfect Bergdorf-clad couture, Hoffman brings us a man fundamentally changed by his quest to write the nonfiction book of the decade. This Capote moves from being the poster-boy of the Jet-set, to being a portrait painted in magnificent hues of ambiguity. Questions are left unanswered about Truman's motivations, his understanding of himself and just how his world has changed. When finished taking in the performance, you will not have fallen in love with Hoffman's Truman Capoteyou might even like him. But you will understand him better than before.<br/><br/>Screenwriter Dan Futterman has created a masterful script which drives the story in an almost organic way, with a wonderful sense of pace that time and time again makes us feel a real sense of empathy for Capote and then reminding us with a narrative uppercut that in Capote's case, nice is often different than good.<br/><br/>Bennett Miller captures the era well, with the at times almost gritty feel of a documentary and a very light touch that allowed the acting and story to shine through. Visually, he creates an interesting balance between the almost sterile expanses of the Midwest in winter, the warmth of Spain and the cosmopolitan cacophony of the New York scene, all while keeping that documentary honesty. <br/><br/>An excellent supporting cast balances out the best film I've seen yet this year and one of the best I've seen in a very long time. There is no nice, satisfying ending and many questions are thankfullyleft unanswered. But if you're looking for a film that will make you think, feel and keep talking about it long after having left the theater, then this is the film for you. If not, I'd recommend catching the boxed set of Survivor. Not too much ambiguity there."

Everything else keeps the film together, nothing is bad but only boring which is a real shame. <br/><br/>I wanted to find something great in this, but it just never gripped me. It never reached a level which I was hoping it would.

","Famed New Yorker writer/socialite Truman Capote (played beyond comprehension by the seemingly always wonderful Philip Seymour Hoffman) gets interested in a killing of a Kansas farm family in late 1959 and decides to go down south with childhood friend Catherine Keener in tow to write a book about the happenings. And of course that novel is ""In Cold Blood"". However, the project ends up being massively difficult on many levels for the titled character. The two young men who committed the grisly crime (Clifton Collins, Jr. in a dynamite role and Mark Pellegrino) are strangely fascinating and even somewhat sympathetic to Capote and ultimately he develops an understanding relationship due to the facts that they are underlings of society and he can relate because of his homosexuality. ""Capote"" is memorable most because of Hoffman. In fact he is better than the film itself. The picture is so low budgeted that it has an odd feel to it. The movie only runs 98 minutes, but lots happens. However, it feels like there are missing pieces as the final product jumps through scenes with little rime or reason. Collins, Jr. (who was as memorable as anyone in ""Traffic"" five years ago) gives ample support and substance to the flick, but the other co-stars seem like they cannot handle Hoffman's in-your-face part and the production's sometimes sporadic flow. Relative new director Bennett Miller certainly does craft a highly unique viewing experience with screenwriter Dan Futterman's adapted script. Thought-provoking and somewhat elusive, while not excellent ""Capote"" does make a case for being the bravest and most memorable film of 2005. 4 stars out of 5."

","If Richard Brooks' film of ""In Cold Blood"" wasn't stark and painfully slow enough for you, this movie goes it one worse. Not only do we get the suffering and torment of the murder victims and the perpetrators, but we also get the suffering and torment of the insufferable personality who brought the story to ""life,"" Truman Capote. All the minor and incidental characters seem to be in some sort of existential pain as well.<br/><br/>From his vapid anecdotes over cocktails at NY literary parties (the real Capote must have been a little more witty and charismatic than this!) to his manipulation of the supposed friendship he forged with the murderers, complete with lies and crocodile tears, this Capote is not only distasteful and pathetic but his true talent is never believably conveyed. <br/><br/>Hoffman's portrayal is sure to garner many accolades, and this dark slow film many award nominations, but to me the whole mess was just hollow and cold, completely unengaging. And the dialogue was poorly written, the cardinal failing of any film..."

","Apart from a magnificent performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman, which yielded a much deserved academy award, this is the most boring movie I can remember to have finished the last couple of years. It does however, in addition to a high level of acting, have some occasional powerful scenes, but altogether this feature was completely and utterly an agony to watch. As far as I'm concerned Capote currently holds the title as the most boring film of the 21st century.<br/><br/>If you ever intend to see it, rather get a hold of ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"". Of course an exaggeration, but you catch my drift.<br/><br/>It may be a brilliant movie if you're a red wine drinking movie critic or a die hard movie buff, but for the layman, this movie holds absolutely no entertainment value what-so-ever."
"rowmorg","1","9","19","27 May 2006"," An actor crucifies his lines and everyone raves
","Truman Capote spoke clearly. I saw him on TV. He enunciated his words and everyone understood. Sadly, in ""Capote"", that is not the case. Hoffman chews up almost every line in the script, butchering the movie. Just look at his mouth when you can see into it. His tongue is curled up over his palate, a contortion Hoffman seems to feel is necessary to carry off his impersonation. He lithps, contorts his vocal cords, and has paralysis of the lips all at the same time. The result: virtually none of his lines is fully comprehensible from beginning to end. Effectively, Hoffman throws away his role in order to pull off an impersonation, and his lines go down the toilet as well. It's no wonder at all that he did not receive an Oscar for this sad waste of a good role. All in all, this is a sordid production, with a depressing ending. Capote, a minor writer who enjoyed a bloated celebrity status in the bubble of Manhattan, thought he saw an opportunity in the Clutter killings far off in the hinterland. Exactly what originally attracted him must have been homosexual, but the director makes no effort to explain. Dominick Dunne's attraction to high-society murder cover-ups made a lot more sense. Perhaps Capote thought he could make fun of the hicks. Sadly for him, he fell in love with one of the convicts. The photographs of the two men shown in the film were clearly of pornographic interest to a homosexual. The prison visits also had lurid homosexual overtones, but the director ignores this blatant aspect of the case. Capote spun the imprisonment out so that he could extract from Smith an unexpected confession. It turned out to be a shocker. His love object and not the unpleasant other man, had performed all the murders, for just 40 or 50 dollars. The film somehow fails to live up to this revelation, perhaps because it cops out with explanatory flashbacks instead of powerful dialogue. In fact, the only man in this grim affair who was going to make big money out of it was Capote himself. In a kind of stupor, he attended the hanging of his confidant. He became seriously depressed by his own cynicism and eventually drank himself to death, never completing another book. The movie is directed on auto-pilot and seems to fail to understand the implications of a lot of what it tells, above all the homosexual aspects. Its financial success seems to have been achieved by word of mouth, with only a couple of dozen cinemas carrying it at the launch and the studio getting it into more than a thousand a couple of months later. Perhaps the gay market carried it alone. It's hard to imagine anything so depressing appealing to any other sector of the public."

I did feel a great deal of emotion at the end, but not because of the story.<br/><br/>2. Voice - I do not care how accurate your voice is to the real person, if it sounds bad stop it. It was nominated for many awards so it can not be that bad. His voice was the second part of this movie that annoyed me.<br/><br/>3.

I had heard of her, I hated her book, but I had heard of her.<br/><br/>I know not every movie can follow up ""The Cave"" and take my head and wrap it around such a stunning story as I felt watching ""The Cave"". I felt I liked these types of movies, but I was very wrong. I can't even classify Capote as it doesn't follow the rules of genre. It isn't a drama because to be a drama it needs a serious story. Capote didn't deliver. Now that I think about it Capote would be a Horror/Thriller.

I kept looking at the clock every 20 minutes to see if it was over. I wasn't able to finish the last 20 minutes of the movie because it was so dreadfully boring.

","I don't know why the filmmakers of ""Capote"" had a bone to pick with Truman Capote as a person, but it certainly doesn't justify the 114 minutes of this excruciatingly dull and simplistic movie. The whole film is based on one idea: Truman Capote was a jerk. A flamboyant, self-conscious egotist. That's it! Nothing more, nothing less. He uses the murderers of the Kansas farmer family as the subjects of his ""In Cold Blood"" novel, manipulates to work out the trust between him and the perpetrators, paying the lawyer fees, etc. By the time killers had been expecting the most his friendship and financial support, he dumped them because ""In Cold Blood"" was finished . This film does a great disservice to the readers of Truman Capote  a fine writer, the author of such great American classics as ""Breakfast of Tiffanys', ""Other Voices, Other Rooms"", ""Grass Harp"". Although Capote may have been quite an ugly person, it doesn't justify this one-sided portrayal.<br/><br/>On P.S. Hoffman as Capote. Truman Capote with his queeny mannerisms and lisp voice is an easy target for a character actor like Hoffman. So, what does he actually do with this material? He just replays his ostentatious gay character in ""Flawless"". Besides the lack of drag outfits, there's not much difference. This would do fine on a comedy show like SNL, but on a feature-length movie, it becomes annoying. <br/><br/>Overall, I would expected much more subtlety and, dare I say, ""depth"" in portrayal of such a complex individual as Truman Capote."

","On November 15, 1959, a family of four were murdered in their Kansas home one evening by two reckless men with shotguns. Soon after, writer Truman Capote opened his newspaper to find the article pertaining to the tragic event. His life would never be the same.<br/><br/>In Benett Miller's Capote, Phillip Seymour Hoffman (Magnolia, 25th Hour) stars as the famous writer who went all the way out to Kansas to inquire about the events that took place. With his friend Nelle Harper Lee (Catherine Keener, The 40 Year Old Virgin), who wrote a book called To Kill A Mockingbird, the two go throughout the town of Holcomb to find answers.<br/><br/>The two suspects, Perry Smith (CLifton Collins Jr., Tigerland) and Richard Hickock (Mark Pellegrino), are young boys who are dazed and confused by the whole situation. All Capote wants from them is the real story. In doing so, Capote seemingly is falling deeper and deeper into Smith's background and becoming quite fond of him.<br/><br/>As Capote starts to write his novel he realizes his turmoil. If he finds out what really happened that night in the Kansas household, he could send the two men to the gallows. If he doesn't find out what happens, his book will never get published. His morals are really in question.<br/><br/>The movie touches on Capote's homosexuality but actually says it. His lover Jack Dunphy (Bruce Greenwood, I, Robot) also feels the hardship of Capote's novel. It is consuming his life.<br/><br/>Hoffman has a difficult job to do in this movie. He has to sound, look, and act just like Truman Capote did. This is the easy part for Hoffman and his performance is stellar. But on top of becoming this character physically, he has to really get into Capote's head. The film shows Capote early on having a great time and ""living it up"" after the success of his latest novel Breakfast at Tiffany's, which went on to become an Academy Award winning picture.<br/><br/>As the movie progresses, you can see Capote start to become movie involved with the suspect Smith and having his book published. Smith's case is still winning more appeals higher up and a stay of execution. Capote's mood goes bad to worse. His novel isn't finished but is already gaining significant attention. The whole ordeal is eating him alive. <br/><br/>Capote is a fantastic movie that showcases why Truman Capote never finished another book after his publication of In Cold Blood.

","As you watch Capote you know you're watching greatness, in every way. You know these filmmakers and actors are going to be talked about for years to come. Philip Seymour Hoffman, a tall, large, deep-voiced, supporting actor does a complete 180  he truly becomes Truman Capote, a short, stocky, high-pitched, and leading man. Capote tells the story of how legendary author Truman Capote researched and wrote his most successful book, In Cold Blood, in the early 1960s. Hoffman is fearless as he throws himself completely into the most complex, controversial, and mysterious roll of his career. The real-life Truman Capote became so traumatized and scarred while writing In Cold Blood that he never finished another book for the rest of his life. It was the end of his career. Hoffman, on the other hand, is on the verge of an entirely new career  as a leading Hollywood star."

"wisewebwoman","10","4","8","29 October 2005"," Incredible film
","I've been a fan of Truman Capote from way back, introduced to him first by ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" and culminating in the groundbreaking work of his non-fiction novel ""In Cold Blood"" which had me captivated from the first page to the last. Throughout the years since the publication of that book, 1965, I could be wrong on the date, to 1985 when Truman died of alcoholism, I always enjoyed his guest appearances on all the talk shows. He was quick-witted, caustic and nobody's fool.<br/><br/>I've just come from seeing Phillip Seymour Hoffman starring in a movie about a few years in the life of Capote while he was working on ""In Cold Blood"" and I can say without a shadow of a doubt that his performance sent chills through me. It is as if Capote has taken over Hoffman's mind and body, more of a channeling than a performance. He lives walks, talks and breathes as if he is Truman Capote. <br/><br/>The film is beautifully made, the sepia, almost b & w tones at times, brings us back to the late fifties/early sixties when all the action took place. Bennett Miller, who is still under forty, does an admirable job in directing such marvelous actors as the above-mentioned Hoffman, and also Catherine Keener and Chris Cooper to mention just a few of the outstanding cast.<br/><br/>On the surface the story is straightforward wherein Capote writes an article (a preamble to the eventual novel) for the New Yorker magazine about a dreadful multiple homicide in the town of Hokum in Kansas. A whole family is murdered in their beds for a pitiful few dollars by a pair of thugs who hear the farmer has a large stash hidden away.<br/><br/>Through his riveting powers of persuasion (in spite of his lisp and his feyness) Capote gains access to just about everybody involved in this homicide, the detective, the friends and finally the perpetrators themselves, who are behind bars.<br/><br/>He goes behind the scenes and into the psyches of all involved and puts the story together.<br/><br/>Much in the movie is left open for speculation, principally the relationship between Perry Smith (played by Clifton Collins Jr.) and Capote. <br/><br/>Harper Lee is the conscience of Capote. She is the author of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" another fine book and movie and has been lifelong friends with him. She gently calls him to task for his self-centredness but most of the time behaves like a very indulgent older sister.<br/><br/>The movie's focus is on the interviews conducted by Capote on Perry Smith, digging ever deeper into Perry's mind and emotions. The peripherals show Capote entertaining, ad wonderful nauseum, cocktail party sycophants and some slices of his relationship with Jack Dunphy. Up to its horrific climax, a series of insinuating, troublesome, ethical questions would not let me go. (1) In view of the cold-blooded nature of the crime how does one feel about capital punishment? (2) Was Capote in love with Smith and vice versa? (3) Is it ethically OK to lie continuously to a murderer on death row to get your story? (4) Should there be a more humane way of dealing with criminals who come from bleak, oppressive and abusive childhoods? And on.<br/><br/>Capote, in a memorable quote says at one point that he and Smith were raised in the same house, the only difference was that he went out the front door while Smith went out the back door.<br/><br/>Why do some make it on the sunny side of the street while others hide in the alleys coming from the same type of background. Will we ever know?<br/><br/>An unforgettable film. This is what movies are all about. Oscar material. Philip: you have to get the Oscar nod for this.<br/><br/>10 out of 10. Stunning on every level."
"WriterDave","7","4","8","25 October 2005"," Like the Real Capote...Always Compelling but Seriously Flawed
","First off, let's get this out of the way. Philip Seymour Hoffman has received universal praise for his conjuring of Capote on screen, and it is all well deserved. For me, much like Jamie Foxx in last year's ""Ray,"", Hoffman becomes the title character. All the award nominations that are to follow are no joke.<br/><br/>Now, onto the film. The director takes a stark, low-key approach that is supposed to give the film a haunting quality. It works well in the early scenes where Capote and best friend Harper Lee are doing their research, but lacks gravitas in the end with the closing scenes at the gallows.<br/><br/>What the film does well is expertly show the distasteful charm Capote had that made him one of the main stars of the ""Jet Set"" crowd, and he was clearly the life of the party as long as you were sucking up to him. He was extremely self absorbed and unlikable at times, which is why it's hard to reconcile that with his interactions with the killers in doing his research for ""In Cold Blood."" He seems to befriend death-row bound Percy way too easily, and then lies to him to keep the friendship going. On one hand the film shows well Capote's obsession with the true crime that was to become the basis of his seminal work, but it seems to gloss over the relationship he had with the subjects and characters that latter inhabited that book.<br/><br/>In the end I'm not sure what the point of the film is supposed to be. You felt little sympathy for Capote or his subjects, but are left with a good idea of what happens when a talented individual becomes so absorbed with themselves and the idea of their great work, that they barely work again and die wallowing in their own self-pity (""In Cold Blood"" was Capote's last completed book and he died in 1984 from complications from alcoholism).<br/><br/>The film does deserve some credit, though, as it made me want to seek out Capote's works, and in an even odder way made me wonder what the heck happened to the enigmatic Harper Lee (whose character is underused in the film and portrayed wonderfully by the always amazing Catherine Keener)? Her relationship alone with Capote (stemming from childhood) might have made a better film, and the film reminds us that her one and only work, ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" (which she was polishing up while helping Capote research his book) became more revered and well-known (every high school student in America reads it and for good reason) than anything Capote did. There's your real story."
"MikeyB1793","9","2","3","25 July 2012"," Remarkable Representation
","This is a really wonderful film that succeeds on many levels. It's a biography of a great American writer and iconoclast – Truman Capote. It's the struggle of writing a book. And it's about murder. The murder's occurred close to the small town of Holcomb in Kansas in November, 1959 and the entire film has this sombre grey November feel to it (except the scenes of Truman vacationing in Spain).<br/><br/>Phillip Seymour Hoffman gives a complex and emotional portrayal of Capote – we see him as journalist, friend, raconteur, life of the party, and writer. He is presented as successful, brilliant, egotistical, an incisive observer and a deceitful manipulator – a person who could be many things to all the different people he encounters. We witness the struggles he has with completing his book. As Winston Churchill remarked on writing a book: ""To begin with, it is a toy and an amusement; then it becomes a mistress, and then it becomes master, and then a tyrant. The last phase is that just as you are about to be reconciled to your servitude, you kill the monster and fling him to the public."" We particularly experience this quote in the latter half of the film when Truman wants to put an end to it all.<br/><br/>If you are at all interested in the book ""In Cold Blood"" or in the life of Truman Capote this is must film. Phillip Seymour Hoffman deservedly won best Actor for his very strong performance in this film. Perry, (played by Clifton Collins) also gives a strong, but subdued role, as one of the two murderers. There are many eerie and strong one-to-one encounters – particularly when Truman is involved – they add to the tautness and mood of the entire film.<br/><br/>All and all, even with its pervasive melancholia, this is a remarkable film.<br/><br/>Interestingly, another film, on the same topic, was made at the time called ""Infamous"". Truman's role was played by Toby Jones, but I found his role to be too much of a caricature. I felt it lacked the strength of character of ""Capote"", but that is just my opinion."
"tieman64","Null","2","3","30 December 2011"," The Journalist and the Murderer
","Truman Capote wrote ""In Cold Blood"" in 1966, a novel which detailed the 1959 murders of Herbert Clutter, a Kansas farmer, and his wife and two kids. Capote would travel to Kansas in an effort to learn everything about the crime. Accompanying him was Harper Lee (author of ""To Kill a Mockingbird""), who assisted Capote with interviews and note-taking. The Clutter's killers were arrested some six weeks after the murders. Capote's book was published six years after he arrived in Kansas. Many regard ""In Cold Blood"" as having popularised the ""faction"" or ""true crime"" novel, which typically mixes fictional elements with traditional investigative reporting (Gonzo journalism would be borne shortly afterwards).<br/><br/>Capote's book was largely an exercise in whetting the reader's appetite, page after page dwelling on portentous scenery and the imminence of murder. What elevated the novel, though, was Capote's sympathy for Dick Hickock and Perry Smith, the two men responsible for the Clutter murders. As a homosexual and outsider, Capote found himself drawn to these two men, and became particularly infatuated with Perry, who was half-white, half-Cherokee, his dark skin and ancestry as much of a social stigma as Capote's homosexuality and fey, oddball mannerisms. Indeed, both Capote and Perry's families were riddled with suicides, and it was not lost on Capote that had he not been embraced by New York's literati he too may have, like Perry, tumbled into some abyss. What ""In Cold Blood"" thus unconsciously suggested is that the unsettled outsider exists precisely because the Clutters are ""settled"", comfortably embedded in rural America. The novel doesn't absolve the murderers, but nevertheless always implies that Perry and Dick are perpetually homeless, tormented, excluded and perhaps even driven to criminality because the Clutters have a home; are a long-embraced part of white America. <br/><br/>""Capote"", a 2003 film by director Bennett Miller, doesn't delve into these aspects of the novel. ""You are a kind and generous man,"" Capote, played by actor Philip Seymour Hoffman, says sarcastically at one point to a Kansas sheriff who ""graciously"" offers to categorise Perry as being ""officially white"", but for the most part such social/racial avenues are left unexplored.<br/><br/>Still, the film has other things on its mind. Though based on a book by Gerald Clarke, screenwriter Dan Futterman did much of his own research and was heavily influenced by a 1989 New Yorker article by Janet Malcolm (along with her subsequent book, ""The Journalist and the Murderer""). Malcolm's thesis was that journalists inevitably betray the subjects they saddle up to; they suck up to the subject, flatter it, get close, exploit it for news, then cut all ties. Malcolm, who was interested in the ethical and psychological consequences of ""journalist"" and ""subject"" relationships, specifically focused on author Joe McGinniss's relationship with Jeffrey MacDonald, an Army doctor convicted of murdering his family in the 1970s. McGinniss, like Capote, would befriend ""his"" convict and write a book (""Fatal Vision"") based on the murder he investigated. And like Capote, Mcginniss would lead ""his"" convict on, acting like he believed MacDonald was an innocent victim and acting like his prose would help MacDonald's case in and out of court.<br/><br/>So much of Miller's film revolves around Capote's guilt at having befriended killers in order to facilitate a book which benefits not the killers but Capote's own reputation (the film's title now has a double meaning: Capote's cold blooded treatment of Perry). Capote, the film argues, usd these criminals, manipulated them, led them on and then gave them the sudden cold shoulder, a betrayal which Miller argues led to Capote being consumed by guilt. ""I did all I could to help you,"" a self-pitying Capote tells Perry at one point. But we know it's a lie. Because of his emotionally and morally exhaustive experience, Miller would have us believe, a shameful Capote never wrote another book. A postscript tells us he died an alcoholic, of a drug overdose.<br/><br/>Miller and Futterman over-estimate ""In Cold Blood's"" effect on Capote, but assuming they're right, this is still a very thin film. Social relations in America are downplayed, Capote and Perry's similarities aren't substantially delved into, and the ethical questions raised by Capote's ""journalism"" (he appropriates suffering at best, lies and manipulates at worst) aren't really fleshed out. The film doesn't go far enough. Still, in its own low-key way, ""Capote"" is preferable to the sentimental, preachy 1967 version of ""In Cold Blood"", and Miller's misty landscapes, haunting chords and greyish blue, near monochromatic palette captures well the brooding, southern Gothic tone of Capote's novel.<br/><br/>Interestingly, Miller's narrative structure loosely echoes that of Capote's novel, which waits and waits for Perry's own description of the grisly murders, until scenes of awesomely vicious, shocking violence hit us hard in the face. The rest of the film is comprised of gloomy shadows, forlorn faces and long shots of rural Kansas, all evocative of Capote and Perry's shared loneliness. For a better, somewhat similar film, see ""Flesh and Bone"".<br/><br/>Beyond all this, Philip Seymour Hoffman gives a convincing performance as Capote (this really was how Capote spoke and behaved). The film's ancillary characters are mostly cardboard, particularly Harper Lee, played by Catherine Keener. Like ""In Cold Blood"" and ""Gone With The Wind"", Lee's ""Mockingbird"" is another cherished American novel that's become a ""classic"" for all the wrong reasons. Though touted as a book about ""racism"", Lee's stance was mostly one of ""gradualism"", the author believing that the South should be allowed to sacrifice justice, and that it was capable of progress if left to slowly evolve on its own. Hoffman would pick up a Best Actor Academy Award for his portrayal of Capote.<br/><br/>7.9/10 – Very good and at times haunting. See ""Infamous"", ""Flesh and Bone"", ""Murder on a Sunday Morning"", ""Paradise Lost 1 and 2"" and 1967's ""In Cold Blood"". Worth two viewings."

","Phillip Seymour Hoffman is by far my favourite actor of all time. When i first discovered his movies i could never imagine the range he could have as an actor, then i saw this movie. This movie is an interpretation of what possibly Truman Capote (writer of Breakfast at Tiffany's) went through to write his next award winning novel ""In cold blood"". Some people disagree with how this movie and also with how Mr. Hoffman interpreted Truman Capote's character. I disagree with every fibre of my being. There could never be a better person to play this role, and nobody should make the assumption of what Truman Capote was like off camera. If you compare what he was like on the radio and in person you can tell that the man would have suffered from lows off camera, battling with his own emotional turmoil. This movie deserves a 10/10 rating because it draws you in and makes you want to watch it to the end."
"dunmore_ego","7","2","3","14 July 2011"," The movie about the book about the murders.
","CAPOTE, first of all, is not a biopic. It covers a short period in writer Truman Capote's life when he immersed himself in his classic True Crime novel ""In Cold Blood,"" the first ""non-fiction novel"" of its kind. Published in 1965, this revolutionary book would make Capote the most famous writer in America. And it would suck his soul bone dry, as he never completed another novel before his death in 1984.<br/><br/>Directed by Bennett Miller, CAPOTE follows Truman Capote (a trimmer Philip Seymour Hoffman, putting on that outrageous accent and playing fruitier than even his drag queen in FLAWLESS) as he interviews the two killers of the Clutter family in Holcomb Texas in 1959, Richard Hickok (Mark Pellegrino) and Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.). <br/><br/>He lightbulbed on the idea of a book which would reveal their psyches, as well as the reactions of the townsfolk and the detectives who eventually caught the two killers, led by Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper), but didn't bargain on the research being a heartsickening exercise that would take nearly six years of his life, test his skill as an author and his very humanity.<br/><br/>This movie is not taken from Capote's book ""In Cold Blood,"" but rather from a section of the book by Gerald Clarke, ""Capote: A Biography,"" written for the screen by Dan Futterman.<br/><br/>Viewing CAPOTE or reading ""In Cold Blood"" reminds us of that scientific precept that states you cannot observe a system without becoming a PART OF that system and thereby affecting the outcome of your observations.<br/><br/>Upon inserting himself into the story, by becoming so close to the killers that he actually hired powerful lawyers to appeal their cases to the Supreme Court, Capote affected the outcome of his novel; a tale that would keep stretching into the future with no end in sight, because he envisioned the hanging of the killers as closure.<br/><br/>Capote (author of ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" 1958) was completely stymied on how to psychologically deal with this new form of fiction he was pioneering; he found himself split into two mental halves - one half empathizing somberly with the quadruple-murderers, while the mercenary side of him surreptitiously picked their brains for book material. Though he admitted a kinship with Perry Smith (""It was like we were raised in the same house, and one day he got up and walked out the back door, and I walked out the front"") he would continually lie to him about the book's details.<br/><br/>After four years of stays of execution, it was Capote who was having nervous breakdowns because the killers were not being executed. Ergo, his book was in limbo, remaining unfinished. When Smith pleads with him to acquire another lawyer, Capote writes back tersely that he cannot find one. It's a morbid conundrum, as Capote finally wants them dead and so must remove himself from the equation.<br/><br/>Catherine Keener plays Capote's childhood friend and confidante, Nelle Harper Lee, whose own book, To Kill a Mockingbird, is published during this period. Only she can tell him truths about himself with impunity.<br/><br/>One of the best features of this movie is that, while Capote was openly gay, he is never turned into a punchline - not by the high society depicted in the movie or by the makers of the movie. He lived with his gay lover (Bruce Greenwood) with no ostracism from the entertainment world. Though he was renowned as the life of any party, we only see snippets of his gregarious night life in CAPOTE.<br/><br/>Movie is slow-moving but not boring, rather, introspective and disturbing. When Perry is eventually hanged, Capote's tears are not so much for the loss of the man whom he had grown close to, but for the fact that Capote himself could have stayed that man's execution indefinitely if he had chosen to invest in more lawyers; his tears are rage against his own selfish agenda in wanting to complete his book.<br/><br/>Capote expressed no joy at the publication of ""In Cold Blood,"" feeling like his soul was sold for its research.<br/><br/>We feel just as soul-spent by the end of this dark, somber film."

I was really expected a rather poor movie with a great performance from Hoffman but that certainly wasn't the case in the end. Now that I've seen all the Best Picture nominations, if I had a vote I might put it towards this film, which is certainly a masterpiece of a character study and storytelling. I was really shocked at how captivating this film turned out to be. I knew of the actual case but I didn't know too much about Capote but this film certainly made me interested. Hoffman gives the performance of his career as the troubled author. It was rather amazing to watch him with this eccentric voice and how he could use it for comedy or drama. The closing moments of the film are unforgettable but I'm glad the film didn't try to paint Capote as some sort of saint. I've now seen most of the ""big"" (ala ""great"") pictures from 2005 and it was certainly a great year for films."
"blanche-2","10","2","3","21 September 2007"," His greatest success - and his greatest failure
","Philip Seymour Hoffman is ""Capote"" in this meticulously made 2005 film, with a script by Dan Futterman and directed by Bennett Miller. To say that Mr. Hoffman, who, by the way, is from my home town, IS Capote gives his performance an apt description. This is no portrayal. You believe you are watching the funny, quirky and sad Capote throughout.<br/><br/>The film focuses on Capote's interest in the Clutter murders, immortalized in his book, ""In Cold Blood."" Capote goes with his good friend, Harper Lee, who is not yet famous, to Holcomb, Kansas, in order to do an article for the New Yorker. He decides instead to write a book. The book becomes his greatest triumph and probably is responsible for ruining the man forever.<br/><br/>The story of the relationship between Truman and one of the killers, Perry Smith, is brilliantly shown in all its complications. Each uses the other - Perry sees Truman as his get out of jail free card, and Truman sees Perry as his insight into the murders. Smith plays on Truman's feelings for all he's worth, showing himself to be a sensitive artist who, in his own words, thought Mr. Clutter was a nice, gentle man up until the time he slit his throat. On his end, Truman lies his face off to Perry - no, he doesn't have a title for his book, he hasn't written much, Perry's sister misses him, etc. But along the way, Capote begins to feels a kinship for this young man, who shares a similar unhappy childhood with him. He attempts to detach himself from the situation as the killers get stays of execution, but finally, it's too much. He can't finish the book because they're not dead, and the constant notes from Perry are driving him crazy. Perry asks for help in getting another lawyer; Truman writes him a letter and says that he's tried but he can't. We know he didn't try. Capote has what can best be described as a nervous breakdown when, in between drinking bouts, he takes to his bed and stops talking. Once he returns to Kansas, he will witness events that will haunt him for the rest of his life.<br/><br/>Hoffman is perfection as the tortured Capote, and the rest of the cast - Caroline Keener, Clifton Collins, Mark Pellegrino, Chris Cooper and Bruce Greenwood is uniformly excellent, with Collins as the soulful-eyed Perry a standout. Keener's straightforward acting as Harper Lee is a nice juxtaposition to the outrageous Truman. The film is made with incredible attention to detail to set the atmosphere of '50s Kansas, right down to the clothing and color pallet chosen for the film.<br/><br/>""In Cold Blood"" was a career-making book - and the last book Capote ever finished. In the DVD commentary, someone said that Capote probably helped Perry to come to terms with what he'd done. After seeing documentaries involving these murders, it seems clear that Perry never accepted what he'd done and always saw himself as a victim, complaining that he could have been a great artist. But although they each had bad childhoods, Capote ended up as a world-famous author while Perry wound up a cold-blooded murderer.<br/><br/>""There are more tears shed over answered prayers than unanswered ones,"" Capote writes in his unfinished novel, ""Answered Prayers."" In reality, this is a quote from St. Theresa of Avila, and it fits in Capote's case. For the rest of his life, Capote would have to live with the great fame he sought being the result of murder and the fact that, for his mental torture to stop and for his book to complete, he wanted and needed the killers to be dead."

","It was after having watched ""In cold blood"", I embarked upon a viewing session of this film. While I watched the former to ascertain what made so much of hue and cry upon its release, the latter gave me a helpful insight about the writer who decided to write one of the most controversial books of American literature indeed English literature. Although ""Capote"" is a weak film,to my mind it has its pros and cons. Pros are related to the technical side. It is a fact that Bennet Miller's style is rather sedate there are many technical issues which have been deftly handled. To quote a few, most of the viewers would be amazed to discover how Winnipeg has become a good substitute for Kansas. Much of the 1950s rural American landscape especially the Kansas landscape was found in that place. The cons of this film are related to P S Hoffman's portrayal of Capote.He has given a good performance but sometimes it can drive people nuts who are not used to Capote's homo antics. The best thing about this film or one should say that the real scene stealer is Chris Cooper as Dewey. He is the sole reason for watching Capote."
"general-melchett","10","2","3","11 October 2006"," Powerful, shocking, and with the best performance of the past decade, one thing is true - Capote is a true masterpiece.
","This film is more than just a film - it is art. Any old moron can just throw together some epic budget and fancy effects and make a ton at the box office, but very few people can depict the life of a supposedly friendly, yet emotionally decayed writer, in a way that makes us feel strongly about him, and actually strips away the glamour and looks into the more shameful and difficult times in his life. But not so famous director and screenwriter have done it in a way that beats Spielberg and co. hands down and makes us wonder - whose side are you on in this film? Capote is a real 10/10 film in every way - the absolutely amazing screenplay, the emotionally charged directing, the turning of boring old research into a beautiful film, and on top of all, the terrific central performance from Philip Seymour Hoffman, that I hope shall be the highlight of this decade.<br/><br/>Schindler's List was moving, but Liam Neeson's performance never came from the heart, and mostly made him out to be a gruff businessman who did one great deed in his life. But Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance was absolutely flawless - he was a man of many faces, a flamboyant appearance and style, and a man whose emotions you really didn't know. Mr. Hoffman's performance was perhaps the best deserved Oscar of the past ten years, and shows his real interest in his role and also to let everyone know the truth about a man who is one of America's most famous authors. This film tackles a controversial issue with grace and confidence.<br/><br/>All I can say about this film is that it was a breathtaking experience. Everyone will find it powerful and moving, and you will see a performance that will not be equalled this year, next year, or in 2008 for that matter. Capote is an absolutely corking film - not to be missed. On top of that, it recreates the 1950s/60s era very well. An absolute bravo to director Bennett Miller, screenwriter Dan Futterman, Truman Capote's true clone Philip Seymour Hoffman and all the supporting cast - your achievements shall not be forgotten. Brilliant! 10/10"

","When a farm family is murdered in 1959 Kansas, New York writer Truman Capote and friend Harper Lee (on the verge of getting her novel ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" published) travel to the Southwest to get the details on both the killing and the mourning townspeople for a Capote-authored short-story (which became his 'non-fiction novel' ""In Cold Blood""). A calculating, well-observed but chilly film, curious--and morbid--not just for the facts of the horrific case but for laying out the quirky inner-workings of Truman Capote--an enigmatic, perplexing character all his own. Brilliantly shot and edited, the film is enacted by a terrific cast (including Oscar-winner Philip Seymour Hoffman in the lead and Oscar-worthy Chris Cooper as Kansas detective Alvin Dewey, whom Capote had a tough relationship with, and yet wrote about rather heroically). The details are sometimes so correct they are amusingly captured, as with the initially-indifferent Kansas residents taking a liking to Capote or killer Dick Hickock's subtle jealousy at Capote preferring Perry Smith over him. The pacing is sure and steady--though sometimes too quick, with many potentially interesting incidents taking place off-screen--and the central figure is marvelously realized (by Hoffman, and also by director Bennett Miller and screenwriter Dan Futterman). Never less than intriguing, the film is even better than Richard Brooks' adaptation of Capote's book in 1967. *** from ****"

","Although the face was familiar I admit to not knowing Hoffman's name until now...clearly an under-rated actor. Maintaining the character over the full shooting period must have been exhausting and a trial for the greatest actor. Admittedly he was offered wonderful material to use. A flawless performance. (Although it would have been unlikely anyway,I could never have been a friend of Capote's. The voice would have driven me to suicide or murder after an hour or so.) This is a truly compelling film with a superbly crafted script, sensitively handled by the director and cameraman. On a negative note - I gained the distinct impression that despite the displays of apparent warmth, Capote was a chilling creature at heart - something of an opportunist."

","Selecting the final segment in the life of author Truman Capote, the film ""Capote"", delves into the inner and certainly troubled soul of the American Novelist. The film itself, is a somber reflection of the price Capote paid to write what appears to be his most poignant work. The introduction of the book and the movie itself invites the audience into the real life drama of the Kansas family who were brutally murdered by two killers named Richard Hickock (Mark Pellegrino) and Perry Smith (Clifton Collins) in 1963. Along the way, one observes how adroitly, the writer is able to weave his tapestry between truth and fiction to achieve his ultimate goal. With the help of an assortment of great actors, such as Bruce Greenwood (Jack Dunphy) and Chris Cooper, Alvin Dewey) the film exhibits the enormous talent, and human flaws which made Capote a household word. Like an excellent novel, the movie is slow to build, but eventually achieves a touching tribute to the man."
"s_cadzow","9","2","3","27 March 2006"," Hoffman's Brilliant Retribution.
","Bennett Miller's sophomore film, Capote, is best described as a silent killer riding atop the shoulders of a giant. That giant is Philip Seymour Hoffman. The film itself is fluent in objective and prolifically entertaining, making for a very steady film, with an unbeatable trump card.<br/><br/>Capote focuses on the life of famous author Truman Capote, from 1959  mid 1960's as he travels to Halcomb, Kansas to write an article about a brutally murdered family. When he, and good friend (and sidekick for the film) Harper Lee arrive, what they find is something much more engrossing, something that changes Truman Capote for the rest of his life, and end in the best work he will ever write, In Cold Blood.<br/><br/>Bennet Miller does not spend much time outside of Capote's obsession with his research for his novel, and that goes much appreciated. Focusing on the strong bond that Capote forms with one of the murderers, Perry Smith, we get to see who the real Truman Capote is. The basis of their entire relationship, which drives the film, is a kind of catch 22. Does Truman really come to ever care enough to want Perry alive, or is it Capote's selfishness to complete his novel, and more so, does Truman himself even know? The library of mannerisms unique to Truman Capote is brought to light in some fashionably played and surprisingly humorous scenes. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is unshakable in his interpretation. He executes an all eyes on me performance, which caricaturizes the real Capote's ability to entertain a crowd flawlessly.<br/><br/>Truman always had a way of being the life of a party, by talking about nothing but himself and his work, yet with no one catching onto the egocentricity of it all, and this is the highlight of Hoffman's brilliant performance. There is a scene in Capote where Truman is at a party after spending months researching in Kansas, wooing the crowd with tales of the convicts and the murders. He goes on to exclaim that ""This is the book that I was born to write,"" turning to the woman next to him and asking ""So what have you been up to?"" letting out a hearty sarcastic laugh as if to say ""Well it doesn't compare to me or my work, so what does it matter?"" Next to never do you get the chance to see an actor immersed so completely in a role as Philip Seymour Hoffman is as Truman Capote.<br/><br/>The only minor problem I had with Capote, as a whole was the almost depreciated expectations that Bennett Miller placed before Hoffman. I felt that Miller limited Hoffman to a commonly linear formula, and despite Hoffman's brilliance, he couldn't break free far enough for what I really wanted to see. This role was Hoffman's ascension to a level that most actors will never reach, and while his performance will be talked about by film classes for decades to come, it is clearly obvious that Phillip Seymour Hoffman wasn't done, he was consumed, and he was more than able to take on more of Truman Capote.<br/><br/>I adored Capote from start to finish, absolutely adored it. For those of you, like me, who have been watching Hoffman through Magnolia and Love Liza, there is no better retribution for Hoffman than the acclaim he has received for his role as Truman Capote. With a new level of fame surrounding Hoffman and up and coming director Bennett Miller, I can only hope we see a pairing of these two talents again in the near future. As far as Capote goes, it is without question a film to be added to the must see lists of everyone in the interest of educated cinema."
"wkbeason","10","2","3","26 March 2006"," Exceptional performance by Hoffmann in a superbly executed (pun intended) complex film
","About six months after I was born in 1959 there was a terrible murder in a small town in Kansas. Truman Capote, probably the most noted writer in America at that time (having recently published the critically-acclaimed best-seller ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"") read about this murder in the front section of the New York Times. Capote decided he wanted to do an in-depth article on the crime for The New Yorker magazine.<br/><br/>He traveled out to Kansas with his childhood friend Nelle Harper Lee who had just written ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" but had not had yet gotten it published. He lived in this small town for several months, becoming friendly and familiar with the people there, interviewing everyone who would talk to him about the crime and the victims. Shortly after his arrival the murders were caught in Las Vegas and delivered to Kansas authorities. Capote managed to interview both of them and was immediately struck by the fact that there was much more than a magazine article under the surface here. He became so engaged with the events and the human beings involved in them that he devoted the next five years of his life to a singular book project which was to revolutionize literature as the first ""factual novel."" The results became his most famous work, ""In Cold Blood."" It influenced writers from the moment it came out, it still influences today. After ""In Cold Blood"" was published in mid-1960's, Capote never finished another novel. He became a severe alcoholic and died from complications of alcoholism in 1984. The writing of ""In Cold Blood""  so the interpretation goes  killed him.<br/><br/>Capote is a film about the writing of the novel, the creative process, the obsession that motivated it, the lives that were affected by the act of writing it, and ultimately about how the novel changed its author even more than it changed the world of literature. Philip Seymour Hoffman won the Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Truman and deservedly so. It is, quite simply, the most astonishing performance I have seen in recent years by an actor. He captures the essence of the flamboyant, poetic, and insightful homosexual literary genius.<br/><br/>But, surrounding this performance is an aesthetic, intellectual, and technical construct of film-making that is rare today. The film runs for 114 minutes, is very slowly (but deliberately) paced, has many, many moments of extended pauses to allow the effect of the cinematography or the subtle, accentuated acting to take hold on the viewer. In quick time, however, it manages to generate a delicate intensity that I found captivating and entertaining.<br/><br/>Each moment in the film is allowed to happen in quiet refinement. Actors are allowed film space to just look at each other, they talk to themselves, the landscapes gone on and on in darkly toned contrasts, lines of dialog linger without an edit. The New York urban jazz party scenes heighten the sense of alienation brought forth and made apparent in the way comfortable literary society is contrasted with the gray earthiness of the criminally violent. Hoffman's Capote becomes deeply connected with both words and is able to translate that into an art form that traps the man and never lets him go.<br/><br/>Moment by moment this is allowed to build so that when the night of the murders is finally revealed to us in bright flashes of bloody horror it seems paradoxically at once brutal, grotesque, and subdued. Indeed their very pointlessness is perhaps the film's most shocking revelation.<br/><br/>This is a terrific film with a superb cast, writing, cinematography, and direction. All elements work well to engage the viewer and show how the contrasts and paradoxes between and within individual lives can shake a sensitive artist to his very core. In some sense, the film allows us to sample what that must have been like. To that extend, we may not understand Truman Capote but we certainly know his anguish. Those seeking resolution or absolution will be disappointed but then life seldom is neatly wrapped up for the sake of one evening's popcorn. This one's real."
"A_Roode","9","2","3","13 March 2006"," A tremendous and devastating film
","I missed 'Capote' in its initial theatre run but was lucky enough to see it in the brief post-Oscar running that it has been given. Seeing it this afternoon was particularly great since the theatre was empty except for myself and three other people. It felt like a private screening. I found 'Capote' ... devastating and an emptying experience. It was a tremendous film and I feel so lucky to have seen it on the big screen.<br/><br/>As has been noted in countless other reviews and by the many acting awards and accolades 'Capote' has earned him, Phillip Seymour Hoffman was tremendous and a lot of the film's strength is due in part to his performance. He really did become the part and was mesmerizing. His portrayal presents a man who is dedicated to his art, not unlikeable but perhaps not truly likable by the end of the film either, and a man who is by turns flamboyant, eccentric, complex, manipulative and calculating. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is a tour de force and I didn't see a better performance in the past year.<br/><br/>Supporting parts are the characters who often make or break a film and someone who seems to have been over-looked in 'Capote' is Clifton Collins. 'Capote' has four chameleon actors -- Clifton Collins, Bob Balaban, Bruce Greenwood and Phillip Seymour Hoffman who always play very interesting (albeit quite often minor) characters. They are the strength of 'Capote' and their constant professionalism in all roles made 'Capote' an even better film. I hope that his work in particular will bring Clifton Collins some juicier roles in the future. I've been a fan for a while now and the horizon is wide open for him. I should also add quickly that Catherine Keener -- always great to see her! -- is quite good here too. She has the most devastating line in the film when she says ""You could have. But you didn't want to."" I'll not say anything other than that because I don't want to ruin things for anyone who hasn't yet watched the film.<br/><br/>The ending of the film really struck me. I almost wish they had played the credits at the beginning of the movie, believe it or not. The consequences of Capote's path and actions during the film are thunderous and clearly are destined to haunt him for the rest of his life. The credits would have played well at the beginning because with a final printed statement as epilogue, I think 'Capote' is near to as perfect of a character study as I have seen in a long time. It's silence and abrupt end would have been even more numbing than it already was. 'Capote' is highly recommended."

","Philip Seymour Hoffman's impersonation of Truman Capote deserves all the accolades it has received. It's not alone the mimicry of Capote's mannerisms and speaking voice that makes this performance so compelling. He also shows with devastating clarity the erosion of Capote's integrity, the deterioration of his personality, his pettiness (particularly the pique he displays when his childhood friend, Harper Lee, is lionized for her book, ""To Kill a Mocking Bird."") At the beginning of the film, Capote is an outrageous but amusing figure on the New York social/literary scene, an already famous writer looking for his next sensational subject. By the end of the film, he has committed every conceivable journalistic sin in order to gather the material for his last and most famous book, ""In Cold Blood."" The film is a little slow at times but the leisurely pace is necessary to detail the exposure of Capote's character flaws and the, at times, subtle but steady decline in his humanity. Capote is in some ways a pitiable figure when the film ends but he's earned every last bit of the dislike he inspires. Capote isn't a great movie -- but the performance is incomparable. There aren't many Oscars that are as richly deserved as the one Hoffman earned."

","The most amazing thing about Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote is that it has almost nothing to do with his mastery of the man's unforgettably precious speech or coy mannerisms. His true achievement is making those affectations disappear almost immediately beneath the skin of the most complex character Hoffman has ever played on screen. When Capote, the egomaniacal young city slicker, decides to explore how a sleepy Kansas town is affected when four members of one of its most prominent families are brutally murdered, he has no idea where the story will lead or the emotional toll that it will take on himself and those around him. In one of the convicted killers he finds a real life character beyond anything his mind could have conjured. But the fate of his book and that of its subject are inextricably linked and it can't turn out well for both. The commingled bravado and vulnerability with which Hoffman as Capote faces this paradox is his truly amazing feat."

","Truman Capote, a writer for The New Yorker, travels to Kansas after hearing a story about a brutal murder of a family. Capote digs deep into the story, believing that this story will be his greatest work ever. So he can have the perfect ending Capote develops a rather close relationship with one of the killers, Perry Smith. The book becomes one of the greatest books ever written, it is, In Cold Blood.<br/><br/>Philip Seymour Hoffman has always been very good in everything he does. From small roles such as Boogie Nights and Cold Mountain, Hoffman always lit up the screen. With Capote, he is able is showcase his talent, as the main star. If you thought Jamie Foxx was brilliant as RAY, then you will be awe-struck by what Hoffman does with Capote. Come Oscar time, get ready to hear ""And the Oscar For Best Actor In A Motion Picture Goes To....Philip Seymour Hoffman""<br/><br/>In the past couple of years, the Best Actor and Best Actress winners, Jamie Foxx and Charlize Theron gave brilliant performances in mediocre films. Here, Bennett Miller is able to keep up with the performance and the story. Granted, the movie does drag on in parts and is a tad boring, Capote is one of the better films that is going to be rewarded for it's performances. Miller makes us feel comfortable throughout the movie because he knows that everyone will be amazed by Hoffman's performance, so when we see the actual killings, it strikes a cord. We don't expect it, it comes out of nowhere. The second half of the film is the better half, it where Hoffman's performance really drives the film.<br/><br/>Catherine Keener did not amaze me too much. She did a decent job, but her being given an Oscar nomination just proves that there aren't very many good supporting performances out there. Keener's smile always gives her performance away, you see right through the character and all you're left with is Keener. Chris Cooper has too little screen time to work with. Granted, Capote only uses him for information, like he does with the killers.<br/><br/>The film does fault with it's pace. Even though it is better then the other films I mentioned, it does go on and on. I almost fell asleep, until Hoffman really got things going. The film is just really depressing and slow moving that it's uncomfortable.<br/><br/>Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance, is by fay, the best performance of the year, no doubt. It is the best performance in years. Like Foxx with RAY, Hoffman becomes Capote. Hoffman is so good as Capote it's frightening. He gives us a unique, uneasy, bold, sympathetic, cold, human, performance. Hoffman does the most subtle things with this character that it just brings it life more and more each time, whether it's playing with his ear, or the way he hold a cigarette or even how he holds a glass when he drinks. Every little detail is nailed perfectly by Hoffman. Hoffman makes this film what it is, one of the best performances of the century. Don't listen to all the critics raving about it, don't listen to all the award shows, go and see for yourself.<br/><br/>The script shows Capote befriending one of the killers so he can write a book. Capote seems cold and heartless, but then you see what the murderers did and you question yourself, do they deserve it. Capote feels like he is the the middle of a tug of war, between the evil of the killers, and the gentleness he sees. Again, Hoffman pulls this off beautifully. There is no other actor who can portray this character as good as Hoffman has done, and no one should try because they will ultimately fail.<br/><br/>See Capote for the riveting performance, then again, that's why everyone is seeing it anyway."

","This film is disturbing without being barbaric. It shows that a story about a crime does not have to be coated with blood, semen, or DNA to be enthralling. The gruesomeness of the crimes chronicled in ""In Cold Blood"" are captured in two very brief scenes. Aside from those scenes, the film could be turned into a play without losing a thing. The film will not make you gag, but it will certainly make you shudder. Hoffman plays Capote so brilliantly that you want to both hug him and throttle him, sometimes simultaneously. His performance alone is worth the price of admission. Hoffman may not have the Best Actor Oscar in his pocket, but he has certainly set the bar quite high."

","In a very odd way I can't help but connect with these characters. For me the film it's about looking for kindness and trying to understand everyone, that's with what I came out from this film.<br/><br/>Hoffman is one of my most favourite actors, he was a character actor and a pretty good one. Prior to Capote he would have had mostly minor roles, but even though those roles were so small he would put a lot of effort in them, and that is why I liked him so much.
In Capote he shows of what he's was made of, carrying the film on his shoulders, because although Catherine Keener was nominated for her performance (I guess it would have been a weak year for supporting actresses), Capote is a one-man show.<br/><br/>Amazing performance. Maybe it's my current mood for finding the movie depressing and a bit boring, but although depressing, much like Miller's other work the film it is a bold effort."

","So here we have it, the actor and the subject he portrays, in my perception both important names in the American cultural life, in and about few of the things having the stamp Made in America that Americans can actually still feel proud of: movies and literature. Both viewed in the clarifying insight that death provides. The actor Philip Seymour Hoffman who with this movie established his fame firmly and that was described as a turning point in his career. Similarly for the portrayed, the real author Truman Capote (also himself an actor once), while already quite famous at the time, with his 'non -fiction novel' (if ever there was an oxymoron) In Cold Blood also shot to stardom. So it is very interesting and understandable that the creators of this biopic chose the period in which this novel came into being and by casting an actor also on the verge of a solid breakthrough. For me the movie was a nice introduction to the person of Truman Capote who appears as a complex personality with his all too human vanity, piercing perception and ruthless exploitation of emotions pertaining to the heart in the service of his goal: to write a great book. To gauge if the quirky manners of Capote has seen here have any connection with reality maybe you should watch some old footage from the era, but somehow the sense of trust emerges that Seymour Hoffman had been doing just that and it earned him an Oscar. Slowly and decidedly the plot builds up to the point where it cuts to the chase regarding the events on that fateful day when the victims were slayed and to get that story out of the main perpetrator. In parallel another very connected plot is building: the equally decided machinations of the American justice system with its appeals and hearings leading up to the eventual and unavoidable execution of the convicted. By hanging. A good old Kansas hanging and even if it takes place in a confined space with well dressed fancy hatted witnesses it cannot escape the notion that it is equally barbaric as a public hanging of old in the town square with cowboys and a horse pulling the rope. The movie can be credited for providing us this insight of how the deplorable practice was performed (the gallows are now on display). Of course a great climax for the movie and enabling Capote to finish the book that since watching this movie has piqued my interest. Summarizing this movie is interesting on many levels as for me it provided some food for thought and spurred further exploration, I recommend to watch it and bring a friend."

","Watching Philip Seymour Hoffman inhabit the singular character that was Truman Capote is a triumph of art, even if like with a lot of Hoffman, I find an underlying pain tends to dominate.<br/><br/>""Capote"" puts us in the Clutter household in Holcomb, Kansas, early one November morning in 1959. The family has been murdered for no clear reason, frightening the community. In New York City, the celebrated fiction writer Truman Capote reads of the crime and decides he must go there, in search of something he doesn't understand. This will eventually both produce his masterpiece and ruin him, not necessarily in that order.<br/><br/>""It's the book I was always meant to write,"" he tells high-society friends between languid puffs of his cigarette. ""What have you been up to?""<br/><br/>""Capote"" the film may oversell the idea that the strain and emotional toll it took Capote to write ""In Cold Blood"" caused him to descend into an alcoholic nullity. But Hoffman's finely-tuned performance does deliver. His voice and manner accurately summon the famous talk-show guest I remember. His eyes alternately suggest aloofness and pain, which is what makes for Capote's tragedy.<br/><br/>It seems that Capote is a wonderful one for empathy as something to pull out of his writer's tool box, using it to form a bond with a leery investigator, Alvin Dewey, Jr. (Chris Cooper). But he has more trouble with empathy from the heart, which comes across especially when he meets one of the accused murderers, Perry Smith (Clifton Collins, Jr.).<br/><br/>Smith and Capote immediately bond, as both are outsiders. But whereas Smith sees a friend, Capote sees a ""gold mine,"" and one in need of mining before the state executioner steps in. Most of what director Bennett Miller and scripter Dan Futterman focus on in the second half is how much of this amounts to a devil's bargain, given the games Capote plays. Capote's lover, Jack Dunphy (Bruce Greenwood) and his childhood pal and researcher, Harper Lee (Catherine Keener) provide the moral conscience from the sidelines.<br/><br/>I found them to be wet blankets, especially Greenwood, who seems to be directed to communicate seething ambidirectional jealousy in every scene. For all the gambits and head games Capote played, he was also working on a story that would present Smith and his accomplice, Dick Hickock (Mark Pellegrino), in as decent a light as two wanton killers ever got.<br/><br/>It feels at times like ""Capote"" overeggs the morality lesson, and its sepulchral pace adds to the weight. But the visual tone is keenly done, especially Adam Kimmel's serene shots of Manitoba doubling for Kansas. Hoffman's Oscar win is well-earned, as he centers a number of powerful scenes showcasing his character at opposite ends of the emotional spectrum, schmoozing with the cognoscenti and trying to compose himself for a final farewell with Smith and Hickock.<br/><br/>Did Capote really go completely silent in print after ""In Cold Blood"" as the movie has it? Not if you count his 1980 best-selling collection, ""Music For Chameleons."" But Futterman's script tells a tale that resonates with the compromises writers make in practicing their craft, and Hoffman's searing humanity carries overtones of classical tragedy.<br/><br/>""It's the hardest when someone has a notion about you and it's impossible to convince them otherwise,"" he tells a Clutter friend by way of inveigling some useful information on the family. I have a feeling if Capote was still alive, he'd want use of that same line for Miller and Futterman.<br/><br/>Whether it's fact or fiction, ""Capote"" the film makes a riveting case study. I think Capote, who made a career out of obscuring the two forms, would have appreciated it."

","""Capote"", like it's subject, is not conventional. Rather than trying to observe Trumand Capote's entire life in one film, it observes the peak of his career and his turning point in his life, and that is the four years that he was researching and writing the first non fiction novel, ""In Cold Blood"". Yet the film seems to do justice to his entire life by subtle dialogue and showing his major development over the course of these four years. The film has a quiet, somber mood that fits perfectly with the subject, and one of Philip Seymour Hoffman's greatest performances in a career full of great performances.<br/><br/>Truman Capote hears about a murder of the Clutters family in Kansas, and begins to do research on the subject. Buy when he finally sees one of the two murderers, Perry Smith, he seems immediately entranced by how lonely and shy Perry is, completely reversing his expectations, and as a shot in that scene shows, he feels like he is trapped in a cage away from Perry, rather than vice versa. But what Truman really sees is himself in Perry. As Truman states earlier in the film, people often feel that they know him, or have him figured out when really they have no idea who he is. And the same goes for Perry. He is a murderer, and that's all that most people will ever see in him from now on. But Truman sees something else, and wants, no, needs to understand this man. Truman places a lot of emphasis on the fact that he wants to change the way the world views Perry, and he also seems to want to change the way he is viewed. He says Perry wants so desperately to be taken seriously, but Truman is trying the be taken seriously by making this book as well. He begins meeting with him and they slowly reveal themselves to each other, Truman learning that Perry had a troubled childhood as well. Perry is very reluctant to talk about the actual murder, however. <br/><br/>Truman begins drifting away from everyone else in his life, and there comes a point in the film 2 here it seems that the two may be using each other, but then the scene comes where Perry talks about the murders with Truman, and it's clear that the two have a connection. Ironically, the time when Perry seems the most weak and vulnerable is actually in the scene of the murders. After this, it cuts forward, and at this point Truman just wants this to be over, and frankly, he just hopes that Perry can just die so he never has to worry about him again. Perry begins trying to contact him, but Truman knows that he can't let himself get connected to Perry again, or else he may never recover. Eventually, however, just before his execution, Perry sends a heartfelt letter that brings Truman to him shortly before his execution. He witnesses the execution and kept telling himself there was nothing he could do to prevent it afterwords. But he can't escape the truth and it seems a part of him was lost forever when Perry died.<br/><br/>The film is a not only a great character study, but one of the greatest biopics of all time, and a sad reminder that there is almost always much more to the people we think we understand."
"arturmachado-29588","7","1","1","22 April 2016"," The making of the book ""In Cold Blood""
","What I like most about movies is that you can learn something from (some of) them. Having read the non-fiction novel ""In Cold Blood"", literary genre which Truman Capote claims to be pioneer, I was curious about this movie. The book describes the true events of how two young Americans met and the brutal homicide they committed against a family in 1959 Kansas; and the movie tells us the story of how that book came to be.<br/><br/>What's it about:<br/><br/>We are presented to Truman Capote (magisterially played by Philip Seymour Hoffman that deservedly won the Oscar for this performance), showing us the man, what he did, his social circles, his intimacy and motivations. So we get an idea of who he was, when then comes the murder news that lead Capote to his investigation, personally interviewing the captured murderers, going so far as to create a bond of friendship specially with Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.).<br/><br/>What's bad:<br/><br/>The title is misleading as it is not so much a biography but an episode of Capote's life, namely the making of the book ""In Cold Blood"". Although the movie establishes well a portrayal of Truman's personality, instead of wasting so much time with long and still shots of plains and buildings and him staring at the horizon, it could give us know the why he be so, is origins, more background on how he came to the literary circle and what more works he published besides the well known ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" that resulted on the homonymous movie starling Audrey Hepburn. Moreover, it is known that Truman maintained a long-term homosexual relationship with the also novelist Jack Dunphy (Bruce Greenwood), but that idea is only insinuated never shown directly if they were more than really close friends.<br/><br/>What's good:<br/><br/>Proclaiming to be a biography it shows little, but something is better than nothing. At first I was going to rate this movie 6/10, but now that I've given it some thought I see the genie behind. The investigation and the friendship with Perry were events that deeply marked Capote for the rest of his life, so much that one can say that he sacrificed himself (voluntarily or not) in order to leave us a legacy (as questionable as it may be), and I believe Hoffman did it also with this role. Good directing, sets, color, shots, costumes and all the cast are at the highest level marvelously complementing this unhurriedly told story that being a sad one, does not try to be sentimentalist, and that I congratulate.<br/><br/>Worth seeing. 7/10.<br/><br/>22/04/2016<br/><br/>R.I.P., Philip Seymour Hoffman (1967-2014).

Truman Capote writes about the murder of one family and visits the prison where the murderers are held. Heart of the story regards the bond he forms with one of them and his quest to help him appeal the case. Director Bennett Miller details the film through Capote's inability to cope with the bond he has formed and the reality of the death penalty sentence. Strongest asset is the performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman whose light voice betrays his brilliance as a writer and he very way with language. Hoffman has been terrific in scene stealing supporting roles but here he is given a much deserved shot at centre stage and pulls off one of the best performances of the year. Catherine Keener is effective as his assistant in his research. Unfortunately supporting actors are not quite as highlighted and barely standout. Chris Cooper, Amy Ryan and Bruce Greenwood are flat and not given the roles that their talent should elevate. The film doesn't applaud or sympathize with the murderers but rather it reveals them through Capote's view of them. It is a detailed look into a life full of grief and depression masked by the sheer talent of an individual unable to counter the downfall. Score: 9 / 10"

I recommend this approach for just about anyone. The story is then told from two different perspectives, and really shows how Capote inserted himself into the narrative.

","A high point in the career of Phillip Seymour Hoffman was his Oscar winning portrayal of Truman Capote in the 2005 Bennett Miller film ""Capote"". Hoffman's transformation into the flamboyant and controversial writer was striking in that he completely lost himself in the role and seemed to virtually channel Capote's spirit. From the voice, the mannerisms, and everything in between this was Hoffman's role of a lifetime.<br/><br/>""Capote"" tells the story of how he wrote his most famous book ""In Cold Blood"", the true story of a quadruple homicide in rural Kansas in 1959. Together with his research assistant Harper Lee, who would write a modern masterpiece herself in ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", it took Truman 4 years to write. Although the story only encompasses about four years, we are given and very intimate look at the life of Capote. Who he was, his thought processes, and much more. All of this would not have been possible with out the amazingly authentic portrayal by Hoffman.<br/><br/>Two men are eventually arrested and convicted of these brutal murders, Perry Smith and Richard Hickok. To get access to the men, Capote bribes the warden and begins a sort of strange relationship with Perry. Truman is very empathetic to Perry's life and upbringing. He humanizes him to the public and helps him get a new Lawyer and possibly a new hearing. Capote's motives and ethics are one of the driving forces of the film. He is writing a true crime novel, but personally influences the events to fit a sort of story line. Although he exploits Perry for his story, he has trouble holding back some very strong feelings for him.<br/><br/>While the men are on death row and keep getting stays of execution, Capote is driven to the brink of collapse since he is unable to finish his book until they die. During this time Perry's pleas for help go unanswered as Truman is unable or unwilling to help anymore. He needs to be done with this book and Perry.<br/><br/>At the end of the film we are told that after writing ""In Cold Blood"" Truman Capote never finished another book and died from alcoholism in 1984. It's amazing movie although a very slow burn and meticulously put together. It's a character study like no other."

","Philip Seymour Hoffman gives the performance of his career: a nearly flawless, nuanced portrayal of American writer Truman Capote. The story is probably ingrained in the popular consciousness due to Capote's famous book, as well as the movie adaptation starring Robert Blake, but the filmmakers manage to bring a freshness to the material that makes it engaging despite the rather low-key atmosphere projected by the images and music that accompany the story. There was also an incredible performance by Clifton Collins Jr as Perry Smith, one of the murderers who Capote develops an iffy relationship with.

","Hoffman's passing warrants reconsideration of this exceptional film, one that places extraordinary demands on truly attentive viewers but that also rewards. Hoffman's capturing and channeling of New York literary scene cocktail party Capote, in which Capote is at once vicious and savage but also endearing and entrancing, exasperating and paradoxical, is among the best thespianism ever put to celluloid: Hoffman catches lightning and controls it utterly. Catherine Keener's performance as Harper Lee is affable, but perhaps not an authentic depiction of the irremediably solipsistic and often self-defeating Lee. Every performance from this huge cast is handsome and crisp, and the film's makers clearly grasp and convey the grandeur of this long episode in Capote's life. The script contains enough episodes, exchanges, and protean depictions of Capote to allow watchers to formulate opinions about a man not readily formulable even if its handling has a fine penumbra of froideur and humorlessness."

","This is more of a character study than a biopic. Although, at their best, isn't that what biopics are anyway? The facts are the facts. But who were these people? We get a splendid impression of Truman Capote and we get fleeting impressions of everyone else in the film and how they related to Capote. Nelle Harper Lee actually interviewed the killers with Capote, and the film does something to acknowledge that she assisted in the research, but by the time Capote gets to the interview, Lee has lost her importance to him. The film implies that to him, she disappeared altogether. You see her occasionally, when he needs someone to jolt him into action, or you see his quiet lover Jack, fervently resting in the corners of his life waiting to be seen by him. Jack finishes a novel and Capote hardly notices. If Capote is at a party, he's either the life of it, or in a corner sulking and waiting on someone (Lee) to come coddle him so he can pontificate on how much torture it is to wait on the appeal (he can't finish his book until the killer's are dead). Lee accidentally wrote the greatest novel of the 20th century. Capote made sure he'd written the greatest nonfiction of the 20th century. Problem was, he set the bar so high for himself, he couldn't even go sideways. So, instead of writing something less deserving, he drank. The film is at fault in giving us the impression that the killer's affected Capote and that is the reason he never wrote again. I feel it makes more sense if he simply realized he had nothing better to offer the world than to continue being the life of the party. That's a difficult task to perform as the years roll by. Legacies take longer than life usually."

Catherine Keener's nomination is a bit baffling though. Clifton Collin Jr. is the real supporting stand-out. He gives is an understated, expressive, and mesmerizing performance.

Surprisingly she's still alive but reclusive to give interviews for decades. In many ways, Truman and Nelle were opposites who were both writers. Truman isn't a very likable character in my opinion. He is as shallow at times as the people he writes about. He loved a good party and he needed to be the center of attention. I believe this film shows Truman's inner demons as well. His alcoholism would kill him but he was haunted by his conscience and his relationship with the two murderers. The film director does a fantastic job in recreating life in 1959. The actors who play Smith and Hickcock do a fantastic job. Chris Cooper does a great job in playing Alvin. Bruce Greenwood's performance of Jack Dunphy is adequate as well.

","I had seen Douglas McGrath's 'Infamous' before Bennett Miller's 'Capote'. Even though both films focus on Capote and his persistence to write about the grisly murder, they differ in treatment and execution. Miller's film looks gloomier mostly because of the washed out colours and it lacks humour while McGrath's film has a good dose of humour. On the technical side, both movies are very well made as they successfully capture the essence of the time period. Also, the relationship between Perry Smith and Capote are portrayed vary in both movies. Actually the Perry Smith characters are different. Yet, I like both movies. While Miller's direction is commendable, it is Philip Seymour Hoffman who stands out in the title role. Tobey Jones did an equally outstanding job in 'Infamous' and it is interesting to compare both performances. Jones's version of Capote is more flamboyant and expressive while Hoffman's version is more toned down. Clifton Collins Jr, Catherine Keener (though unfortunately she does not have much screen time) and Chris Cooper do solid jobs as the supporting cast. In the end, 'Capote' and 'Infamous' are both fascinating portraits of the same enigmatic man and how a violent crime that didn't even remotely have anything to do with him, changed his life.

","In a nutshell, ""Famed author Truman Capote befriends two murderers while researching his celebrated book 'In Cold Blood' - and finds himself changed to the core."" Having relatives who knew Mr. Capote makes me want to disagree, slightly, with this film's closing theme. The film portends Capote ""never finished another book"" due to an emotional attachment formed with killer Perry Smith. But the real reason for Capote's writer's block was that he was never again really sober long enough to call upon Clio, or any of the other muses which fueled his creativity.<br/><br/>My grandmother told me some amusing stories about Capote, including how he'd order: ""Vodka on the rocks,"" and, after a pause Jack Benny would appreciate, add, ""hold the rocks."" This was in a Sag Harbor, NY bar; Capote ""held court"" in many watering holes around the world, and was always the life of the party. Grandmother enjoyed this film, but not more than either ""In Cold Blood"" or the real Truman Capote (when he wasn't being too sardonic).<br/><br/>Capote might have appreciated this film (while trashing it in public), as it could be described as the dramatization (by Dan Futterman) of a speculative biography (by Gerald Clarke) about a nonfiction novel (by Capote). Secondary sources rule. And, for a 2005 film, there is a surprising lack of intimacy shown. Capote and companion Bruce Greenwood (as Jack Dunphy) are like brothers, his much-heralded ""love"" for Smith is debatable, and only once does Capote try to hook up (don't blink) with a potential sex partner.<br/><br/>The production is first rate, with director Bennett Miller guiding an excellent cast. Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal doesn't inhale, but it's the best Truman Capote since ""Murder by Death"" (1976); and, it provided Mr. Hoffman with a mother-lode of ""Best Actor"" awards. ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" writer Catherine Keener (as Nelle Harper Lee) and aspirin-chewing Clifton Collins Jr. (as Perry Smith) are among the many notable ""Best Supporting"" players.<br/><br/>******* Capote (9/2/05) Bennett Miller ~ Philip Seymour Hoffman, Catherine Keener, Clifton Collins Jr."

It's a complicated script, because of the controversy of the story between Capote and one of the defendants of the crime; Perry Smith. On the other hand, and repeating myself, Futterman touches that theme with an astonishing finesse and touch, leaving the task of interpreting their relationship almost entirely to the audience. The script has its flaws too, with some little, but maybe unnecessary scenes (under my point of view) and the feeling that it sometimes doesn't go into the ""killers"" psychology deep enough.<br/><br/>The direction is really good, with some beautiful scenes (as the first time Capote arrives to the house were the murders happened) and great takes, but Miller takes a huge risk as he's, starting from the ""one year later scene"", in the edge of making the film too dense, or simply, boring. However, and in the final act, everything goes back to normal, and, although I found the end to be a little bit abrupt, it ends magnificently<br/><br/>As you may have heard, the acting is specially incredible. Some secondaries in state of grace as the amazing, with only staring or smiling, Mrs. Catherine Keener, a really good Chris Cooper and a sensational Clifton Collins Jr. I found (don't ask me why) Pellegrino to be the weakest of all the cast, doing, however, a difficult job with good results, but not as good as I expected. I found the scene with the photos a little ridiculous because of him, Ihad the feeling that he couldn't control himself. And, of course, the whole movie's weight fall on Hoffman's back, who does a performance that i don't have words to describe. In the last few years I hadn't seen such an incredible performance; he's not impersonating Capote, he IS Truman Capote. His voice, his mannerisms,... His acting was another risk, as it could have seemed that he was ""mocking"" Capote, but he's simply enormous in this role.<br/><br/>I give it a 7.5/10 because of some lack of rhythm, and some direction flaws, all almost erased by Phillip Seymou Hoffman's marvelous acting skills.<br/><br/>P.S.: Sorry for the poor English. I'm Spanish."

","Capote is a film adapted from a book tracing author Truman Capote's journey in writing his legendary piece, In Cold Blood, a novel about a gruesome murder of a family in Kansas.<br/><br/>The most praise-worthy aspect of the film is acting. I applaud Phillip Seymour Hoffman for his outstanding portrayal of an openly gay individual. My sister actually mistook him for one, only to blame it on his outstanding acting. Catherine Keener also gave a somewhat satisfactory performance, and so did Clifton Collins Jr.<br/><br/>Capote also guarantees viewers to shed at least a single teardrop because of its moving story that is enriched by the outstanding acting of Hoffman. The development of the friendship between Capote and Smith is definitely underlined in order to keep the story moving in that direction, and that friendship definitely brought out strong emotions from the actors and viewers alike. By the end of the film, my sister, who said that she felt that the movie was boring, was actually the one crying buckets! I too teared up a little, and it is actually rare that I cry because of a movie.<br/><br/>Final say? Capote's an outstanding movie. It has a good story that runs straight up to the end, the outstanding acting makes viewers empathize with each and every character, and the overall direction is also outstanding. I commend the producers for making such a brilliant film that will be remembered throughout the ages."
"ClaytonDavis","8","1","1","24 November 2007"," The Truman Capote Exposition
","In his directorial debut, Bennett Miller brings the story of author Truman Capote and the fascinating events that led to his greatest written work, ""In Cold Blood."" Capote stars Philip Seymour Hoffman as the flamboyant author, Catherine Keener as ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" author Harper Lee, and Clifton Collins, Jr. as the murderous killer Perry Smith.<br/><br/>Miller does an admirable job bringing this intriguing story to life but it's Hoffman that makes his mark as the multi layered man torn between worlds. Hoffman shows Truman's vulnerability but at top has his tenacity and wit that made him such a star. But underneath all of that, Hoffman does the greatest impersonation of him and captures all the antics and mannerisms. With previous accomplished works in Magnolia, Almost Famous and Flawless, Hoffman finally lives up to his title ""greatest working actor of his generation."" Catherine Keener in her quiet performance is just that, a quiet performance with powerful words behind a soft voice. She acts like the strong willed mother that reprimands you when you've been a bad boy. But I'm afraid the viewer doesn't find the richness of her performance that critics found in the past Oscar season. I prefer her in the much underrated performance in The 40 Year Old Virgin.<br/><br/>Speaking of underrated performances, Clifton Collins, Jr. gives the breakthrough performance of the year. His Perry Smith is smoldering, painful, and incredibly stunning in line delivery and poise. I couldn't imagine a more richer performance out of any other actor. After his introductory performances in Traffic and other subtle works, this shows the actor's range.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Dan Futterman is the crowning work of this achievement as his scripted dialogue never falls flat and his character study his remarkably on point. It is Miller that executes his work amazingly and finds his Director nomination at the Oscars well received and deserved.<br/><br/>Grade: ***½/****"

","""Capote"" is about six years of author Truman Capote's life during the time he wrote ""In Cold Blood"".<br/><br/>This film is the antithesis to bombastic, mind-numbing Hollywood dreck aimed at teen age boys. ""Capote"" is played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, who more than earned his Oscar for his portrayal. His portrayal reminded me of Dustin Hoffman's portrayal in ""Rain Man"" -- Phillip puts his whole mind and body into the role. A very difficult role, and very intelligently played. I was especially impressed with the acting towards the end of the film, where Truman says goodbye to Perry Smith.<br/><br/>The other actors are also terrific, and I especially liked Chris Cooper as the Kansas agent who brings the criminals to justice, but I'm sorry he wasn't seen more time on the screen.<br/><br/>The visuals are stunning -- wide open fields of Kansas, sun drenched Spain, and early 1960's New York City. I wonder how they got rid of buildings that were built since the early sixties. CGI, I suppose.<br/><br/>The music is understated, and sets the emotional tone of the film. Gentle piano and strings, it is poignant and underscores the tragedy of Truman and his relationships.<br/><br/>Truman Capote was a brilliant author, yet an alcoholic, so he was not above manipulating and lying to get what he wanted. My only negative critique of this film is that it left me wanting to know more -- what was Capote like before 1959, when he was already famous from writing ""Breakfast at Tiffany's""? What was he like after 1965? I remember reading he threw ""the party of the century"" sometime in the later 1960's.<br/><br/>""Capote"" is well worth the time, if you want to see something besides car chases and big explosions set to loud rock music and edited in three second shots."

","This film is about the research of Truman Capote on a murder case. He bonds with a murderer during the visits in prison.<br/><br/>The most striking feature about this film is the acting of Philip Seymour Hoffman. He completely transforms himself into a completely different person. His distinctively high speaking tone and a camp persona must have been the result of a lengthy and hard process of practice. The plot is somewhat predictable, a little slow in the beginning but picks up towards the end. The scene where Truman Capote has to tell Perry that he is in fact a friend with a motivation is memorable. Everything in this scene is excellent, from the acting, direction and lighting, they all fit the mood of the scene. The final scenes, which I will not describe, are particularly moving. despite the slow start, it is a moving and gripping film."
"z134424","9","1","1","21 June 2007"," The Cost of Genius
","One of the best movies of recent years, Capote features a towering performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman in the title role as writer Truman Capote. However, do not let Hoffman distract you from the other qualities of this film. A quiet, brooding drama, it is an almost-perfect example of technical style. The cinematography grabs you from the opening shots of the desolate wheat fields and lonely farmhouse in the rural Kansas setting, and the sparse score underscores this sense of desolate isolation and the quiet, introspective tone that these shots help to establish for the feature as a whole. The cast is magnificent. From the aforementioned Hoffman who captures every nuance of a flamboyantly gay, astronomically talented writer from the American South in the late 1950's; to Catherine Keener as the tough and steady Harper Lee; and Chris Cooper as the quietly dignified rural cop and Joe Blow as razor-sharp, artistically talented and cold-blooded killer half-Indian; every principal actor nails his or her respective job. And of course, Bennet Miller keeps it all together as director. All this talent combines to create a fascinating portrait of the price of creating a truly genius work of art. Truman Capote looks through the paper one day and sees the story of a family killed in rural Kansas and knows that this story is perfect for him to investigate and write completely. Along the way to investigating and it, he grows to personally respect one of the its main characters, even as his journalistic and artistic needs force him to cold-bloodedly manipulate and lie to him. These contradictory feelings make for great thought-provoking drama as they simultaneously allow Truman Capote to create the work of his life and tear him apart."
"Pedro_H","8","1","1","7 May 2007"," Slow, well made and absorbing portrait of a self-destructive genius
","A recreation of how, on a whim, celebrity author Truman Capote found true fame and fortune through his ""hands-on"" coverage of an ongoing multiple murder investigation: only to find events overtaking and - ultimately - almost destroying his life.<br/><br/>America has many interesting historical tales, but being a new country not as many as, say, England. For such reasons we should be grateful that this fantastic and important moment should be captured with such skill and realistic acting - including an absolutely knockout award winning performance by Philip Seymore Hoffman in the title role. Certainly worth the price of admission by itself.<br/><br/>What do you think of Truman Capote, if anything? An icon, a waster, a con man, one of the best American writers of all time, a social glad fly, a braggart, a substance abuser, an original thinker, a stool pigeon of the jet-set? I think all of the above and more, however his greatest skill was as a self-promoter of his own genius.<br/><br/>The movie clearly doesn't have a lot of money to spend and this reduces where the camera can wander or linger. However this, for once, helps. It is a close-up film, so much so much so that it is sometimes hard to breath.<br/><br/>Nor does the film want to dramatise the back-story of how Capote got semi-famous, a lot of the ""great moments"" are told in casual boastful reminiscing. His (homo)sexuality is both present and relevant, knowing how to manipulate a man it by patiently getting to know his weaknesses and aspirations. However limited they are in a death-row cell.<br/><br/>How ironic that his assistant - Harper Lee (a far too dull Catherine Keener) - should also have a brush with fame and fortune via her classic book: To Kill a Mocking Bird. Almost viewed here as an annoying interruption in to the central drama. The film doesn't take any view over whether Capote himself had any (secret) role in its creation. A rumour that circulates to this very day.<br/><br/>What is great about the movie is that we (mostly) know the story and the outcome (after all, it has been filmed not once but twice!) I certainly did and I am sure that all the professional reviewers did too, but it doesn't hurt the reviews one little bit. Indeed the decision not to present this as a thriller lets the tone remain even and slow. I liked this approach, although I am sure it is jarring to most watcher of modern cinema.<br/><br/>This film works best at showing the randomness and callousness of life. Where the worst possible scenario for one family becomes the making of another, at least on a temporary basis. Yes, one man's ending really is another's beginning.<br/><br/>The honest, hardworking, welcoming townsfolk of Kansas come off the best in terms of human values, but we are not entertained, intrigued or thrilled by basic honest human values. That is the central sin that we all have to bare and for sensitive types like Capote this home truth can suffocate.<br/><br/>Despite the title there should surely be a film about the full life of Capote - although I would be pushed to say who could play him. Maybe it would be a classic three actor job?"
"g0b0","9","1","1","4 May 2007"," Excellent Script Reveals Capote's Complexity
","This movie is a marriage of excellent writing and superb acting; what a treat for folks who love good cinema! I have always known that Truman Capote was a talented writer in spite of his eccentricities but DAN FUTTERMAN really nailed it. I realize that he collaborated on the script with the author of the original book, Gerald Clarke III. Kudos to both of them. Clarke for the original material and FUTTERMAN seems to be the primary author of the movie script and was the Executive Producer, along with the genius lead actor, PHILLIP SEYMOUR Hoffman.<br/><br/>I really got a sense of how powerful yet conflicted CAPOTE was. It was apparent how his own morality and ethical conflicts would, at times Impede his work. Excellent writing illustrates this point. PHILLIP SEYMOUR Hoffman's acting is so seamless that it was easy to forget that I was watching Hoffman playing a role. Rather, I felt that I was watching him 'channel' Capote, body, and soul. Hoffman was that convincing. <br/><br/>When I had this thought, it occurred to me, ""PHILLIP SEYMOUR Hoffman truly deserved the best actor Academy Award for this film; this is fantastic acting!"" Another point in Hoffman's favor is that his delivery was entirely consistent from start to finish. I have rarely seen that, even from Kenneth Branagh or Kevin Spacey. Staying 'in the moment' for an entire film requires up to 3 months of constant mental discipline for the actor; no small feat.<br/><br/>The directing may have been the weakest link. That is NOT to say that it was bad; just unremarkable in a positive or negative way. It was simply adequate. <br/><br/>I liked this film so much that I was disappointed when it ended. I wished that it could have covered more events in CAPOTE's life rather than a single (significant) one. I do hope that FUTTERMAN and Hoffman will team up again with another colorful story. This was a winning combination."

","Of course the Oscar for P.S. Hoffman was more than well deserved. If you had the chance watching this movie, before the academy awards were held, you kind of ""knew"" that he would get it. Why? Because the first time he speaks (and if you've seen him act or in an interview before) you realise that he had become Truman Capote, this wasn't P.S. Hoffman anymore! <br/><br/>And even if I didn't know much about Truman, I'm pretty sure this is as accurate as it could get to a depiction of this man. The struggle in him is displayed with such genius by Hoffman, that you can't imagine anybody else playing this role (although I've read that there is a comedy about Truman out, but I haven't watched that one yet).<br/><br/>But there are other fantastic actors on display here too, as you can see in the cast list. I'm only going to mention Clifton Collins Jr.. He could have a break-out in the next few years (a big one I mean), he would've deserved one. First movies I watched with him, he called himself Clifton Gonzalez Gonzalez (another stand out role, is his turn in One Eight Seven - 187).<br/><br/>This movie is ""quiet"" and long at places, so that is a let's say final warning for people who are not into this kind of movies! ;o)"

He makes this film completely worth watching while moving you to tears with his heart-wrenching performance. It does not surprise me,however, that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has failed to recognize Capote in the categories of best picture,director,and adapted screenplay in addition to the best actor Oscar. They have become amazingly incompetent over the past 6 years, and it saddens me when the best films of the year (in my opinion, at least) go home with one or even zero Oscars.Examples of this are:Capote(2005), Sideways(2004),Lost in Translation(2003),Adaptation(2002),In The Bedroom(2001).

","Going into this film, I knew the following, from clips of the film on TV, clips of the real Truman Capote on TV, reviews of the film, and, just, cultural osmosis: * PS Hoffman does a bang up job of imitating Truman Capote.<br/><br/>* Truman Capote was a charming wordsmith who could wrap people around his little finger and get whatever he wanted from them.<br/><br/>* Truman Capote wrote a ""non-fiction novel,"" ""In Cold Blood,"" about the murder of an innocent family in Kansas, and the killers of that family.<br/><br/>* Capote exploited others' tragedy to gain fame.<br/><br/>* ""In Cold Blood"" was hugely successful and its success catapulted Capote into superstar status. Success went to his head; he became an alcoholic and a self-parody, and never finished another book.<br/><br/>I mean ... just from cultural osmosis ... you know all that going in to this movie.<br/><br/>So, why bother seeing the movie? I can't think of any good reason. This movie didn't deliver more than what I got from seeing clips of it on awards shows, or reading reviews of it.<br/><br/>There is really nothing else there. You do get stewed in 1960s architecture and fashions. It's like you are in a time capsule. But that's not what art is supposed to do.<br/><br/>The film itself is meticulously crafted. There are scenes that look like Edward Hopper paintings, scenes that look like stills from Film Noir ... so what? There weren't any scenes that offered me any insights into the main characters that I didn't have before I saw the film. I got no new insights into Capote, or into fame, or into Capote's relationship with Harper Lee, or into Perry Smith, the killer the film focuses on. I learn more about the mind of a killer by watching a TV tabloid program like ""Dateline NBC."" So, all in all, this is a very pretty movie, and if you are into 1960s kitsch, you'll really want to see this.<br/><br/>But this is also a film that deals with the murder of four innocent people -- these murders are shown, on screen -- if you keep your eyes open, you will see a man with his throat cut, writhing as his neck spurts blood, as he dies -- it's a veritable Al Qaeda decapitation video -- and this is a film that features the capital punishment of two characters. Perry Smith is shown being hung by the neck until dead.<br/><br/>And this film's pretty 1960s nostalgia, and PS Hoffman's meticulously crafted imitation of Truman Capote, are not enough to honor the weight of the subject matter the film attempts to handle, but fails to present with any new insights.<br/><br/>After watching this entire film, I did not once cry, or even feel sad, not even for a moment, not for a single character, but I did experience admiration for whomever found all those 1960s cars and ashtrays.

","It seems that biopics are the new fad for the Oscars. Last year, four of the five nominees were biopics. This year, only two managed to make the cut. Good Night and Good Luck was a solid history lesson, so it set the tone that I expected from the other option, Capote. Seeing as, prior to this movie, I was unaware a man named Truman Capote even existed (and even less aware that Capote was pronounced 'ka-po-tee' and note 'ka-pote'), I was seeing this as a film, not for education or because I happened to love the book or anything like that. Even from that perspective, Capote is one hell of a powerful film in its final act.<br/><br/>For those who are as unfamiliar with the subject matter as I am, a little background is required. Truman Capote (Hoffman) is a best-selling author best known for Breakfast at Tiffany's. He is now writing articles for newspapers, currently researching a quadruple homicide in Kansas. With the help of childhood friend Harper Lee (Keener), he goes to the town and acquaints himself with police chief Alvin Dewey (Cooper) to find out everything he can. After consideration, he decides to make a new novel instead of simply an article as the killing fascinates him.<br/><br/>Once the killers are caught, Capote manages to secure interviews with them. He becomes intrigued by Perry Smith (Collins), an articulate and artistic soul who committed this apparently motiveless crime. In order to squeeze the whole story out of him, Capote buys himself more time by buying better lawyers for the killers. This leaves Capote with an internal struggle. He becomes attached to Smith, yet cannot complete his novel until the two are executed.<br/><br/>It is in this problem that the true villainy of Capote is shown. He is willing to see this man whom he has come to love on a deep level be executed for the simple purpose of finishing his work. Sure, he lies to himself constantly, but he is always putting himself first and essentially destroys himself with his egotistical obsession.<br/><br/>Had the movie been fictionalized, the role of Capote would have been difficult enough. However, since Capote was a very famous figure, the role would seem to be downright impossible to pull off. Lo and behold, Phillip Seymour Hoffman is absolutely stunning. From a dramatic perspective, he is incredible at showing the intense emotions that Capote feels in the end. After viewing a brief featurette, it is also obvious that he absolutely perfects the vocal patterns and mannerisms of Capote. He isn't Phillip Seymour Hoffman, he is truly Truman Capote, and it is one of the best performances I have ever witnessed.<br/><br/>Also worth mentioning in an outstanding supporting performance is Clifton Collins Jr. as Perry Smith. He is simultaneously chilling and sympathetic as the killer who had potential for much better. The scene where he finally describes the murders to Capote is among the most powerful I have seen recently, mostly thanks to Collins' unemotional narration. It is a shame that he was snubbed for a nomination that was given to William Hurt, who may have been great, but was not nearly as memorable. While on that topic, it is also a shame that Catherine Keener was nominated. While she was good, she was not given enough material to be nomination-worthy, and that nomination should have gone to Thandie Newton for Crash.<br/><br/>The main problem with the movie is that, for the first half anyways, it is quite dull. Sure, Hoffman is still great, but the movie just can't hold interest while Capote investigates the town. It does become more interesting once the killers are caught and Capote starts involving himself with Perry Smith, but it doesn't really kick into gear until Capote starts becoming anxious for the execution. This is more of a payoff movie, as it never really sinks in how good it is until the end.<br/><br/>As stated above, the payoff for the movie is near downright incredible. The last forty minutes of the movie are incredibly powerful and make this one an easy recommendation for those who can appreciate dramas. Extremely strong performances from Collins and especially Hoffman definitely make the movie much more than simply another biopic. Capote is not quite a must see like Brokeback Mountain or Crash, but it is certainly one that you shouldn't walk away from disappointed.<br/><br/>Overall Rating - 86%"
"lastliberal","10","1","1","30 April 2006"," A real insight into Capote
","It was a book that changed modern non-fiction. Truman Capote's non-fiction novel, In Cold Blood, made him a star. But the interesting thing is that he never finished another book. Did the conflicts he suffered in writing the book ruin him as a writer? This film paints an illuminating light into that question.<br/><br/>I found it hard to watch as his speech was difficult to understand, but I could see the pain as he explained, ""It's as if Perry and I grew up in the same house. And one day he went out the back door and I went out the front. "" As someone who grew up near Kansas and was barely a teen when Capote was writing this book, I would have never known him. But, I have to say that I feel I am closer to him than ever having watched Phillip Seymour Hoffman's performance in Capote. He was brilliant.<br/><br/>Of course, let's not forget that this was a Chris Cooper double feature. He played an excellent role here as the DA."

This slow-movement that I do not like usually, then is there to take you in. And then you are in the movie! The artificial modes of Capote then becomes the most natural thing ever. As if there is nothing on earth that this man cannot convince you to do. And the ""sorrow"" in Perry Smith's eyes. He seems somehow innocent.

Whether it will be held with history's truly great performances. I think it should be, and likely will.<br/><br/>Capote is a great film, well made from every aspect, with a strong supporting cast, tight script and engaging story, but it is all overshadowed by one of the best performances in a decade or more. PSH inhabits Capote, his cartoon-like voice, mannerisms, paranoia, ego, gestures. This is made all the more amazing by the fact that this movie is not a hero-worship picture - it tells a generally unflattering tale of a man who was willing to go to any extent to finish his book.<br/><br/>Capote tells the tale of the writing of In Cold Blood, the first ""non-fiction novel"", entertainment reading based on an entirely true story. Capote travels to the small southern town to write about the brutal murder of a family of four. How it affected the townspeople. He soon finds that he has a novel in the making. One that would make him the most famous writer in America, stop his prolific career and hasten his death.<br/><br/>By chance, Capote meets one of the accused killers, Perry Smith. A lonely and confused man, mistreated as a child but with many hidden gifts. Truman views him as a kindred spirit saying ""Its as if we grew up in the same house."" But the dilemma strikes - if the novel is to be completed, then Perry (whom Capote has at least inwardly fallen in love with) and his partner in crime must be put to death.<br/><br/>Although we know how this will end for both Smith and Capote, the journey is extraordinary as we watch the manipulation on both sides of the jail cell. In the background is Nell Harper (Cahterin Keener) Capote's friend gaining notoriety for To Kill A Mockingbird. (Capote says of the film at its premier ""I don't see what the fuss is all about."") She acts as the films moral centre, telling Capote the truth about himself, which he knows but does not want to hear.<br/><br/>PSH deserved an Oscar nomination two years back for Owning Mahowny and I implore anyone as gripped by his performance here as I was to seek that small film out.<br/><br/>Capote is a worthy best picture nominee on its own, made better by a lead acting performance for the ages. **** out of ****"

","CAPOTE has been discussed in great depth and there would be little that I might had. The film had been highly recommended to me by a film professor and I had thought to rent it on DVD. While in Wall Mart I came upon a double disc offering CAPOTE and Richard Brooks 1967 film IN COLD BLOOD for a combined price of just under $20.00. I couldn't resist and found that they make for an excellent double-bill. The day following my screening of CAPOTE I took a look at the earlier film (which I had originally seen during its theatrical run). The two films work perfectly together, each enriching the other. Though IN COLD BLOOD was made 38 years before CAPOTE, it has a style that fits seamlessly with the later film. Even the different actors playing Perry Smith and Dick Hickock work well. Only the writer played by Paul Stewart in the Brooks film, representing Capote only with a different name, comes up short. That weakness is more then taken care of with Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance in CAPOTE. If you were as fascinated by CAPOTE as I was, then you may want to take a look at IN COLD BLOOD."
"mmeltzer-1","Null","1","1","2 April 2006"," Capote is complex and revealing, and poignantly dissects a prominent literary personality.
","""Cappote"" completes a trilogy for me of 2005 movies with stunning narrative reveals. Joe Beuchas ""Family Stone"" strung out a mottle of thematic relations and dropped amusing hints and insightful clues like lemon drop candies before letting you walk into the big punch. The family stone is kind of sly. She is a rock with purpose that defines a high maternal consciousness which wives and mothers in pain are not unlikely to come to when faced with the pain of their own loved families, in telling them she is soon leaving this earth. <br/><br/>Ang Lee's ""Broke Back Mountain"" leads us to find, in the final analysis, a character's room back home where he grew up, of juvenile paucity. We re-look forward, skipping the superfluous details of Jack Twist's ""formative"" elements through to his adult passions. The emotional terrain is as profoundly simple and uncomplicated as the cinematic images which readily bear their breathtaking artistry. That artistry almost reminds how to breath when incorporating the sudden expansion of the narrative this last punch delivers. And Lee deliberately throws it.<br/><br/>""Capote."" My first film review ever was as a college freshman on ""Yellow Submarine."" ""Everything was as it should have been!"" I declared fully unaware that an acid experience best shared is one better considered on its particular merits. So. What exactly does Capote-like mean? Phillip Seymour Hoffman does much more than act like Truman Capote if my memory of his appearance on the Cavat, Griffin era of afternoon TV entertalkment shows serves. His performance is Dorean Grayesque in the way that he shapes his character through mannerisms which themselves seem to deflect the world as it assaults his effete sensitivities, yet cannot bat it away. One wonders if he drank to get rid of the DTs which a sudden awareness of ego tender unrelentingly unleashed as he reconciled a ""there but for the grace of God"" ethos with his own relentless, gallant pursuit of a monster no one in their right mind nor out of a glass full of liquor should care about. <br/><br/>I knew nothing of Truman Capote outside his writing In Cold Blood, and that he was odd, queer in the way that people appear when they strain to look through thick glasses. Looking too close is a strain. Yet we get to look close comfortably and see someone actually withering under the strain of what he finds. He looks so close it is all suddenly around and he cannot find a blanket, only a bottle. <br/><br/>All the movies are studies in character, but Capote washes over in ocean waves, grandiose and powerful, receding and serene. Its psycho-dynamics fly from his opening oratorios, through his paying off the warden for access to his subjects and his vulnerability over his companion's taking off, to the whisper of an unfinished epitaph fished out of a sea of words from pages of his leftover book floating with posterity in the wake of an alcoholic life. Thrown from the bow, perhaps in a final release. In that sense, ""Capote"" is an epic production. <br/><br/>In the sense that people are powerful forces of their own destruction, Capote shows us how demons might be summoned in the life experience of the creatively indulgent, and why we should know to heed the vulnerability of the spirit to the narcissistic excesses of notoriety. it is not that we may call out to loneliness, but that loneliness can call out to us, reminding us, as a vibration to a moth closing on an innocent looking candle flame, reminding us that we can be our own worst enemies."
"wnterstar","10","1","1","31 March 2006"," Stunning and riveting
","This movie should have won the Oscar for the best picture. It has everything a great movie needs: spectacular cinematography, a riveting script, phenomenal actors, and a chilling score.<br/><br/>It draws you into the plot slowly and lets you discover your way to the climax. I have never seen a movie where the silences are just as important as any of the words that are said. Capote does more with a 2 minute silence then most movies can do with 20 minutes of dialogue.<br/><br/>There are two standout performances in this movie, the first is Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Here is an actor who has been around Hollywood for fifteen years and I didn't really know his name until now. When I look at his list of credits, his roles always seem to be ones that people remember, even if they don't know his name. He is fantastic as Truman Capote, capturing the man to a ""T"". Somehow, he made me love Capote and hate him at the same time...not an easy feat! He doesn't minimize the arrogance and self-centeredness that Truman Capote was accused of. I was glad to see him get the recognition he deserves for this role.<br/><br/>The other standout performance is Clifton Collins, Jr. Collins is another actor who has been around forever, but in the background. As Perry Smith, one of the two men who killed a family in rural Kansas. His performance will let you see the man behind the murderer as sad, misunderstood and almost frail.<br/><br/>That is until we hear him talk about the murders. Then we see in his eyes the madness, the cruelty and the heartlessness that must have been present in the real Perry Smith.<br/><br/>This movie is a must see, not only for Truman Capote's fans, but for anyone who is fascinated by true crime dramas."

Smith ..many many others)..he was fantastic. Glad that he got his Oscar, and hopefully only true ACTORS will get them and not overrated/overpaid (20mil/movie???absurb). I watched the movie and truly enjoyed seeing Hoffman in his true natural habitat. He just,as stated before, became Capote and never once disappointed me. The movie itself, as with most modern bio's cover only a short period in the man's life...showing his demons and the period when the great book was written. Just go and watch Hoffman and you'll see a true artist at work...have fun."
"MovieAddict2016","9","1","1","30 March 2006"," A rare modern-day masterpiece that feels like a product of the '60s rather than the present day
","Capote is a great film  one that captures the cinematic aesthetic of 1950s and '60s cinema and does, indeed, come across as a product of the era. (In fact, presenting the movie in black and white rather than modern-day filtered color may have been a wiser choice.). From the opening, graceful shot of swaying cornfields to the punctuating closing frame, Capote is a magnificently crafted (if somewhat flawed) character study hiding behind the false façade of a standard Hollywood biopic (and it is so much more). The film's approach to chronicling its titular figure is pleasing and unusual  it doesn't chart his entire existence from birth to death; rather, it drops us square in the middle of a key event of his life that dramatically altered his own perception for years to come.<br/><br/>Directed by newcomer Bennett Miller, it is a promising and captivating character examination that takes place over a short six-year time period, beginning with the ruthless slaying of a family in Kansas in November 1959 and ending with the execution of the killers in April 1965.<br/><br/>Flamboyantly gay author Truman Capote becomes interested in the story and travels to Holcomb, Kansas with Harper Lee (Catherine Keener) to write an article about the tragedy. However, after meeting with the two young men who committed the crime, Capote feels compelled to extend the story into a ""nonfiction novel""  and he even begins to have possible romantic feelings for Perry Smith (Clifton Collins, Jr.), a soft-spoken and sensitive man whom Capote feels a deep spiritual link with. He claims at one point in the film, ""It's as if Perry and I grew up in the same house. And one day he went out the back door and I went out the front."" The movie does have a few problems, primarily its editing  which is sloppy, unnecessarily slow at times and yet at other points much too fast. The direction is not superb or showy, although I think Miller's conservative approach is in part to adapt to the style of cinema from a half-century ago. Furthermore, considering the fact that this is Miller's second movie, it is still very impressive and vastly superior to the direction of Paul Haggis' noisy, flashy ""Crash."" Hoffman, the P.T. Anderson regular who has come to be known amongst film buffs as one of the generation's finest character actors (he is for his generation what Steve Buscemi, Peter Lorre and Harry Dean Stanton were for theirs), buries himself inside Truman Capote. You simply forget you are watching the sleazy phone sex kingpin from ""Punch-Drunk Love""  he disappears inside his role. Every mannerism, every verbal pronunciation  it's all nailed perfectly. His Best Actor grab was well deserved rivaled only perhaps by Joaquin Phoenix's embodiment of Johnny Cash in Walk the Line.<br/><br/>Capote is a splendid character film, one that examines the manipulation and self-centeredness of its ""hero"" and isn't afraid to expose his lesser qualities. The film does not pander to its audience, nor does it cater to the standards of the Biopic. Its few flaws  such as its inability to present Harper Lee and other supporting characters as well-rounded people, or its lackluster editing  don't detract from the overall product, which is an incredibly tasteful and artistic examination of greed, betrayal, love and heartbreak. The movie is about Capote's experience writing In Cold Blood  rather than his entire life -- for a reason, and that reason is made vibrantly clear by the end of the film."

I presume that the film is named and centered around the flamboyant and brilliant writer and social gadabout because there was no more concise way to describe the way this news story phenomenon could be laid out.<br/><br/>Capote(deservedly award winning Philip Seymour Hoffman,who really is no surprise here,since he's had over a decade of palpably good film performances)is a unique portrayal here: he is never completely sympathetic(is he on the side of the shell-shocked townsfolk of Holcombe,KAnsas or is he merely exploiting their fear?Is he really sympathetic with Perry Smith or merely using him for the book? Is he really in need of peeling away at a social disconnect in American society or is he merely an opportunist?),but he is always compelling.

(I knew that Caapote had written Breakfast at Tiffanys; what I did not know was that In Cold Blood would not be followed up with an actual novel.)

Do not miss this extraordinary experience. No sooner had I left the theater than I sought out anything and everything I could lay my hands on about Capote--and of course reread ""In Cold Blood"" for the third time. I would very much like to know the validity of the implication in the movie postscript that Capote's literary stutterings after the publication of his blockbuster derived from his intense ambivalence about his ruthless dedication to his novel and his empathy for the killer Perry Smith."

But the real performance in this movie belongs to Clifton Collins, Jr. as Perry Smith. Mr. Collins's performance is what made the movie work for me. He was fantastic!! Too bad that he did not get a nomination for Best Supporting Actor, as he deserved it. They could have nominated him instead of Paul Giamatti or William Hurt. The scenes between Hoffman and Collins are very touching, and the scenes where Capote is seeing Smith for the final time are heartbreaking.

","I was skeptical about this movie - there was too much fuss made about it during the last weeks. And again I was wrong. Seymour Hoffmans acting is perfect, not one movement that would indicating that he is not a total eccentric gay. The pictures taken in Kansas need the whole screen and sink deep into ones perception - especially the view of the house in which the murder took place is a story on its own.<br/><br/>But the most intriguing thing about the movie is how the story is told. In the beginning it is all laughing and fun. Then something starts to develop, but nothing is said directly. Scene after scene leads further into doubt and every now and then the thought ""he cannot be that much a bastard"" flickers up. Capote, who seems not to have a doubt with what he is doing, is shown as a person that still can be understood - in a way. The movie is not a lecture about right and wrong. It is easy to criticize Capote, but it is much more interesting to admit, that his actions can be understood to a certain extend. It's an inconsistent feeling that one is left with after the movie and that is most valuable.<br/><br/>Nevertheless the writing at the end of the movie could have been skipped. It is the only thing that hints towards punishment and I doubt that things are that clear and easy to explain. But maybe that was needed to satisfy a certain audience. (9/10)"

","Of all the films I've seen from 2005, this is by far the best, and I really enjoyed ""Good Night, and Good Luck."" Philip Seymour Hoffmann gives the greatest performance of his career. Will Hoffmann ever get another role as good as this  and do it as well as this one? Capote, for those who may not know, never published another book after ""In Cold Blood"" and it's hard to imagine Hoffman will ever achieve this level of artistic success.<br/><br/>Hoffman plays Capote dead-on, even Hoffmann's voice mimics almost perfectly that of the author's. It felt like a documentary camera was following Capote while he researched his book.<br/><br/>Great acting by others as well:Katherine Keener, Chris Cooper; and Clifton Collins, Jr. as Perry Smith.<br/><br/>Very sparse soundtrack, except for some New York party scenes, and that aural emptiness works well with the loneliness depicted by this film and the story behind the story. Was Perry Smith Capote's soul mate?"
"pyrocitor","9","1","1","15 March 2006"," An astonishing lead performance, yes... but Capote boasts so much more...
","Speaking as a viewer who was unfamiliar with Truman Capote's work, or the man himself, I have to say that I was still floored by Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of the caustic-tongued, immensely talented though also seriously troubled author. The always talented Hoffman brings a particular energy and commitment into his portrayal of Truman Capote that shows why he easily stood above the crowd when picking up awards, most recently the best actor Oscar.<br/><br/>Yet don't go into Capote thinking that Hoffman's performance is the only reason to see it - while it's true that he is easily the best thing in the film, director Bennett Miller seems to most certainly know what he's doing, despite his lack of previous credentials. There is a surprising atmosphere created in Capote, an almost tangible sense of underlying threat and danger, despite the mostly passive exterior. The stark, nearly black and white photography also helps add to the mood, as well as better establishing the time period. Between costumes, sets and surroundings, the film lives and breathes the 1950s and 60s in a most impressive manner - never once does it seem replicated or staged, the movie seems to be ripped right out of the time. <br/><br/>Miller and screenwriter Dan Futterman also show the sense to focus on a certain period of Capote's life, his time writing a nonfictional novel depicting the murder of a Kansas family, titled ""In Cold Blood"". While researching the killing and interviewing the killers, Capote begins to develop a peculiar relationship with Perry Smith, (Clifton Collins Jr.) one of the killers. Futterman proves himself to also be an excellent writer, as Capote boasts a particularly solid script as well as a superb lead performance and capable directing. <br/><br/>Hoffman's incredible lead performance is also backed by very strong performances from the film's stellar supporting cast, the standout being Clifton Collins Jr. as the killer Capote develops a strange interest in. Collins is similarly astonishing, almost paralleling Hoffman in strength and believability of performance, and it is quite a shock and shame he was not nominated for an Academy award himself. Catherine Keener also gives a great performance as Nelle Harper Lee, Capote's childhood friend and fellow author, who shares in his exploits while researching and writing his novel. Chris Cooper also makes the most of his relatively small role as the town sheriff who arrested the two killers, who genuinely believes in the morality of his job. I had never been a fan of Cooper's in the past, but having seen a few of his movies lately, it becomes clear to me that his talent is indisputable, and I now quite enjoy his performances. (ironically enough, I used to say the same thing about Philip Seymour Hoffman once upon a time...) Bruce Greenwood is also a strong though quiet presence as Jack Dunphy, Capote's partner, companion and fellow novelist, who often feels ignored and overshadowed by Capote's devotion to both his work and Perry Smith. In fact, performances are quite impressive right across the page, Hoffman of course being the highlight, though very capably backed. <br/><br/>So all in all, Capote is quite the quality piece, and is worth seeing, although the main draw being to see Philip Seymour Hoffman's Academy Award winning performance, which, rest assured, lives up to the hype. Yet don't go off thinking Hoffman's lead performance is the only reason to see this movie - rather to see an excellent example of a strong film from all angles - excellent screen writing, strong, capable directing, wonderful cinematography and powerhouse acting from the entire cast throughout. All in all, it's hard to find a weak link in Capote really - quite worth the watch!<br/><br/>-9/10"
"agmoldham","6","1","1","12 March 2006"," Powerful Performance
","I have long been an admirer of Philip Seymour Hoffman from his roles in Magnolia and Boogie Nights amongst others. This film really belongs to him and he was a worthy recipient of the gong for best actor. This is very much a film for people who like to see a strong acting performance rather than a blockbuster film with lots of special effects.<br/><br/>The film chronicle's the writing of the author Truman Capote's most popular book ""In Cold Blood"". The film shows Capote's research with the people involved in a mass murder and with the murderer's in particular. The film is very understated and I suspect people will apply their own values to the film and take away quite different things. As for myself I believe the film to show the early development of the media's exploitation of people, but as I said I'm sure other people may pick up quite different interpretations. Personally I preferred the films I mentioned earlier to Capote, but I still believe it's quite an interesting piece and well worth checking out - unless of course you're into bubblegum movies."

","Having just watched Capote, I think I can safely say that Hoffman has produced, in his portrayal of troubled and manipulative writer Truman Capote, the best performance of the decade, deservedly winning the Oscar. The film shows the way in which Capote, while in the process of writing his undisputed masterpiece In Cold Blood, lied and deceived his way into the trust of those closest to, and perpetrating, the Clutter killings. <br/><br/>Hoffman constructs a brooding, complex, insecure and lonely figure with Capote, as we slowly are privy to the writer becoming the lies he has peddled. By the film's end, the audience is left unsure as to who the real Capote is; the extroverted entertainer who's the toast of glitzy parties, the lonely alcoholic jealous of the success of his friends or the cold and distant analyst of the two Clutter killers.<br/><br/>Worth seeing just for Hoffman's virtuoso performance, but much more than that. A classic in the waiting and highly recommended."
"jon.h.ochiai","10","1","1","4 March 2006"," Capote Down Cold
","Truman Capote revolutionized modern American literature with his non-fiction novel ""In Cold Blood."" ""In Cold Blood"" told the story of the heinous murder of the Cutter family in Halcomb, Kansas. The book and its author seem to be a paradox as depicted in Director Bennett Miller's ""Capote"" which follows the writing of ""In Cold Blood"". ""In Cold Blood"" would be Capote's last completed novel before his death years later. Capote was defined by his powerful words which at times seem incongruous with the witty, flamboyant, alcoholic, openly gay author. As stunningly portrayed by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Capote is a peculiar talented man with great vision, and completely selfish. Dan Futterman's screenplay based on the book by Gerald Clarke is captivating and compelling as a character study of a tragic crime and tragic author.<br/><br/>In 1959 Capote (Hoffman) tells ""The New Yorker"" editor that he wants to go to Kansas to research the brutal murder of the Cutter family. He travels to Kansas with his partner Nelle Lee Harper (amazing Catherine Keener), author of the soon to be published ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" Nelle is Truman's ""pass"" into the conventional world of the Midwest to conduct his research of the murders. Truman and Nelle befriend police chief Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper) during their stay in Kansas. Eventually the murderers are apprehendedPerry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.) and Richard Hickok (Mark Pellegrino). Truman is strangely attracted to Perry, who is apparently intelligent and artistic. Truman sees him as a spiritual brother, burdened by a similarly painful past. Smith and Hickok are convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death by hanging. In the meantime, Truman rejoins his lover Jack (strong Bruce Greenwood) in Spain to begin the arduous process of writing ""In Cold Blood"". However, Truman desperately needs a completed Third Acta confession from Perry. Also the longer Perry and Hickok remain alive, the further the book release delays. Hoffman is compelling in drawing our compassion for Capote as this sad man who is alien anywhere outside of New York City, deceiving himself of his own self interests. In a great scene near the end when Truman cries that he tried everything to save Perry, Nelle (Keener) reminds him, ""But the truth is; you didn't want to.""<br/><br/>""Capote"" is defined by its compelling performances. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is awesome as Capote. He will probably win an Oscar for his performance. Hoffman nails the Capote voice, and is completely authentic in his portrayal. His is not mimicry. He balances tragic and pathetic. Hoffman inhabits Capote as the lone outsider, who is only powerful when he is writing or creating worlds in his mind. Hoffman also charms as Truman with a biting sense of humor. Truman boasts that he has 94% retention of conversations and he knows this ""because I tested myself."" Catherine Keener is amazing as Nelle Harper. She commands a natural intelligence, strength, and compassion. Jack tells Truman that Nelle is ""even more man than"" he is. She and Hoffman have great chemistry. As Nelle she provides a touching relationship for Truman which humanizes him, and punctuates Truman's isolation. The touching exchange between the two when she leaves Spain is subtle and heart felt. Director Miller's ""Capote"" captures Truman Capote at the peak of his talent and prowess, before his gradual and tragic decline with drugs and alcohol. What stays with you is that Capote was a gifted writer who was most alive and powerful through his words, but his own voice reflected a sad man, who people never really truly got."
"PhillieTurk","Null","1","1","27 February 2006"," Excellent Exploration of the Similarities Between Seemingly Different People
","Besides the fact that Perry's diary entry for ""if called upon to make a speech"" for an achievement is almost identical to Marlon Brando's Oscar acceptance speech (Perry's speech from his diary as found in Capote's notes: ""I can't remember what I was going to say for the life of me. I don't think ever before have so many people been so directly responsible for my being so very, very glad. It's a wonderful moment and a rare one. Thank you!""), and the reasoning that Perry could be trying to identify with celebrities and people of stance in those times, I think it is intriguing that Capote's notes written right before Perry's ""achievement"" dialogue are as follows: ""If Called Upon to Make a Speech  This is exactly what I was talking about  a speech just in case he's ever recognized for an achievement"". <br/><br/>This is exactly what Capote just repeated to Harper Lee. I don't think he would have written it as ""This is exactly what I was talking about"" if they were simply notes to himself. He had written the notes just as he would have said them to Harper, and in a way he was preparing himself for this ""speech"" over the phone, much like Perry was preparing for his own ""achievement speech"". I noted a stark similarity between the psyche of both Perry and Truman and how they often feel the need to stand out as being flawless amongst people due to their own personal anxiety and loneliness. <br/><br/>Either that or it was simply a tool used by the crew to help Philip Seymour Hoffman remember his lines.<br/><br/>P.S. I found this out by freeze-framing  Bennett Miller sent me a personal copy, and if you believe that I tell you another. P.S.S. Capote should win as many Oscars as it was nominated for."

","Some claim that pianists are human. And cite the case of Mr Truman<br/><br/>Ogden Nash, ""Carnival of the Animals""<br/><br/>Truman Capote was not named after the piano-playing former US president, but you have to acknowledge he was human. Unfortunately, his humanity got in the way of his ambition and ego, a clash which eventually destroyed him as an artist and as a person. At least, that is the story told here, but given his propensity for the bottle he may well have finished up an alcoholic wreck even if he had never met the killers Perry Smith and Richard Hickock and not written ""In Cold Blood"", which is one of the finest accounts of a crime and its aftermath in the English language. <br/><br/>The remarkable feature of Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance as Capote (the Oscar is a certainty) is the way it projects the inner conflict between Capote's near-love for Perry and the need to get the work done, even if that means Perry getting strung up. Hoffman makes it clear that Capote, having decided the work was more important than the relationship, then, because he was human, could not live with the consequences. The bottle beckoned, and that was it. It is also made clear in the live reading of part of the book before a New York audience that a truly brilliant work resulted. <br/><br/>Dan Futterman's script, though loaded with Capote's own words, leaves enough room for Hoffman to use non-verbal ways of expressing his character's emotions. Capote was also a born liar, and like all good liars was great at sincerity. Hoffman carries this off beautifully. Sometimes you wonder whether Capote was a fantasist who believed his own lies but on reflection it seems more likely he was a ruthless realist, lying without compunction if it suited his purpose. Sadly, he could not live with the result. A moral tale indeed."

","SPOILERS THROUGH:<br/><br/>If ever there was a movie that defines the term ""character study"" it would be ""Capote."" The film is a near masterpiece and that's quite strongly due to Phillip Seymour Hoffman. I've been a fan of his for years and have never seen a film he was in where he wasn't extraordinary. And Capote maybe his best performance yet. <br/><br/>I did not know a lot about this story before I saw the film. My main draw in seeing it was the incredible reviews and the presence of Hoffman in the title role. I went into the theater mildly curious and came out overwhelmed by the performances, not just from Hoffman But Catherine Keener and Clifton Collins Junior(who should have been nominated for best supporting actor.) Capote isn't overrated, it's a highly underrated film. I really don't know a lot of people who have seen it.<br/><br/>Capote does have a kind of slow buildup and takes awhile to get going but when it does it's gripping. It's the kind of film it's difficult to say you ""have fun watching"" but it sure is a film you respect the heck out of while your watching it. I definitely see why it's up for an Oscar and though it is not my favorite film of the year, it's certainly one of the most riveting.<br/><br/>Phillip Seymour Hoffman becomes Capote so much so, that you forget who he is and the relationship between Capote and Perry is full of complexities, incredibly developed on screen and utterly fascinating. And I must really mention Clifton Collins Junior again who's portrayal of Perry should have landed him a best supporting actor nomination. <br/><br/>What this film does so skillfully and so well, is lure the audience in. The beginning is slow and features a large amount of short quick scenes of parties and dinners. I will admit my attention wandered. The tension doesn't build like a typical film because it's tough to know how much one is getting into the film until their already deeply involved. It becomes less a film one is watching and more just a look into one person's inner being. Capote's a strange and uncomfortable film, brutal at times, shocking many times and one that also at times, leaves a bad taste in your mouth because of the unrelenting and gritty structure but it's always brilliantly acted, and an excellent character study."

All the reviewers miss this deep meaning, but I can tell you the deep dark secret, never mentioned, but inescapable is--- THERE BUT FOR THE GRACE OF GOD GO I.<br/><br/>Capote identifies with the killers, especially Perry, who is also from the south, also abandoned by his mother and ultimately raised in an orphanage, where we presume he had the usual care, abuse and neglect. Capote had a similar abandoning mother (""we were both abandoned by our mothers""), but at least had the saving grace of being raised by a relative, an aunt. Probably his childhood had a modicum of love and security, but just the bare minimum, as Capote can identify with 'cold blood.' He also identified with Perry's creativity, as he was literate and artistic. After hearing Perry's childhood story, he said, ""we were raised in the same house, and one day you went out the back door and I went out the front."" This was the most telling moment in understanding their connection.<br/><br/>In a way, Capote was as cold-blooded as Perry, using him to write the story that would make him famous and earn him a goldmine. He was shown to have two faces, the sympathetic one toward Perry, gaining his trust and finally getting the details of the killing to end his book, and the other, the egomaniacal entertainer at Manhattan parties. He went from eccentric to an out of control alcoholic, but he was always discreet, never getting falling down drunk, but always sipping a drink. His writer friends were concerned for him but there was nothing they could do, nothing anyone could do.<br/><br/>The closing credits said he died in 1984 from the complications of alcoholism, but Ebert wrote that he died of an overdose. I figure he ultimately could not live with himself or his memories, knowing that just under the surface, he was a cold blooded murderer too.<br/><br/>And such is the human condition, that some emerge from a traumatic childhood and become an overt monster, and some emerge from a traumatic childhood, an eccentric celebrity, fiendishly brilliant, and a covert monster.<br/><br/>Audiences will be drawn to this by the millions and will be affected by viewing this, because all of us have a dark side. We can identify and there but for the grace of God go I!"

","The Great Phillip Seymour Hoffman is, in my personal opinion, one of the best actors the industry has ever seen. I admire him so much that I recall little moments of some of his movies sometimes, and I start to laugh. I've got his image stuck on me, but not because of the actor in person, but because of the characters he creates and the impression they leave in me.<br/><br/>Daddy's boy in ""Scent of a woman"", the unpleasant doctor in ""Patch Adams"" (the first time he actually impressed me), the singular Freddie in ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"", the crazy music man in ""Almost Famous"", the drifted widower in ""Love Liza"", the noisy journalist in ""Red Dragon"", the good friend in ""25th Hour"", the incredibly funny Sandy in ""Along Came Polly"", the angry boss in ""Punch-Drunk Love""; not to forget Dan Mahowny in ""Owning Mahowny""Now Truman Capote.<br/><br/>He is going to win the Academy Award on March 5th, and it will be well earned. A performance is more recognized when it portrays something out of the ordinary than something common; therefore a character like the controversial Capote attracts attention. The change the actor goes through is remarkable, but sometimes there's more than a physical change. I'm not in the mood of giving examples, but Hoffman's is a complete transformation; and that's what actually counts.<br/><br/>You see it in the way he puts the cigarette in his mouth, the way he grabs the phone, or he walks and places his body parts; not to mention his voice and way of speaking: it's disturbing. You find more about the character as the years pass by. He has only one trusted friend who's been with him all along: Nelle Harper Lee (a flawless delivery by the always good Catherine Keener); they understand themselves perfectly.. ""I don't lie"", he tells her. But he does; he is a journalist. By the time the movie enters his life, he was a celebrity, and it is funny to see him the way he is, around his fellow journalists, telling jokes, being the attraction. There's a tremendous respect for him.<br/><br/>""In Cold Blood"" was the name of his unfinished book that told the story of a family murdered by Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr., don't forget about him) and Dick Hickock (Mark Pellegrino). ""It's the non-fiction book of the decade"", Capote declared. What did ""non-fiction"" mean? The writer was creating a genre in the world of novels. ""This will change the way of writing"", William Shawn (Bob Balaban) told him. The film goes through the five years it took Capote to write the book. The facts are detailed; the screenplay by Dan Futterman is accurate and true to the main characterI mean, it's five years within an hour and a half.<br/><br/>Capote became close with Perry Smith while working, the movie tells; his couple Jack (underused Bruce Greenwood) spent time alone in Spain by himself while the writer traveled to Kansas almost unconsciously, to the point of waking up in trains in a way you could tell he didn't know where he was. Even though there were emotions running through, the man knew his priority. He got into the private files of Detective Alvin Dewey (genius Chris Cooper) because of the trust the detective's wife had on him. This could have brought him consequences, in fact, everything could.<br/><br/>One way or the other, every story finishes ""Capote"" goes for the black screen in every situation. It is too confident on its material, because it should be. Its director, Bennet Miller, presents his baby (alongside him, Hoffman and Futterman made it come true). Here is a man who understands and, even better, appreciates silences. He witnesses the landscapes with the camera, he focuses his characters with still shots, no music; he lets them talk. Sometimes he observes what's around; but then, when there's something we better not listen to, the music playsAnd now it talks.<br/><br/>It's a relief when once in a while you see a film and you know the people involved in it wanted to do it. Phillip Seymour Hoffman got the role of his career, or he said so at the SAG Awards; but that doesn't me it is the best role he's ever playedHe knows that, but in ""Capote"", there's not one frame without his presence; it's a showcase of the man's talent: he's grateful for itI am personally grateful for it.<br/><br/>With the last lines, the movie leaves written an epigraph. Think about it, and try to be in Capote's place. He wanted it to happen; he couldn't cope with it."
"The_Void","7","1","1","16 February 2006"," A haunting and none too obvious true story with an outstanding performance from its lead actor
","To put it lightly, the nominations for the 2005 'Best Picture' Oscar are very weak indeed. The Academy has decided to go with politics rather than films with merit, and as a result we just have a list of films that handle current events - and if you ask me, it's a bit of a joke. Capote was the last Best Picture nominee that I saw and I set my hopes pretty low after the other four fell massively short of expectations. I am surprised, therefore, to report that Capote is actually a damn good film - and although it's not the best of the year, it definitely deserves to have that statuette to it's name come March 5th. The film is still somewhat politically orientated, as it handles themes of violence; but these are wrapped up in the involving story of Truman Capote and the events that lead to him writing his masterpiece, In Cold Blood. We follow him as he researches the brutal murder of a Kansas family. The story really lifts off when he comes into contact with Perry Smith; a death row inmate, and one of the murderers. We follow the writer as he develops a friendship with this man, in order to write his book. But the relationship may have grown beyond professional reasons only.<br/><br/>The main stand-out thing about this film is most definitely the lead performance. For years now, Philip Seymour Hoffman has been one of the most talented, yet underrated actors around; and with his portrayal of the famous novelist here - he's finally getting the roles that allow him to reach his full potential. Hoffman holds the screen with a performance that is as intricate as it is absurd, and any success that this film gets is owed more than in part to this great performer. The story itself is intriguing, and the way that the writer builds a friendship with the murderer is both haunting and absurdly touching. This film shows that no matter what men do, there is always a deeper and more complex side that is often ignored. The tone of the film is downbeat and saddening, and inexperienced director Bennett Miller does an excellent job at ensuring the film always feels right. Capote himself isn't too well known outside of literature fans; so this film can be thanked for bringing a true story that is none too obvious to the big screen. As mentioned, this isn't the best film of the year; but it's easily the best on the list of nominees, and while its chances don't look too rosy; it will be a huge shame if it doesn't win the award."
"ikanboy","8","1","1","11 February 2006"," Hoffman is brilliant!
","I came to this movie with only one intent: to watch Seymour Hoffman's performance. Truman Capote, the man, does not appeal to me. I found him to be a vainglorious, self aggrandizing prig! Would Hoffman's portrayal, which I knew from previews to be uncannily accurate about Capote's famously fey mannerisms, go into character, or stay in caricature? Could Hoffman escape his stolid, teutonic, appearance and become a mincing, literary mountebank? The plot goes as follows: Capote reads an article in the New York Times about a Kansas farming family of four found brutally murdered in their isolated farmhouse. Intrigued, for reasons unexplained, he gets the New Yorker magazine to send him to Kansas in search of an article. He is accompanied by Harper Lee, the author of the, yet to be acclaimed, novel ""To kill a Mockingbird,"" who acts as his point man. Capote knows full well how middle America is going to react to an eastern ""fairy,"" and he has Lee soften up the people he needs to interview. Once inside he takes over, winning people with his gift of story telling  mostly quite revealing stories about himself  and inveigles them to reveal details about the crimes.<br/><br/>His aggressive, and insertive, tactics are no different than any other of the paparazzi, but he does it with such panache and, due to his fame as an author, he gets away with it. He steals into the funeral home to take a morbid peek at the dead bodies  bizarrely cocooned by cotton face masks, to hide the shotgun damage  he bribes a Sheriff's office manager with books so he can have access to one of the murderers, who is imprisoned in a cell in an ante room. Expecting a monster, he finds instead a literate, soft spoken, artistic, half breed, who asks him politely for aspirin to ease the pain in his legs.<br/><br/>**SPOILER*** Hooked, he decides to abandon the article, and go for a book, the first non fiction novel. Aware that, if the men are executed, time will run out on his project, he hires a lawyer to mount an appeal, and manages to keep them alive long enough to milk the story. Using self revealing stories he gets Perry Smith, the articulate one, to open up about everything except the one thing Capote needs to finish his story: the description of the murders! We are so taken in by these conversations that we forget that it is between a writer, whose main aim is a story, and a sociopath, whose main aim is to stay alive. Both men are consummate con artists, so subtle in their skills that they only reveal enough to keep the game cloaked and ongoing. Perry Smith keeps mum about the murders, while Capote lies about his book's progress. Perry demonizes his partner, and Capote dutifully plays along, spending all of his time with Perry. Perry wants to know the title of the book, Capote lies and says he hasn't come up with one, knowing full well that: ""In cold blood"" will show his hand.<br/><br/>P.S. Hoffman's portrayal of Capote is an incredible melange of great impersonation and great acting! He is, in my opinion, a shoe in for the Oscar. While I was moved by Ledger's haunting work in Brokeback, I was awestruck by Hoffman. He wasn't just required to impersonate the pompous little gnome, he was required to make us wonder which Capote was the real Capote, or whether Capote changed personas with the context required of him! Does he care about Perry, or is he simply using him. When he cries on the eve of their execution, is he crying for them, or for himself? Then we add the interplay between him and Perry, and we have two actors playing actors. Both keep their true selves hidden in an intricate game of mutual manipulation. It is only in their final conversation that Perry confesses to the murders in a brief and brutal fashion, so brief that it never really shocks us out of the delusion that he, as his sister so tellingly says: ""would as soon kill you as shake your hand."" We never see a warm side of Capote, and from his retelling of his childhood, as a frequently abandoned, terrified child, we are left to wonder about how his persona is hidden away under the layers of melodrama. As Capote states to Harper Lee, when she asks him if he has fallen in love with Smith: ""I feel we grew up together, and he left out of the back door and I left out of the front door."""
"dbuffalo","6","1","1","10 February 2006"," Hoffman makes the film worth seeing, even if the screenplay drags a little...
","Before I review this film, I have to say that I might have a unique perspective (or bias) on the subject of this film. Though I have never read ""In Cold Blood"", I have seen the movie and read portions of manuscripts by Capote relating to his research of the subject matter. I have also seen him interviewed at length during the latter portions of his life by numerous journalists and television hosts. Many people who see this film probably never saw Capote in life nor really knew anything about him other than what they might have learned in secondary school or college.<br/><br/>From this writer's perspective, Truman Capote was probably one of the most tortured and yet simultaneously brilliant writers who lived in the 20th century. His public and social arrogance was a shield for his insecurity and confusion (emotional, sexual, and otherwise) created by his pretty tough early upbringing in the South. Unlike many of the relatively cartoonish cinematic portrayal of historic figures we have seen in recent years, I believe that Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote is every bit as good a portrayal of a historic figure that I have seen in quite a few years, given the limitations of the script with which he is presented. <br/><br/>I think the film, Capote, as directed by Bennett Miller, is best described as a vignette-style docudrama. It is designed to capture the intense intellectual probing, unscrupulous but effective manipulation of the criminals depicted in ""In Cold Blood"", and the ultimate inability of Mr. Capote to exculpate himself from the very manipulation of these convicts (particularly the Perry Smith character played by Clifton Collins) that he transforms into personal success through his ultimately best-selling novel. I believe Mr. Hoffman captured the essence of Capote's self-absorption both with his work and with his ego about as well as anyone is capable of doing. It is certainly an Oscar-worthy performance, whether he wins or not.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the film, unless one is truly interested in the characterizations of Capote, ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" author Harper Lee (Cathleen Keener) and partner Jack Dunphy (played by Bruce Greenwood), the film might drag for some not interested in the workings of the main character in this film. Chris Cooper (who has been busy this year in things like Syriana) is quite competent as KBI investigator Alvin Dewey. The rest of the cast certainly fit the historical period and the mood of the film. I tend to fall into the camp that believes Dan Futterman's screenplay does drag in the less intense sequences, but in the most important interactions between Capote, his close associates, and the convicts, this screenplay works very well.<br/><br/>Having seen this film, I now want to read both ""In Cold Blood"" and Gerald Clark's biography. If one understands that this film is not a doctrinaire commercial historical drama and that the film is designed specifically to highlight the perspectives, actions, and emotions of Truman Capote, then one should see this film. It is not a masterpiece by any means, but its lead actor is quite masterful in the lead role. I will give this film a 6 (which is quite generous for me)."
"rkt-1","10","1","1","8 February 2006"," ""CAPOTE"" holds its own.
","From the acting and directing, to the writing and music, CAPOTE grabbed me in a way few films have. Set around the brutal 1959 killings of the Clutter family of Kansas, the film follows the eclectic author Truman Capote (Philip Seymour Hoffman) as he researches and writes his best-selling masterpiece ""In Cold Blood."" The gem here is Hoffman. He completely becomes Truman Capote, from the way he speaks and walks, right down to the way he smokes his cigarette. Towering above his costars, Hoffman shows the audience a human side of the famous raconteur that few knew about. His scenes with the brilliant Catherine Keener (Harper Lee) are electric, as well as the relationship we see develop before our eyes between Capote and Perry Smith. The finest bit of support comes from Clifton Collins, Jr. As convicted killer Perry Smith, Collins brings the audience into his world of intrigue and sadness, only to rip our hearts out during his confession. The confession scene (between Capote and Smith)shook my emotions and mind to the bone, forcing me to tears. Finally, I have to comment on the duo of Bennett Miller and Dan Futterman. Two relative unknowns, Miller (director) and Futterman (writer), capture the essence of the mind of Truman Capote, and they allow the audience to feel his sorrow and guilt. Miller's pacing and camera work is unbelievable, while Futterman's words let the characters grow in numerous directions. This film is destined for greatness. From the cast to the crew, CAPOTE captures everything I was expecting from the hype. Its five Oscar nominations are definitely worth it (they should have had more!!). This film proves that new talent and a small budget can reap great rewards as well as reach artistic perfection."
"bandw","10","1","1","7 February 2006"," Philip Seymour Hoffman brings Capote back to life
","When I first saw Truman Capote on one of the late night TV talk shows my reaction to him was, ""Who is this funny, sad, charming, off-putting, self-centered, peculiar little man?"" I wondered if he was putting on an act or whether he was for real. Anyone who sees this film understands that he was very much for real. Hoffman, in a stunning performance, captures the essence of Capote. Is it the case that Hoffman may be the best actor to come along since Brando? <br/><br/>Capote needed to be the center of attention, he needed to be admired, he needed love. His needs were as great as his ego and such a person is usually vulnerable and winds up being unhappy. This was true for Truman. This movie shows Capote at his peak and then shows him on the precipice of his downhill slide. We are led to believe that Capote's experiences in writing ""In Cold Blood,"" his account of the murders of a family of four on a rural Kansas farm, not only raised him to the pinnacle of success as a writer but also contained the seeds of his destruction. The relationship that developed between Capote and Perry Smith, one of the killers, is ambiguous. Capote was a master manipulator and the little pas de deux he does with Smith is fascinating, since Smith himself is not above manipulating Capote. Of course Capote wins that contest, but it is implied that the emotional toll it took on him was significant. He was conflicted by wanting Smith and his accomplice to be hanged, so he could have a final chapter in his book, and by having established a bond with Smith. Journalists have to distance themselves from their subjects because they have to move on and cannot sustain emotional involvements; ""Capote"" examines what happens when that rule is disregarded. There are parallels between Capote's career and that of Joeph Mitchell, another writer for the New Yorker (of distinctly different personality), who became close to one of his subjects, one Joe Gould. After achieving success with his articles on Gould, Mitchell never published again. Mitchell's story is detailed in the movie, ""Joe Gould's Secret."" Apparently if a journalist flies too close to the flame he stands to get seriously burned. In the beginning of Capote's last major work ""Unanswered Prayers"" (fragments published six years after his death) is ""More tears are shed over answered prayers than unanswered ones,"" so he was not without introspection.<br/><br/>The relationship that Capote had with Harper Lee, as depicted in this movie, gives insight into both of their characters. Lee had a deep understanding of Capote and his self-centered nature, but the relationship meant enough to her to maintain it. There are some good scenes between them. Lee recognized that your typical small town Kansan was probably going to have some trouble dealing with someone as unusual as Capote and she runs interference for him on occasion by dealing with people that Truman would not have been able to get to first base with. One has to wonder if ""In Cold Blood"" could ever have been written without Lee's accompanying Capote to Kansas. Her presence in the movie is certainly an added attraction. She could be brutally honest with Capote on occasion, but, as with most everyone, he seemed rather oblivious to what she said or did.<br/><br/>In one scene Capote is shown reading selections from ""In Cold Blood"" to a large New York audience. He revels in the applause after the reading - you can sense him purring like a cat. This is an important scene in that it shows what a beautiful writer Capote was and why he was justly famous for his writing. This scene is so wonderfully filmed, from being backstage before Capote's entrance to the rousing standing ovation at the end, it is transfixing.<br/><br/>With the exception of Bob Balaban, who gives a rather uninspired performance as Wallace Shawn, the editor of the New Yorker, the supporting cast is excellent. Chris Cooper turns in another fine performance.<br/><br/>The score is suitably subdued and not without merit.<br/><br/>This film is an altogether impressive work."
"itislynda","10","1","1","6 November 2005"," Fabulous, nuanced movie
","In ""Capote,"" by a combination of name dropping, charm, sensitivity, empathy, as well as ruthlessness, we see Truman Capote delicately gather information for his book, ""In Cold Blood."" We witness the complexity of his character who celebrates Harper Lee's publication of ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" and, a little later, sniff at its movie's debut that he ""didn't see what all the fuss was about."" ""In Cold Blood"" describes the Clutter murders, the execution of the killers, and Capote's manipulation of everyone for the good of his book. ""Capote"" implicitly questions whether Capote was justified in his deadly (perhaps literally, in his deliberate failure to obtain a better lawyer for Perry) deception and callousness, in the face of the creation of a book whose influence is still strong today, a tradition carried on by Anne Rule and others. We are shocked at Perry's sister's warning to Capote about her brother's capacity for violence, in the face of his apparent self-awareness, regret, and perhaps guilt, yet ultimately witness the aptness of her assessment. ""Capote"" does not give easy answers about the nature of evil, deception, envy, charm, or talent."

","I don't really know much about Truman Capote, he isn't well known where I hail from, I'm familiar with breakfast at tiffany's, but never heard of in cold blood, but I like Hoffman.<br/><br/>So off to see the film, and what a great choice, everything is extremely well done, the set design, clothes, the soundtrack, but of course Philip's performance for me was emotional, by the end it was tearful, Truman may have changed writing with his book, I don't know, but I do know that this film has changed my life. I refrain from saying 'in a small way', because I feel that would, for me, undermine the feeling I took away from this.<br/><br/>Thank you Philip."
"Eli-Tuco","1","5","12","4 August 2013"," It's all about me, me, me.
","After seeing the original movie, In Cold Blood, and then Infamous, and lastly Capote, I have to say the last two are a total waste of time. <br/><br/>The movie, In Cold Blood, is a great film and it is a must-see film. But the others are about Truman Capote and his lifestyle and his fixation with one of the killers and nothing else. <br/><br/>I could give a rats ..... whether Hoffman nailed it or won an Academy for his impersonation of the author about his sexual tendencies toward a lonely killer. <br/><br/>We know that the author made up some of the items in the book and yet it's considered a literary success. It's difficult to believe that one can write lies in a book and can get well compensated. <br/><br/>This is the type of world those people live in. A circle of wanna-be's listening to fairy tales and living in the moment and can go to bed thinking they have a purpose. <br/><br/>So lets just say what it really is. Hoffman or Toby being a Capote ventriloquist, receiving money and grabbing that gold plated statue and screaming out the window that they made it. Never mind that a family of four just got wiped out. <br/><br/>Place that inanimate object on the proverbial mantle and spend the hell out of that big fat paycheck."
"SeriousJest","4","3","6","23 August 2012"," Oscar bait: Great performances, but I prefer In Cold Blood
","This film is Oscar bait. You may marvel at Hoffman's range in playing a high-pitched, effeminate, whiny, selfish prick who follows around a couple of murderers to lay the groundwork for the boom of tragedy porn culminating in the next century's Casey Anthony trial (for a keen take on that trial as a tragedy porn poster child–no pun intended–check out Episode 8 of The Newsroom). Undoubtedly, Hoffman played the hell out of the role. He masterfully presented a talented, visionary writer with a need to make his mark, perhaps driven by a need for redemption from his traumatic childhood, who encounters in these young killers the other ending of the Choose-Your-Own-Adventure book for kids like himand who is fascinated, obsessed, and consumed by this Bizarro version of himself. Unfortunately, that's about as interesting as the story gets on the Capote side. I would have rather read that in a footnote than watched a whole movie about this man. If you want to see a good movie about the murderers themselves, including what drove them to commit the acts, and what followed, watch In Cold Blood, based on Capote's actual book. rather than a movie about the man's writing of a good book. There are a couple of very good scenes by the end, and Collins's performance is terrific, but again, they are all scenes that were also well done in In Cold Blood. I would rather have seen a remake of that than sit through this plodding trip on the meta bandwagon."
"fedor8","Null","3","6","29 March 2007"," ""Dead Man Walking: Part 2"".
","Let's not kid each other here. The main reason why this movie was ""recognized"" by the Acadumby voters is because of its more-or-less blatant anti-death penalty message. Needless to say, I would have stayed away from this movie had I known it was just another political-issue-of-the-week drama. I should have known better, of course, than to trust an Oscar film.<br/><br/>It is absolutely amazing to me that they would sell this movie under the title of ""Capote"". The story is about a certain part of his life, it is not nearly as biographical and extensive as it should/could have been. From what I know, his life was interesting enough to warrant a proper bio, and not this kind of moody, slow-moving small slice of the pie. The acting is good, but the script is too limited in scope.<br/><br/>Back to the death penalty. Hollywood's obsession with promoting its damn liberal ideals is unceasing and will not/cannot cease  EVER. This much we know. It's neither the first nor last anti-death penalty movie they'll unleash at us. I do not see how we as the viewers are supposed to sympathize AT ALL with these two robbers/murderers. They kill a family (""In Cold Blood"") and yet we are presented all this left-wing drivel about a poor childhood, this and that, ladida Who gives a s***?! (Of course, the killer being part-Indian exonerates him from most guilt  in the eyes of Hollywood's unintelligentsia.) They should have been hung 4 years earlier! End of story, and let's now have more about Capote. Instead, we get to study in great detail his emotional connection with one of the killers. Sorry, but this is simply not enough  and I'd trust Hollywood to have over-dramatized this relationship, too, so I can't even be sure if its even in any way justifiable, from a biographical viewpoint."
"bob the moo","Null","3","6","19 March 2006"," Hoffman is great but his character is so difficult to like that it cries out for a wider focus in the material, which it has but not as strong as I would've liked
","Truman Capote is an author and journalist who spies his next project among the stories in the paper  the apparent motiveless murder of a family of four in Kansas. He goes to the town along with Harper Lee to try and do an article about how the callous crime has affected the town but realises that there is more to this story than just an article and decides to write a book. When two men are captured and quickly convicted for the crime, Truman helps to get them better lawyers for their appeal in return for unlimited visitation rights with the two  specifically Perry Smith. While Truman wins the total trust and friendship of Smith, he also knows that for his own good he must get all he can from Perry to make his book as good as possible.<br/><br/>With all the Oscar hype over Hoffman's performance and all the awards he is up for I decided to go and see this for myself despite not having read any of Capote's work or indeed knowing more than the documentary I watch a week prior had taught me (which wasn't much). The film opens with the aftermath of a cold and cruel murder and sets the coldly detached air that the film carries consistently really well. It is as much a presence as Capote himself and indeed the two compliment each other as they overlap. However this also backfired a it on me because the film never shirked from highlighting how mercenary and exploitative Capote was towards Smith; it may have made out he couldn't forgive himself at the end but by the standards of the Hollywood biopic redemption, that was very small beer. But by nature of Capote being so hard to like I found myself looking for a hook to the film; the story itself is good but as Truman is the focus he undermines it by repelling the audience. To counter it I thought the film would make more of the theme rather than the man by looking at the role of journalism generally in terms of being able to coldly report on subjects while also getting close to them, however although it did do this through Truman, I didn't think that it did it as well as it could have done.<br/><br/>So for this reason I felt oddly detached from the film and like it wasn't sure how to totally engage the audience. That said it was still very strong because the repellent nature of its subject (the person and the crime) easily held my interest even with the cold approach it took. Hoffman's Capote is fantastic of course. Yes he has the voice down pretty well but his performance is more impressive because he gives a convincingly selfish and horrible little character that is still interesting. He plays him with such layering and conviction that I think he deserves the praise he is being given. Keener has perhaps a smaller role but she is as reliable as ever; as indeed are turns from Cooper, Greenwood and others. Collins Jr is oft-typecast in banger roles so it was good to see him in a better character and he does well despite not really being given the time to get to the heart of his character  which is fair enough I suppose as he is not the focus of the film.<br/><br/>Overall this was a worthy if not easy film to watch. The performances are good and the subject matter intelligent and interesting. The nature of the main character makes it hard to emotionally get into the film but generally the interesting material makes it easy to get into even if I do think more could have been done with the interesting theme of journalists getting too close to their subjects and their motivations for doing so."
"majikstl","7","3","6","15 January 2006"," Based on Tru events ...
","""People like that, who cozy up to artists, do so at their own risk,"" or says Truman Capote as played by Robert Morse in ""Tru,"" the one-man show written by Jay Presson Allen. And that also seems to be the history lesson in CAPOTE.<br/><br/>Truman Capote was introduced to the mass public as a winsome child, as a character in ""A Christmas Memory,"" a famed TV special based on the author's childhood recollections of growing up poor and under the guidance of his eccentric Aunt Sookie. For others, he is the sophisticated wit behind works like ""Breakfast at Tiffany's."" Though most, no doubt, remember Capote as a jaded celebrity, a toothless monster on talk shows, known for his bitchy attitude and acid tongue attacks on those he counted among his jet-setting peers. It is the loss of innocence that took him to that last stage of his career that CAPOTE is all about.<br/><br/>CAPOTE deals with what the author had to do to make the transition from literary darling to full-fledge celebrity, a brand name more famous than his actual accomplishments. Whether that was fulfilling his destiny or selling his soul is sort of left up to the viewer to decide.<br/><br/>The catalyst for the change occurred far removed from Capote's high-toned Manhattan society world. On the plains of Kansas in 1958, a farm family of four was violently murdered. The killings of the Clutter family barely made a blip on the map for most Americans, but Capote saw it as material for what he would call a nonfiction novel. Though why such a project would be considered ground breaking is odd, since turning true crime into pulp fiction is a tradition dating back even before the dime novels of the old west. Anyway, the result was ""In Cold Blood,"" a novel that gave literary prestige to penny dreadful literature.<br/><br/>The implication is that Capote was pioneering this new form of journalism in which the author becomes personally involved with his subject, though writers getting chummy with (and betraying) their sources is a journalistic tradition almost as old as the printing press. The key difference in Capote's case is that he didn't consider himself a journalist or even a historian, but rather an artist wanting to apply fiction writing techniques to true events. That seems to be hair splitting of the narrowest of strands, not to mention a way of sidestepping a few ethical standards, most importantly, objectivity.<br/><br/>Anyway, Perry Smith and Richard Hickock were spared from being mere minor footnotes in the annals of crime by Capote, who ultimately focused his novel on the criminals and not the their crime, or their victims. And the film implies that Capote, if he didn't fall in love with Smith, at least developed a deep affection for him. Whether this is true, it certainly makes for good drama. Capote befriends the two killers while also lying to them and feeding them false hopes, all to exploit their wretched lives and sanctioned deaths for literary glory. CAPOTE suggests that as he promised to do his best to save the killers' lives, he not so secretly grew impatient for their executions so his book would have a good ending. Fact, it seems, wasn't conforming to his fiction fast enough. The film puts forth that Capote's eventual physical, emotional and literary decline stems from the moral choices he made to get his story, selling his soul, as it were -- though various addictions, including being a fame junkie, probably were greater factors.<br/><br/>As with ""In Cold Blood,"" one must wonder if CAPOTE is journalism, biographical history or simply nonfiction fiction? Like ""In Cold Blood"" we have to trust that there is honesty buried within its artistic license; where facts end and good storytelling commences is never clear under the best of circumstances. When the author's motives are suspect, the border probably doesn't exist at all. And getting history to fit on a movie screen further confuses the issue. CAPOTE must be taken with a grain of salt -- it is ""based on true events,"" an indirect way of saying that truth has been bent to suit the story -- or the whims of the filmmakers. As fiction, CAPOTE is an admirable production. Dan Futterman's screenplay covers a lot of years and territory with precision and style and it is matched by Bennett Miller's moody direction. But the best element of the film, and its greatest illusion, is Phillip Seymour Hoffman's remarkable incarnation. The rather imposing actor not only mimics Capote's grating little voice, but also physically takes on the diminutive guise of the elfish author. It is a dead-on impersonation, but also a complex performance of a character whose comically nondescript presence hides considerable arrogance, manipulation and pettiness. It is not a flattering portrayal by any means.<br/><br/>To its credit, the film itself takes exception with the notion that art is its own justification. The popular assumption that in art -- and journalism -- the end justifies the means is challenged; the film questions if finding some vague artistic truth overrides sacrificing honesty or the loss of ethical standards. Whether the filmmakers practiced what they preached may be another question to consider.<br/><br/>But, at least, CAPOTE has purpose, being about a person of note; compared to Capote's own novel, which indirectly legitimizes the lives of two men whose only act of consequence was the cold-blooded slaughter of four innocent people during a bungled robbery. As with ""In Cold Blood,"" CAPOTE casts a more curious eye on the two killers, than on the poor Clutter family. And despite the fact that Capote grew up in rural America like the Clutters, the irony is that he seems to identify with the predators more than the prey. Or maybe that is just what the filmmakers see, as they portray the author as a predator of a different sort."
"MichaelMargetis","8","3","6","15 November 2005"," ""Ever since I was a child, folks have thought they had me pegged, because of the way I am, the way I talk. And they're always wrong. "" - Truman Capote
","Philip Seymour Hoffman has been one of my favorite actors for four years. He is just such an incredible performer whether he is a desperate hospice nurse in 'Magnolia', a degenerate sick gambler in 'Owning Mahoney', a closet gay porn film assistant in 'Boogie Nights', a perverted phone caller in 'Happiness' or even a vengeful Mormon mattress salesman in 'Punch-Drunk Love'. Whatever role Mr. Hoffman takes he achieves utter perfection in. He is such a great actor but the Academy always ignores him. In his latest film 'Capote' chronicling famous author Truman Capote's struggle writing his book 'In Cold ', Hoffman plays Truman Capote. Rarely, have I seen a performance as ground-breaking as this. Philip Seymour Hoffman goes beyond perfection in bringing one of recent history's most famous novelists to life. Let's just cancel the 'Best Lead Actor' ceremony at the 2005 Academy Awards right now, and rightfully hand Philip Seymour Hoffman the 'Best Actor' Oscar. Trust me, his performance is THAT brilliant. <br/><br/>'Capote' is a decent film that is great as it is primarily on Hoffman's performance (as stated in the above paragraph.) Hoffman nails Capote as he was. An obnoxious, self-centered, attention hog who really only cared about how issues effected him, but could get away with it because he was a great writer. Most biopics try to sugar-coat their subjects (I won't name any names) but 'Capote' doesn't do anything of the sort. Actually one of the first scenes of the film is Truman Capote traveling by train with his dear friend Harper Lee, the author of the immortal classic 'To Kill a Mockingbird' (played nicely by indie favorite Catherine Keener). On the train a black luggage carrier compliments Capote by saying 'Just when you think your books can't get any better, I'm proved wrong!"". It turns out Capote payed him to say that in front of Lee to make himself look superior to her. But for all his bull, Lee puts up with Capote and she travels with him to a small town in Kansas where an entire family was brutally murdered in the most horrific act against humanity the town has ever seen. They eventually catch the culprits, one of which is a shy hispanic man (played powerfully by Clifton Collins, Jr. - Traffic), who Capote develops a close relationship to, but tries not to become to emotionally involved with because he is on death row.<br/><br/>Like I said before, the best thing by far about this film is Hoffman's beyond powerful performance as the extremely swishy and almost creepy Truman Capote. The other actors in the film are all pretty good (but incomparable to Hoffman). Catherine Keener is perfectly cast as Harper Lee while Clifton Collins, Jr. sparks emotion from his powerful performance as a brutal killer with a conscience. 'Capote' also stars Bruce Greenwood (Thirteen Days) as Capote's lover, Bob Balaban (Best in Show, Waiting for Guffman) as Capote's agent and the undeniably marvelous Chris Cooper (who also stars in this year's 'Jarhead' and the upcoming 'Syriana') as the Kansas town's police chief. Bennett Miller does a not too shabby job directing (nothing too noticeable) and the writing mixes between great, powerful, so-so and dragging. The total runtime of the film is 98 minutes, but it feels longer because it has some pacing issues. On an up-note, the film does a perfect job creating the look and feel of the era.<br/><br/>If Philip Seymour Hoffman weren't in 'Capote' it wouldn't be worth seeing. But since he is in it, giving one of his finest if not his finest performance, make sure you get a chance to screen it before the Oscars to see for yourself what everyone is raving about. My hat goes off to you Mr. Hoffman, you impressed me once again. Grade: B+ (screened at AMC Deer Valley 30, Phoenix, Arizona, 11/13/05)<br/><br/>my ratings guide - A+ (absolutley flawless); A (a masterpiece, near-perfect); A- (excellent); B+ (great); B (very good); B- (good); C+ (a mixed bag); C (average); C- (disappointing); D+ (bad); D (very bad); D- (absolutley horrendous); F (not one redeeming quality in this hunk of Hollywood feces)."

","I hold certain films to a higher standard than others. ""Fight Club"" could have been important instead of merely threatening so. We have others that spin up wheels of competence in representing life but seem to lack any understanding of life itself.<br/><br/>So I am profoundly disappointed by this.<br/><br/>Yes, it has a good actor exercising the opportunity to be the center of a world that we see only through his eyes. I've followed him from ""Twister,"" where he made that story all about himself by his quiet control from the corner.<br/><br/>And the thing does work in the way we obsess about celebrities, and revel in their quirks but only so long as we can understand those quirks and manage them in ourselves.<br/><br/>But the thing about this is how the world is delivered by an artist, how pieces of it can be sectioned out and packaged. What we see is the wrapper only, usually. Capote was all about wrappers where other writers -- the best ones -- are about the selection and sectioning of pieces.<br/><br/>So okay, movies are about wrappers too, because the best of them are self-aware and that self-awareness is about how they wrap life for us.<br/><br/>Capote was a cinematic writer, the first one unless you count Hunter Thompson. He'd impose florid visions on a substrate of ordinary life and sculpt a shape on those visions that made it seem as if the underlying matter of life had that shape.<br/><br/>He imposed style on fate, and gave us a whole new generation of possibilities for writers, mostly useless of course.<br/><br/>This is important stuff, the stuff of which you could make a great movie, especially if you have a team who understands. And Hoffman surely does understand this. Even in his most undisciplined moments like ""Love Liza"" he built a layer of wrapping and simultaneously pierced it. Its what I call folded acting, giving us two layers.<br/><br/>Now look at this movie. It is all wrapper, all style. It is a romance in the sense that you can slickly move your mind over the lubricated latex skin of the thing and never touch anything real. No nerves, muscle, juice.<br/><br/>There's the wrapper of the killer's world. Of the book Capote wrapped around that. Of the persona Capote wrapped around it in his fabricated person. Of the book Gerald Clarke wrapped around all of that. At each layer, these artists gave us means to touch the reality within. Now we come to the fifth wrapper, the one of the movie.<br/><br/>And it seals off all the reality. Was the hanging supposed to be that piercing? The snubbing of ""Mockingbird?"" The withdrawal from prison visits? Can any defender of this film claim so? Ask yourself what effect it had on you when Capote withdrew to Spain? Was it any different to you than when he withdrew to Manhattan? It was in all the other wrappers, because it withdrew the needles.<br/><br/>No needles here folks. Move along, nothing to see.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
"grahamclarke","4","3","7","18 February 2007"," The consequences of a severely inadequate screenplay
","Since ""Capote"" has been so well received I found it an unpleasant surprise to find it a film so severely lacking in the kind of depth and complexity that the subject matter warrants.<br/><br/>Symptomatic of this is Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance. It's a case of excellent mimicry, which is not as unusual a talent as it might appear. A street artist may capture a startling likeness but one wouldn't call it art. Like much of the film it's a case of a dazzling veneer with all too little beneath the surface.<br/><br/>Unluckily for ""Capote"" but luckily for us, a year later ""Infamous"" came to the screen dealing with much the same territory. Undoubtedly Capote would have far greater enjoyed ""Infamous"", which manages to be colorful, intelligent, funny, thought provoking and great entertainment. ""Capote"" may have its moments, but overall it's heavy handed and stark. Worst of all is that the main characters are underwritten so that even excellent actors such as Hoffman and Catherine Keener (and Clifton Collins Jr.) really do not have much to work with since so much of the psychological complexities of their characters have been ignored. <br/><br/>Completely avoiding the clearly erotic element in Capote's and Smith's relationship is misleading if not untruthful.<br/><br/>These faults are clearly the case of a poor screenplay. Nothing can overcome that; not the excellent cinematography, nor the talented actors. As always, it's starts and ends with the screenplay."

","Although I have heard of Capote, he was before my time and I knew little to nothing about him before seeing this film. Overall, I wasn't impressed. Phillip Seymour Hoffman was the redeeming quality; I always enjoy watching him work, and he did a phenomenal acting job. The movie kept my attention for the most part, and gave me a few laughs, but it failed to move me. Once I left the theater, I ceased thinking about the movie, which is never a good sign. Although I don't regret seeing this movie, I probably won't watch it again. I did like the actor Clifton Collins, Jr, who played Perry Smith. His acting was mesmerizing, and I wasn't sure what opinion to have of his character. He was this cold-blooded killer, but you couldn't help but sympathize with him at times, with his sad eyes and enigmatic motive."

Maybe I miss something important but all what this film is about is talking. They talk all the time and that not very interesting. It jumps from scene to scene with no red line.

"Tony-114","6","4","11","30 October 2005"," ""What's the Title of Your Book?""
","Please note: although I've checked the ""spoiler"" box, there really isn't one in this post. For this film details an important series of events in American cultural history on several different levels that, frankly, should be common knowledge to anyone old enough to go see it. Those who have a strong interest to see ""Capote"" are already familiar with its story. Those only partially familiar yet wish to see it (not surprising, given the loud (justified) raves for P.S. Hoffman's performance) would do well to do some preliminary study, about the real-life Clutter killings if not about Capote himself. If you're interested in seeing the film but have never heard of either Truman Capote or the story (or the book TC wrote), do yourself a favor and rent Richard Brooks' 1967 adaptation of ""In Cold Blood."" Robert Blake's performance (as Perry Smith) in that film is every bit as good as Hoffman's in this one, and you'll get a much better understanding as to why Smith and Hickock did what they did, which, ultimately, is what ""Capote"" is really about. <br/><br/>Having said that, I'm torn about recommending ""Capote"": yes, Hoffman is excellent in capturing Capote the enigma and deserves to be on next year's Best Actor Oscar short list; yes, it captures the relationship between TC and Harper Lee, as well as the painfully-shy Lee herself (I wonder what the real HL thinks of Catherine Keener's performance); yes, it does a good job capturing the deep connection between Perry and Truman, and I even liked how the filmmakers seemed to have gone out of their way to dignify the Clutters as murder victims almost as much as they do their killers, something the film of ""ICB"" doesn't do.<br/><br/>Yet in making sure everyone involved is portrayed with an appropriate level of dignity and sensitivity, all the blood and the feeling has been drained out of it. This is why ""Capote"" generates more questions than the film can possibly answer: What was it that moved TC to pursue the Clutter story so immediately from the very moment he read about it in the newspaper, considering the light years rural Kansas was from his own Manhattan world of holding court at cocktail parties and being the general center of attention? Couldn't the filmmakers have addressed more fully how the success of ""ICB"" ended TC's career, not even to show how the book's release forever altered the publishing and literary worlds and made him a cause célèbre for years, which made his downfall so breathtaking and tragic? <br/><br/>With the exception of Perry himself, how was it that no one in his orbit -- Lee, Jack Dumphy, even William Shawn, to an extent -- never confronted or call out TC on how shamefully exploitative he was in squeezing the murder story out of Perry for the sake of his own career and ego? And most importantly (one reason I wanted to see it), how did a flamboyant,self-centered, lisping man-child queen not only manage to get the story with the full cooperation of everyone he approached -- including, begrudgingly,the lead investigator in the case! -- yet was not once ""gay-bashed,"" verbally or physically, by anyone he encountered in Holcomb or elsewhere in Kansas, no less a bastion of church-sanctioned homophobia in 1959 than it is today? (TC was wise to bring along Harper Lee, but a beard posing as a research assistant could have only done so much.) <br/><br/>All of these things could have been portrayed very well. The problem with ""Capote"" is the script: the filmmakers' dedication to stay within the boundaries of ""ICB""'s creation and composition deprives the movie of having a lasting impact. Why did they continue to portray TC to the very end with sympathy to the point of reverence, and limit detailing his comeuppance to a handful of pristine notes at the end of the picture? Truman Capote was a true genius, brilliant and beguiling; he was also a despicable, manipulative, narcissistic lush. ""ICB"" made TC; it killed him, too. If the makers of ""Ray"" were brave enough to show their subject warts and all, the makers of ""Capote"" could have easily done the same. Sometimes when you keep the kid gloves on, you do more harm than good. The real talent lies in knowing when to take them off."

For me Hoffman's acting carries with it a heavy twinge of the sleazy; like a used towel left at the set of porn movie. And Futterman didn't understand that truth is far more interesting and realistic than the negligent fictions in his screenplay... some of them being so twisted that they completely change entire nature of Capote's character and skew interpersonal dynamics to the point of complete unbelievability.<br/><br/>Not only is Infamous more interesting to watch but is more true to the spirit of actual circumstances as well."

","H'wood is in it for the money, not in it for fidelity to what really happened.<br/><br/>Yes, it's a good film for drama and all, and I liked it, but I like even more fidelity to history.<br/><br/>Capote vs. _Capote_ By Phil Gibbons<br/><br/>About a year ago, in anticipation of the 40th anniversary of the publication of Truman Capote's In Cold Blood, his journalistic account of a murder and its aftermath that he called a ""non-fiction novel,"" I began to do some research on the book and its author. I read just about everything published on Capote's life and work, talked to some of the participants in the saga of the Clutter family murder and...<br/><br/>Unlike In Cold Blood, Capote is very much a work of fiction, with a plot dependent on incidents that were created for the film. The movie focuses on Capote's inner struggle as he wrestles with writing a ""great"" work of literature. In the film, he comes to realize that for his work to succeed, he must manipulate, exploit and deceive the two murderers, Perry Smith and Dick Hickock.<br/><br/>Capote's ambivalence about Smith and Hickock and the agonizing turmoil it wreaks on his life is the major plot line throughout the film. Several scenes dramatize his willingness to intercede on behalf of the killers. After their conviction, Capote is depicted as hiring lawyers to represent them in their appeals, angering his newly befriended law enforcement source, Kansas Bureau of Investigation agent Alvin Dewey. When Smith goes on a hunger strike to try to die before facing the hangman, Capote spoons him baby food through the bars of his cell, telling him that he still must live so that Capote can reveal to the world that he is not a ""monster."" Capote's real motive, according to the film, is to keep Smith alive as a continued source of material for his epic.<br/><br/>The filmmakers explain Capote's presence on death row with a scene in which he gives ""Warden Krutch"" a $10,000 cash payoff, which gains the writer unprecedented access to his two protagonists.<br/><br/>Capote is shown spending months bonding with Smith, all the while hoping to get Smith to describe what happened and how he felt on the night of the crime. The film concludes with the hanging of Smith and Hickock, and a note stating that Capote never completed another book; the film suggests that the process was so personally scarring that it irretrievably shattered Capote as an artist.<br/><br/>There is nothing in Gerald Clarke's book Capote: A Biography, on which the film is based, that claims that Capote attempted to secure legal representation for Smith and Hickock. Nor is this assertion included in any other nonfiction account that I have seen. Duane West, the county prosecutor at the time, told me that the initial appeal was handled by attorneys appointed and paid for by the state of Kansas. Subsequent appeals were taken up by members of the Kansas Legal Aid Society of the state bar association after they were contacted by Dick Hickock, a fact mentioned in In Cold Blood itself.<br/><br/>Capote's extended prison sojourns in the film are likewise fictionalized. In five years, Capote personally visited his subjects no more than half a dozen times, though he did correspond with Hickock and Smith on a weekly basis. He placed a great value on access to information, but was less interested in dealing with the defendants as people. The baby food scene and other death row confrontations were likewise invented.<br/><br/>While the film's Warden Krutch is an utterly venal and corrupt bureaucrat, the real-life Warden Sherman Crouse denied Capote access to death row because prison regulations restricted contact to immediate family and legal counsel. To overcome this, Capote retained the well-connected law firm of Saffels & Hope, who, at Capote's request, approached the governor of the state and worked out a deal.<br/><br/>While an unattributed comment in Clarke's biography suggests that money changed hands, there's no evidence that it went to the warden. Charles McAtee, the recently deceased former department head of Kansas State penal institutions, described Crouse to me as a principled individual who remained in his position despite terminal cancer, determined not to leave the onerous task of executing Hickock and Smith (and two other inmates) to his successor.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>An op-ed by Daniel Henninger in the Wall Street Journal (11/4/05) invoked Capote as an example of a nonjudgmental film ... He bolsters his case with dubious evidence: ""Early in the film, Capote becomes absorbed with the lives of the accused murderers, especially Perry Smith, whose undoubted intelligence and troubled early years seem to resemble his own. He tries to secure better lawyers for them. And indeed through these interventions, Capote produces stays of execution for years, partly out of sympathy but also to give him more time to collect material for his book."" Describing the film in the New York Review of Books (11/17/05), Daniel Mendelsohn wrote that ""the film focuses on the . . . five-year period during which the killers, assisted at first by Capote, found better lawyers, made appeals and won stays of execution."" Mendelsohn bought into the film's premise that Capote was ambivalent, initially helpful to the murderers but ultimately eager to have them done in to pave his way to stardom. He accurately cited a 1965 letter from Capote, quoted in Clarke's biography, in which he say he's ""keeping his fingers crossed"" that all appeals will be denied and that the execution will swiftly ensue. But Mendelsohn failed to mention that Capote expressed exactly the same sentiments in published letters written two years earlier Mendelsohn also ascribed Capote's addiction issues to the grueling creative process involved with In Cold Blood. In reality, Capote's alcohol and prescription drug intake was at a serious level before, during and after the composition of In Cold Blood.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>_Extra!_, March/April 2006, www.fair.org"
"michael.will","Null","2","4","24 December 2005"," On with the Truman myth
","""Capote"" is a factual account, and that is to say it's loosely based on the accumulated hearsay of Gerald Clarke's post-mortem biography, dealing with the six gruelling years that author Truman Capote spent researching his bestseller, ""In Cold Blood"". This was his masterwork -- a ""non-fiction novel"", as he called it while claiming to invent the art form -- about a pair of young drifters, Perry Smith and Richard Hickock, and how they savagely murdered a farm family in 1959 Kansas, which eventually led to their deaths on the gallows at Leavenworth. A stark and equally famous 1967 film was adapted from this book, and ""Capote"" is a very calculated companion piece, in terms of mood and pacing and general bleakness. It fills in the blanks of what Capote left out of his book, namely his own very active and high profile role in the case, and in the lives of the people involved, especially the killers. Capote, with stunning efficiency, kept himself a completely invisible presence in the book and the later film.<br/><br/>It's a portrait of journalistic ruthlessness, reminiscent of Billy Wilder's biting film satire of 1950, ""Ace in the Hole"", and how such ruthlessness emotionally boomerangs. Capote was as much a professional charmer as a brilliant author, who rose from humble beginnings to the heights of New York society just by sheer force of character, turning himself into something of beloved mascot of the extremely rich, much to their later regret. In the 80s, he exposed their smutty secrets in an infamous chapter of an unfinished novel, that he published in the New Yorker. The rich, Truman told the dazzled public, use such things as menstrual fluid, in humiliating sexual situations, to declare their racial supremacy. It was pure social suicide, as bewildering as it was titillating, and this movie, though not referring to this directly, purports to tell us how it came about.<br/><br/>We join Truman in 1960, when he goes to Kansas to write about this obscure mass murder. Though an effeminate little weirdo, he employs his masterful New York social climbing skills on the Midwestern townsfolk and local authorities, and they're putty in his hands. He sweet talks and lies and finagles his way through the channels, and eventually into the confidence of the killers themselves. Only they can provide him with the story's grisly core, the cold facts of the mass murder as it happened. Focusing on the more intelligent and vulnerable of the two, Perry Smith, Capote chips away at Perry's resolve with faux friendship, which gradually evolves into a very real platonic romance between the two. Meanwhile, Truman's new lover's execution, which Truman has the means to help prevent or at least postpone, is something that must occur if Truman's masterpiece is ever to be completed. The film's wonderful conceit, dime store analysis at its finest, is that this prostitution of his affections for the sake of art and fame is what led to his own self-demolition, in alcoholism and betrayal of his privileged friends. Highly debatable in terms of accuracy, but it makes for a great, if sanctimonious, gossip fable.<br/><br/>Philip Seymour Hoffman is terrific as the diminutive oddball, catching the effete mannerisms and catty charisma that made Truman a talk show celebrity, and suggesting that this public persona was simply a tool employed by a cold and very troubled genius. Perhaps this extreme dead seriousness is, in itself, something of a flaw to the portrayal. The film is resolutely grave and low key, trying too hard to mimic the mood of the book and subsequent film it's centered around, while frantically steering clear of the situation's very evident black comedy aspects. Truman was, according to all sources including Clarke's biography, a preposterous human being, and his never-quite-sane shenanigans, even during this intense period of his life, had more than their share of high hilarity. A lot more could've been made of his culture clash with uptight 1960s Midwesterners, and his egocentric excesses that are well documented, without detracting from the story's impact. While ""Capote"" doesn't commit the unpardonable sin of Jennifer Jason Leigh in Robert Altman's ""Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle"", that of making a literary icon an aggravating bore, it does wring a lot of the fun out of old Truman. It's as if the filmmakers were scared shitless of making this seem like a sleazy character assassination, which, in essence, it is.<br/><br/>Where ""Capote"" does succeed, despite its over exacting cross referencing, is that it's a solid psychological piece in its own right. Leisurely as it is, it's utterly involving and invigorating, and I'd hazard to guess that one could appreciate it with no prior knowledge of ""In Cold Blood"", or the highly publicized life of this most famous of mid-century authors. It actually rises to that most daunting of challenges -- taking on an artist and his godforsaken creative process, and fashioning a piece of accessible cinema for more than just his hardcore fans. Of course I'm biased -- I am, indeed, a lifelong Capote freak. The guy and his books are fascinating, and though far from the last word on the subject, this fractional biopic figures well into the ongoing mythology of Truman Capote."

","Phillip Seymour Hoffman's performance as Truman Capote will undoubtedly earn him best actor candidacy.

Katherine Keener was badly miscast. I loved her sexy quirkiness in Being John Malkovich and The 40 Year Old Virgin. As the matronly Nelle Harper Lee, she was no-frills plain vanilla. Clifton Collins Jr. was unconvincing as the sociopath Percy Smith. Bob Balaban deserves bigger roles.<br/><br/>I give the film a 6, with 5 of those points being credited to Hoffman."

","On Nov. 16, 1959, Truman Capote noticed a news item about four members of a Kansas farm family who were shotgunned to death. He telephoned William Shawn, editor of The New Yorker, wondering if Shawn would be interested in an article about the murders. Later in his life, Capote said that if he had known what would happen as a result of this impulse, he would not have stopped in Holcomb, Kan., but would have kept right on going ""like a bat out of hell.""<br/><br/>At first Capote thought the story would be about how a rural community was dealing with the tragedy. ""I don't care one way or the other if you catch who did this,"" he tells an agent from the Kansas Bureau of Investigation. Then two drifters, Perry Smith and Richard Hickock, are arrested and charged with the crime. As Capote gets to know them, he's consumed by a story that would make him rich and famous, and destroy him. His ""non-fiction novel,"" In Cold Blood, became a best seller and inspired a movie, but Capote was emotionally devastated by the experience and it hastened his death.<br/><br/>Bennett Miller's ""Capote"" is about that crucial period of less than six years in Capote's life. As he talks to the killers, to law officers and to the neighbors of the murdered Clutter family, Capote's project takes on depth and shape as the story of conflicting fates. But at the heart of his reporting is an irredeemable conflict: He wins the trust of the two convicted killers and essentially falls in love with Perry Smith, while needing them to die to supply an ending for his book. ""If they win this appeal,"" he tells his friend Harper Lee, ""I may have a complete nervous breakdown."" After they are hanged on April 14, 1965, he tells Harper, ""There wasn't anything I could have done to save them."" She says: ""Maybe, but the fact is you didn't want to.""<br/><br/>""Capote"" is a film of uncommon strength and insight, about a man whose great achievement requires the surrender of his self-respect. Philip Seymour Hoffman's precise, uncanny performance as Capote doesn't imitate the author so much as channel him, as a man whose peculiarities mask great intelligence and deep wounds.<br/><br/>As the story opens Capote is a well-known writer (of Breakfast at Tiffany's, among others), a popular guest on talk shows, a man whose small stature, large ego and affectations of speech and appearance make him an outsider wherever he goes. Trying to win the confidence of a young girl in Kansas, he tells her: ""Ever since I was a child, folks have thought they had me pegged, because of the way I am, the way I talk."" But he was able to enter a world far removed from Manhattan, and write a great book about ordinary Midwesterners and two pathetic, heartless killers. Could anyone be less like Truman Capote than Perry Smith? Yet they were both mistreated and passed around as children, had issues with distant and remote mothers, had secret fantasies. ""It's like Perry and I grew up in the same house, and one day he went out the back door and I went out the front,"" he tells Harper Lee.<br/><br/>The film, written by Dan Futterman and based on the book the book Capote by Gerald Clarke, focuses on the way a writer works on a story and the story works on him. Capote wins the wary acceptance of Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper), the agent assigned to the case. Over dinner in Alvin and Mary Dewey's kitchen, he entertains them with stories about John Huston and Humphrey Bogart. As he talks, he studies their house like an anthropologist. He convinces the local funeral director into letting him view the mutilated bodies of the Clutters. Later, Perry Smith will tell him he liked the father, Herb Clutter: ""I thought he was a very nice, gentle man. I thought so right up until I slit his throat.""<br/><br/>On his trips to Kansas he takes along a southern friend from childhood, Harper Lee (Catherine Keener). So long does it take him to finish his book that Lee in the meantime has time to publish her famous novel To Kill a Mockingbird, sell it to the movies, and attend the world premiere with Gregory Peck. Lee is a practical, grounded woman who clearly sees that Truman cares for Smith and yet will exploit him for his book. ""Do you hold him in esteem, Truman?"" she asks, and he is defensive: ""Well, he's a gold mine.""<br/><br/>Perry Smith and Dick Hickock are played by Clifton Collins Jr. and Mark Pellegrino. Hickock is not developed as deeply as in Richard Brooks' film ""In Cold Blood"" (1967), where he was played by Scott Wilson; the emphasis this time is on Smith, played in 1967 by Robert Blake and here by Collins as a haunted, repressed man in constant pain, who chews aspirin by the handful and yet shelters a certain poetry; his drawings and journal move Capote, who sees him as a man who was born a victim and deserves, not forgiveness, but pity.<br/><br/>The other key characters are Capote's lover, Jack Dunphy (Bruce Greenwood), and his editor at the New Yorker, William Shawn (Bob Balaban). ""Jack thinks I'm using Perry,"" Truman tells Harper. ""He also thinks I fell in love with him in Kansas."" Shawn thinks In Cold Blood, when it is finally written, is ""going to change how people write."" He prints the entire book in his magazine.<br/><br/>The movie ""In Cold Blood"" had no speaking role for Capote, who in a sense stood behind the camera with the director. If ""Capote"" had simply flipped the coin and told the story of the Clutter murders from Capote's point of view, it might have been a good movie, but what makes it so powerful is that it looks with merciless perception at Capote's moral disintegration.<br/><br/>""If I leave here without understanding you,"" Capote tells Perry Smith during one of many visits to his cell, ""the world will see you as a monster. I don't want that."" He is able to persuade Smith and Hickock to tell him what happened on the night of the murders. He learns heartbreaking details, such as that they ""put a different pillow under the boy's head just to shoot him."" Capote tells them he will support their appeals and help them find another lawyer. He betrays them. Smith eventually understands that, and accepts his fate. ""Two weeks, and finito,"" he tells Capote as his execution draws near. Another good line for the book."

","Capote tells two stories, presenting both without hiccups. The first is an exposé of how the title author's In Cold Blood was written. The second shows the emotional and psychic dissolution of the man who starts out the film as a brilliant eccentric and finishes it as a basket case.<br/><br/>In Cold Blood made Truman Capote a household name, and led to him being ranked as one of the greatest American writers. It also destroyed him. He would never complete another book and, less than 20 years after finishing In Cold Blood, he would die of a drug overdose. Great authors often live unhappy lives. After his experiences putting together his legacy work, Capote's became almost unbearable. Bennett Miller's motion picture shows how obsession and self-absorption developed from personality traits into personal demons.<br/><br/>Capote opens in 1959. The title character (Philip Seymour Hoffman), tired of writing fiction, has decided to investigate four Kanas murders as a possible subject for a non-fiction article in the New Yorker magazine. With him, he takes his good friend, Nelle Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), who has recently completed her manuscript for To Kill a Mockingbird. The local police chief (Chris Cooper) offers reluctant cooperation. After the killers - Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.) and Richard Hickock (Mark Pellegrino) - are captured, Capote's interviews with Perry result in a twisted form of bonding and co-dependency. There is manipulation and empathy on both sides. At one point, Truman remarks, ""It's as if Perry and I grew up in the same house. One day, I went out the front door and he went out the back."" Eventually, with the appeals process prolonging the execution of the death penalty, Truman reaches the point where he wants Perry to be hanged so this nightmarish phase of his life can reach closure. ""All I want to do is write the ending, and there's no end in sight,"" he laments.<br/><br/>One cannot write about this film without tossing superlatives in the direction of Philip Seymour Hoffman, whose performance will earn him an Oscar nomination. Hoffman doesn't merely imitate Capote. He inhabits him with an intensity that demands acknowledgement from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Catherine Keener, Chris Cooper, and Clifton Collins Jr. offer support, but this is Hoffman's movie from start to finish. Underrated for most of his career, this role will allow him to take his turn in the spotlight.<br/><br/>Capote is a deep movie with rich veins to mine. The lead character is not likeable. He is a user who exploits his relationship with Perry for personal gain. At the beginning, he doesn't know what it will ultimately cost him. As the movie develops, we see the complex love-and-hate association with Perry and how this results in the slow erosion of Capote's personality. The brilliance of Bennett's movie is that it concentrates on the characters and their interaction and never becomes a mouthpiece for one side or the other with respect to the death penalty. It would have been easy to turn Capote into a polemic, but Bennett resists the urge.<br/><br/>Although I had a stronger connection with Capote on an intellectual level than on an emotional level (I never came close to shedding a tear), the experience stayed with me for some time. That's unusual for something I see for the first time in the midst of a film festival. (In this case, Toronto.) Normally, movies falling into a mid-day slot leave a minimal aftertaste before being washed away by the next feature, but not this one."

","Following the murder of a family of four in a remote corner of Kansas author Truman Capote decides it will be the subject of his next article for the 'New Yorker' magazine. He heads there with his friend and research assistant Nelle Harper Lee. They interview various locals and gradually befriend the lead investigator and his wife. It isn't long before he starts to think the story is more suited to being told in a book. When two young men are arrested he befriends then and after they are convicted he continues to visit them as they wait on death row and recommends they get a better lawyer and appeal. He now has two problems; to finish the book he needs them to tell him just what happened in the house that led to the four deaths and just as importantly he needs an ending which ongoing appeals won't provide.<br/><br/>This is a really interesting film even if you haven't read 'In Cold Blood'... perhaps more so as there is much to be learnt about the crimes. It must be stated though that this is about Capote's research, his relationship with the arrested men and the effect the story has on him. We are told what happened in the house on the night of the killings but this is a relatively small part of the story. The characters are impressively complex; most obviously Capote himself who we see manipulating the accused men and hoping for a conclusion that isn't in their interests; there is also a feeling that Smith is also trying to use Capote to save himself from the noose. Philip Seymour Hoffman does a fantastic job as Truman Capote; it is little surprise that he picked up an Academy Award for it. There is a solid supporting cast; notably from Catherine Keener as Harper Lee and Clifton Collins Jr as suspect Perry Smith. Overall I'd certainly recommend this film whether you are already interested in Truman Capote or are just after a fascinating story based on real events."

"marydm-43470","10","0","0","15 April 2019"," Sublime Hoffman
","Have now seen this three times on Netflix and I cannot take my eyes off Hoffman. He is absolutely mesmerising, all the more for underplaying the character.
This doesn't feel like a biopic, ten minutes into the movie you forget it's based on a real life historical personality. The economy of the narrative is of great help, the movie concentrates on one aspect of Capote's life -his writing of In Cold Blood and the circumstances surrounding that- and treats it in depth.
Hoffman can convey an ocean of emotional nuance with the barest facial expression. During a couple of closeups of those deep blue eyes framed by the tow coloured hair I was sobbing myself silly. How I miss him!
The moral conflict at the centre of his research for the book is treated with the complex respect it deserves. There's no glossing over the deeply selfish way Capote goes about befriending the convict Perry (that's the other brilliant performance in the film), and his self awareness that he may have used a person at a gross disadvantage. Who says Hollywood doesn't do serious cinema? And it's done organically, through the dramatisation, without clunky voiceovers and talking heads.
Script outstanding, editing spare and effective in moving the story along, but this is Hoffman's hour. He is beyond mesmerising, smouldering, scintillating in the role.
With every movie of his I've seen, even when he was still a kid in Twister, I remember him long after I've forgotten the rest. I'm still in mourning at his passing. Did he want to write his own tragedy or was it a tragic mistake. What a performer, what a legacy!
Love you Philip!"

"krocheav","8","0","0","9 July 2018"," Capote - Will The Real Truman Please Stand
","Capote is one of those productions that leaves the viewer wrestling with many questions, like: Where does the ""truth"" lie ~ where does the manipulation of such a cunning writer like Capote begin and end & Who uses Who to the highest degree? ~ so many facets to consider. Is Capote capable of telling the truth? ~ are Truth and Lies one the same to this gifted but damaged character? Will we ever know? In interviews, Capote tells us he demanded complete control over the making of the film version of ""In Cold Blood"" right down to the fact that he insisted on a complete cast of unknown actors. As it turned out, apart from Scott Wilson as one of the killers, it has a very well known cast indeed. Then we learn that the director Richard Brooks, is also the producer , as well as the screenplay writer - with no credit suggesting that Capote had any involvement whatever other than selling the rights to the book. There won't be many (if any) telling Brooks what he can and can't do. One other story tells us that Truman contacted Brooks to complain about him employing a Blackman to compose the music score and, that he wanted Brooks to sack him, with Brooks telling Capote where to go in no uncertain terms...so much for his claims with all these demands. <br/><br/>As for the suggestion that he never wrote another book after 'In Cold Blood' because of the 'emotional' effect that accompanied it - this also seems a bit of a stretch. With millions of copies to his credit, an endless supply of booze and over-the-top lifestyle luxury, would he ever need to? Anyway, apart from the mysteries surrounding these questions 'Capote' as a movie production is quality all the way, with a stand-out performance by the late Seymour Hoffman and fine direction to keep the slower story elements constantly entertaining. Of particular note is, director Bennett Miller and screen play writer Dan Futterman give us various revealing clues to the double sided nature of Capote - one such has Harper Lee responding to a statement during a phone conversation where Capote says words to the effect 'While he tried, he could not stop the executions of these men he was writing about' to which she responds ""Maybe not. The fact is you didn't want to""!"
"classicsoncall","8","0","0","17 October 2017"," ""It's the book I was always meant to write.""
","It's easy to become conflicted over the character of Truman Capote in this picture, just as Capote himself appeared to be conflicted in his relationship with one of the Clutter Family murderers, Perry Smith. It was a little unsettling to hear Capote outright lie to Smith the first time (when he said he didn't have a title to his book yet), but then he repeatedly lied time and time again to secure an advantage in gaining insights into Smith's character. Maybe 'lie' isn't the right word, how about manipulate? Capote was a master manipulator when it came to getting the information he wanted and needed for his story. I'm not so sure I wouldn't have done the same.<br/><br/>The title for the film might be a bit of a misnomer. ""Capote"" isn't about the life of the esteemed novelist, it's really about a five or so year window during which Capote became captivated by the murder of a Kansas family and decided to write about it. I'm not sure if this was the first 'non-fiction novel' ever written as Capote claims to his publisher in the story, but that probably doesn't matter. If you've read ""In Cold Blood"", you'll know it's a chilling account of the brutal Clutter murders, a riveting read that's hard to put down once you get started.<br/><br/>Despite the real life Capote's celebrity, the only time I've ever seen him, and this seems kind of weird, was as a panelist on a handful of the old Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts aired during the Seventies. Every time he appeared, as I recall, he utilized that affectation where he brings two fingers to his eye underneath the eyeglass lens. I can't recall if Phillip Seymour Hoffman did it more than once in this movie, but the one time I did make note of it was while riding to the premiere of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" with his publisher William Shawn (Bob Balaban).<br/><br/>What one probably needs to do if you haven't already done so, is catch up with the 1967 film based on Capote's book. As a complement to this picture, it does a much better job of detailing the dysfunctional, sordid and senseless lives of Richard Hickok and Perry Smith, while the stark black and white filming adds to the horror of the Clutter nightmare. In that movie, Perry Smith is portrayed by actor Robert Blake, and thinking about it now, wouldn't it have been something if Blake and Hoffman were contemporaries to appear in a film like this together. That would have been something, wouldn't it? <br/><br/>Reading some of the negative reviews on this board, it appears that the film's pace was a problem for most. Granted, this is not an action movie, but the drama presented is noteworthy and provides some insight into the complexity of Truman Capote's character. What might serve well would be a more complete story on his life and times, the description of his early life to prisoner Smith sounded like the kind of stuff that would make for a compelling biography."

"ElMaruecan82","9","0","0","9 February 2017"," One character study can hide another...
","""I thought that Mr. Clutter was a very nice gentleman. I thought so right up to the moment that I cut his throat."" This is perhaps the most defining and haunting line of Truman Capote's ""In Cold Blood"", one that stuck to my mind like dried mud on boots' soles. The essence of Capote's masterpiece is to have asked the question: how could people like the brave, God-fearing Kansan Clutter family members be slaughtered like hogs by two hoods who admitted that they had nothing personal against them.<br/><br/>The question could never have a satisfying answer. The book and its cinematic documentary-like adaptation of 1967 chronicled the chain of events that made the Clutters cross the path of Perry Smith and Dick Hicock and while we got a few insights on the killers' troubled personalities, there couldn't be a satisfying 'explanation' to the crime. The closest to a 'conclusion' was that neither Dick nor Perry could kill alone but together they formed that third personality that could slit the throat of Mr. Clutter and shotgun to death his wife, son and daughter.<br/><br/>But for me, the real conclusion was that it was all a stupid waste, Hicock didn't have the killing DNA, whatever that meant, Smith was a tormented artist, if within their inhumanity, they were humane enough to put pillows under their victims' head, if Perry didn't let Dick have 'his way' with Nancy, so it is a real waste that they just didn't leave the house and let everybody live. I deplored the loss of six lives at the end of my ""In Cold Blood"" review, daring to include the killers. Little did I know that there was a seventh victim, a collateral damage on an emotional level. Truman Capote himself, who died of complications from alcoholism in 1984 but it is established that this was a result from his work on ""In Cold Blood"", the bond he developed with Perry Smith and the conclusion of this very relationship, one of painfully conflicting reactions.<br/><br/>Bennet Miller's ""Capote"" features the same third act than Richard Brooks' classic but this time with the focus on Capote. In the first film, he was a sort of neutral character, a man who allowed Perry and Dick to talk and share their feelings, with ""Capote"", we get new insights on this relationship and the way it drove the writer's interest and then fascination for the case. I mentioned in my review of ""In Cold Blood"" that it was one of morbid nature and somewhat it was. When Capote meets Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper reprising William Forsythe's role) he tells him that he doesn't care for the resolution, the nature of the crime and the victims is the primal focus. It takes the discovery of the coffin's contents and the macabre detail: a cotton device applied to hide the disfigured heads so Capote can measure the atrocity of the crime.<br/><br/>And then, when he finally meets Perry Smith, something just 'kicks off', and the duo drives the film just like Hicock and Smith in the first. What does Capote see in Smith if not a small man, half-Cherokee, carrying the stigmata of a tormented childhood, just like he does. In Smith (played by Clifton Collins Jr.); Capote sees himself, he whose mannerisms, short stature and homosexuality made him a natural outcast. Capote can't see any evil in Smith while he must admit that he was evil enough to commit such a horrific crime, this is the start of the book. And as Capote tells Perry, if he doesn't write his story, people will believe he's a monster. But Perry sees in Capote a genuine desire to help him, a misunderstanding that Capote deliberately entertains because he needs a Perry as healthy and friendly and talkative as possible.<br/><br/>Capote loves Perry but he loves his project even more and in order to make his masterpiece, he has no other choice than compromising his own self-esteem. There's some moral justice that the process of making a book about such an affecting story would also affect the writer himself, as if no one could survive from it. And that's the most captivating aspect about the film because we see an artist in the process of making a nonfiction book, but whose basis is the character study of two despicable human beings. And in the same time, as viewers, we're also transported by the character study of Truman Capote and the way this hidden, hammy and cynical genius finally meets his match and makes the acquaintance with his destiny.<br/><br/>""Capote"" doesn't duplicate the shocking effect of ""In Cold Blood"" but doesn't sugarcoat the disturbing elements, we see the brutal killings and we see how Capote approaches the truth as scared as confident. The performance of Philip Seymour Hoffman makes you realize what a tremendous loss he was for cinema and what a tragic coincidence that he also died from his personal demons, as coincidentally tragic that Robert Blake, who played Perry Smith, would also be later accused of a crime. Sometimes, fiction is crazier than reality and it is perhaps for this reason that ""In Cold Blood"" revolutionized modern literature by proving that even journalism style can inspire masterpieces, the catch is that the nonfictional emotions would also spread to the author and ultimately kill him.<br/><br/>In the film, Nelle Harper Lee, played by Catherine Keener, helps Capote in his investigation, and the project lasts so long that she has time to write ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" and go to the premiere of the film's adaptation. It would take years for Capote to make ""In Cold Blood"" and while Lee lived till her peaceful death in 2016, Capote would never recover for it and will die less than two decades after. You have nothing for nothing and what Capote shows is the prices we shall pay to have some unique and universal glimpses of human natures, even when scumbags inspire genius."

","The true story of famed writer Truman Capote's work on his last finished book ""In Cold Blood"" is told brilliantly in Capote, starring Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Esteemed writer and popular socialite Truman Capote learns about a brutal murder in a small town and decides to investigate the story for an article in The New Yorker. He travels there with his best friend from childhood and long into adulthood, Harper Lee. Harper Lee is, of course, the author of the classic novel To Kill a Mockingbird, but at this time hasn't even written it yet. Now, Mr. Capote goes to this town and interviews many people. He talks with the police, with local residents, and even friends and family of the victims. But something happens when he meets the alleged killer. He develops a sort of empathetic connection to him, although he still does just seem to want a story. He decides to write a ""non-fiction novel"" instead of just an article as he gathers so much info. This is where we see a despicable side of Truman Capote start to arise. He hires a lawyer to help fight the killer's case, but mostly because he doesn't want the kid killed until he can get a confession out of him to write in his book. He acts like he's the kid's friend in front of him, but lies and treats him like garbage behind his back. And the movie also focuses over the fact that Truman starts to become impatient over his 4 year process because he cant finish his book until the killer convicted, set free, or executed. We also see Truman's fall from friendship with Harper Lee due to his increasing alcoholism and his insane jealousy over the success of her famous novel.<br/><br/>This movie does something great for the biopic genre as a whole. It shines light on a person's life, but doesn't romanticize it. This movie shows Truman Capote for what he was. Fun, and intelligent, but also deceitful and slightly corrupted. Phillip Seymour Hoffman runs away with this role portraying every detail associated with the author. Mr. Hoffman perfectly portrays the voice and lisp of Truman Capote, and also embodies all of his little mannerisms and traits. He becomes Capote in such a way that you forget it is an actor on screen. The man on screen IS Truman Capote, and that is beautiful. The story is excellent and truthful. It isn't romanticized like it could have been. An excellent movie. Must-see.<br/><br/>10/10"

","The movie presents its story quite impressively, maintaining the balance of focus between the Truman Capote character and his masterpiece book In Cold Blood's making process. The earlier parts nicely emphasize on Truman as a character through his individual distinction. Although it's quite brief but it's quite constant repetition in subsequent parts made it very effective. The next parts nicely focus on the relationships Truman has, particularly with Perry in the writing of In Cold Blood. But I really like how the movie summarizes the story by depicting Truman's sad hypocrisy of denying to help Perry and Dick to find another lawyer yet at the same time lying to them saying he's trying his best. This movie really is one of the milestones of Philip Seymour Hoffman's acting career. By simply changing his voice and adding some new little habits to his mannerism he was able to shed his old characters' persona of ruthless men."

These frame equally visually arresting shots of domestic and prison interiors of the 1960s so well done that the scenes of the Clutter's murders still shock despite pervasive cinematic violence. Philip Seymour Hoffman's impeccable performance needs no superlatives, his impersonation's exactitude extends to how he holds a newspaper or a fork, only Charlize Theron's performance in ""Monster"" as Aileen Wuornos is its superior. The story of the development and writing of Capote's ""In Cold Blood"" derives the big screen treatment as it includes murder, execution, and most interestingly Capote's ruthlessness in working his relationship with Perry Smith, one of the murderers, into a confession. The story aptly captures the pain and sacrifice necessitated to create great literature. In short, well worth seeing."

","A film about Truman Capote writing his very last book. A rather slow but ultimately gripping interesting experience driven forward by the performance in its center, Philip Seymour Hoffman. His Oscar was well deserved. What a great actor he is he already showed in earlier films (that I also admired: Boogie Nights, Magnolia, 25th hour ...).<br/><br/>His presentation of the odd, egocentric, homosexual writer Truman Capote is absolutely amazing.<br/><br/>For a great story for his new book he would spare no efforts and also lie to everyone around him. His sources, his workmates, his friends and finally the one he is lying most to is himself.<br/><br/>Famous writer Capote's attention is caught by a murder of a family in a small town near Kansas (it was Kansas, wasn't it?). He wants to write an article about it but when he gets involved in the details of the crime after having talked to the local people and police he is so taken by the case that he decides to write a whole book. To be able to write a good book and to get rich details of the material he has to talk to the murderers themselves. As the investigations and trial move along Capote starts spending more and more time with one of them, Perry. He makes him believe they were friends to get all the information he needs for his book. He lies to him he would describe the murderer how he really is and even gets them a lawyer for their plea. But he is just exploiting them as he needs more time and info for the book. For sure he tells everyone how much he cares about the murderers. And when it comes to an end Capote has already realized that he has spent so much time and effort into his work and always suppressed his emotions. Witnessing the murderers execution he is shaken to the core, questioning his morals and the sense in all that. He would never write a book again.<br/><br/>The first part of this film feels really fresh. Capote still a very distanced character is quite entertaining to regard. <br/><br/>There is a bit of a slow down in the second quarter of the film but it goes by fast as we quickly move on into the more emotional part of the movie. All the relationships around Capote are interesting most important of course the one to the prisoner Perry. We get more and more involved and it's so great to see Capote being torn between his need for glamour and being in the center of attention and a successful writer, and his personal emotions. The performances is the key to keep the audience interested all the way through.<br/><br/>This is a small and fine film that looks good on the surface and delivers depth in its core. <br/><br/>As a biographical drama this is a film for mature audiences. People with low standards and demands for their movies might claim this is a boring flick due to the slow pace I can just say: You are not sufficiently evolved cause it's not!<br/><br/>Good film!"
"MBunge","7","0","0","23 September 2010"," Capote vs. Infamous
","Every so often, Hollywood produces two or more movies about the same subject at virtually the same time. Sometimes it seems like happenstance, sometimes it seems like ego and sometimes it's a lesser production trying to piggyback on the buzz and hype of a superior work. If we're lucky, one of them turns out okay. Very rarely do we get more than that. In the two movies made of Truman Capote and the writing of In Cold Blood, we got two very good films, though one is far better than the other.<br/><br/>In November of 1959, a well-to-do Kansas farmer, his wife and their son and daughter were brutally murdered in their own home. The crime was so sensational that it even merited a front page story in the New York Times. That's how the horrible deaths of the Clutter family came to the attention of Truman Capote. A novelist and screenwriter of some regard, Capote is more renowned for his presence in the New York City social scene. He was the sort of devilishly irreverent and sharply insightful fellow everyone loved to know or say they knew. Capote first thinks to do a magazine article for the New Yorker about the impact the Clutter murders have on small town Kansas life. But after journeying to Kansas with his best friend and fellow author Nelle Harper Lee, Capote finds something more than a magazine article. Particularly after he meets one of the murderers, the complex and conflicted Perry Smith, Capote seizes on the idea of using fictional storytelling techniques to tell the true story of the Clutter murders and their aftermath. He pours all of his heart and soul into the work, only to be tortured for years as he must wait for the execution of the killers before his has an ending for his masterpiece. But in producing one of the greatest American books of the 20th century, a novel that changed the way non-fiction stories are told, Capote appeared to destroy himself and never wrote another significant thing for the rest of his life.<br/><br/>Infamous is a greater effort of filmmaking than Capote and I'm now going to praise the former at the expense of the later, but I want to first mention that Capote is still a fine film and worth seeing. It's just not as good as Infamous.<br/><br/>Fundamentally, Infamous is the better written movie and it's not even close. I t has more well drawn and meaningful characters, tells the story in more detail and depth and provides a much clearer picture of what happened and why. Whether it was Capote and Lee's interactions with the Kansas natives, Capote's place in New York's literary circles, Capote's relationship with his lover Jack Dunphy or his affinity for the doomed Perry Smith the other killer, Dick Hickock, Infamous is more informative, engaging and dynamic.<br/><br/>That difference in quality extends to the performances, though that's a bit unfair to the folks in Capote. The cast of Infamous is given so much more to work with that it was almost inevitable they'd do a better job. The greatest example is the distinction between the main characters of these films. Toby Jones' Capote is flamboyant, mincing, gentile, driven and both charming and distant at the same time. Philip Seymour Hoffman's version gives a few glimpses of humor and wit, but is mostly quiet, solemn and overtly detached. They have the same odd and Southern-tinged voice, but these performances have very little else in common.<br/><br/>That contrast in the level of characterization extends to just about every part. In Infamous, we're presented with an interpersonal dynamic that tries to explain why the effeminate Capote could be in love with the more macho and straight-laced Jack Dunphy. In Capote, they're simply presented as a couple with no real explanation of why these two men would ever be together. In Infamous, Dick Hickock is given a few scenes to show the audience how shallow and uninteresting he is compared to the wounded and violent Perry Smith. In Capote, Hickock is barely in the film at all and therefore doesn't serve as a comparison to Perry or the Perry/Capote relationship.<br/><br/>Now, only the actual people involved in this story and those who knew them can testify to which version is more historically accurate and personally fair. But there's a line in Infamous that says In Cold Blood brought a kindness to Capote's writing that hadn't been there before. That sort of kindness is absent from Capote the film. It presents the writer as a fairly nasty piece of work who only summons up some regret and remorse at the moment of crisis. Infamous shows Capote as a basically decent person who, under immense personal and professional stress, behaved in unfortunate ways.<br/><br/>What ultimately distinguishes these two movies is that I think Infamous is trying to be entertaining while Capote is trying to be significant. Capote is dominated by quiet scenes of no action or dialog that are clearly intended to be meaningful and moving. And if you're a devotee of New York literary history and already know well the story of Truman Capote, you might be able to make those scenes meaningful and moving in your own mind. But even if you've never read In Cold Blood or heard of Truman Capote, you'd still find Infamous a delightful experience."

It's neither bad nor good, but thanks to the incredible performance form Hoffman and the surprising performance from Clifton Collins Jr., it's worth a view.

Well, to my surprise he does and it's so powerful and it's the one time during the film when you're 100% mesmerized. <br/><br/>The rest of the cast disappoints, including Oscar nominee Catherine Keener. I understand subtlety, but I also understand staring into the camera like you're bored out your mind.

In such themes there appears to be a romantic attraction to the perpetrator of a heinous crime. There I fail to understand why nobody has a romantic attraction to the victims. What is so different in this crime from other heinous crimes? Two young criminals enter a lonely house and try to steal and then massacred the whole family and were caught and convicted by the law of the land. May be they had disturbed childhood but every disturbed child do not become criminals in the end. Capote himself had disturbed childhood but became a celebrated author. Was this the reason for the sympathy with the perpetrators. Was the attraction for Capote to one of the perpetrators the latter’s handsomeness? Besides who is the manipulator? Was Smith trying to get into the good books of celebrated author to get good lawyers or was the author trying to get full story for his book? I am also reminded of the film “Dead Man walking”.

","I had rated Capote 8/10... until I saw Infamous. Had to come back and change it to 6/10. It is natural to compare the films. In fact its invited by implication due to their release dates and subject.<br/><br/>I don't think its harsh to challenge the cast portrayals, especially since we did have another film to compare it to. If one saw both films, what a chance to see a ""remake"", made at the same time? We got to see TWO CASTS, perform almost the same material. Maybe the timing of the releases wasn't so great on several levels, but hey - if they'd been released a couple of years apart, somebody would complain then too.<br/><br/>As for Hoffman, of whom I have always been a fan, I found his performance almost cardboard. Toby Jones, however, was electric. Hoffman's Capote was driven solely by his desire(s) - to change the way people wrote and read. There is tenderness for Smith, but it is only as a subject for his work. Showing interest and human compassion is not the same as tenderness, heavily handled (and handed) in Capote. And though Jones' Capote was similarly motivated, HIS Capote seems to actually evolve during the film. True, people don't always evolve in a story, or in real-life. But don't motives change as a situation evolves? Situations have to evolve or we get bored and stop watching - if they get made into films at all. Douglas McGrath's screenplay was also far superior.<br/><br/>To be nominated for an Oscar is a tremendous honor, but frankly I thought Hoffman's performance in Boogie Nights was more deserving of an Academy Award than Capote (and though not a great flick, check out his performance in Flawless, with DeNiro) - both nuanced AND deep ""...almost the same material"", but it wasn't the same material. Infamous was gritty and moving - when we hear the Clutter women screaming before the blasts, I thought, ""oh my god, all that screaming and then NOTHING."" Even though I knew the gunshots were coming, I actually started when I finally heard them. The reactions I had to Capote were simply ""gut"" - the reactions to Infamous were physical and mental. The word that keeps coming to me about Capote as a film is ""safe"". The acting, writing and directing.<br/><br/>I just ordered the book, ""In Cold Blood"" online and I have to read it. Because the stories in the films WERE the same. The difference, as always, is in the details. None of us will ever know how it truly played out, we only know what information was shared. Shared information can change during retelling.<br/><br/>Perry Smith was obviously a very troubled person. And like all of us, he wanted people to think he was smart. And he did try, harder than most it seems, to educate himself in some ways. Someone doesn't need to ""agree"" with a new knowledge or position in order to have their mind opened by something/someone - (re: his reaction to pornography, Capote's writing itself, etc...). But Collins turned him into something pathetic, rather than sympathetic. I'm dying to know if the ""baby food"" incident really happened. The scene progression in Capote said much about both Truman and Perry, if true.<br/><br/>I like Daniel Craig, and my problems seeing him as Smith in Infamous were purely physical and my own. But basically every other character was more real to me in Infamous than in Capote. Bullock generally leaves me cold, her Lee knew Truman and loved him anyway. Keener's seemed to tolerate and enable him. Chris Cooper is a gem and by far the best performance in Capote.<br/><br/>Truman Capote was and wasn't a caricature of himself. He was already different and memorable, so he made himself different and memorable. He obviously observed people and he got them to share infinitely intimate details with him by sharing some of his own first. The Truman Capote that we saw all those years ago on The Tonight Show (unfortunately, I'm too young to remember him from anywhere else) was represented in full color in Infamous.<br/><br/>He wasn't anywhere in Capote."

"Paul-271","7","0","0","6 May 2007"," A rather slow and quiet account
","As others have noted, this movie tends to bias toward the view of the killers rather than the killed which I find bothersome. I do not find killers of helpless families to be interesting or romantic. However, that's only part of the film and hardly the center of it.<br/><br/>The center is, in fact, the title character. The movie covers several years of Capote's life during which he wrote the book which did change many things in publishing. It made the author the most celebrated author in the US and maybe the world. However, what he had to go through to write the book as well as he did destroyed him utterly.<br/><br/>The movie chronicles the destruction of the killers, to some extent the killed and most completely, the author who lost his detachment entirely. It is a picture of an artist, Capote, who sacrificed himself for his art. The art work is great, but it took everything from the artist to create it.<br/><br/>My problems with the movie remain mostly directorial. We are often treated to jump mood shots supposed to convey the barrenness of the Kansas USA scenery where the crime took place, but the movie short shrifts how that barrenness played with the people of the area who were affected by the crime. Instead, we're shown seemingly hours of what in reflection, is unrelated Capote verbiage with his companion or with others in the town or prison.<br/><br/>Thus the two most affected by the crime, the dead family and the townspeople are ignored in favor of us 'learning about' the criminals and Capote's love life.<br/><br/>However, the worst complaint I have about this movie is simple: it's mostly inaudible. This is by far the worst sound I've heard in a modern movie. Capote as a man spoke in a mumbly high lisp which the player does well, but it's frustrating to miss at least 30% of what he says. Ditto the other characters because the director has chosen a documentary hand held camera look to the movie.<br/><br/>The sound isn't any better than you'd get with a Super 8 home movie camera crippled by a $3 mic and in a windstorm. That may be the intent of the director, but it means that the movie which is 70% script and 30% performances loses much of the script.<br/><br/>Very much worth a viewing or two, but clean your ears well before and pump up the volume."

","The name of this film is slightly misleading, in that it suggests an entire life when in fact it is limited to one arc in that life. An important arc, no doubt, and while this powerful and beautifully acted movie gives us an unusually deep experience of that arc, it isn't the story of Capote's life, and so perhaps some other title might be more appropriate, though I don't have any suggestions. It begins with the author's first interest in the Kansas murders of the Clutter family and ends with the completion of the book after the hanging of the killers. So it's a movie about Capote researching and writing In Cold Blood, and this would seem almost superfluous, since the book itself documents the making of the book, except that the portrayal of Capote is so subtle and nuanced. Credit for this must go to Philip Seymour Hoffman in the title role. Hoffman assumes the stance, the voice, the look of his original, and while Capote's thin, affected voice and mannerisms might lend themselves to caricature in a lesser actor, Hoffman uses them as a bridge to Capote's sporadic humanity. Capote's instinct that the Clutter murders would make a good story is borne out; with the help of Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), he gets what he needs from the community, reluctant though they are to deal with somebody of that sort. Especially notable among the townsfolk is Chris Cooper as Alvin Dewey, the detective whose face registers the pain the killings cause him. The acting throughout is superb; indeed, this is one of the best-cast movies I can remember. The killers are like day and night, the shallower, genial Dick Hickock (Mark Pellegrino) and the dark, sensitive, tormented one, Perry Smith (Clifton Collins, Jr.). A bond between Smith and Capote develops, each masking his sense of his own power to manipulate the other, and yet each feeling the connection of mutual experience as outsiders. Capote needs Smith to tell what happened that night, and he resists until practically the eleventh hour. It comes as something of a surprise that he initiated and carried out the killings in a few seconds of rage while ""Ricardo"" just watched, stunned. Capote has his book, but he must also pay for his connection to Smithhe attends the execution, at Perry Smith's request. At the end of the film one senses the terrible burden of achieving closeness with a condemned man and his crimes, something the film-makers emphasize with the after-titles that say Capote never finished another book. The movie pushes us into the same corner into which Capote found himself pushedwe are torn between wanting to like the killer and our dread of his act. Capote tells Smith he needs to know everything for his book; otherwise, Smith will go down in history as a monster. Smith's story explains everything, the bitterness of abandonment as a child, the hard life he lived, and the sudden rage at a world in which a good man like Mr. Clutter would be afraid of him. Telling Capote about the killings hurts all over again, because the sense of being pushed out of the good world was not allayed by the murders, nor is Smith's pain lessened by confession. So Capote wasn't telling him the truthlying to Smith seems to be something he does easilyfor he portrays Perry Smith as a damaged man, deeply wounded by life. These factors do not extenuate the crime. Smith is still a monster."

Having never seen Harper Lee, I don't know if Keener succeeded, but I like what she presented. This one's all about Capote, anyhow. Phillip Seymor Hoffman has created lots of great roles, but this is the one that brought him to a larger audience. The story is not about the murders he studied. The story is about Capote  the egocentric, manipulative, self-deluding character who uses others and lies as long as he needs. It's a very dark story in the first place, and to then focus on someone who can only be considered a vulture who knows how to write, makes it all the more uncomfortable. You end up feeling grateful you weren't acquainted with the killers OR Capote. Top notch character study. We saw it twice this year."

","Alright, unless you've been orbiting earth in the space-station, you'll be aware of Philip Seymour Hoffman's multi-award winning performance as Truman Capote. And this film is worth seeing for this performance alone, even if it had nothing else to offer you.<br/><br/>But it does have more to offer - a lot more, in fact.<br/><br/>Let's get Hoffman's performance out of the way first, though. Not to dismiss it, but to laud it because it is the most significant factor of the film. Of course, I've never met Capote, and never seen him in the media, at least not that I recall. Hoffman creates a multi-faceted character - at times sweet and endearing, at times cold, calculating (even ruthless), and always ""theatrically flamboyant"" if you catch my drift. Hoffman portrays Capote's foray into regional Kansas, where you could safely assume they had never seen anyone quite like him, with bravery, humour and courage all rolled into one effete identity. Truly outstanding. If Capote was indeed like this, what an interesting personality he must have been.<br/><br/>The guts of the film revolves around Capote's desire to re-establish himself as America's foremost novelist. It seems there was a significant drought following ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", and his creative juices are set flowing when he reads of a multiple homicide in Kansas. His idea is to create a factual novel woven around this horror, and he recognises that if he does it well enough, it will be an icon of literature. He has confidence that he is the writer to do just that.<br/><br/>The significance of the title of the resultant book, ""In Cold Blood"" is cleverly presented to the viewer as not only the original crime, but also Capote's naked ambition to use the jailed murderers to his own ends.<br/><br/>The other actors in this quality film shouldn't be overlooked, even though Hoffman is in almost every scene. Chris Cooper is great as a weary law enforcement officer trying desperately to arrest the killers of his small-town neighbours and friends. Catherine Keener plays the soon-to-be-famous author Harper Lee with refreshing candour and the inquisitiveness one would expect of the character. And watch out for Clifton Collins Jr as Perry Smith, one of the captured murderers, and the one from whom Capote draws much of the information about the terrible events at the lonely farmhouse. Collins presents the character in almost overwhelming sadness, together with a chilling, bitter side.<br/><br/>The director, Bennett Miller has done a creditable job of weaving this tale together, and the cinematography easily copes with the lonely murder scene, the depressing jail environment, as well as Capote's social scene in New York City.<br/><br/>This movie isn't for the faint-hearted, however those who choose to view it will be rewarded with several excellent performances (including Hoffman's superlative portrayal of Capote) and a rich and compelling story line.

","I'm writing this review a little late, being as I saw it in January 06. However, the upcoming release of semi-sister movie Infamous has made me decide to finally review this masterpiece.<br/><br/>I went into the theater thinking it would be a bore fest, my sister dragging me in, and I was extremely surprised at what I saw. It is one of the best movies I have seen, and ranks very high on my list of favorites.<br/><br/>The number one reason is Philip Seymour Hoffman. I cannot praise this man enough. He portrays Capote so wonderfully, as a man who is battling between his work and his status and what is morally correct. He is someone we both love and hate, and in the end can't blame for any of his flaws. This is by far Hoffman's best work to date. I always liked Hoffman before, particularly for his role in Cold Mountain, but this is the movie that put him up in my favorites. It is worth seeing the movie if only for his performance alone.<br/><br/>The other part of this movie that truly captivated me was the relationship between Capote and Smith. They represent different sides of the same coin, as Capote points out, as if they, ""...grew up in the same house. I went out the front door and he went out the back."" They seem to be like brothers, and other times like good friends, sometimes Capote plays something of a father figure to Smith. But it doesn't seem as if their relationship is just that, it also has a romantic tension underneath the surface, it is so great even a homophobic person will find themselves feeling so sorry for the characters. <br/><br/>Their goodbye scene is so heart wrenching I was in tears. It shows the true nature of their relationship. It seems Perry always took it for what it was, that it would eventually end, and Capote was more emotionally attached than he cared to admit. Through the whole movie you are confused as to what exactly it was that bonded them, and what made their relationship so powerful, and you realize the characters are just as confused as you.<br/><br/>When the movie ended and the credits began to roll, no one in the packed theater said a word, and no one got up until the credits were over. Everyone was too stunned by it to even clap, and I can say I have never seen that happen in any movie ever before.<br/><br/>This is an amazing movie and it deserved every single nomination it got. I absolutely loved it, and I feel it will be one of those movies that will be remembered years from now. It is not good if you are in a dark mood (but perhaps better for some people?), but if you are in the mood for a good drama, a good tragedy, and even somewhat of a good tragic romance, then this is a wonderful movie to watch. To those of you who are expecting something boring, you will be pleasantly surprised."

","""Capote"" (2005) is an inspiring film. Directed masterfully by Bennett Miller, it tells of the story of Truman Capote (played expertly by Philip Seymour Hoffman in an Oscar-winning performance) as he develops a close relationship with a killer who would inspire his famous novel ""In Cold Blood"". Also inspirational in performance is Catherine Keener as ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" novelist Harper Lee and their ""relationship"" together. The story and script are also top-notch (which also earned an Oscar-nomination for the writer Dan Futterman ) as well as the subtle score Mychael Danna. This is truly a must-see film if only to see Hoffman tackle the complex character of Capote. A 9 out of 10."

","I don't often watch movies twice. But this one is a cert. I wouldn't think it would suit everyone's sense of entertainment per say. But a artistically speaking I feel this is a thinking person's movie. <br/><br/>Hoffman was brilliant and so were the other actors, I think that was the key for it's success. <br/><br/>I really couldn't fault it - and I think what kept me so fascinated was Hoffman's acting. At the end of the DVD they had footage of Truman and particularly his voice - he did do a good job. The script was good too, when the portrayal that Truman was sensitive to Perry's detachment. He had led an abused child hood, and when Truman handed the picture he had of him and his sister, and said to him, 'Your sister misses you?"" (when one got the impression she didn't) I sensed that was a great humanitarian thing to do to a convicted killer. And a softness rather than defensiveness entered Perry's eyes. Yes, good movie.<br/><br/>Only drawback was I had difficulty in the beginning understanding some of what Hoffman said, but soon got in tune with the unusual diction."

","Capote is astonishing in the depths it dives. Truman Capote's motives and feelings are laid bare before us and we find ourselves sympathizing with him even while we are disgusted by him. The success of this movie is that it is brutally honest and yet at the end we still love Capote.<br/><br/>Part of that is due to the brilliant performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman. As Truman Capote travels to Kansas to write an article about how the random murders of a well-respected family are affecting the community, Hoffman does not show us how Capote changes. Hoffman changes. He goes from objective outsider to involved insider and Hoffman makes the change flawlessly- you don't even notice the change, you're so engrossed in the character.<br/><br/>Hoffman is not the only good thing about this movie, but he is definitely the best. The writing is good, though strangely distant and shallow at times. But that's only sometimes- the way the screenplay takes its time digging deeper is wonderful. That combined with the performances and the directing creates a very good movie."

","In the years between 1960 and 1965, author Truman Capote (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) formed an unlikely friendship with Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.), a killer on death row accused of murdering a family of four in Kansas. His conversations with Perry and research into the murders would form the basis of his greatest literary work, ""In Cold Blood."" <br/><br/>Capote is a terrific film that succeeds on every level. It was difficult to watch at times but it was still an emotionally engaging experience. Capote himself was an interesting person even if he did act a bit pretentious. In the film, he did have a few annoying moments like when he said ""I have 94 percent recall of all conversation. I tested it myself."" That line sounded like he was bragging and he was very much in love with himself, as other characters pointed out. At the same time, I felt sorry for him when he was talking about his childhood since people would make fun of him. He said, ""Ever since I was a child, folks have thought they had me pegged, because of the way I am, the way I talk. And they're always wrong."" As an adult though, he got the respect of most people. I think Philip Seymour Hoffman did a fantastic job as Capote and he deserved the Oscar. Some people called his performance an imitation but I think he did more than just talk like him. He actually became Capote.<br/><br/>The main thing the film focused on was the relationship between Capote and Perry. At first, it was hard to tell if Capote was just using him for his book or if he actually cared for him. As they continued to meet, a friendship developed and Capote was looking past his book. He didn't want to portray Perry as a monster despite his crimes. He actually wanted to portray Perry correctly. The scenes between Capote and Perry were interesting to watch and they were done very well. The ending was particularly memorable and I think it was the best scene. I have to give credit to Clifton Collins Jr since he gave a very good performance as Perry. It was a shame that he wasn't nominated. I also have to give credit to director Bennett Miller because he managed to capture Capote's research and relationships pretty well.<br/><br/>There were a few other people in Capote's life that were portrayed in the film. Harper Lee accompanied Truman to Kansas to help him with his research. Their relationship together was nice to watch but I think Catherine Keener should have gotten more screen time. Her performance was fine but it wasn't really Oscar worthy. I don't think there was enough of the character to really warrant a nomination. Alvin Dewey was portrayed by Chris Cooper and he did a decent job, nothing special though. Jack Dunphy was Capote's boyfriend and he was portrayed by Bruce Greenwood, who did a decent job. I didn't really find this relationship very interesting. Their conversations were kind of dull but Greenwood didn't get a lot of screen time so it didn't hurt the quality of the film. In the end, Capote is an excellent film and it's worth checking out. Rating 10/10"
"parmstro","10","0","0","25 August 2006"," Restrained excellence
","What a great movie! Story, acting, cinematography, music, direction and an intentionally deliberate pace come together to make far and away the best film I saw in 2005. One gets the feeling that everybody involved in Capote succeeded in making exactly the film they set out to... there is no sense of compromise, no striving for flash or excess, no need to hype anything...the story, stunningly calmly told, simply works.<br/><br/>Truman Capote, not a particularly sympathetic character, is not sympathetically portrayed. Philip Hoffman's astounding recreation of him is fascinating -- prickly and suave, Truman advances and retreats, and spirals slowly down, all the while creating an enduring masterpiece of writing, In Cold Blood. The vulnerable Capote's immersion in the aftermath of this awful crime ultimately claims him as another victim, the movie convinces us. And that's it. A simple concept, intricately told, and expertly realized.<br/><br/>Truman Capote's personal ostentation and fall is, ironically enough, captured in a film that has no ostentation itself. The movie Capote never falls below restrained excellence."

","In November 1959, Truman Capote, celebrated writer and literary personality, read about a family who had been slaughtered on their farm in Kansas. He sensed a story and went to witness how the small, conservative town was coping with these brutal killings. The resulting non-fiction novel, In Cold Blood, made Truman Capote one of the most famous writers in the world. He believed that this was the book that he was always meant to write. But though it was his greatest success and the piece of work he was most proud of, it also wrecked his life and heralded his downfall.<br/><br/>The most surprising thing about Capote (the movie) is all the things it is not. It is not a biography of Truman Capote's life, or even an exposition of his extraordinary talent and extraordinary personality. It is also not a detailed investigation into the killers, the murders or the townspeople. Instead, it is the most powerful depiction of a man at his best and his worst.<br/><br/>In researching and writing In Cold Blood, Truman Capote was presented with an irresistible opportunity to gain more prestige, respect and praise than he had received for any of his previous work. And Capote was desperate for praise, going to any lengths to achieve it. It is through his relationships, behaviour, lies and motivations over these five years in his life that the film reveals the most about the man. Much more incisively than a cradle to grave biography could have done.<br/><br/>An entertainer, Truman is shown to be witty, manipulative, preening and posturing, while often completely insensitive and selfish. But it is in the friendship that he fostered with one of the killers, Perry Smith, that Truman is most exposed. Both endured lonely childhoods, were sensitive artists and shameless liars, and both were selfishly dependent on each other. The irony is that in order for Truman to get what he wanted (an end for his book), his friend must die.<br/><br/>The DVD extras include original footage of Truman Capote that demonstrates why Philip Seymour Hoffman deserved that Oscar."

","Truman Capote was an egotistical jerk who basked in his fame and high-level intelligence... but you gotta hand it to him - no matter how much of a deceiving diva he was, he was intelligent (94% recall of conversation?!?) and ahead of his time. Capote follows the self-proclaimed author of the first ""nonfiction novel,"" In Cold Blood, through the making of his most famous work. He continuously pokes and prods one of two men convicted of murdering a family for information for what he knows will be the work he's remembered for, all the while lying to him about the progress of the book. While the accused Perry Smith's alibi comes in at a close second, my favorite scene is Capote's final meeting with his inspirations; at once, he fully realizes at what cost his book will be finished. You don't want to feel sorry for him, but it's hard not to. There is some strong acting going on from Catherine Keener and (needless to say) this year's well-deserved Best Actor Oscar-winner Philip Seymour Hoffman, but my favorite performance comes from Clifton Collins, Jr. as Perry Smith in a breakthrough showcase. Everything in Capote may not be 100% true, but it was still the best movie up for Best Picture at the Oscars."

","Capote (2005) is not a coming-of-success story dealing with the birth of an author like most bio-pics do -- but it zooms in on the American writer Truman Capote at the height of his career, when he is researching and documenting the Kansas Cutter murders for his much heralded book ""In Cold Blood"". This is a patient, careful film in which good performances are thankfully abundant and facilitate an already well-crafted screenplay.<br/><br/>Although it is always compelling, Capote has, like most films, its more powerful scenes and its thinner scenes. It has its ups and downs, and often manages emotional. Similarly, so does Truman. There are many scenes in which you like him for his rhetoric, intellect and humour and other parts you find him quite morally distasteful, as when he makes it clear to the killer he is interviewing that he is not his friend as he had lead him to believe, but he is merely doing his job and his using his friendship to get information from him. In this sense, director Bennett Miller is bravely objective and does not shy away from a balanced portrayal.<br/><br/>Need more good aspects? I was never once distracted by the portrayal of the era (1950s-1960s); my eyes never wandered from the actors to the costumes or setting as they are firmly placed in the backseat to make way for a dynamic cast. Clifton Collins Jr. deserves special credit here for his role as the Kansas Cutter murderer -- he acts with such conviction that his presence is felt in scenes he is not even in. <br/><br/>Need some negative aspects? There really aren't any -- ultimately, Capote (2005) simply lacks the 'oomph' to be a 9-10/10.<br/><br/>8/10"

So, after a couple of weeks on DVD I finally (as usual) caught it. This is of course, Philip Seymour Hoffman's nom de plume performance as the author Truman Capote as he researches for 'In Cold Blood'. (now, that's a book I should read). I was actually tremendously surprised at the depth of Mr. Hoffman's performance. When I first started watching it, it occurred to me that I had never actually seen a trailer for the movie, as I was stunned at the depths of Mr. Hoffman's performance. First the VOICE, wow. Since I've followed Mr Hoffman's career quite closely, I was more than a little surprised at it. He NAILS it down. He also nails Capote's nuances, especially the hand gestures.

","For the film Capote director Bennett Miller, along with his cast and crew traveled back to the late 1950s and early 1960s to shoot their film. Somber lighting, empty fields of farmland and poignant color conveys an assortment of moods throughout the film, from impending death, to the infectious laughter of a high society party scene.<br/><br/>Cast and Crew are in top shape; it is a rare treat to find such rich performances from both principal and secondary actors. It is not only an era that is captured on screen but the personalities of the characters within the frame. Especially important in films depicting actual historical figures.<br/><br/>Never condescending or judgmental the filmmakers offer a rare and intelligent discourse concerning the relationship between writer and subject. The score is used to conjure a specific mood, and though the same solemn piano score has been used to the same effect in other films, the restraint of the director and others involved prevent the film from indulging in any kind of sentimentality or forcing the audience to feel something that is not present."

","Capote/2005/***<br/><br/>Main Stars: Philip Seymour Hoffman Catherine Keener Clifton Collins Jr. Bruce Greenwood<br/><br/>Ahh, there's nothing like a good slow-moving film that teaches you a moral. Capote was one of them. It was not EXCELLENT like some critics thought and neither was Lost in Translation, which so many critics RAVED about. They were both good, slow-moving films. Truman Capote (Philip Seymour Hoffman), the pompous, high-pitched, little twerp, who is famous for writing articles in the New Yorker, now wants to write a book on a tragic event that happened in a family one day in 1959. The tragic event was the gruesome death of a family of four in Holcomb, Kansas. Harper Lee (Catherine Keener) is Capote's ""partner in crime"" for this story. What makes Truman so obliged to create a book based on the tragic family event is when he digs deeper into the story and wants his audience to know about it in much detail. The book he writes based on the event is called In Cold Blood, which was also made into a movie. It is an attractive title and sure did attract a big audience. But before the book was finished, Truman felt a need to help the man who committed the murder. This man, named Perry Smith (played by Clifton Collins Jr.), had a troublesome life and Truman had pity for the man. Yes it's kind of hard to see Truman Capote show love and compassion for a man UNDER him yet he did and really TRIED to help him out but didn't exactly succeed. So yes Truman has a soft side to him as he does for his ""partner"". No not Harper Lee but is other ""partner"" and Capote's lisp and high-pitched voice might convince you that he's a bit on the swishy side so his ""guy partner"" is Jack Dunphy (Bruce Greenwood). I have to admit Truman Capote may be a snob but he sure has or had an interesting life in which he was also a bit troubled so he can kind of easily relate to Perry's life a bit. I also have to admit that Philip Seymour Hoffman does an excellent job portraying him. He does not as much imitate him as channel him. It actually seemed you were looking at the REAL Truman Capote on screen, which is obviously impossible because he died in 1984 from supreme alcoholic problems. And no I did not know that myself. I just saw the footnote at the end of the film that described that. It also described that after In Cold Blood, Truman Capote never wrote another book again. This is the last line from the book In Cold Blood: ""More tears are shed over answered prayers than unanswered ones."" I guess it makes sense because answered prayers do remain with you and are most likely more important than unanswered prayers. God will always hear your prayers and definitely grant the important ones that will remain with you forever over the trivial ones that will probably soon vanish or fade away from your thoughts, that is if you have too much on your mind.

","It's 1959, and an eccentric author/journalist Truman Capote has just seen the story in the paper about the Clutter killings in Kansas.

Over the course of the film, he begins to develop a close relationship with one of the murderers, Perry Smith.<br/><br/>I suppose that this movie falls into the category of beautiful. The acting is absolutely outstanding; the Oscar for best actor (Philip Seymour Hoffman) was given to the right person. While Hoffman's performance as Capote was excellent, I believe that there is another man who should be recognised; Clifton Collins Jr. Rarely have I seen such good, and believable acting. I also think that he should have won an Oscar, but, sadly, everything can't work out for every being on this earth.<br/><br/>So, as a summary, this film was definitely one of the best films of the year.

I don't know why but I've been watching a lot of Philip Seymour Hoffman movies lately and noticing him in films I didn't realize he was in before (i.e. Twister). I was expecting a biography of Truman Capote's life from birth to death, but this one pretty much focuses on what he went through to author ""In Cold Blood."" Even though it's not as biographical as I assumed it would be, I learned a lot about Capote just by watching this picture.<br/><br/>I know it's no longer in theaters; So, I suggest that you rent it if you're ever in the mood for something a little depressing."

","When Gerlad Clarke was writing Truman Capote's biography, the latter told him ""I won't respect you unless you tell the whole truth"". And in Capote, the biographer, scriptwriter and director have tried to do exactly that. The movie spans five years of the author's life, when he was writing his book, In Cold Blood, about the murder of an affluent Kansas family in 1961. The book probably made him the most famous writer in the US.<br/><br/>The investigation into the murder takes a backseat to a thorough examination of Capote's character. Was he a parasitic writer who would do anything to get his story or was he striving for a higher cause? Did ""In Cold Blood"" refer to the murder or to the writer's actions? After each scene, you find yourself changing your mind either way. Capote makes you believe that whatever he was doing had to be done for a reason that will be revealed later. Though it is never revealed, the actions cannot be condemned.<br/><br/>The movie is superbly written, giving not three, but four dimensions to Truman Capote, who was played fabulously by Hoffman. It's a must see."

","After a brutal murder of a Kansas City family, Truman Capote (Phillip Seymour Hoffman Empire Falls) a writer for the New Yorker begins doing research for his book In Cold Blood. He plans on researching on the small town's reaction to the murders that have just recently occurred. He is help by his friend Nelle Harper Lee (Catherine Keener, The 40 Year Old Virgin) and is guided through the town by F.B.I. agent and friend to the victims Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper, Seabiscuit). Here Capote visits Perry Edward Smith (Clifton Collins Jr., Life of the Party) and begins to realize that they have similarities between each other. With the same troubling family background that Capote and Smith have, they begin to have a relationship with each other. Capote is then trying to write his next book about the murders, trying to get all the information that he needs from Smith while trying to delay his death sentence as long as possible. This film was great because it gives the image to the killers that they are sorry for what they have done to the Kansas City Family and are trying to find forgiveness for their actions, although they aren't going to receive any sympathy from anyone besides Capote. This leaves the question of whether or not the death sentence is the right form of punishment for one's actions. And to have the notion that Capote was a homosexual left me thinking was he attracted to Perry Smith or was he just sympathetic to him? Phillip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote is everything that the Academy should be looking for in the 'best actor in a leading role category.' I've always been a fan of Hoffman, regardless of what he has been in, so seeing him play this role was far from disappointing to me. The way that the film was shown in a shade of gray was the most visual part of the film and definitely left me feeling empty. Maybe that's what Capote was feeling through this whole time. Either way, it was a great film that left questioning afterwards up to the audience, in which can lead to several theoretical discussions."

That mood is duplicated at the bottom part of the film, the execution. Great cinematography. Great performance to by Clifton Collins, Jr. as one of the cold-blooded killers.

Catherine Keener was great as Harper Lee and Clifton Collins as Perry Smith. Actually Clifton Collins' portrayal was a bit too sympathetic for me.

","What makes Capote stand out - especially - isn't anything else but one of the deepest conflicts of man, that between heart and mind. You may wonder ""why?"", considering that the battles of heart and mind have been fought so often in the pragmatic world of art. The secret lies in the performance.<br/><br/>P.S. Hoffman is more than astonishing. Capote isn't just a self indulging narcissist, or a heartless manipulator, or a brilliant writer, or the child forsaken by his mother. He is all these and much more and therefore stands for every man and woman that goes beyond himself or herself. The parallel between Capote and Perry, artist and murderer, is simply amazing and points out that we are a complex set of circumstances defined by moment and chance.<br/><br/>Sacrificing oneself, one's passions, one's beliefs for art (or for any other equivalent notion)...by doing all this, Capote ruins himself. We are left contemplating the question, eternal and redundant: is it worth it? My guess, it may well be."

Chris Cooper is becoming one of my favorite actors, I like him more and more with every movie. The Oscar for Hoffmann is well deserved and I thought that he gives an accurate portrayal of the somewhat snobby Capote who despises most of the people because he is smarter than they are or because they are less literate than he is. The distance of Capote towards the two killers and his up close and personal relationship with Perry Smith towards the end of the movie come across very well. Once again, good movie, go and see it!"

","If you are a fan of Philip Seymour Hoffman you will not recognize him here. He easily melds away into the role of Truman Capote and it's completely understandable why he was recognized with an Oscar for this role. The year before, Jamie Foxx did the bio role to much acclaim, but frankly, we could see Mr Foxx in that role (or at least I could). As Truman Capote, Mr. Hoffman completely strips away any veneer that we have associated with his previously understated, yet scene stealing and compelling, characters. During this movie, he is front and center and never lets us stop watching this compelling downfall. I actually had pity for this character, and believe me, if you watch the movie, you will understand where I'm coming from.<br/><br/>The reason I felt compelled to write is just because, although Mr Hoffman always seems to find those understated supporting roles, which he makes so personable and individual you can't help but see a small part of him in every role, somehow, in this feature, he comes through as a driving force and starring role that you can't stop looking at him or thinking about his thoughts.. <br/><br/>Anybody else, it would have been a Brokeback rehash. Please please please see this movie. It will move you, awe you, and yes disturb you. Whether it's true or not, only Mr Capote knows."

I have to say, that is what you will walk away from most from this film. Hoffman's performance is immaculate.

","I am glad that this movie did not win Best Picture from the Academy. This is certainly not because of the acting, which was incredible, nor the settings which were very believable, nor the storyline which was intensely captivating. I simply believe that Crash was a better movie.<br/><br/>Not to put this movie down in any way. I am only 15 and have not read In Cold Blood, the book the main character, Truman Capote, was doing research for in the movie, although it is now at the top of my list. However, I found this movie moving (no pun intended) and fascinating. I don't think I have ever seen the likes of Philip Seymour Hoffman. He was simply breathtaking in this role. When the movie was over I found myself shocked that it wasn't Truman Capote himself in the role.<br/><br/>I thought the only flaw in the movie was the pace. It seemed a little slow-moving. There were many unnecessary silences without which the movie could have been shorter. Maybe I only saw the movie as slow because I am an impatient teenager. This is highly possible.<br/><br/>I would recommend Capote to anyone over the age of 13 who enjoys books and is willing to open their mind a little. I say this because Truman Capote was a flamboyantly gay man. Without an open mind or acceptance of the gay/lesbian community, one could not possibly enjoy this movie or receive the full impact of Mr. Hoffman's acting.<br/><br/>Overall, I found this movie to be one of the most intriguing I have ever seen."

","Two men kill a family of four on a Kansas night and this compels Truman Capote to write a novel about it.<br/><br/>I used to see Truman Capote on the talk shows in those years I stayed up late. It was difficult, at times, to understand him then and watching the DVD now it was still difficult to understand him or the character playing him. But, armed with the power of a Remote I can rewind many times and sometimes I was able to understand what he said. At other times, I said ""forget it "" when I still couldn't get a handle on what was said. Is this a tribute to Hoffman who played him? Probably. The one thing I do remember from those late night talk shows is that, at times, he was funny. Well, when I could understand what he said, that is. No, I am not being critical here. This is the way it was.<br/><br/>Capote is obsessed with only three things: 1) why did the two men kill a family of four in Kansas that night. 2) when he would get the ending for his novel: 3) with himself, of course.<br/><br/>His researcher is cousin or childhood friend (I have heard both) Nell Harper Lee who wrote To Kill a Mockingbird. In this movie she does finish her book and the movie is made and Capote has no joy for her as this is the time he desperately needs an ending to his book and he cannot get it and can think of nothing else. <br/><br/>From what I remember of those talk shows when Capote was on, Mr. Hoffman nails the character perfectly. See, watching TV does educate.<br/><br/>Only two men deserved the Best Actor Award, David Strathairn (for Edward R. Murrow) and Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Both nailed their character, but Hoffman walked away with the Oscar.<br/><br/>Good acting performances all around, but the story is in the details and in the telling. Very compelling."

","I watched this movie last night and find that I'm still processing what I saw. Current accolades aside, I firmly believe this film will go down in history as perhaps the best biopic of all time.<br/><br/>***spoilers** The movie traces the four-five years that Capote spent writing ""In Cold Blood,"" and how writing his most important creation also served to be his undoing.<br/><br/>Capote, the toast of literary writing circles after his first few novels are published, decides to write about the murder of the Clutter family in Kansas. Manipulating his way into unrestricted access to all sides of the crime, the victims, the killers, the investigators and the ""collateral damage (the family and friends of both victims and killers),"" he goes about writing the masterpiece that will not only change him, but will invent an entire new genre of writing: the true crime novel. In doing so, he paves the way for such modern writers as Ann Rule and other similar authors.<br/><br/>However, unlike most other true crime writers, who generally begin their careers in law enforcement and are trained to deal with the emotional impact of their work, Capote comes to this work wholly unprepared for the impact it will have on his psyche. The proof of his gift as a writer is evidenced by the fact that he finished the work at all.<br/><br/>While Capote is a master manipulator, he is also an extremely caring person. As he is drawn deeper into the facts of the crime, and the lives of the people affected by it, he is also drawn into caring about all of persons about whom he writes, especially Perry Smith, with whom he shares a certain commonality of background. While he is repulsed by what Smith and Hickock have done, he is also digging for an answer as to ""why?""<br/><br/>Phillip Seymour Hoffman's brilliant and nuanced portrayal of Capote carries the film, which is supported by a superb screenplay, supporting actors and cinematography; all of which combine to document the story of a brilliant writer who was destroyed by his groundbreaking masterpiece.<br/><br/>10/10"
"vmkladylazarus","7","0","0","25 March 2006"," Capote: In Cold Blood
","Imitation and mimicry is honed to a fine art in Capote, but does that really stand up to the art of creative invention when all you have to go on for character study is an author's work of fiction? Considering the competition Phillip Seymour Hoffman was up against in this year's Oscars, I wonder if his shoe-in for best impersonation was totally fair. The Academy does like it's celebrity imitators: Joaquin Pheonix nodded for his role as Johnny Cash, David Straitharn as Ed Murrow, Russell Crowe as Jim Braddock. Academy Award notwithstanding, Hoffman did give a tremendous performance, however much he was helped along by the Capote archives. <br/><br/>The story revolves around famous eccentric author Truman Capote and the execution (perhaps even on two counts here) of his last book, In Cold Blood. Capote was inspired by a horrific farm family murder in the sleepy town of Hocombe, Kansas to come and gather research. One of the pair of convicted killers, Perry Smith, has a sensitive side, and effectively manipulates Capote (himself a master manipulator) into forming a complex friendship. Capote says at one point 'it was like they grew up in the same house, and he went out the front door while Perry went out the back'. They had both been abandoned and abused as children, but made different choices about how they let it affect them. Truman Capote turned his demons inward and spun out stories with a close observation of people and their daily tragedies. Perry Smith took hostage an entire family and savagely murdered them for less than fifty dollars. <br/><br/>Capote offers help with the killers' appeals with the intent of drawing out his story, but ultimately, does not want to save them. It's a quandary he deals with by resorting to a fierce alcoholism. <br/><br/>The film has a great attention to period details, with the 1950's fashions and swanky black tie book parties, but I was left oddly cold by the story. I failed to really empathise with Perry, especially after he finally divulges the events of that gristly night, where he was completely in control and slashed the throat of the 'kind gentleman who was scared of him.'<br/><br/>The climactic moments of the film came close to being maudlin to me, and seemed to tread very familiar ground. Capote is well worth your patience for a glimpse into the psyche of a ruined man, and for fine performances from all the leads, but it didn't move me. It almost seemed too quietly measured, too calculatingly paced, that when the big moment came it fell suddenly short somehow.<br/><br/>Summary: A familiar story of complex relationships which is part crime investigation, part character drama and will appeal to fans of Truman Capote and Mockingbird author Harper Lee."

","It would be more memorable if its author wouldn't have been so arrogant and smug about his own writing. ""In Cold Blood"" was a detour in his storytelling, one which dealt into the darker side of humankind and fictionalized the true story of a small-town Kansan murder. It became a critical success, spawned a movie and series of the same name and made sure that people knew who Truman Capote was.<br/><br/>Its creation is the basis of first-time director Bennett Miller, who begins the movie with the murders themselves, and then shifts into introducing Truman Capote in a series of scenes -- a social gathering in which he talks of a friend of his wanting to write a homosexual love story between a white Jew and a black man; Harper Lee's cute denunciation that the comment made by the assistant conductor on the way back home was a practiced criticism which Capote himself paid for; his own assertion of himself in the eye of others. Capote in learning of this murder is somehow drawn to it and has decided to write about it: it would make great fiction, he tells his editor, William Shawn.<br/><br/>Off he sets to Kansas where while his mannerisms shock the locals, they don't stop him from getting assistance from the Kansas Bureau of Investigation agent in charge Alvin Dewey who has him come face to face with the killers, Richard Hickcock, and the one whom he becomes strangle attached to, Perry Smith. Here is where the film brings out the manipulative side of Capote. His relationship with Smith becomes an odd mixture of equal parts investigation, fascination, and exploitation. He isn't above telling Smith lies about the progress of his book, it seems, because like a schoolgirl, he seeks Smith out for everything but sex itself. The book, it seems, takes so long to come to fruition because ending it would mean ending his association with Smith and he doesn't want that. Even though there is a clear expiration date on their friendship.<br/><br/>Making a film about someone not just unsympathetic but with an affected, weak speech that could invite for immediate strangulation to end the pain is a tricky thing because either the person in question gets romanticized to some degree or it becomes unwatchable. Since Phillip Seymour Hoffman is on screen in almost every scene and he has to carry the entire movie on his shoulders, his performance has to modulate itself so it won't alienate the viewer and it does so. He makes CAPOTE his own when it could have been a tiresome affair because really, the man himself was a bore who thought he was interesting. <br/><br/>Hoffman's is no light feat considering this story is about the man who brought such light fare as ""Breakfast at Tiffany's."" Solid support by Clifton Collins, Jr. as Perry Smith, and Catherine Keener as Harper Lee. Bob Balaban, Amy Ryan, Chris Cooper, and Mark Pellegrino also turn in small, fine performances and round out a dark, brooding movie about the darkness within two men."

","It's easy to say actors are ""born to play"" certain roles, and, without question, Philip Seymour Hoffman bears a striking resemblance to the notorious writer and professional celebrity Truman Capote. But this is no easy ride. It is a film that ruthlessly exploits the perfection of its casting with constant tight close-ups focussing on Hoffman's extraordinary facial contortions and rambling monologues in his uncannily accurate tinny drawl.<br/><br/>We follow Capote as he researches his most famous book  the documentary novel ""In Cold Blood""  a shocking story about the massacre of a respectable family in a sleepy Kansas town. In particular, it reveals how the author developed an eerie fascination with one of the perpetrators, Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr)  a brooding drifter on death row. This obsession ends up jeopardising the legal process and serves to paint Capote as complex, neurotic and relentlessly unlikeable.<br/><br/>At the endless fashionable soirees he attends, he surrounds himself with fawning sycophants  and even though he enjoyed famously close relationships with iconic women (including Jackie Kennedy, Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor)  in the film his cronies are faceless yes-men and ghastly society hags who hang on his every word and laugh uproariously at each self-congratulatory anecdote.<br/><br/>This superciliousness is neatly contrasted by the gruff Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper) - the Kansas lawman in charge of the murder investigation. He is unimpressed by Capote's patronising tales of New York high society, and brings some much-needed perspective to what is, essentially, a gruesome multiple homicide.<br/><br/>The two most important people in Capote's life gently attempt to instil some of this compassion in their flighty chum: ""In Cold Blood"" is dedicated to best friend Harper Lee (Catherine Keener) and lover Jack Dunphy (Bruce Greenwood), and they come across as caring and unbelievably patient, but both are criminally under-appreciated. The crunch comes when Capote is sitting alone at the premiere of the film version of Lee's even more revered novel ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" unable to offer her any congratulations as he is too busy wallowing in his own self-pity. This is the moment we lose any straggling empathy.<br/><br/>While his book contains exhaustive characterisation of the victims and the killers, the movie has little in the way of back-story. It is a troubling letdown for viewers looking to understand what is a shocking crime and develop compassion for the Clutter family. The flashbacks to the killings are late in arriving and serve merely as jolting snippets of ultra-violence, rather than emotional stepping-stones.<br/><br/>This is a movie that is unapologetically egotistical. Its fixation with Capote directly represents the character's own self-absorption. As such, Hoffman's Oscar is a triumph of role-ownership. He truly manages to maintain interest and repay the viewer's investment in a film where the detachment is disquieting and the lack of any real redemption is a constant niggle.<br/><br/>7/10"

","I have very mixed thoughts about this wonderful movie; mixed thoughts about what I am supposed to focus on after watching the soul of two people. Am I to focus on the writer Capote or the murderer Smith because after leaving the theatre I was drawn between a character analysis of both people. I suppose Capote would have thought similarly because the most memorable line of the film was when Capote compared his upbringing to Smith's when he said, roughly, we were raised in the same house and when we left, he went out the back door while I went out the front. This in a sentence is why I admire the film so much; it is rare to watch a film that can so thoroughly study the characters of two leading players in a film. Many films seem to exaggerate plot to the extent that the characters are only talking vehicles to add colour to the car chases and violence. Capote was that extremely rare American film that went deeper than the superficiality of the obvious.<br/><br/>I read the boards with viewer comments about this film and found them to be fascinating reading. I remember seeing Capote on TV and from those memories I thought Hoffman's portrayal of Capote was perfect. The Oscars should have given a double award because Hoffman was perfect as was Joachim for Cash-they could have been recognised equally.<br/><br/>The Set Decoration by Decter and Russel was outstanding as was the overall Set Decoration by Gonclier. Recreating so accurately a time and place far away geographically as well as chronologically was a tough call and they accomplished it extremely well.<br/><br/>Capote is truly a memorable film and richly deserves its many accolades."

If this is an accurate portrayal of the man then I am convinced of his mendacity in tinkering in the fate of the two murderers. In this respect this is a fabulous feat of cinematography, story telling, documentary making and acting. Is it ground breaking? No, it is of its time, subtly tying up the loose ends we may have been unaware of....a great tribute to Capote's own effort. An evergreen film for all time."

","By now you have, of course, heard of ""Capote"" as the film in which Philip Seymour Hoffman gave the performance of his career, and took away the Best Actor Oscar at this year's ceremony. So, you don't need to wonder too much about the calibre of acting in this flick. Outstanding, to say the least. Where this movie *really* surprises, is the unique and original handling of the biopic; a genre that is very tired, yet always popular and notable for bringing to light the little known nuances and hardships in the lives of celebrities and people of greatness.<br/><br/>Before going to see this film, I was pretty convinced that ""Capote"" was just another biopic being thrust out in 2005-2006's new biographical ""renaissance"" (starting with Jaime Foxx's ""Ray""), and most likely following the same formula. You know, a young kid down on his luck, abusive and/or alcoholic parents, or a life changing death of a friend, followed by a dream and struggle to be recognised, and concluding with a suicide or death, helped along by some kind of substance abuse.<br/><br/>""Capote"" does not follow this formula in the slightest. After seeing the flick, I'm as clueless about Truman's parents, childhood, adulthood, first kiss and struggle to the top as I was before I went into the cinema. To be honest, I had no idea about Truman Capote. ""Great American writers"" are, unfortunately, just ""American writers"" here in Australia, which is possibly why ""Capote"" got such a limited release through independent movie houses across our wide brown land. But, afterwards? I understand a lot about this man, as much as I know about Johnny Cash after ""Walk the Line"" and Richie Valens after ""Labamba"". ""Capote"" does not thrust facts and draw pretty pictures to illustrate the life of its subject, instead, everything about Truman Capote is delivered via the incredible performances, across dialogue, body language, facial expressions, choice of beverage, etc, etc, etc. This method, of course, leaves a lot of questions unanswered, and facts undiscovered, but leaves you wanting to do a bit of extra-curricular study on a few things it nudges you towards.<br/><br/>A fantastic film, that dances across true crime and psychological behavior, driven almost entirely by superb acting (and not just from Hoffman).

","This film became available in a nearby theatre just recently. I saw it last weekend. It's a pity that it's been in such limited release in movie house around here. I went into the room not knowing who Truman Capote was. I did a quick google on him before leaving. Something about him being a writer. Oh. Okay. Wasn't much to go on there.<br/><br/>The sets, wardrobe and cinematography were brilliantly done for this movie. I like period pieces that look like - the places you've been where time hasn't changed. The acting was very well done by the entire cast. Phillip Seymour Hoffman (Truman Capote) appears to have nailed the real Capote's personality. For that, I go on clips from the Johnny Carson show. The way Capote talked was unusual and uniquely his own style. It's amazing that he was apparently openly gay in the old boy's clubs of NYC. In the 1950's?! That he downplayed it, heading south - that seemed like someone would do in that era. Heck, I'm guessing it's still done today in the Bible belt.<br/><br/>Capote said what people wanted to hear. Other times, he'd say/do the most eccentric things. I don't know if he was deliberately eccentric, or merely seeking attention. He reminded me of Andy Warhol. I just googled that name. It's not a surprise that they knew each other.<br/><br/>Capote scanned a newspaper in NYC and decided to arrive on a small town doorstep to write about a family that was murdered. The small town reacted in different ways. Sometimes it required the help of his best friend Harper Lee (Catherine Keener). Keener was great as a supporting actor. She delivered some of the best lines in the movie. The funniest scene being when her screenplay To Kill A Mockingbird becomes a success. I was surprised to learn that he was 'connected' to that classic movie somehow.<br/><br/>The evolution of prisoner Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr) is gradual, and you sort of want to cheer for the underdog. Capote's swings of concern and indifference are what this movie is mainly about. Why was he that way? There didn't seem to be an answer, other than he did what was in his own best interests. Only Harper Lee knew him for what he really was. This movie left a lot open to speculation. Unless you are willing to do research on the man. I recommend not doing that until you see the movie. I take this film to be a depiction and interpretation. If you want extreme depth, you watch the Biography or Documentary channels. This is a factual and cinematic presentation to me."

","Capote? It's a film about Truman Capote, well known American author. Capote takes place from late 50's to mid 60's. It tells the story of how Truman Capote was inspired and how he researched for one of his best selling nonfiction books In Cold Blood. This movie is recommended for movie lovers, not for the casual movie goer. With that said this is an amazing film that interests the mind. The cinematography is dark and sets the mood well for the killings Capote is investigating, but also adds a since of mystery. It is well contrasted when Capote vacations to Spain. The lighting is bright, he wears light clothes representing his separation from the troubles in Kansas, where the murders took place. Most important, the acting played a major role in making this film great Philip Seymour Hoffman truly captures the essence of Truman Capote; his emotional highs and lows are acted out perfectly. Although the character of Capote may have eclipsed other roles, the cast of actors still played well beside him. The writing and directing were top notch, which added to overall quality of the film. It was well worth watching and I highly recommended it for film lovers."

Along the way, ""Capote"" offers fascinating, if thin, recreations of the Cool Jazz-fueled cocktail circuit of the early 1960s brownstone intelligentsia in New York City as well as an outsider's view of the more grounded yet aspiring ""wheatfield soul"" of rural Kansas (landscape by Manitoba).<br/><br/>Philip Seymour Hoffman reveals a Capote whose vulnerability has made him tough. Capote's vibrant, fey demeanor comes across at first as off-putting. But he is soon accepted by all because his consistency belies a force at once gifted and resolute. We realize we are dealing with someone who is determined to make sense out of a senseless aspect of human existence. It is not always a pretty sight. Capote manipulates his subjects and the people in his private circle in order to produce his book.<br/><br/>Lured out of the halls of The New Yorker magazine by the killings in Kansas, Capote crash lands in an alien sensibility. His fame is his credential, but he demurs in the face of the local sheriff (played with admirable restraint by Chris Cooper), who tells him fiercely, ""I care,"" referring to the capture of the killers. Here are lawmen faced with bringing brutal murderers to justice. Art may be eternal, however both Capote and the sheriff know for sure that life is short. At the press conference, a duly subdued Capote stands, silent, in the back of the room. He is beginning to assimilate -- the first step in getting the real story.<br/><br/>When Capote calls his publisher in New York to ask for more money and for ""Dick"" Avedon to take pictures of the captured killers, it is the ego of the artist taking over. Without this selfish force, the book could not be created, but it remains a selfish drive to the end, nonetheless.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Capote remains a cruel cut-up. This is his defense mechanism, to keep others from knowing his insecurities, from guessing at his depression. The writing process turns Capote inside out, and there is no way he wants to share that with anyone. <br/><br/>Instead, Capote regales his adulating listeners with name-dropping tales of boozy moments in exotic locales alongside cultural icons. More poignantly, he glibly deprecates the killers he has been cozying up to. Yet Capote's sincerity is apparent as he attempts to understand their story, which will become his book, and to help their cause as long as it dovetails with his opus. <br/><br/>A ""necktie party"" is how killer Perry Smith (Clifton Collins, Jr.) refers to his own impending death sentence; in 1965 Kansas still ""hanged from a rope until dead"" its capital murderers. Does anything emphasize more strongly the link to the Old West, especially as viewed by an arriviste member of the nation's cultural elite? Capote cleaves to his New York cachet; earlier he had denied that the subtle landscape of Kansas reminded him at all of his youth in the Deep South. He would rather see himself as a product of northeastern intellectualism than a bayou baby brought up in 'bama. His work on ""In Cold Blood"" forces him to reconsider his innermost self.<br/><br/>We are never truly moved to pity Smith, even though we are introduced to the accused in a humanizing environment, a kitchen that serves as an emergency detention cell. We are subsequently alienated from the convicted killer, whether by cell bars, his own attempts at artifice or the hangman's harness. The peculiarity of the outbuilding that houses the scaffold, to which the condemned are chauffeured in a roomy car, built ""when Detroit still cared,"" further distracts from empathizing with Smith in his most helpless and final hour.<br/><br/>In days of yore the hangman might shake the condemned man's hand to judge his weight before adjusting the noose. In ""Capote,"" Smith shakes the sheriff's hand before climbing the gallows. The scene reminds us of the sad truth that it is ultimately a weak man who would, as Smith's older sister told Capote in an earlier scene, ""just as soon kill you as shake your hand.""<br/><br/>Capote came to view murderer Perry Smith as a brother in spirit, and he confided this profound emotional tie to Nelle (Catherine Keener), his friend since childhood. After justice has been meted out in the Kansas barn, it is Nelle who refuses Capote's personal revisionism that he tried to stay the execution. <br/><br/>While the victims of the murders are not the focus of ""Capote,"" the sheer brutality of the crimes is directly depicted in an abrupt flashback, lest we forget why these murderers have been ordered to forfeit their lives."
"MOscarbradley","9","0","0","5 March 2006"," A master-class in acting
","Just let us forget for a moment that Truman Capote existed and that the character up on the screen is the invention of a scriptwriter's extraordinary imagination. Then let us consider just how fully Philip Seymour Hoffman has inhabited the role. This is a great performance by any standards. Hoffman convinces us that this devious, mendacious little man could exist and like some Machiavellian/Mephistopolean ogre could ingratiate himself with, well, just about anybody. It takes a tremendous leap of faith but this extraordinary actor makes it.<br/><br/>But hold on; Truman Capote did exist. That insidious charmer lived and breathed and wrote some of the greatest fiction ever to come out of America and he 'invented' the 'non-fiction novel' and with ""In Cold Blood"" he may have written the greatest example of the genre ever put on paper. So now Hoffman's task is all the greater. He must convince us that it is indeed the living, breathing Capote up there on the screen; like Victor Frankenstien he must give his creation life, and that is what he does. The limitations that most actors find imposed on them when they play a real-life character, (do they look like them, sound like them, have they got inside their heads?), Hoffman seems to have set aside, (though to all three of those questions the answer is a resounding 'yes'). Rather. he seems to exist outside of Capote, looking in on him, studying him. It is a master-class in acting.<br/><br/>But what of the film itself? It begins in 1959 on the day of the Clutter killings and ends some years later with the execution of the killers and the completion of Capote's book on the subject, ""In Cold Blood"". It is, therefore, not a biopic in the conventional sense of the word but a study of creativity and of celebrity. While we never see Capote pounding away at the typewriter we do see, in great detail, the painstaking way he achieved what he did, how he charmed (and lied) his way into the lives of everyone involved, in particular those of the policeman Alvin Dewey, (superbly played by Chris Cooper), and finally into the lives of the killers themselves, in particular Perry Smith, (another brilliant performance by Clifton Collins Jr). Some say Capote was in love with Smith; there certainly may have been a strong physical attraction on the writer's part, but on this reading Capote seems to have loved no-one but himself, or rather loved nothing but his own genius, his own extraordinary belief in himself.<br/><br/>The film suggests he was filled with remorse when Smith was finally executed and that he drank heavily afterwards, (he never completed another book), but he drank heavily before as well and his depressions were as much a symptom of his own vacillating creativity. Capote's own early life was troubled and his first novel, the brilliant ""Other Voices, Other Rooms"", written when he was only twenty-four, is filled with disquieting Gothic imagery. He certainly felt an affinity with Perry Smith, that their lives were not necessarily so different, but as he says in the film it was as if they had grown up in the same house but that he, Capote, had gone out the front door while Smith went out the back.<br/><br/>And by concentrating solely on a particular period in the writer's life, scriptwriter Dan Futterman and director Bennett Miller, (hard to believe this is his first feature film), can delve deeper into what it is that makes Capote the man he is, can explore in depth the tiny sinews of thought that make up a great writer. And they are blessed with that great performance, the pinnacle of Hoffman's career to date, perhaps the finest example yet of the actor's art of making us believe that the person up there on the screen is who they say they are."

","This movie was just fabulous. I can't wait until it comes out on DVD and I can buy it. Now, I knew nothing about Truman Capote except that he wrote Breakfast At Tiffany's, and the only reason I knew that was because I watch Seinfeld. Anyway, I looked up on my local theatre website the write-up about Capote and it sounded appealing. I have to say though, for many people who don't have the internet, the title of this movie would be very deceiving. Before I read the description I thought the movie would be about the life of Truman Capote and it is so not. It is so much better. Philip Seymour Hoffman was excellent. I can't say anything negative about him. He was just fabulous. And the relationship he formed with Perry was touching at times, especially at the end. Seeing Hoffman/Capote breakdown just before the two killers are to be hanged was heartbreaking (for Truman). You will learn as you watch the movie that Truman develops feelings for one of the killers. Keener did a really good job too. It was my first time seeing her as an actor and I was impressed. At the end of the movie they give a little write-up of how Truman dies and a little light goes on in your head as you begin to remember things that occurred in the movie and you're like, ""oh yeah"". Anyway, awesome movie."

","Capote comes highly recommended, so I went in with big expectations. I cannot say they were met. Capote moves along slowly taking its time to develop its characters, plot and rhythm. Philip Hoffman is a highlight with a commanding performance lead. His ego, insecurity, ruthlessness, pride and regret all mix together in this complex and believable character. The center of the murders, Clifton Collins Jr, is portrayed with potential. How could such a mild man be a savage killer. Yes, the ingredients are all there. But somehow Capote manages to ring shallow. The inner workings of the accused are never fully explored. The background, motive and capacity to kill all have to be taken for granted. And Capote himself rings scripted. His inner workings are also not deeply revealed. Add to this a really slow pace, and I see a movie laced with dramatic opportunity which never comes around. Worth watching, yes. Disturbing, yes. But acclaimed, no."

","From viewing the trailer, I felt some concern that Philip Seymour Hoffman might mimic Capote rather than produce a rounded character. I was wrong. This is a stunning performance, and despite very stiff competition should collect the Academy Award for best actor. Clifton Collins Jr - an actor I was not familiar with - is also extraordinary and very moving as the articulate killer Perry Smith with whom Capote forms an odd bond, a bond which ultimately goes beyond simply using him for what he can get out of him. The script is exemplary, and makes few concessions to the viewer: you're expected to know who William Shawn was and to follow some witty New York cocktail party literary gossip. Futterman makes no bones about the way Capote manipulated, and in some cases blatantly lied to, his subjects. All minor roles are well cast, notably Catherine Keener as Nelle Harper Lee and Chris Cooper as the detective Alvin Dewey. I am inspired to re-read Capote's masterpiece In Cold Blood and also re-view the interesting film of that book."

","This movie was great because it shows how Capote evolved through the writing process. Not only did his book slowly come to be, but he slowly evolved throughout the movie. The question is, did he experience a good change or bad change. At the start of the movie Capote's personality grabs your attention and you don't know if you want to like him or dislike him. But one thing you do see is that he is good with people. He knows what people want to hear. People are on the edge of their seat around him listening to him. Phillip Seymour Hoffman has done an amazing job with this character, the viewer is able to truly see who Capote is, or who the writer wanted us to see. Hoffman really lays it all out in this movie. Catherine Keener did an amazing job as well, the chemistry between her and Hoffman really makes the movie appealing to all viewers."

","Two very engaging and very compelling things are centerpieces for works that people keep coming back to again and again: psychopaths and artists. Especially when both are slightly insane or egotistic, the analysis of brains abnormal and uncomprehended are fascinating and wondrous motifs that re-occur in literature and media again and again.<br/><br/>This movie has both, a very contradictory and egotistic mind, Truman Capote's, matched with the alarmingly sweet and charismatic mind of a psychopath, Perry Smith, who Truman falls in love with and interviews for research to write his best-selling and important work, In Cold Blood.<br/><br/>The result is very affecting. Hoffman's zealous and defined portrayal of Capote is matched by the outstanding performance of Clifton Collin's Jr., the lonely and slightly terrifying face of a killer who is human and humanized.<br/><br/>The real drama comes from Capote's terrifyingly manipulative mind. For someone who didn't know much about Capote before I entered the theatre, Hoffman's performance was simply shocking. The commercials and advertising and posters and the like would have you imagine that Capote was a very strong artistic trope, like other biopics that show brilliant artists and their troubles. However, a couple of things should be noted... first, this is not a biopic. Second, Capote's flamboyantly homosexual and confrontationally controversial mannerisms both set the man himself apart from the type of character we like to see from artists, and also set Hoffman's performance apart from basically anything we've ever seen before.<br/><br/>A side-result is a very discomforting and contradictory look. Capote lies, manipulates, cheats... and yet the presentation of these events help us concern ourselves with his character so much that we can't help but want every part of his innermost desires to actualize. We have a man who kills, but he's also lonely and afraid and willing to cling on to anybody who will give him attention. We empathize with characters we'd normally shun, yet simultaneously feel uncomfortable being so close to them, thus wanting to know more about them so that we can come to terms with who they are.<br/><br/>And at the end, when we see the denouement of what is both a perverse and a relatable relationship, the movie centers in on Smith's heavy breathing as he awaits his doom and the audience breaths heavily along with him, feeling all hope begin to fade from the screen as the deranged Capote watches on. Now tell me that isn't great, great film-making.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

","In November 1959, a family of four was brutally murdered in the quiet, clothes-pinned dust-bowl of rural Kansas. Soon after the suspects were rounded up, the story caught the interest of 'New Yorker' prodigy and celebrity-socialite Truman Capote, hot of the success of his first novel ""Breakfast at Tiffanys"" and eager to absorb himself in what would later be considered the very first non-fiction novel. But was his attraction to the mysteriously alluring killers an act of friendship, or a fiendishly designed plan to capture the true story behind a terrifying massacre In Cold Blood?<br/><br/>Director Bennet Miller effectively films the legendary relationship between death-row inmate Perry Smith and the fragile Capote to whom he confided. Philip Seymour Hoffman, the most famous unknown in Hollywood, channels the exasperating uniqueness of the title character perfectly, tip-toeing into every scene like an injured sparrow, his ever-present tear-pooled gaze mirroring every Milo-second of emotion. The camera treats Truman like an inmate himself, cleverly trapping him in empty rooms and barred conversations with those he loves, or rather, those who love him.<br/><br/>The story confronts the viewer with several questions, not the least of which being Why do we commit such atrocious acts and how far are we willing to go to justify them? In the end, Truman's seen as the delicate, feeble genius he was. In love with himself, his work, his friends and his enemies.

","Truman Capote's masterpiece IN COLD BLOOD (1965) set a new standard and style in the literary world. We know that he didn't finish another novel after it, too, which begs the question, ""Why?"" Fast-forward to the 2005 film CAPOTE and we get the answer.<br/><br/>Mr. Capote is reincarnated in the body of actor Philip Seymour Hoffman, and it is ""through"" him that we get to find out what happened during this snapshot time of Truman Capote's life. A vicious murder of a family in rural Kansas takes place and Truman races there to find out if there's a magazine story in it. But what he finds is much more than just a short periodical piece. As the murderers are captured, Truman becomes enraptured with the idea of learning why these seemingly innocuous men did something so heinous.<br/><br/>Truman digs deep, perhaps too deep, and we watch as every shred of decency is stripped away from him just so he can ""finish the story."" He bribes the prison warden and lies to the two killers (and ultimately to himself) about why he's really spending so much time with them on death row.<br/><br/>In the end, it rips Truman apart, causing him to become an alcoholic and a shell of what he once was.<br/><br/>Occasionally casting directors get ""it"" right. And this time, they not only got it right by casting Mr. Hoffman in the role of Truman Capote, they bottled a bit of magic and captured it on film. David Strathairn did it, too, in his performance as Edward R. Murrow in GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LUCK, but Hoffman takes it to a euphoric level for movie watchers. His mannerisms, voice and costumes were impeccable. Many times I thought I was actually watching Truman Capote and not an actor playing him. Now that's great acting.<br/><br/>If there was any failings in the movie, I'd have to say it was with its overall script. Although intriguing and genuinely creepy, it held only a small piece of what Truman Capote was. I realize that to capture all of what he was would be almost impossible ...but there you go. That's life.<br/><br/>Even so, Hoffman deserves all the accolades he's gotten and I have no doubt he'll jump up on stage at the Oscars this year and pick up his statue."

Some movies I see do not do enough research into the book that they are taking things from. If you are a fan of the book or interested in Capote at all; this is the movie for you.<br/><br/>As far as biographies go, this movie shows how it should be done.

Capote is everyone of us. Tell me, aren't you fascinated by the unknown? By the people who did something good or bad, right or wrong? By their minds? Well, maybe you're not so addicted to this kind of knowledge and it's nothing bad. Capote is a journalist, in the first place. His relation with Perry Smith, the bastard that killed four people, it's the same relation that the mass-media from our present time it's using with their news-subjects. Capote it's a great writer, no doubt about it, but this movie isn't a simple frame from a great man's life, the most important picture from his biography. It represents more than that. The job of Truman Capote has been continued by the today's media...""In cold blood"" it's what people wants, the watchers, the readers, the listeners, they are all ""slaves"" in this brainwashing program initiated by the media from almost any place in the world. We like killers, violence, blood. Just to see it, not to feel it. That's OK, but there are many more things to watch...Good things, great things. Back to ""Capote""...I'll say that the relation between Capote and Perry Smith it's the same with the relation between media and their sources of news. Exploited? Yes, Capote has exploited Perry Smith, but never left him alone. Even when Smith was executed, Capote was there. Actually, i didn't read ""In cold blood"". Any book that describes the crimes of a young thief isn't my style...Inside the mind of a criminal? The movie doesn't want to show Perry Smith's real face, or that even a ""in cold blood"" killer has his ""good side"". Truman Capote it's a man that discover his masterpiece in writing in the eyes of a killer. Perry Smith's life isn't special. A thief that become a killer. There are many others bastards that follow the same black direction. The line between stiling and killing it's so thin! The regrets are useless. This movie evocate a person with the gift from God. A writer that could transform the banal story of a killer in something special, in something remarkable, in a lesson for the others it deserves RESPECT. So they given to Truman Capote, the writer of ""In cold blood"", perhaps the most known book from the United States literature a lot of respect, a great commemoration-A movie for the Oscar 2006-Go CAPOTE!(Capote...sounds a little Italian-Mobster-Godfather-Name?)-Escuse my bad English, i'm an amateur!"

Coming of age one of the most talked about writers of the late 1950s was Truman Capote. He was then celebrated as a NEW YORKER short story writer.

The scene in which Perry explains the night of the murders is one truly gripping scene if not nauseating. The murders were truly 'In Cold Blood' as Capote's title of his book infers.

I am delighted that more filmgoers will now ""Seymour"" I mean ""see more"" of Hoffman's work. He has been one of the most undervalued actors for some time now. His acting forte is to play sad sack losers. However, Hoffman is a winner and might very will be one come Oscar night. Truman Capote was the ""Truman Show"" and center of attention of many New York cocktail galas and parties. His exuberant personality was more of a façade and defense mechanism for his sadistic self-esteem. The film for the most part solely fixates on the developments of his classic novel ""In Cold Blood"". The libro told the bloody tale of a mid-western family who were violently murdered in (you got it!) cold blood by two psychotic killers. Capote actually befriended the psychopaths to aid him with the non-fiction narrative. The supporting cast of ""Capote"" was also bloody good: Catherine Keener as his confidante Harper Lee, Chris Cooper as the local lawman Alvin Dewey, Bruce Greenwood as Truman's lover Jack Dunphy, and Clifton Collins Jr. as slayer Perry Smith.

","I saw this film at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival. Philip Seymour Hoffman is one of my favourite actors, period. But he's usually known for character roles, and so he's not quite the household name he deserves to be. And sadly, because this film probably won't have wide appeal, he might remain that way. The truth is that he's one of the finest actors working today, and this film is a tour de force. Hoffman inhabits the role of Truman Capote, nailing everything from his childlike voice to his fey mannerisms, even down to his facial tics. He's almost too good, which may distract a bit from the other charms of this film.<br/><br/>If focuses rather narrowly on the time Truman Capote spent writing his most famous book, In Cold Blood. After a family of four is murdered in their remote farmhouse in Kansas, Capote decides to write an article for The New Yorker. After the two murderers are apprehended, Capote begins to form a bond with one of the men, Perry Smith (portrayed with amazing subtlety by Clifton Collins Jr.), drawing parallels between his own troubled childhood and that of the career criminal. The proposed article is abandoned, as Capote realizes he has the material for a book. And not just any kind of book, but a whole new kind of writing, what Capote calls ""the nonfiction novel.""<br/><br/>As the months drag on after the men's convictions, Capote keeps trying to draw Smith out, asking him to tell him about the night of the killings. When he finally does, it's uncomfortable to watch, not only for the brutality of the murders, but also for the way that Capote uses Smith for his own ends. It's clear that there is an inner conflict going on in Capote's mind. On one level, he really does befriend this killer. But he also uses him for material so he can feed his huge ambition and ego. His duplicitous nature is just another thing he has in common with Smith.<br/><br/>But after several years of research, at the end of all the legal appeals to spare the killers' lives, Capote is relieved to hear they'll finally be hanged. It's the only way he can finish his book. However, the experience of actually watching the executions shakes him deeply. His jumbled mixture of feelings and motivations went on to have a profound effect on Capote, and although the book does go on to become his most successful, he never finishes another. The film ends by quoting the epigraph to his final, unfinished manuscript, Unanswered Prayers. It was Christian mystic Teresa of Avila who said that ""answered prayers cause more tears than those that remain unanswered."""

","Capote was the first film I've seen in some time for which I haven't read a half-dozen reviews, watched the trailer (twice), and checked the IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes ratings before placing my eight-dollar and fifty-cent wager. Maybe it's fear of commitment. Perhaps I've been burnt too many times. Mostly I'm just cheap. All this considered, the fact that I chose to see this film based on a single, solitary ""Oh, it's good,"" from my friend Tamara, more of a conversational aside than an actual discussion, is unusual.<br/><br/>Things could have gone badly.<br/><br/>(To be fair, I also knew Philip Seymour Hoffman to be quite talented.)<br/><br/>But still, it could have turned out terribly.<br/><br/>The film was, in fact, absolutely wonderful. Having read nothing of the plot, I expected the storyline to focus on celebrity hobnobbing, heavy drinking, and the other more superficial elements of Capote's life. It simply never occurred to me that the movie would focus on In Cold Blood. The intensity was just incredible, relentless. While Hoffman's invocation of Capote's peculiar accent and pitch comes across as a slightly comic departure from his real-life voice in the opening scenes, it is so consistently done, with such confidence that  only minutes into the film - it seems no more affected than it would on Capote himself. The rest of the cast delivers solid performances as well, including a lovable but uncharacteristically unsexy Catherine Keener. Clifton Collins Jr. is excellent as the murderer, Perry Smith, convincing the audience that he is, all at once, vulnerable, sweet, damaged, and volatile.<br/><br/>Perhaps the greatest thing about this film was its commitment to realism, it's honesty. The film never shies away from Capote's faults  his selfish motivations for working on In Cold Blood, his drinking, his self-centeredness. Just the same, it challenges the audience to decide for itself the true nature of his actions. Was Capote in love with Smith? Did he help them secure legal aid out of charity or self-interest? Was he an eccentric artist consumed in his work or just a lousy friend, uncaring lover? And, of course, the film carries on the legacy of In Cold Blood itself. Capote's ability to uncover the duality of monstrosity and humanity in his subjects is an important lesson in a world that prefers to view its criminals and its heroes  in black and white."

","I never knew much about the man Capote apart from reading the beautiful book breakfast at Tiffanys and seeing the fim, and after watching this film felt none the wiser about him,I cannot help but wonder if this is how Truman would like to be remembered if he was alive today and why the film concentrated upon this particular story line of his life when I was looking forward to a history lesson on such a great writer and if now I should wait for someone else to make a film that does justice to the the man surely he deserves better than this and being immortalised in this film memory,I personally think it would put most newcomers off his work.I would also like like Hoffman to play him again the man truly deserves the Oscar this year,I cannot think of another actor worthy to add to the category rather than just making up the numbers.Breathtaking when you can enjoy a film just for the stars performance but dismiss the film as ordinary."

","Nearly devoid of action sequences, this is obviously not a movie for the dull-witted, easily entertained, or those looking for adventure, romance and sex. ""Capote"" is a slow-moving, episodic recitation of a complex and highly flawed genius at the pinnacle of his career.<br/><br/>Brilliantly written and acted, the movie is pure dialog and psychology. It covers Capote's research and writing of his last and best completed work, ""In Cold Blood"", which solidified the style of writing an absolutely true story in the manner of a fictional novel.<br/><br/>The portrayals of his interviews with one of the heartless killers are gripping. The film shows Capote for exactly what he was, brilliant, artistic, intellectual, witty but also egotistical, selfish, manipulative, insensitive and even treacherous. A film for people who like to be forced to think deeply about the movie they just saw."

","This film is a tribute to the acting talents of Hoffman, Keener, Cooper and others. It provides an excellent contextual understanding of Capote's complexity and his efforts that culminated in the publishing of a biographical novel. It showcases his keen ability to use others so effectively in his writing efforts. Particularly noteworthy was his ability to empathize, to engage, and to manipulate others to collaborate with him in his artistic effort to create his novel. He also exhibited an amazing memory for detail. Nothing seemed to detract him from his goal of achieving the supreme work of fiction. Capote was relentless in his pursuit to graphically record a terrible murder. I was further drawn to Capote's struggle to accommodate his role as a bystander with prisoner's role as a perpetrator. Capote had an uncanny ability to identify with that criminal's mindset. He used this to his advantage in gathering material for the novel. All of his energies were directed to keeping his subject alive so he could write his book. Capote manipulated the truth with the prisoner whom he befriended in order to obtain cooperation and to produce the final version his story. Was this coverage of a biographical event the source of his ultimate undoing in succumbing to alcoholism? The viewer is left wondering. This is an engaging as well as challenging film."
"meddlecore","10","0","0","15 January 2006"," The Exploitation of an Egomaniac
","An excellent film. Every aspect of this film is masterful. Hoffman's performance as Capote is nothing short of brilliant, and all the supporting actors and actresses do an equally incredible job. The direction and cinematography are also extraordinary, but what I think made the film is the story and screenplay. The storyline, plot and dialogue were Capote's greatest strength. The film, especially the early parts, are dominated with blues and yellows- a technique that greatly contributed to the grim and dark tone of the film. The film moves a little slow for the average moviegoer, but will capture the intrigue of cinephiles. From the stunning imagery, to the camera-work, to the superb acting and the wonderful plot and dialogue, this film captures the ego-maniacal essence of Truman Capote as good as any biographical film is able to catch the essence of it's subject.<br/><br/>Now that I have that out of the way I would like to discuss the story. It tells of how Truman Capote, author of Breakfast at Tiffany's, revolutionized American non-fiction writing by dedicating his time to researching his subjects in depth before even writing a sentence. His book In Cold Blood, the product of this story, would go on to be considered one of the great American literary masterpieces.<br/><br/>It tells how Truman Capote, working as a journalist for the New Yorker magazine, happened upon a story of murder in a small Kansas town called Holcombe, and decided to turn the story of that small town- that was rocked by the gruesome murders- into a book. A book like no other American author had previously written. One that would enter the minds of, not only, the townspeople that were affected by this event, but also, into the minds of the killers themselves.<br/><br/>When the killers are captured in Nevada and extradited back to Kansas, Capote uses his charm and manipulation to gain unfettered access to the two criminals, Perry and Richard. He forms an especially close bond with the quiet and well spoken Perry, as he empathizes and feels sorry for the man. Capote feels that he even loves Perry, but in reality, for him, it is merely a relationship based on exploitation. The only reason he even pretends to care about the men- such as getting them a better lawyer, a number of appeals and stays- is to prolong the amount of time the two men, condemned to death, would be alive, so that he could get more information from Perry. Mainly information about what really happened the night that the family was horrifically murdered by the hands of the men...<br/><br/>From early on it seems that Richard and Perry are trying to exploit Truman as well, as they attempt to ruse Capote into writing a book in favour of them and their case. But Capote is no gullible fool. He knows why he was there, and the power that he held over Perry. He utilized this power to control the situation completely. He would constantly keep information, or flat out lie, to Perry in order to secure his cooperation with hopes of getting the information he desired, and in fact needed to successfully complete his book.<br/><br/>We see as Capote is transformed from a concerned friend and confidant of Perry, to an egotistical self interested writer willing to do (or not do) whatever is necessary to shape the events (or wait for them to occur) precisely as he desired them to. When it seems the two men will get off on appeal, Capote delves into a state of depression, as he feels that he will be unable to finish his book- as he will be without an ending to the story. I feel that the true relationship Capote had with Perry is epitomized in the scene of Capote and the two mens final meeting prior to their execution. Capote begins to ball, not because he is sad that the men- especially Pery whom he has grown close to- are going to die, but rather because he knew that he completely exploited them, and is at least partially responsible for sealing their fate. This scene is shot with a hand-held camera which shows the tension and unease that is evident in this final confrontation, in which Perry asks Truman to view his execution- as a friend. <br/><br/>This film definitely deserves all the praise that it has been receiving. Bennett Miller and Adam Kimmel are successful in creating an intriguing and visually stimulating film. Hoffman and the entire cast give one of, if not the, most magnificent performances of the year. Hoffman definitely deserves recognition for his role as Capote- a character that seemed quite difficult to emulate. He really did become Capote. The writing in the film also deserves recognition as the story and dialogue, especially when combined with such great performances, were absolutely incredible. This is an all-around excellent film that accurately portrays the exploitation of an egomaniac. It will satisfy a number of your cinematic needs and desires. Definitely recommended. 10 out 10."

The emotions that surrounds the film give it a disturbing aura. It brings up the question if there's a line too human behaviour.The film also gives us the reason why Truman Capote never came too finishing another book, his mind just couldn't handle the events at the execution of Perry Smith. After this he turned into drinking, which would be his dead.The film really catches you and leaves you at the end with a feeling that makes you think twice about things like media, journalists and the death penalty."

","This was one of the strongest movies I have seen all year. The well drafted script and moving story were highlighted by amazing performances, the strongest of which was by Philip Seymour Hoffman. While most of the buzz about this movie will concern whether or not Hoffman deserves the Best Actor Oscar, the other performances by Chris Cooper and Catherine Keener should not be discounted in supporting roles. The story follows Truman Capote (Hoffman) during the nearly 5 year period that he was writing his masterpiece, In Cold Blood, one of the best accounts of an American tragedy ever written. The incredible taxing effect that the research caused on Capote, as well as the close relationship he developed with one of the killers causes Capote to take a downward turn. This movie received a ten from me. I wanted to give it a 9 or perhaps a 9.5 because at times I felt like it was dragging, or it could be seen as dragging. However, I then rethought and realized that the reason I felt tired was because of the emotional taxing that occurs during the movie. It is emotional and at points hard to watch. Also, I love the book In Cold Blood. And Truman Capote is very interesting to me. So for me the Movie was a 10, but be careful. Because of my love for the story I feel my opinion may be biased. However, from a purely analytical standpoint I must say that the movie is great. And Hoffman does deserve the Oscar"

","CAPOTE <br/><br/>For the past few months, when CAPOTE was easily available for me to see at local theaters, I refused to go b/c something about Phillip Seymour Hoffman always irritates me. I had no desire to see the film. My mother however has wanted to see it for months, and was determined to see it before it left the one theater it was still showing in Connecticut, 45 minutes away. So I figured what the hell, I'd see it so I could have a more developed opinion on the Best Actor race.<br/><br/>Well, I'm glad I did.<br/><br/>CAPOTE was much better than I thought it would be. First off, the story of how Truman Capote became involved and obsessed with the writing of his novel IN COLD BLOOD is a fascinating one. And, despite my personal distaste, Phillip Seymour Hoffman brought this character to the screen like no one else would have been able to.<br/><br/>In previews, I heard his voice and it was like nails on a chalkboard... however, in the movie, that voice simply amplified Capote's razor wit. Hoffman performance never felt like an imitation to me... granted the voice had to be imitated... but beneath the voice, Hoffman was living the role through all the emotional highs and lows. The voice and mannerisms were merely the surface of this performance. You can imitate a man's voice and physicality... but you can not IMITATE the descent of a man into depression and obsession. That has to be felt organically by the actor, and it's exactly what Hoffman does here.<br/><br/>The film itself is also a taught, emotional experience. The scoring was perfectly eerie without ever trying to cross over into a thriller.<br/><br/>One clear divide I was thinking while watching this movie is the difference between a Hollywood biopic... and a true biopic film. CAPOTE conveyed who the man was and told his story in an unconventional way. They told the story of this man's entire life, by focusing on his most important years. We find out what his past was by watching the man he had become. This is completely different film from the more mainstream WALK THE LINE... and I appreciate this kind of biopic a little more.<br/><br/>The supporting performances were all great in terms of supporting the biggest aspect of the film, Hoffman's performance. I actually most preferred Chris Cooper's work in his small role. Awards-buzz for Keener seems odd just considering there wasn't really anything for her to do. Some people call the performance not showy enough for Oscar's tastes... well I think the role simply wasn't good. None of Harper Lee's pivotal moments of influence were captured on film b/c the director chose to follow Truman Capote the entire team... in the end leaving Harper Lee as a side-note. There is nothing wrong with this and it ultimately works for the film... and Keener delivers everything required of her... but I don't see this as an Oscar-Worthy performance. If nominated I'd prefer recognition for her performance in THE 40-YEAR OLD VIRGIN.<br/><br/>Overall, CAPOTE snuck up on me from behind to become one of my favorite movies of the year. From that first moment when the murdered bodies were discovered, I knew this was going to be a good film.<br/><br/>The only thing that kept the film from getting an A were a couple of moments that left me confused. Was Perry the only one to actually carry out the killings? That's how it was shown, but not how the men were tried? Also, what was it that Harper Lee NEEDED to tell Truman over the phone that got him out of his bed? This seemed to be a big moment that was slightly unclear to me.<br/><br/>Aside from these small details, everything worked, and it taught me about a little chunk of history I never knew was so fascinating. CAPOTE is Phillip Seymour Hoffman's best performance and an amazing film wrapped into one package. And if anyone else had reservations about seeing it... I recommend a change of heart.<br/><br/>...

Leger had a breakthrough performance in Brokeback Mountain; Daniels was incredible as a pseudo-intellectual bore, spouse and father in The Squid and the Whale, but neither came near Hoffman in their respective performances.

"Ric-7","10","0","0","30 December 2005"," Uncanny performance in enlightening film
","In the seventies, I read the three or four installments of Capote's novel-in-progress, Answered Prayers. The connection of the installments was not clear, but the individual pieces, which could stand on their own as short stories, were breathtaking. Until the time of Capote's death, he assured everyone he was working on the novel, and then, posthumously, it was discovered that there was nothing more--not even an outline.<br/><br/>The segments of Answered Prayers were basically in the genre of ""non-fiction novels,"" such as In Cold Blood, as the pieces were mostly based upon actual celebrities. I believe that the writing of In Cold Blood not only produced a piece that changed the nature of writing at that time, but it also took a terrible toll on Capote. I cannot help but think that the need for persons to die before he could complete the book, and the fact that the book required the betrayal of friends, all served to affect his future writing.<br/><br/>The parallel is there: Capote began work on In Cold Blood when he saw a news article of the deaths of four persons, and his objective was to look for an explanation. He could end his work on In Cold Blood only after the deaths of two more persons, and furnished the explanation for his inability to produce another complete work.<br/><br/>Mr. Hoffman's performance in this film is absolutely uncanny. Not only is he a gifted mimic of Capote's speech and mannerisms, but he is able to invest so much meaning without speech or mannerism. For example, the scene in which he says ""goodbye."" Earlier in the film, Capote speaks of his mother having abandoned him for her own reasons. In this goodbye scene, Capote obviously knows that he has already abandoned a friend, and that doing so is the inevitable prerequisite for a great personal success. Hoffman gets all of that across with ""goodbye."" <br/><br/>I never imagined that a film about writing could be this good. A definite ten, in my opinion."

","This is a Richtwinpoortwin(.)com post on the movie.<br/><br/>We recently went to a movie in NYC with some friends and watched the limited release film - Capote. We were going to watch Syriana but many of us didn't like George Clooney and the tickets for the hour we wanted to watch the movie was sold out. So we went to see Capote. The theater that we went to was really small. There were like 5 columns of seats on each side of the screen. My twin and I were like ""What the hell did we get ourselves into?"" after the first 5 minutes into the movie. It was like in a twilight zone - in a crappy theater with lots of other people watching this mess and the others are like pretending to like it. My twin turned to me and asked - ""Are we really watching this? Are these people for real? Can we get our money back?"" Anyway, we did sit through the movie; we saw worse movies than this one - as in more boring. And actually I'm glad we sat through it.<br/><br/>Capote is a movie about the man Capote who wrote ""In Cold Blood"" in a time where American writers were treated as celebrities with fame, fortune, respect, and praise. Now the only real thing going for Capote, as what my twin and I pointed out was that he had 1 thing no one else had. And that was Confidence which overshadowed any obvious flaws the man had. When he spoke, people listened. When he had an idea, he brought it into reality simply through his confidence in himself and his abilities. ""I have a 94% recall,"" was his catch phrase to impress others and boost about himself in an amusing way. The obvious flaws we see from this Capote is that 1. He has a really weak speaking voice - he sounds like a woman - it was annoying and almost unbearable.<br/><br/>2. He was openly a homo - at a time when gays were bashed and forbidden to come forth.<br/><br/>3. He was very conceited, greedy, uncaring for others, and a liar - he did not care about other's work even his friends' and put down their works - in his words: ""I don't see what all the fuss is all about."" <br/><br/>4. He had a big drinking and smoking problem which ultimately killed him.<br/><br/>But what made everyone stay in that theater that night, what made the people in the movie listen to him whenever he spoke, what made him the greatest and most famous American writer, and why there is a movie on his guy, was one thing - it was how blatantly confident he was in himself and in his skills and abilities to get what he wanted into his reality. However, in the end what he brought into reality cost more than what he had to gain.<br/><br/>It is also true in real life to an extent - where confidence can bring certainty and into reality some things that you want - in business, school, games, life. However, there is something even more powerful than confidence. We will share that in a future article and you can decide for yourself."

Kudos to the makers of this film by reminding us what a brilliant writer he was in his earlier years. Hoffman's portrayal of the torturous process Capote endured to complete ""In Cold Blood"" is one of the great cinematic depictions of an artist suffering for his art.<br/><br/>Kudos to all the actors who participated in this film. Catherine Keener's performance as Harper Lee is worthy of Oscar consideration as well.<br/><br/>In the past few years, Hollywood has served up more than its share of truly atrocious, overly hyped movies.

"EUyeshima","8","0","0","24 December 2005"," Startling Hoffman Performance Emblazons Intense Treatment of Capote's Life-Changing Episode
","Although he was a celebrated author, I have to admit my initial familiarity with Truman Capote came from his frequent appearances during the 1970's on ""The Tonight Show"" with Johnny Carson, as well as his silly appearance as duplicitous millionaire Lionel Twain in Neil Simon's 1978 ""Murder by Death"". Capote's effete manner and often patronizing comments (e.g., he opined that all actors were basically stupid) made such a strong impression on me that it was not until much later that I realized he wrote such gems such as ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", ""The Grass Harp"", ""The Thanksgiving Visitor"", and of course, his seemingly atypical masterwork, ""In Cold Blood"". It is the intensive research and writing of this latter work, a self-proclaimed ""non-fiction novel"" published to great acclaim in 1965, which is the basis of this well-crafted though sometimes slowly paced movie.<br/><br/>For those who have not read ""In Cold Blood"" or seen the stark 1967 film adaptation directed by Richard Brooks, the true-life story focuses on Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, a pair of drifters who break into the home of a Kansas farm family in November 1959 based on a rumor that they had $10,000 stashed away. Upon discovering that the family had no money on hand, Smith and Hickock systematically killed the four members of the family. First-time director Bennett Miller recreates much of the book's plot, including the gory crime, within the context of the movie. On a broader level, this film focuses on Capote's journey of over four years in chronicling the story until the inevitable ending, and in the meantime getting to know the killers intimately, especially the more enigmatic Smith. Actor Dan Futterman, familiar from his guest turns on ""Will and Grace"" and ""Sex in the City"", has written a delicately balanced screenplay that highlights the contradictory forces with which Capote was grappling in getting his story on paper.<br/><br/>Although Miller's direction and Futterman's script are both strong for rookie efforts, the key to the film's effectiveness lies in the performances. In a startling transformation, Philip Seymour Hoffman inhabits Capote from the most subtle mannerism to his inner soul. Always a fine character actor, Hoffman brings his dead-on impersonation to a level of consciousness that exudes just the right shadings of narcissism, vulnerability and self-destruction. From the snippets of Capote regaling cocktail party guests in Manhattan with his stories to his useless wardrobe name-dropping in Kansas, there is no question in Hoffman's performance that Capote is a man in love with himself. As author Harper Lee, Capote's closest confidante and research partner on the killings, the always watchable Catherine Keener unaffectedly presents the sturdiness of her plain-spoken character, and their close, painfully honest relationship is believable.<br/><br/>The other striking performance is provided by Clifton Collins Jr., who brings out the alternating coldness and vulnerability in Smith, especially as his character naively and desperately comes to regard Capote as his friend. The prison cell scenes between Hoffman and Collins have an intriguing, disturbing charge that subconsciously seems to point to the homo-erotic nature of their relationship. Smaller roles are filled expertly  Chris Cooper in familiar territory as Sheriff Alvin Dewey and Bruce Greenwood as Capote's patient lover, author Jack Dunphy  though their scenes feel truncated compared to the rest of the story. In fact, the film feels rushed toward the end as Capote is obviously deeply affected by the events and his own culpability in the killers' fate. I only wish there was a greater sense of a denouement to the film, but regardless, the film is certainly worth seeing for Hoffman's masterful performance."
"siollan_riordan","9","0","0","10 December 2005"," One of the best films of 2005....utterly intriguing!
","I have to say that with all of the glitzy glamy movies that Hollywood has been putting out lately it was a rather pleasant surprise to leave the cinema with something to ponder other than my disappointment. Capote, it turns out, is a very engaging movie even for those with only a passing interest in the author or literature of the 20th century. The story is very obviously character-driven rather than being a pure historical/biographical film- something which I think made it so powerful. Likewise the acting was unquestionably superb with Catherine Keener and Cliffton Collins, Jr. in outstanding supporting roles. Philip Seymour Hoffman as Truman Capote was simply phenomenal, transcending anything that he's done in the past; watching him bring Capote to life was nothing short of incredible and I can only hope that he at least earns an Oscar nomination for his efforts. Without saying too much about the actual plot and spoiling it for those who have yet to be initiated into the fascinating world of Truman Capote so to speak, I would like only to say that it was well paced. Unlike most recent movies, the audience is allowed to savor the various revelations of the film and sit with the conflicting and sometimes uncomfortable emotions that they precipitate. Most recent films that I've seen drag you clumsily along with needless plot twists, never allowing any of things you witness to really sink in. Capote, on the contrary, allows its characters to coalesce carefully and to a large extent naturally, and one really gets a strong sense of the emotional and psychological make-up of these intriguing figures. This in turn also brings life the creative process behind the ground-breaking book which is at the heart of the whole story. The film penetrates the often romanticized world of the artist (in this case a novelist) making it very accessible and ""real"" to outside audiences- not something many other feature films of late can claim to have done (aside perhaps from the Hours). Overall, Capote is a superlative film, the likes which haven't been seen in a while. All I can say is that I hope there is more to come- Hollywood please take note!! :)... In my opinion, Capote is easily one of 2005's best movies."

","Capote is one of those movies that become more enjoyable if you are already familiar with what is about to happen on the screen. This movie is based on a book, which is based on the life of Truman Capote at the time he was researching and writing a non-fiction novel called In Cold Blood. So, there you go. The more you know about Capote and his books and his friends and his friends' books and some movies based on those books the more interested you might become in watching this film.<br/><br/>The nice thing about this movie is that it does not follow the biopic formula, which is basically this one: we meet a great man at the peek of his career and then flashback to his troubled childhood. We then get to see his teenage years, his first marriage, etc., until the day he dies. Capote only offers a few years in Capote's life, but it is written in a way that allows us to understand a lot about this man's past.<br/><br/>Everyone is saying that Philip Seymour Hoffman must get at least an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Capote. I agree. This actor has always been excellent. You might remember him from some small roles in movies such as Scent of a Woman, Boogie Nights, Happiness, Flawless, Punch Drunk Love, etc. He transforms himself in every one of these films and, even when the movies he is in are not that great (Flawless, for instance) his performance makes them watchable.<br/><br/>When the movie begins, Capote is already a recognized fiction writer. He decides to go to a small town where a family has been murdered. His idea is to write a non-fiction novel on how that small community is dealing with such a horrible crime. However, once he meets the murderers he realizes that they are not very different from him. He spends lots of time talking to one of them. He learns that this guy's horrible childhood is something Capote can easily relate to. And yet, one guy became a murderer and the other one a writer.<br/><br/>Capote has money and some power and he can help these murderers to get better lawyers. However, he also wants to finish his non-fiction novel and, what better way of ending it than with the execution of the assassins? I believe the screenplay is very well written. We get a very good idea of who Capote was: how he adored being adored, how he would even pay people to say nice things about him, how he loved being the center of attention at parties, how he was so selfish that he couldn't even enjoy his best friend's success.<br/><br/>This is one of those ""slow"" films. No one chases anyone, there is not a lot of suspense and the violence is handled with taste.

","This movie is stunning from beginning to end; however, I have voted to give it a 9 rather than a 10, because there were a few minutes somewhere in the middle when the exquisite tension slowed down or dragged a bit. But perhaps I'm being overly critical, because all in all this is a work of art. The writing, the direction, the visuals, the pace, the editing, all the performances, even the background sounds combine and result in a brilliant work, a total experience for the viewer--if a bit scary here and there. Regarding the lead performance, words are inadequate to describe Hoffman's ""reincarnation"" of Truman Capote. Too bad the real Capote could not have lived to see it, because he would have asked, ""Is that how I really look and sound?"" This reincarnation is truly eerie, but once the viewer becomes adjusted to it, we can go with the flow. ....I remember reading the book ""In Cold Blood"" when it was a best-seller, and now I feel compelled to find a copy on my bookshelf or otherwise rush out to the library or bookshop to grab a copy and reread it. Then I want to see the movie again."

","Calling Truman Capote the gay writer is not necessary now. I think the fact that he was a alcholic was a very imortant part of his life and people do not refer to him as the writer with a drinking problem why should the refer to him as the gay writer. I think that it was a sin the way that this film was distributed. I had to search for it . Film is about the writing of the book not his life. If you didn't know that Jack was his partner then you wasted your time watching the movie. As the old saying goes we tell jokes we don't explain them. Acting is fine. Supporting actors and actress were right on the money. The ending was more dramatic in the movie in Cold Blood because you were able to get closer to the Perry character. Or maybe I was younger and more effected."

","At first glance, Truman Capote is easy to caricature as an effete, liberal, New York snob of a writer. He had a soft, high voice. He lisped. His mannerisms were feminine. His first book, Breakfast at Tiffany's (based loosely on his relationship with Marilyn Monroe) is the sort of lightweight matter that would make you pigeonhole him as a minor author. But as Phillip Hoffman's masterful portrayal shows, Capote was much more complex. He was capable of being a warm, caring man and a manipulative careerist, frequently at the same time. His writing skills were first-rate, and he founded a literary genre than many have explored since his time.<br/><br/>The scenes where Capote interviews and bonds with one of the killers, Perry Smith, are extraordinary in their subtlety and depth. The two men mesh like the negative and the print of the same photograph. Capote uses their common background both to give Smith genuine moral support and to extract the particulars of his life and heinous crime that made In Cold Blood a blockbuster. From Smith's end, he uses the relationship to get a better lawyer for an appeal and fill the desperate void of loneliness within him.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for Smith, Capote holds the upper hand. To give his book a solid ending, he needs the specifics of the violence that took place that fateful night of the murder. He also needs Smith and his partner executed. He pushes Smith's buttons intuitively and expertly, alternately radiating warmth and professional hardness in order to crack Smith open for descriptions of the bloodletting. As the movie progresses, Hoffman's mounting anguish over the conflict between supporting Smith and pursuing his own agenda became both compelling and repellent. I wanted to shake Capote and tell him that gaining his objective would ultimately damage him. Evidently, it did. Capote never finished another full-length novel (although he twice won the O. Henry Memorial Short Story Prize), and he died from complications of substance abuse at age 59.<br/><br/>The movie is not without flaws. Between the Capote-Smith interview scenes, the movie drags. The sub-plot involving Capote's relationship with his lover never gains traction. And his friendship with Lee Harper (author of To Kill a Mockingbird) serves only to provide another perspective on Capote himself. But these are forgivable flaws in light of two of the best performances of 2005."

","I normally steer clear of films that reek of Oscar, but this turned out to be far more than a parlor trick by the able impersonator Hoffman.

We learn how high a price Capote paid for his persistence in hunting down the story of this infamous Midwestern massacre, and how far he went to see his masterpiece through. Every performance deserves an award, the technical aspects are beyond reproach, the storytelling and script are clear as a bell without an unnecessary moment. But most breathtaking of all is the way Hoffman portrays Capote's unshakable faith in his own genius."

I could not believe how well he carried the role, with the speech and actions. The whole cast was excellent and especially Clifton Collins Jr. who played one of the killers. The only objection I found with this wonderful film was it was very slow moving and seemed at times to drag out somewhat.

"akavar","9","0","0","11 November 2005"," Outstanding Character Study
","By now there has been so much said about how great Philip Seymour Hoffman portrayed Capote in this movie, that it almost seems like hype. However, I found that Mr. Hoffman fully lived the Capote character and I admit to being transported back to my memory is as a child watching Truman Capote on the Johnny Carson and other talk shows. Having seen Mr. Hoffman in numerous other roles over the last 10 years, I firmly believe that this is amongst his absolute best work. I have always liked Mr. Hoffman and I feel this is at minimum Oscar nomination, if not Oscar award winning, material.<br/><br/>It can be very difficult for an actor to portray an iconic historical figure with believability. When I watched Leonardo DiCaprio portraying Howard Hughes in Martin Scorsese's ""The Aviator"", I found myself thinking several things. At times I actually thought I was truly viewing Howard Hughes. At other times I thought I was seeing Leonardo DiCaprio portraying Howard Hughes. And other times all I saw was Leonardo DiCaprio and I was saying to myself ""He's not even portraying Howard Hughes"". At no time during ""Capote"" did I ever feel that I was not seeing Truman Capote on screen. My commendations to Mr. Hoffman on such great work.<br/><br/>As to the movie itself, it was an excellent portrayal of an artist caught up in the subject of his work. Because of Mr. Capote's intense interest in his subject, he became extremely personally involved with the criminals. This intense involvement eventually lead to Mr. Capote's total destruction as an artist. Contrast, the character of Holly Golightly in ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" with the Perry Smith character from ""In Cold Blood"". The emotional involvement and emotional identification that Mr. Capote had with Perry Smith caused him to cease to be able to function as an artist, and eventually caused an early death for Mr. Capote. Mr. Capote vacated the light fluffy world of ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" and journeyed to the stark grim world of murder on the high plains. He made this journey physically, emotionally, and most importantly, artistically. The grimness of what really happens to innocent people, and the consequences for those were who perpetrate crimes on these innocent people was something that Mr. Capote could not avoid experiencing in a visceral manner. The acceptance and true understanding of this insight into the human psyche destroyed Mr. Capote.<br/><br/>The moving portrayal and its associated undercurrents was portrayed in a manner that most people should be able to understand. The movie is about an extremely violent crime and the psychology of what happens to the writer documenting the criminals following the crime. The violence is portrayed in a sensitive manner, because it needs to be there. We have to understand what actually happened, but thankfully, where spared from any sensationalism. This after all, is a study of the various characters involved, not a history rendition of the crime. This character study was written and directed in a very artful manner, and I believe we could see some Oscar nominations for the various other artists involved with the production of this movie.<br/><br/>Overall I would rate this movie as a must see for this year. Do not wait for it to come out on DVD. Go and see it in the theater."

This movie has affected me for days. When PSH first came on I actually gasped and as the story progressed I was in awe. The performance and the story was dead on. The six year process killed him. He was never quite the same after that and fell into any intoxicant he could get his hands on. The guilt he held for so long overcame him. The cinematography only added to the dour feeling.

","Fascinating portrait of an incredibly complex and gifted writer. Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance is amazing; despite his lack of resemblance to Capote, he so inhabits the character that it's easily overlooked.<br/><br/>What's always mystified me is how such an odd-sounding, fey little man could've infiltrated the homes, and souls, of people so unlike him, especially in the uptight 1950s. The movie deftly answers, by showing how Capote combined wit, the attraction of celebrity, and simple courtesy and kindness to overcome the resistance of clannish Midwesterners and sociopathic criminals. Even as his subject, Perry Smith, learns that he's being played by Capote, and learns the depths of Capote's betrayal of his appeals of his murder case, he still can't help reaching out, even as his time runs out.<br/><br/>Powerful supporting cast, especially Catherine Keener as Harper Lee, Capote's childhood friend, research assistant, and literary rival (his petty jealousy over her success with To Kill a Mockingbird is especially telling). She's the only one capable of calling him on his manipulative ways, and the only one capable of seeing past his egocentricity to see the insecure, small man beneath. Bruce Greenwood and Chris Cooper are fine in underwritten roles. But the real revelation here is Clifton Collins Jr., as the doomed murderer, Perry Smith. Collins' portrayal, both sympathetic and vaguely menacing, should certainly earn him an Oscar nomination for supporting actor."

","The film does an excellent job, as of course does its lead actor, in portraying a snapshot of time in the life of Truman Capote. Additionally, it cleverly allows the viewer to witness a momentous time in the writer's life while getting glimpses of his potentially true characteristics. One can see at this pinnacle time in his career, as the film implies, how the events he chose to pursue created the man that most people know as Capote.<br/><br/>All the same, I feel that a biography the film was not. It's not that I wanted to see a biography--I just think the film's title doesn't do the overall topic justice. I may have opted for a title more on the head like, The Deceptor, or The Deception of Truman Capote; something that addressed the characteristics of the man and of the focus of the film. (I know Deceptor isn't a word - just an idea)."

","Aside from the fact that Hoffman(Capote)can easily win the Best Actor Oscar and rightly so, the film was dreadful. One of the slowest moving movies I ever saw. And there was so much alcohol consumption in it, which, by the way did eventually kill Truman Capote, I nearly staggered out of the lobby into the street. <br/><br/>With the discovery of DNA, I am a death penalty advocate. Heck, I was that way even before DNA but only if there was absolutely no question as to the guilt of the defendant. Now, regarding this film,it turns out that Mr. Capote takes a real shine to one of the two mass murderers of the Clutter family in a small Kansas town in Nov.1959. Capote had just come off a sterling triumph by penning ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" and while living off its proceeds, one day he spies a newspaper article about the mass murder, cuts it out and away he goes to write a book about it. The tome was not going to be ordinary but the cat's meow--the best fiction-non fiction book of all time and he gets a slap on the back of encouragment from his friend Harper Lee, the authoress of ""To Kill A Mockingbird.""<br/><br/>And so Truman goes to Kansas on several fact finding missions, missions designed to give him the tools for the job, and by golly if he doesn't become infatuated with one of the condemned, Perry Smith. It's interesting to analyze the basis for this odd situation. I came up with the following: 1. Capote was homosexual and found Smith his type of partner. 2. Capote wanted to strongly advocate against the death penalty. 3. Capote's interest was merely self-serving to earn mucho bucks from <br/><br/>two guys on death row 4. Capote liked hanging around Kansas because of fondness for seeing <br/><br/>wheat and corn stalks 5. Capote was so liberal that he didn't mind springing two killers to<br/><br/>terrorize the rest of us<br/><br/>I am positive that the truth lies(pardon the pun)in the midst of the above 5 hypotheses however, after being tortured by this movie for 98 minutes, as Rhett told Scarlett, ""I don't give a damn."" All I know is that Mr. Hoffman, as Capote, did a remarkable job and I went home before going entirely mad."

","Aside from how he wrote the book ""In Cold Blood"" there was very little else about the life and work of Truman Capote. Overall, the film was very depressing and only showed a small part of Capote's life.<br/><br/>The actor who played Capote seems to have over acted. Since Truman Capote was a serious writer it is hard to believe he always behaved in the way he is depicted in this film. When he was alive he sometimes appeared in public to be intoxicated but it is hard to believe that a person in this condition could have written as much and as well as Capote did.<br/><br/>Also the actor sometimes overdid Capote's southern accent, making it hard to understand what he is saying some of the time - I thought the film could use subtitles in some parts."

","On the night of 14 November 1959, in Holcomb, Kansas, a farmhouse is broken into by the criminals Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.) and Dick Hickock (Mark Pellegrino) that expect to get US$ 10,000.00.

I have never seen the weird Truman Capote or read his book, but it seems that the interpretation of Philip Seymour Hoffman is perfect based on many reviews. In spite of that, I found the image of this American writer presented in this boring low-paced overrated movie of a despicable, unpleasant, manipulative, unstable, substances addicted homosexual, capable of defending a criminal for his self-profit.

"kaimono2001","5","2","5","28 October 2006"," exceptional acting, weak story
","I think I need to stop reading books which movies are based on prior to seeing them, because I am almost always disappointed. In this case I read the classic ""In Cold Blood"" not Capote's biography, so I don't have an exact comparison. However, while In Cold Blood is engaging and very creepy and disturbing, I didn't feel quite the same about this movie. Again lack of character development and detail weaken this movie. It is so much easier to empathize with the criminals, clutter family, friends and locals in Halcomb in In Cold Blood, which is why it is a classic. Since this movie focuses on that time period in Capote's life, I feel many of those involved in the writing of his novel were left out. Also, Perry as described in the novel (having a personality disorder) and Perry depicted in the movie(somewhat sane) seem like two different people. Ironically, Dick who is described as sane yet malicious in the novel seems crazy. I left this movie not really feeling much about anyone. Although Huffman's acting was exceptional, as well as the acting of the supporting actors, I didn't really feel I understood Capote. When comparing it to the book, it doesn't quite answer what the process of writing the book was like. By this I mean mentally. For example, why does he continually lie to Perry about the book? Why is In Cold Blood written differently than what is depicted in this movie?? In a sense, is the movie saying that Capote lied not only to Perry and those he loved, but also his audience? More detail about that would be quite interesting, and maybe show the magnitude of his self absorbency and greed. So I feel if I hadn't read In Cold Blood I probably would have really enjoyed this movie (since I don't know much about Truman Capote himself). Therefore, the best advice is to enter the movie completely ignorant and it's good. However, now I'm only left with questions. So 5 stars for acting -5 stars for depth."

Once again, Hollywood managed to fool me into renting a useless and shallow film with limited artistic value and negligible intellectual challenge. The movie paralyzed me emotionally and intellectually, leaving me not caring about any of its characters or content. I kept waiting for it to heat up and develop into some kind of ethical or legal controversy, but to no avail. Half way through it, I found myself checking the counter on my DVD player to find out how much longer I have to endure this torturous peace of work. I never understood the significance of Capote's personal life, nor his bonding/fascination with this cold blooded killer. I didn't really care about Hoffman's performance and could care less about his skills in imitating or looking like the real Capote. For some reason, it seems that Hollywood, and the so called critics, are discovering new standards for arts. They have been building whole movies around the ability of certain actors to imitate some famous persons from the past such as Capote, Ed Murrow and others. Who cares if they can mimic the actors look and sound?!? You need a story first, not last. They are building shallow stories around actors' talents, not the other way around. Why did someone felt the need to make a film about Capote and a half century old murder!? What is the significance of such an annoying person? Just because they found someone who can imitate him! The movie did not entertain me, engage me emotionally or intellectually, or provoke me. It just bored the hell out of me."

","Greetings again from the darkness. This is a powerful, mesmerizing, disquieting film. It is the fascinating story of a fascinating story. For those of us old enough to remember Truman Capote, it is chilling to see his reincarnation through Phillip Seymour Hoffman. For those of us who have read Capote's book ""In Cold Blood"", it is gut-wrenching to witness some of what brought the book to life. For lovers of film, this one is a must see.<br/><br/>Hoffman has spent years building an impressive resume in Hollywood, ranging from exceptional support work (""Scent of a Woman"" ""Twister"") to underrated indie leads (""Owning Mahoney"" ""Love Liza""). He is a craftsman and artist, an actor's actor. His turn as Capote transcends anything he has ever done. This is no impersonation. While watching the movie, we forget he is an actor. He is Capote as we become lost in the story.<br/><br/>The essence of the film is Capote's bizarre attraction to one of the two men accused of the brutal slaying of a rural Kansas family. Much speculation has occurred over Capote's relationship with Perry Smith, but make no mistake, it led to his most important work and probably his lost soul.<br/><br/>Director Bennett Miller does a nice job of letting the character and story speak. No fancy camera stuff. Capote poses and alternates between the torn character visiting Smith in prison and the master celebrity holding court with the ""in"" New York crowd.<br/><br/>Catherine Keener turns in some fine support work as Nelle Harper Lee, Capote's childhood friend and the writer of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"". Ms. Lee's story could make a fine film as her life as a recluse rivals that of J.D. Salinger. One must wonder of the collaborative efforts of Lee and Capote.<br/><br/>Not a film for everyone, but it is definitely for those who enjoy the highest quality acting within a remarkable story line."
"filmmakerck17","3","4","14","13 November 2005"," Capote failed to sweep a lamen off his feet
","Beautiful cinematography. This is the most prominent thing I took from Capote. From the first frame I was captivated by the imagery. Being a filmmaker myself I was stunned by the beautiful camera work and lush Kansas landscapes.<br/><br/>We now go from what I thought deserved those three stars and delve into the seven missing stars and what I felt didn't deserve them. Keeping in mind that I went into this film a lamen, completely unaware of its contents, who Capote was, and what I was about to see. (and if you try to use that as a defense for this film, I'd only regurgitate storytelling 101 -that any good story should appeal to and inform those who aren't familiar with the subject matter, or else why tell a story at all? I didn't have to be a machinist to enjoy ""The Machinist"", I shouldn't have to be a Capote fan to enjoy his story) My first annoyance occurred in the first scene featuring Phillip Seymore Hoffman in the city telling jokes. I noticed a directing style that reminded me of Dylan Kidd ala Rodger Dodger. A sort of shaky hand-held camera-work with sparse cutting and focusing on certain things in the background from time to time. I thought it suited Rodger Dodger because it was constant and served the narrative. Capote? Not exactly considering the cinematography ended up seeming random by the end. Indeed it distracted me a bit considering that the previous cinematography in the beginning was so well done and would have satisfied me if it had continued consistently.<br/><br/>From the first moment, PCH's performance distracted me. I kept finding myself concentrating on his acting. To be honest, I thought the voice he used was utterly ridiculous and forced at times. But as I watched it, I had a feeling folks would be praising it as the best acting of the year. I thought the emotion he could well up was extraordinary, but the voice seemed forced to me, be it a right on duplicate of the original Capote's voice or not. And I also feel that he was straining to get the caricature down so much that we lost some of the humanity in his performance. I think he's a great actor, but no human being could act competently through all those layers of mannerisms and that unnatural voice.<br/><br/>I thought this film failed at placing me anywhere but vaguely in the same room with Capote at random times and intervals. I felt as though I wasn't seeing the pivotal moments, but that I was seeing random in-betweens. Only at a few key moments did I feel as though I was in Capotes shoes. The film failed to put me in Kansas where the family was murdered for more than that brief instance toward the beginning. It failed to put me in that cell on death row for more than a second or two. I never felt ""in"" on the decision making process at any point and I basically felt as though I was following Capote around for a while and waiting for new information the rest of the time. As time went on I began to just feel as though I was witnessing events presented to me randomly as the big decisions had been cut out. I got a very distinct disconnected feeling. Of course feeling in his shoes is a subjective thing, but I felt as though no one but die-hard Capote fans would be able to feel as though they were truly along for the ride.<br/><br/>I believe this film wasted the majority of its time. From a storytelling standpoint it seemed to drag at every stage, a lot of its time spend on dead air, irrelevant conversations, and repetition of already known facts from said conversations. Not enough information was divulged in the given time-frame. We as an audience should have known the reasons for Capote going to Kansas in the first place to write this book -all in great detail, the relationship with Bruce Greenwood's character(they wasted this actor in my opinion, but I say so as a fan), and basically have gotten some kind of resolution other than the text given before the credits. I never really got what Capote or any supporting characters were like on a personal level. Maybe to see his life fall apart at the end? That would have made this waiting pay off.<br/><br/>Other than beautiful city/landscapes, this film from a directorial standpoint lacked anything exceedingly interesting. Basically it consisted of harsh cuts and a few fades to black. I found that most of the angles were just ordinary 'get the job done' kinda shots, maybe some interesting camera movement here or there, but nothing truly engrossing. I was constantly able to realize ""Hey, I'm watching a movie... and it's pretty boring."" In all, I thought the same story could have been told 100% better in the same time-frame. More information, more convincing characters, faster dialog, and a faster pacing altogether could have done this film well. Did this great story really need any/all that? Well, in the end, every element of this story has been told before. FCH has played a flamboyantly gay character very similar to Capote in another film called ""Flawless"". Killers on deathrow telling their story to one lucky journalist with a lot in common with them -is certainly well worn territory, ""Killer: A Journal of Murder"" for one. And families of four have been slain in a much more gripping fashion to be sure, in more films than I care to mention.<br/><br/>I'm left wanting more information; more about every character in this film. There was certainly time enough for double the info we got, and it would have served to better flesh out whats really what and who's really who and why."

First, this screenplay demands that we ache for a sad one hit wonder of a writer and his grotesque infatuation for a quadruple murder who, ""In Cold Blood"", murdered a father, a mother, their son, and their daughter. For nothing. Their murders, much like the source material, are used only as a means to comprehend the killers.

And Dan Futterman? Why? How sick do you have to be to write THIS story from THIS point of view? And where did this phantom boyfriend come from? There is no historical basis for Truman Capote to have a ""boyfriend"".

","Capote seemed bent on presentation for presentation's sake, not trying to construct a picture as a stand alone work. I'm usually a fairly accurate judge of what I will like and dislike and so I had put off watching Capote because way too many people were buzzing about how hip Capote was. Usually whenever the general public talks about how hip or artistic something is they're discussing something that is a cliché, so familiar that it is hip in the cartoon sense, palatable for the general masses. Hardly something that is cutting edge or unique. Very much like the new sirloin burger at MacDonald's, not what I'd call real gourmet cuisine.<br/><br/>The main reason I decided to finally watch Capote was because I had watched Infamous one night a month or so back and was so pleased I watched Capote the next night. The first night I was left surprised and thinking, the next I was left sleepy and disappointed. Capote was so busy with trying to create atmosphere and style it never developed the characters with anywhere near the depth that Infamous did so briefly and elegantly. The solid character development in Infamous was due to much better casting all around as well as a much more alive script with rich, layered dialog. I was impressed by all the performances in Infamous, even the usually commercially thin Sandra Bullock who, sans make-up, appears as real and convincing as I've ever seen her. By the way, who did the singing for Gwyneth Paltrow? If it was her, she may have missed her true calling. Capote on the other hand, most (almost all) of the characters were presented as thin, stock characters used to push the story along, as well as manipulate your emotions and mostly to support the starring role of Hoffman. As a side note, I'm usually a big fan of almost all instrumental soundtracks but the repetitive piano chords replayed over and over in Capote, an obvious and flaccid attempt to create a gloomy, heavy mood, became a distracting annoyance after the umpteenth time. By the end of Capote I was bored and distracted and felt that the obvious attempt to manipulate me as an audience member failed. I also felt detached and uninterested in all the characters, nothing had happened to give me a sense of their unique humanness or that most of them were real. Infamous on the other hand, I found to be one of the most intriguing and touching love stories I have seen in quite a long time. I happen to be a straight male who usually sees most theatrical (and public) displays of love as false, unconvincing and badly clichéd. Toby Jones and Daniel Craig were both very much alive and the love they created fascinating. And though they were of characters that I would not think I could find so interesting and feel so much for, a psychotic criminal and a gay society party boy, I was nevertheless quite touched by their love and seriously saddened by its tragedy. I was finally able to realize very clearly after Infamous why Truman Capote slowly self destructed after writing ""In Cold Blood"". It did the job of top notch cinema and art, it changed my perspective on many points. To paraphrase the Perry Smith character from Infamous, it had the most important element to writing and a great story and which Capote lacked: kindness.<br/><br/>Granted, Mr. Hoffman does give an admirable performance in Capote but it's just that: a performance. He appears to be acting. To me the essence of great casting is to find someone who so fits the character they really don't need to act. Great acting should never be obvious, it should be invisible. Toby Jones was a much more accurate fit and gave a much more natural (and therefore believable) performance as the real Truman Capote than Philip Seymour Hoffman working so hard to act like Truman Capote.<br/><br/>Capote was not bad but a bit of a moody disappointment, much like it's repetitive soundtrack, striking one chord over and over again in an overdone, calculating fashion. Infamous, on the other hand, was not only surprisingly more entertaining, richer and alive but I think a more accurate picture of the real Truman Capote than the rather one sided, coldly brooding version in Capote. If Mr. Capote were so cold blooded and ruthless I hardly think he would have been the darling of high society everywhere. Capote was adored by the party jet set everywhere when he was still happy and living life with such glee. And even though he could be a vicious gossip and somewhat of a backstabber he still had a tremendous charm and real affection for others, otherwise it's quite doubtful he would have had so many devoted friends. In Capote the charm and affection for others is just not there, certainly not as it is in Infamous, which paints a more human and humane picture of Mr. Capote.<br/><br/>It's true that ""In Cold Blood"" led to Truman's deterioration. If you want to see the underpinnings that were responsible for zapping his life away I think you'll find Infamous to be more accurate as well as a much more enjoyable motion picture experience."

","who cares about this pathetic little man? I noticed in the Hated it section, one person found the first 30 minutes interesting and then everything after that boring. Strangely, my take was exactly the opposite. I was about to write it off but then Chris Cooper's part happened and the movie had a sudden infusion of energy. I like Hoffman as an actor but I like him when his own persona comes through, like it did in Scent of a Woman, Twister, Talented Mr. Ripley, etc. Obviously, making movies is ALL about the benjamins...let's face it. Playing somebody who actually lived is 10 times better than playing a fictional character. Cate Blanchett and Judi Dench played Queen Elizabeth and were nominated for best actress, Jim Carrey was nominated for playing Andy Kaufman, Robert Downey got his shot and blew it with Chaplin...the point is, those actors KNEW they were being given their dream shot. A license to print money. Once they get an Oscar, it's hello twenty million per picture while the rest of us slog along in our dreary lives sucking up to them, as if those people have any value. Their entire LIVES are based on non-real things. The smart ones become drug addicts and suicides. At least it shows they have some understanding of how pathetic they are. Capote did too, so he killed himself REAL SLOWLY by drinking himself to death. In fact, when they scanned his brain while he was still alive - if you can call those type of people alive - they found that it had LOST MASS! And there are still people EVERYWHERE who say that his lifestyle...nudge nudge, wink, wink...is perfectly acceptable. You know, whatever dude. Have fun encased in ice."
"edwagreen","5","2","6","7 April 2006"," Capote: Boring Clunker **
","Philip Seymour Hoffman, ordinarily a tremendous actor, is downright dull in this film regarding Truman Capote's research for ""In Cold Blood."" <br/><br/>In several ways the film reminded me of the 1951 classic ""A Place in the Sun."" While violence and death are occurring, we sing interactions among the wealthy in high society. Also, that farewell scene between Capote and the condemned killers was similar in nature to that of Elizabeth Taylor visiting a condemned Montgomery Clift.<br/><br/>The differences were that the characters in ""Place"" were more alive. The killers in ""Capote"" were sadistic sickos who definitely got what they deserved. No question whatsoever here in the use of capital punishment.<br/><br/>I was wondering if Capote used the title ""In Cold Blood"" to describe what was actually done to the killers of the Clutter Family. He lies to one of the condemned murderers when they question him about the title of his book.<br/><br/>Naturally, Capote had formed a homosexual bond with one of the killers. This conflicted him for he fully realized what this guy had done and the guy's own sister condemned him as well.<br/><br/>Katherine Keener, who received a best supporting actress Oscar nomination, for Harper Lee is wasted in this film. Shown as a chain smoking writer, she is given little to do in the movie. Surely, the writer of ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" deserved better than this. Then again, we deserved a better film as well."

"christian-manasci","6","1","2","5 December 2018"," Disappointing
","Having just completed Truman Capote's gripping non-fiction novel In Cold Blood the night before, perhaps my expectations were never going to be met. Granted, this is not a film adaptation of that masterpiece, although it undeniably plays a big role in the plot. Unfortunately, the story's complexities and subtle, nuanced characterizations are given an all too simplistic treatment.<br/><br/>Anyone who has seen The Master, Boogie Nights or Magnolia knows what a masterful performer Philip Seymour Hoffman is. His portrayal is impressive, yet it often veers too close to caricature. That strange, high-pitched voice can feel like a really good impression more than anything else.<br/><br/>He's not helped by a workmanlike script that eschews subtlety, opting instead for an easy, broad-strokes narrative. Whole chunks of plot are dispensed with in late-night telephone conversations that never ring true.<br/><br/>Chris Cooper's pointless chief investigator feels nothing like the book's Alvin Dewey. He is instead very ""Chris Cooper-y"": a stoic, stone-faced man's man that spends his time on screen storming out of rooms.<br/><br/>But most damaging of all is how the film chooses to handle the two killers. Richard Hickock might not have pulled the trigger on that fateful night, yet In Cold Blood is unequivocal about his key part in the murders. He barely registers here, and is instead treated like a cameo.<br/><br/>This could have been excused if the relationship with Perry Smith, the main crux of the film (and arguably, of In Cold Blood) was satisfactory. Clifton Collins Jr. is not a bad actor, but he doesn't come close to the real thing, or at least, to the Perry Smith described in Capote's book.<br/><br/>This guy was an insecure, boastful, angry, sometimes charming man, with complex psychological issues. Yet he is reduced to a quiet, naive, kindly guy. By the end of the film, as he finally reveals what happened on that fateful night, you half-expect him to break down in tears and proclaim his innocence. His portrayal as a fallen angel is dangerously misleading.<br/><br/>The movie desperately wants to generate a powerful connection between Capote and Smith, yet it feels forced. Their relationship does not come close to having the depth required, which robs the emotional climax of any authenticity.<br/><br/>Again, I'll fully admit that having just read In Cold Blood prior to seeing this, I was kind of setting it up to fail. But I truly think such a fantastic writer, and such a masterful novel, deserved a bit more effort and a bit more subtlety."

","The murder case that a family was killed happened and Truman Capote starts writing the book from the murder. He visits the scene of the murder and contacts the murderers to get some materials. This film describes the process that Truman Capote has finished off his work, In Cold Bloody. I have not read his novel much less I did not know that Capote was an actual writer before watching this film. However this film makes me feel reading his novel especially In Cold Bloody because I got some information and background about him through this film. This film describes the background of the terrible murder and the feeling and idea of Capote. I recommend everyone to watch this film in spite of whether you have read In Cold Bloody or not because this film describes the background of the novel well. And if you have not read the book, you must get to want to read it like me."
"g-bodyl","8","1","2","29 August 2013"," Powered By Strong Performances!!
","Capote is a well-directed film that has a strong centralized performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman. The story itself is great and interesting and I really liked the rather dark tone of the story. I was also pleased by the cinematography and the camera shots of the 1950's Kansas. The movie seems to go a bit long, but that is crossed out by a well-written and memorable screenplay.<br/><br/>Bennett Miller's film focuses on six years of Truman Capote's life as he is writing a novel based on the true killings of four people in Kansas. Truman meets with one of the killers in jail and ends up making friends with him. However, this will change his life forever.<br/><br/>The acting is a strong point for the film. Hoffman delivers an amazing performance as Capote and it shows he can act in just about anything and do it well. His voice was a bit annoying but since that is how Capote spoke, I can't complain. The supporting actors led by Catherine Keener, Clifton Collins Jr, and Chris Cooper are also pretty good.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great if not somewhat of a long film. It's not long as the it feels like it though. But great direction, acting, and a taut screenplay delivers the goods. There is many talking scenes but they are very interesting. I rate this film 8/10."
"CountZero313","9","1","2","12 January 2009"," the artist as voyeur
","Never meet your heroes, we are told, as they will invariably disappoint. Any Truman Capote fans will testify to the veracity of that after this chilling account of Capote's process of researching his non-fiction work, In Cold Blood. Hoffman has been lauded for his portrayal of the writer, another success in the niche of acting as impersonation that has proliferated in recent years (Ali, Ray, The Hours, Walk the Line, The Aviator...). The horror of the crime, the self-absorption of the writer, the disdain of the killers - this is a story that appears to lack redemption and offer up only squalor. The film rises above that material by focusing on the symbiotic relationship of Capote and Perry Smith, two incomplete, emotionally stunted individuals, feeding their mutual need for as long as they can make it last. Clifton Collins Jr. matches Hoffman's performance with chill and vulnerability as the naive but ruthless Smith. The film's triumph is to have you rooting for Smith against the antagonistic Capote. When Capote finally gets what he wants - a full confession from Smith - the irony is that the raw horror of it breaks him, forcing him to confront his own amorality. The quiet power of the killer forgiving the artist at the climax is stunning. This is a complex film, disturbing, that dares to challenge big themes, and rewards greatly."

He's quite an actor and deserving of the great reviews and the Oscar he got for this, but the film just didn't grab me. It was interesting to watch Capote working the angles to get the story, it was heartbreaking to see Perry Smith's talent and intelligence (at least as portrayed in the film) having been wasted, it was interesting to see how Capote manipulated Perry to get what he wanted, but it didn't add up to a great movie. It's not something I'd heartily recommend to someone. It's certainly going to take someone who likes more cerebral movies to watch it (too many people think movies are for disconnecting your brain). I liked it for the performances, but it could have been a better movie. In the final analysis, I was a bit disappointed."

","""More tears are shed over answered prayers than unanswered ones"".<br/><br/>i really liked this film even though i didn't know or hear much about this inspiring individual, Truman Capote. we are told about him through a murder story which he follows in order to write an article about but after discovering a few things he decides an article wont be enough and a book is what he wants to write, the best one he ever wrote, the one he was chosen to write.after some time the 2 murderers are found, arrested, guilty and charged by the death penalty.by that time Truman has Perry Smith, one of the murderers very interesting and eventually his main inspiration for the book, so not only is he becoming his friend but he also finds them a very good lawyer that gets them an appeal that gives Truman more time with his new friend and more material for his new book.Perry is cooperative because he believes in Truman as a true friend that his book will help him get out of jail.for Truman it is the same in the start but after some time he finds that there is no other way for him to go on with this relationship without lying to Perry and telling him what it is he wants to hear.<br/><br/>watching this will make you want to imagine what it feels like to be in Truman Capote's shoes in this very complex situation he dealt with.great things have a great cost, for his best book he had to pay with his life.maybe he didn't die right away but after this his life was never again the way it was before, it just kept going downfall.he prayed for Perry and his fellow murderer to finally die and his prayer was answered.thinking about it makes it easy for me to understand that for an answered prayer like this there will be much more tears shed than for any other unanswered one."
"AshLlewellyn","7","1","2","10 October 2006"," Banal
","This film portrays Truman Capote's interest in the brutal and enigmatic murder of a family in rural Kansa which led him to pen In Cold Blood. It focuses upon the personality of Capote as he wrestles with his feelings of intrigue in the details of the case, and his guilt as he begins to manipulate the lives of the subjects in order to best fulfil his literary ambition.<br/><br/>Much has been made of Hoffman's performance, and indeed it is an excellent one. He becomes Capote, and in the series of small rooms in which his character's effete charisma reigns, wonderfully conveys the eccentric writer's deep inner-tumult.<br/><br/>Hoffman's skills, however, are wasted on a mundane narrative. Scene follows scene with very little dramatic tension. Whilst the intrigue of these events centred around the shocking violence which intruded upon a peaceful setting, the screenwriter simply did not scratch beneath the surface of any of the characters to the extent that anything substantial is said about the murders themselves or Capote's interest in them. Vague, simplistic allusions stand in for the presence of the type of deft analysis that one might demand of a movie based around extremely tired events. Indeed, if it were not for Hoffman's sublime performance, his genius, this would be a dire two hours. Unfortunately, however, he can not create tension, profundity, insight, nor depth, where these qualities do not exist. As a result, the film languishes as a lavishly made and commandingly acted B-grade script."
"Aristides-2","6","1","2","27 May 2006"," *Based On A True Story But With Some Unfortunate Major Changes
","Yes it is a great performance by Hoffman and it shows the hustling Capote with his many personality and character flaws. *My main major complaint is that some huge reality issues of the true story were changed to accommodate a Hollywood story. You know, the usual BS that even talented writers engage in on this level of film-making. Two examples:1) To make the Capote/Smith bonding even more, errrrh, maternal, they show Capote giving Smith a reason to live as he feeds him baby food (get it folks!) when Smith is in an advanced stage of starving himself to death. The reality was that Smith's long lost father (who had a loaded rifle pointed at the junior Smith the last time they saw each other in Alaska) somehow heard of his son's plight and wrote a letter to him on death row. Ten years later, that is. This created an emotional response from his son that brought him back to life;his father cared for him<br/><br/>and he credits this with making him want to continue the fight against the state's decision to kill him. It wasn't Capote's loving care. 2) At the end, as the execution grew closer, Smith pleaded with the only friend he had left in life (was Hickok a friend?), Capote, to witness the execution. He would find this something of a consolation. Capote said he would and arrived in Kansas but couldn't face the actual hanging. So the sociopathic Smith, before the hood was placed over his head, scanned the faces, hoping for a final human contact. What an ending folks! In closing, why can't writers/filmmakers stay with the facts, the truth, when they're dealing with people's stories? In ""Capote"" they changed things to structure the story and make it (from their point of view exclusively) more ""dramatically balanced"". Make Capote more caring. Well, people's lives, in extremis, are often not neat;including scenes like this in a story is what can make for greatness in a movie."
"Bunuel1976","8","1","2","5 May 2006"," CAPOTE (Bennett Miller, 2005) ***1/2
","Despite (or perhaps because of) its low-key nature, this emerges as a better film than either CRASH (2004) or BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN (2005). Its success, clearly, is due mainly to Philip Seymour Hoffman's uncanny portrayal that deservedly won him several accolades (chief among them the Best Actor Oscar). For the record, I've watched 5 films that were either scripted by Truman Capote or adapted from his books - INDISCRETION OF AN American WIFE (1953), BEAT THE DEVIL (1953), BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S (1961), THE INNOCENTS (1961) and IN COLD BLOOD (1967) - but also his one acting role in MURDER BY DEATH (1976).<br/><br/>While the film's title would suggest a biopic, strictly speaking it isn't - as the script focuses on just one, albeit pivotal, incident in the author's life. Its careful depiction of a Midwestern American town gives the film an air of authenticity, but this is contrasted with Capote's flamboyant lifestyle and the high-class milieu he typically inhabits.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the film's gay subtext is not overstressed. It is however suggested in Capote's relationship with one of the killers (which I have no way of knowing whether this is how it really was, or whether it was merely 'invented' by the script); the result of this, unfortunately, is that the second killer - displayed in a one-dimensional (i.e. unsympathetic) fashion - doesn't really get his due! I've only watched Richard Brooks' superb film version of IN COLD BLOOD (which was itself remade as a TV mini-series in 1996!) once - but I did recall instances from it (particularly the massacre and the subsequent execution of the culprits) through their representation in CAPOTE - and I would certainly have watched it again now, were my two VCRs not being repaired at the moment!!"

","On one level the film is about the true story of a highly intelligent author who decides to write about a murder case.<br/><br/>One of several sub themes of the film is ""the aesthetic vs. society"". It is an old theme: The artist is so fixated on his aesthetics that his activities come into conflict with morality and norms that ""normal"" people follow. In this film we see how Capote ends up selling his soul.<br/><br/>What makes this film so good is the way this is done. The almost dreadful process is displayed with tender, sensitivity and a sensation of dire awareness.<br/><br/>The film is kind of slow, which will put some people off. This is not a weakness, it is fundamental to convey the unique feeling of the film, which is what I remember second best. What I remember best is Hoffmann's brilliant acting. It should be the other way around, and this is why I can't give the film a top score."

Movie is well made with wonderful acting performance from Hoffman and all the sidecast, esp Catherine Keener.<br/><br/>But what fascinate me is how Mr. Capote dealing with the fact( the criminals) and his non-fictional novel( the book). There is is no doubt that Capote created the genre of non-fictional novel which affect the development on journalism. I am sure he experienced the paradox and dilemma of writing a non-fictional novel. To know what i really mean, you can simply ask him how a conclusion or judgment on the criminal can be made? Did you find any difficulty in it? I believe there are bunch of it.<br/><br/>Non fictional novel is written with bias and judgment in no doubt, that why it's so fascinating to read. Mr Capote in the movie obviously experienced the moral struggle it brought. That's why he is not willing to let the criminals get to know the name of the book , coz he feels ""guilty"" of having that book name and the novel details in it.<br/><br/>So i think the movie can be better by elaborate or explore more humanity on the blurred line between the truth and the novel side and how Mr. Capote dealing with his inner struggle.<br/><br/>PS. Nowaday, Modern journalism is leaning to the non friction novel style, I experienced a lot of consequence from that which Capota did. For example, the way he made ""friend"" with the interviewee is the usual practice of an investigative reporter. Sometimes, what you did for the job is like being in a social party. And, what's more? you will get cold-blooded finally if u get used to that kind of life. (luckily i escape it at the very last minute :))"

He has met real life and the most important line in the script, which changes him completely, is the girl who says about a boy, that he has never been into anything terrible before. That's the key to ""In Cold Blood"" and that's what makes Capote interested; the real life, which is infected by evil. And he makes a journey into that real evil, which he hasn't known much about before. Or has he? Much to think about here. Is life stronger than art? Definitely, according to this movie."
"teh_mode","6","1","2","8 March 2006"," Great performances, flawed story.
","Bennett Miller, long time friend of Philip Seymour Hoffman, adapts this tale of legendary writer Truman Capote's struggle to write the great American novel. After becoming good friends with one of the Clutter killers, Capote proceeds to manipulate anyone and everyone in order to aid his new book In Cold Blood, including Alvin Dewey, one of the FBI investigators on the killings. Whilst talking to Perry Smith - one of the convicted killers - Capote forms a bond with the young man, and convinces him that he will attempt to help his case whichever way he can. He's lying of course, the book is entitled In Cold Blood, his interest could only be a purely selfish one.<br/><br/>What's good about Capote doesn't necessarily make it an intriguing experience. Philip Seymour Hoffman, now one Oscar up, is fantastic as the man himself, nailing all of Capote's mannered traits, yet is never sympathetic enough for us to truly feel sorry for him. Catherine Keener, who brilliantly plays Harper Lee - Capote's closest en-trustee - finishes her masterpiece To Kill A Mockingbird, and yet Capote barely even notices. Why should we care if he sympathises with a killer?!? The portrayal of Perry Smith is questionable. Miller's film shows him to be a mild-mannered man who regrets his actions, despite the real Capote saying he thought the real Smith enjoyed killing the Clutter family. Capote is worth watching to see the struggles that the protagonist goes through whilst agonising over his ""non-fiction novel"". He neglects everyone, from his partner to his friends, in order to get to the bottom of his masterpiece. He never completed another book after this one, descending into a celebrity lifestyle of booze-cruising and wise-cracking.<br/><br/>In the end Capote is too esoteric. If you have no interest in journalism, the process of writing or of Truman Capote himself, then Bennett Miller's film won't exactly send the taste buds tingling. It's well played, if a tad too slow, and certainly has it's moments. A slow film about a unsympathetic man. Capote is worth seeing for it's performances at least."

","I can honestly say that this is yet another highly-touted film that I simply didn't appreciate all that much (this thing is up for Best Picture of the year at the Oscars?). Even the across-the-board praise for Philip Seymour Hoffman is a little over the top, in my opinion, as he certainly does possess this guy's look, voice and mannerisms, but as a character with emotional ups and downs, I didn't see all that much variation in this guy from beginning to end. Basically, the guy's a highly intelligent, manipulative, self-absorbed guy, who uses these killers' vulnerabilities against them, so that he could write the ""greatest non-fiction novel"" of all-time. So am I supposed to care about this guy? Oddly enough, the one actor in the film who did truly capture some humanity in his performance was Clifton Collins Jr. as Perry Smith, one of the ""cold-blooded"" murderers. Not unlike Sean Penn in the highly effective DEAD MAN WALKING, Collins portrayed real emotion in his guy, straining to come through to our side, but finding it difficult to fight against his lifetime of ugliness. Now why Catherine Keener is being mentioned for anything other than a passable portrayal of a woman who basically just stands around Capote the whole picture while not saying or doing much, is also beyond meThe good points about the film? Well, its final 10-15 minutes certainly come through as the stagnancy of the film's mid-section is finally budged with some actual intrigue, emotion and resolution. For the most part, the film moves at a slow pace and features scene after scene of Capote speaking to either Perry Smith or messing around with his friends and telling them how great he is, while drinking and smoking up a storm. Sure, Capote's grandiose personality is fun to watch at times (if only because the guy's a mess and doesn't seem to know it)Granted, the film looked great, its opening cinematography work in Kansas was splendid, Hoffman certainly acted like the real Truman Capote, Collins Jr. was memorable and the fact that all of the talk ultimately affected Capote in a negative manner was a decent stuff, but the film itself was a little too long, moved a little too slow, and didn't really pull me into the murderers' back story or Capote's inner being"
"ludwigvan_beethoven","10","1","2","24 February 2006"," Love in Cold Blood
","The first thing that I noted about this Cinematic piece is that it has characteristics of all the great cinematography of the past. It deserves every award it can get. Unlike the original movie IN COLD BLOOD upon which this is based it is in Color. I think that Truman would be proud of this film if he were still living to see it. I have many fond memories of Truman when he was living among us although the claim that he never wrote again is inaccurate. Truman did write after IN COLD BLOOD but it was a steady stream downward from the heights that he had reached involving heavy drinking and severe mental depression. I never knew if Truman ever got psychiatric treatment for his depression but in retrospect it seems that he should have as well as for his grief over Perry Smith. The last straw was ANSWERED PRAYERS which he had begun to publish in four issues of Esquire Magazine. ANSWERED PRAYERS was an expose of all the high society people who had allowed TRUMAN into their most private lives and considered him a close trusted friend with whom they could be themselves with---including Jackie Kennedy Onassis, Chris Isherwood, The Paleys, Tennessee Williams just to name a few and these folks never forgave him and never took his phone calls etc after he had hurt them. ANSWERED PRAYERS was something that was a very bad judgment on Tru's part---probably as the result of his alcoholism. Alcoholics are often dysfunctional people and hurt others for their own selfish gains. While Truman did have an excellent memory; he often took a hidden tape recorder (this is has come into dispute of late but many of us know that he did) with him and taped his conversations not only for accuracy but legal reasons although many legal scholars might say that he taped his interviewees and friends illegally by trampling on their privacy rights without their knowledge. In ANWSERED PRAYERS, Truman betrayed just about every person that he knew by exposing them--ANSWERED PRAYERS never got off the ground fully especially when those in it learned of how he depicted them. Needless to say the Paley's and others were very hurt by this and quickly shut him out of their lives. Truman became an unwelcome a pariah in their eyes to be avoided like the plague at all costs and only the most loyal of his friends stuck with him despite how badly he had severely hurt them--among them NBC Tonight Host: Johnny Carson and his ex-wife Joanne--- the latter in whose whom he had come to live as a sort of permanent house guest. Mrs. Carson is to be admired for her courage and support for taking on Truman and giving him the support that he needed in his last years although it must have been very embarrassing to walk in and find Truman dead.<br/><br/>The set critics who seem to go to movies to find fault with the set people have found a number of things that are wrong with this film but that does not detract from it's superbness but I assume that this was because it was hurriedly shot without checking historical references. I myself noticed a major flaw in the execution scene in which the prisoner's handcuffed hands are in the wrong place. In arresting anyone or executing anyone the proper Police procedure is to have the subject's hands handcuffed behind their back to prevent any assault on the officers present by the prisoner or prevent making an escape easier. Despite this--the way this scene is shot gives the viewer the feeling of being the one being executed. Truman often said that he fell in love with Perry Smith which he did and it cost him dearly as it would in ANSWERED PRAYERS.<br/><br/>Hoffman has Truman's character down so accurately that those of us who knew Tru or were at least acquainted with him would in an earlier situation would have thought that it was really Truman. The disappointment of this film is that one is led to believe that this will be a biography of Tru's life so one expects to see scenes of his early life (which Hoffman as Tru tells) and life after IN COLD BLOOD. Instead we are treated to a history of IN COLD BLOOD--which has also been made into a movie that is recommended be seen before seeing this movie as well as reading the book.<br/><br/>The drama in this film is so intense at times that one barely notices any of the music once absorbed with TRU. Dr. Lee (author of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD and played by played by Katherine Keener) plays a significant role CAPOTE but it is not clear to the viewer if she is there as Tru's secretary or she is there to write a similar story. (Dr. Harper's MOCKINGBIRD is also about similar case in which a Minister murders for insurance money and is then murdered himself at the funeral of one of his victims.). Much of the early part of the film takes place in Dr. Nell Harper Lee's (who is a lawyer in her own right and has multiple Doctorates including one from the University of Alabama) modest cold water flat, after she had moved to New York (she had formerly worked for an airlines). We are shown the two worlds of Tru---the glamorous parties in which the illustrati of New York are in attendance along with the luxurious world and the drab"

","Why does anyone praise this awful film? Mimicry is a skill, but easy to do, with the available photos,voice recordings,news photo-ops,etc. Truman Capote was plump, effeminate,obnoxious.ego-overfilled, arrogant,an alcoholic, and vicious. He ultimately alienated the celebrities he fought so hard to be with. The film glosses over some of these, while presenting a story of a man incapable of change, which could be good if the man had not been, as Capote was, a pathetic loser. So why was it filmed, and why the praise for PS Hoffman? What is achieved by portraying a man who should have been sent on an automated rocket to Mars? Surely a biopic on a more desirable person could have been done. Speedhumps"

","Capote. The movie named thus, should have shown a bit of Truman Capote, rather than a version that could have been titled ""In cold blood part 2"", Truman Capote is known to have led a colorful life, with his effeminate mannerisms to his bragging to his famous movie star friends and of course all of that stemming forth from an abandoned childhood. Even after IN cold blood, Capote's struggle to let go of the four years that the book sapped him off, and his vain attempt to get back to writing --all of these would have been a movie that could have aptly been called CAPOTE. That is what a biography would really encase. A look at the the person, on circumstances that made him the way he was, or his struggles that changed him as a person..and him before and after (maybe) What Bennet Miller's CApote has is 'THe making of In Cold blood' yes CApote did get very affected by the research and it did alter his life, but does the audience know what he was before (apart from the brief party scenes) and then what happened to him till he died in 1984. Philip Seymour Hoffman is brilliant in his depiction, but i think he could have been used to show Capote for Capote and not for 'The making of the non fiction novel IN COLD BLOOD'."

","Capote has got to be one of the best or if not the best picture of the year. When the first opening shot was first show I've got to be honest I was'nt very optimistic about the movie and did not know what to expect. Later in the movie after being introduced to all the characters they all slowly grew on me. I was very fascinated by the fact the lead character ""Capote was such an arrogant asshole, which did not want anything to do with anyone, unless to further his success in his writing career. After seeing both sides to the story of the towns people and what they thought of the killer, and the killer himself it has led me to understand that you should't just go judging people cause there always is to sides to a story. Lastly what really took the cake for this movie was its climax and conclusion. It was heart wrenching, sad and maybe was for the best(in my opinion). I recommend everyone to see this heartfelt movie of love, hate, greed, and self pity. The acting was phenomenal, the movie was shot perfect, except for the slow beginning i give it a 9/10 vote."

","Capote is based on the book of the same name by Gerald Clarke. The film tells the true life story of author Truman Capote who would later write his biggest hit of all time entitled In Cold Blood. In the movie Truman goes to Kansas in 1959 to research and find out about several people slain in their own house. Eventually the two criminals responsible are caught and Truman goes to interview one of them. His name is Perry Smith. Once they get talking the two of them become friends and Truman can really sympathize with Perry. While getting more information for the book Truman keeps coming back to see Perry even though that due to Perry's jail sentence it won't be for a long time. He also knows that to show his relationship with Perry and what he has learned that he has to write one incredible book.

Capote has good direction, a good adapted screenplay, good performances by the entire cast (and I' am positive Phillip Seymour Hoffman will win this year's Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Truman Capote), good original music, good cinematography and good film editing. The film is well crafted and well made and really focuses on its story and characters showing their good and bad sides and concentrates on what makes them do the things they do. The film also had some very good character study. I also found that the movie had a good pace and was absorbing and compelling. While watching this film I became interested in what was going on and this is one movie where the characters and the things they do and the choices they makes fascinates you. The film is also riveting and a stylishly made film that looks like it just came out of the 50's time period. Overall a compelling and very well made film that I'm sure will continue to win more awards and get the attention of more theatre goers."
"emilyxmay","10","1","2","5 February 2006"," Truman's quest for fame and glory was his inevitable downfall
","just saw Capote. Wow. Phillip Seymour Hoffman should win the academy award for that one. Hoffman immerses himself in the role. All the acting is superb.<br/><br/>On the other hand, ugh! No wonder Truman drank himself to death. He was a grandiose, defiant slimy little man, although he had a very charming, manipulative side.<br/><br/>At first, I was quite taken with the movie and Capote's method of writingand thought that Capote was simply immersing himself in the booksomething that is quite necessary when we create art. Butas the movie wore on, I began to seewhich is so telling in one of the scenes when Capote says something like: ""It was as if we grew up in the same house (meaning Capote and one of the killer, Perry Smith). Only he went out the back door and I went out the front."" Capote felt a real kinship with Perry Smith, they had similar childhoods, and was probably 'in love' with him.they were two peas in a pod, only one was rich and famous, and the other followed the 'dark side'. Truman couldn't deal with his own fame after recognizing their similarities.<br/><br/>The only difference between Capote himself and the killer Perry Smith was that Perry Smith went to prison and was executed for the end results of his resentments, defiance, and grandiosity. He lived his life as Master of the Universe. Capote, unable to deal with the metaphor, his narcissism, and his lack of a soul, drank himself to death. He died in 1984 from ""complications"" of alcoholism.<br/><br/>One of my favorite  and I think spectacular - authors, Anne Rule, writes true crime in a similar manner to Capote. However, she looks at the positive and how the people involved, the 'victims', are able to turn their lives around in spite of their circumstances as crime victims.<br/><br/>Capote never wrote another book although he did have some unfinished works. At the end, there is a quote from Capote that says something like ""fame isn't as grand as it's cracked up to be"". What is meant to me was, we'd better be humble in how we choose to share our gifts with the world. When Capote began the process of writing In Cold Blood, he thought only of fame and glory, yet it was his downfall."
"Quinoa1984","8","1","2","4 February 2006"," an actor's film- all the director has to do is stand back and not get in the way (much)
","A film like Capote works due to two things- the credibility of the story, and it's casting. The director doesn't have to do THAT much, though for what it's worth Bennet Miller does a good job setting up a dark mood for much of the film, with maybe a little much hand-held camera-work to add the 'indie' touch, but some chilling music as well. But, as Robert Altman once said, 85% of the director's job is usually in the casting, and it's here that Miller scores his points. Philip Seymour Hoffman is the likely pick for the Oscar, and while it's of course un-fair to ever pick a definite winner over other good performances, Hoffman here scores a nifty triumph into his catalog of character-actor parts. He creates a pure dimension in this character of Truman Capote, who in real life had a lot of hubris with his writing, though also had enough sensitivity and observance of the truth, however grisly. His book 'In Cold Blood' I have not yet read, though from the story presented from the facts in this film, it's definitely quite the intriguing one, especially when we get introduced into the mind-set of Perry Smith.<br/><br/>Truman, with author Harper Lee (Catherine Keener, a good though not brilliant performance as more of a smaller character than anything), goes to investigate four killings in Kansas in 1959. Perry Smith and his partner in crime Dick Hickock get a quick trial and sentenced to death, but over the years of appeals, Capote keeps visiting Smith in his jail cell- in between his elite social engagements and drinks (and writing, of course)- trying to get the ultimate truth about November 14th of 59. It's in these scenes, between Hoffman and Clifton Collins Jr as Perry Smith, that the film becomes totally, can't-leave-eyes-from-the-screen watchable film-making. The cinematography by Adam Kimmel is effective in its use of shadows and bits of light, and the shocking part of the sort of 'revelation' in the final cell meeting to Capote is very shocking. Miller, who's only other credit is a documentary film from years back, doesn't hold back on that flashback.<br/><br/>It's in the scenes when Capote finally becomes vulnerable, and breaks his hubris in his moral conflict, that Hoffman strikes some rich ground. His is a character that is highly respected among is peers, admired almost to the heavens as the 'inventor of the non-fiction novel'. In some of these scenes it actually isn't all that strong, however necessary they are for the story. It's when it comes down to this kind of intense, duplicitous kind of investigating and connection between the writer and the killer that the drama runs high. And it is well worth to note that although acting all around in the film is top notch, Collins Jr is in a true breakout performance here, as a person with a lot of deep wounds and terrible vibes behind his 'sensitive side'. It almost becomes a tad manipulative on the director, though it's through getting in the first hour- which almost rushes through the kind of procedure of researching and writing a book of this sort- for the good stuff. Anyone who's interested in film acting would do well to see at least the crucial parts of this film, as it has some of the best contained in any film of 2005."

","Phillip Seymour Hoffman, who gives the best performance so far this millennium as ""capote."" I'm usually not into the whole ""awards"" thing, as well as actors playing well-known figures as an imitation, or ""transforming"" into a new role, but what's remarkable about his performance, is that he's faced with such a specific and exaggerated character he needs to play (and he nails the stuttering lisp and squeaky voice), but it takes a back seat to how well he understands the role ""capote"" needs to play in this movie. The movie centers on capote as narcissistic and completely involved in himself, his own world, and his own work . . . and that's exactly how he comes across. But he's neither hero nor villain-- we see him for what he is, we neither like him or hate him . . . but we're fascinated with him and his research for ""in cold blood"" . . . and what's vital to the movie-- is that we're willing to follow him the entire time.Believe it or not, Hoffman, while faced with an extreme and flamboyant character, adds a subtle note under the imitation in every scene that leads it to become what the director wants. At the end, he has a breakdown and cries as the criminals face the death penalty. Hoffman makes it clear that-- he's crying because ANYBODY would cry while facing something like that-- but then we really have NO idea why he's affected beyond that . . . what is he thinking? it could be anything. This scene reminded me so much of the ambiguity of halle berry in the final scene of monster's ball.<br/><br/>I can't stand catherine keener, i think she's terrible in most things, but . . .she blew me away. What a great cast. And dan futterman's script is the best screenplay in ages.<br/><br/>This isn't the life story of truman capote, but instead an exploration of a great mind meeting a criminal mind.

He then goes on to talk to the killers and becomes close to one, Perry Smith. He visits Perry in jail and has him recount the night of the murder and why he did it. (This is when it gets disturbing.) In the end, Perry is hanged (you do feel sorry for him by the end) and Capote's book is released to the public and becomes a big hit.<br/><br/>This movie is very powerful, I won't lie. I personally haven't read the book, but the movie gives you a good idea of what the book is about. If you're in the mood to see a dramatic, borderline depressing, movie, this is the one. The acting is flawless: Philip Seymour Hoffman is brilliant at playing Capote and the viewer really connects to all the characters.<br/><br/>Overall, a great movie.

","In this movie a writer is assigned to cover a story of an entire family brutally slaughtered by two men; the two men are apprehended, incarcerated, tried, convicted and sentenced to death. The two men committed a crime that was as senseless as it was heinous. These men deserve no special consideration or attention whatsoever, except as it relates to the horrible crime they committed. Yet the writer befriends one of the murderers - in fact the one who actually did the killing - and now has to deal with the fact that he now has an intimate relationship with a cunning and deceitful mass murderer, who is so nasty that his own sister wants nothing to do with him. The writer knows that yet he can't help himself. No matter how much he tries, he can't stop thinking about this murderer. Well, what does that say about the writer? The movie shows how the writer, who is urbane, mild-mannered, well-liked, and respected, recognizes the unacceptability of transforming this work assignment into something personal, but he simply can't help it, and now he is stuck with having to deal with the consequences for the rest of his life. For by writing an entire book about these two no-account murderers, is the writer in a way really writing about himself? Is the writer in a way condoning, glamorizing or at least excusing, what these two men did? Indeed, the writer even goes so far as to obtain legal counsel for these dangerous characters. This movie shows what happens when a professional person who is expected to maintain professional objectivity loses that objectivity and becomes enmeshed in the subject matter that he is examining. Once the boundary that separates the job from the personal is crossed, the consequences can be emotionally devastating, which is what happens to the writer as the writer, who was a successful and gifted author, never writes another book and drinks for the rest of his life."

","Having read In Cold Blood and most of Capote's other novels (as well as a good deal of biographical material), I'd have to say that this movie DIDN'T COME CLOSE to penetrating the psychological depths of this historical/literary event. Suggesting that Phillip Seymour Hoffman is going to be nominated for various awards for his performance in this movie is probably correct, but this fact doesn't necessarily warrant such a bestowal. Oftentimes, especially in Hollywood, mistakes are made when it comes to such things. Aside from affecting a Capote-like lisp and beholding people with an aloof, yet studious gaze, Hoffman neglected a lot of other Capote-isms, like his excessive squirming, and the sheer drunkenness of his person, etc. In my point of view, although Hoffman held a drink as a prop in every scene, the level of intoxication wasn't captured. nor, when PSH claims to feel a close connection with perry smith, does the claim appear to be based on any events or actions that had preceded. in other words, the ""connection"", or bond, between the two was never fully established.<br/><br/>the only indication that a bond was forged was when Capote-Hoffman says so (paraphrase) ""i feel so close to him."" this doesn't cut it for me. the viewer should be able to intuit certain bonds long before they are voiced or spoken by piecing together subtle clues that in this flick, were entirely absent.<br/><br/>aside from showing perry smith biting his lip (which was intended to make him seem less-than-killer like, exposed, humane) they never really delved into his character, showed other instances of his humanity or lack thereof. in short, i was BORED STIFF by the superficiality of the rendering. boo."
"robert_johnston","5","2","9","16 October 2005"," Hoffman is Capote - but not in a good way
","And by that I mean the whole film is so in love with itself that it fails to realise that it is actually incredibly shallow. Accomplished maybe, but ultimately saying nothing. As Capote the novelist was in love with his prose, then Capote the movie is in love with its imagery, but doesn't seem to appreciate that it ends up revealing more about its maker than it does about its subject. Yes, it can be pretty, but it has all been done before - and better. No visual cliché can be resisted. For example, when Capote himself reveals his self-conscious prose in the reading when he describes the clothes of the victims, you can't help but remember that in the earlier courtroom scene you know with a sinking heart that the camera will not be able to resist panning over the relentless grey suits to reveal Perry as the lone figure in white. It's not that the film isn't enjoyable, it is just relentlessly self-conscious. And even this almost works until the flashbacks to the killings when you realise that the shallowness isn't post-modern genius, merely an unconscious apeing of Capote's own failings. And to see the movie as an examination of how a writer manipulates truth seems to me to miss the point that the character Capote himself describes In Cold Blood as a novel from the outset. Indeed, isn't the book's ""novelisation"" of reportage the whole reason In Cold Blood is famous in the first place? As for Hoffman's performance, while enjoyable, it is parody rather than characterisation - it feels like watching a stand-up comedian pretending to be Alec Guinness acting out a role. No doubt Capote was an unpleasant human being but the charm he must have possessed is reduced by Hoffman to merely a couple of queenie comments at parties. Also, the way the screenplay keeps underlying his hypocrisy ends up being almost insulting to the audience's intelligence. To be fair, it is well made and worth seeing - the fact that with a little more courage its flaws could be turned into triumphs shows that it isn't dull. And with ruthless editing it could have been so much better. Unfortunately this would have meant that it would have only been 70 minutes long. Mind you - Breakfast in Tiffany's was a novella..."

(Dir: Bennett Miller)<br/><br/>Hoffman gives an uncanny, well-modulated turn as Truman Capote with Oscar-worthy aplomb.<br/><br/>In 1959 a brutal murder in rural Kansas proved to be an eye-opening and career launching journey for journalist cum author celebre Truman Capote (Hoffman giving a deft, smart performance) by finding unlikely inspiration with one of the killers, Perry Smith (Collins equally good), in his ultimate literary triumph, ""In Cold Blood"", launching a new style in writing: the non-fiction novel.<br/><br/>Capote, a freelancer for THE NEW YORKER, finds his next article while reading the unspooling case of the slaying of a family in Kansas while reading about it on the front page of THE NEW YORK TIMES. What he doesn't anticipate is the compelling need to write more than a few pages for the periodical; it becomes a feverish desire to become a source for his new book and the end results prove to be prophetic (and perhaps an aura of doom that would permeate the author until his untimely death due to alcoholism in 1984).<br/><br/>Enlisting his life-long friend and fellow writer destined for greatness, Harper Lee (the always welcome Keener, the voice of reason here), to tag along to coax the local Midwesterners out of their righteously ensconced shells to poke out a story the two quickly discover the grisly homicides are grist for history. Welcoming them is local sheriff Alvin Dewey (the underused but still affective Cooper), a no-nonsense yet fairly justified type who makes swift resolution in finding the two men who broke into the Clutter household and killed the four family members with shotgun malice.<br/><br/>It is here that Capote finds himself bewitched by the quiet yet smarter than he appears Perry, the more avuncular of the two criminals who confides in him as much as he sees fits  adding some tension down the line when Capote realizes the material he has is voluminous for his proceedings which ultimately (and unexpectedly) has Capote befriending the duo and perhaps a sort of grotesque bond with Perry more so than the cipher Richard Hickok (Pellegrino).<br/><br/>Capote's companion Jack Dunphy (Greenwood), a fellow scribe, is concerned that his mate may be getting into some dark waters that may consume his passion for the page yet Capote remains fascinated with the feral Perry to the point it mimics a moth to the flame: someone is bound to be burned in the process.<br/><br/>Based on Gerald Clarke's biography of the author and adapted by actor Dan Futterman (best known for his role on TV's ""Judging Amy"" and co-executive producer with Hoffman), his novice screenplay manages to capture lightning in a bottle with Capote a catalyst for some chilling moments of self-aggrandizing and getting caught up in his hyperbole for the literati cosmopolitan set of Manhattan juxtaposed with the funeral landscapes of the barren countryside of the cold Kansas climes (coolly interpreted by cinematographer Adam Kimmel in its shroud-like blue-greys). Director Miller's sophomore effort here (he did the indie docu ""THE CRUISE"") allows his character driven story to move things along with cause affect but is a bit listless and dry with some decidedly slow and boring pacing but still achieves a well documented biopic without the trappings usually associated with the genre (i.e. making the protagonist a glorification; if nothing else it is a warts-and-all depiction). The juxtaposition of the cocktail party environs of the hoi polloi of NYC to the blunt trauma of the Midwest is jarring to say the least like a shock of ice water to the system. <br/><br/>Hoffman truly gives an uncanny and Oscar-worthy performance channeling the famed author with dexterity and deftness incorporating his infamous child-like, lispy croak/whisper of a voice suggesting a recently burned tongue and a on the verge of going to sleep demeanor and captures the wit and humor as well as the arrogance of his craft (at a public reading of his first galleys of the book he asks his publisher William Shawn (Balaban) if Tennessee Williams was pleased and when he's assured he laughs like a child told Santa is coming solely for him. Hoffman, one of our most underrated actors of my generation, has always been a favorite and fast becoming a Gene Hackman in the sense he is ubiquity is only surpassed by his talent which looms large in the seemingly shrunken chameleon affectation of Truman Capote, a man gift of gab and perhaps suspect in morality."

","'In Cold Blood', Truman Capote's most famous book, was a thinly fictionalised account of some real life murders; which he befriended the killers to write. 'Capote' tells the story of the book's gestation. At its dramatic core is the tension between Capote the professional, to whom his subjects are just material, and Capote the human being; to be a writer, of course, he needs to function on both levels. But nonetheless, the film presents him as someone so fundamentally self-centred that it's hard to see why we should care about his ethical unease - there's little doubt that ultimately he's going to resolve it in his own favour anyway. Philip Seymour Hoffman is very good in the title role but there really doesn't seem to be too much purpose to this movie, except to genuflect in reverence of the ""artist""."
"jboothmillard","8","1","3","30 June 2009"," Capote
","I saw clips of this film on TV, and saw the amusing voice the lead actor put on, like an impression of Droopy the Dog, and that coupled with the award nominations was what prompted me to see it. This is the story of homosexual writer Truman Capote (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Philip Seymour Hoffman), author of the book ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", who in 1959 was inspired to write the acclaimed novel ""In Cold Blood"". Basically a farmhouse in Holcomb, Kansas was broken into by criminals Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.) and Dick Hickock (Mark Pellegrino), who also murdered the family of four living there. Capote travels to the small town where the murder occurred, with his friend Nelle Harper Lee (Oscar and BAFTA nominated Catherine Keener). He eventually gets to meet the two arrested killers, and as he gets to know them he feels compassion for them, particularly Perry who he forms falls for. Capote also manages to get them a new lawyer, and postpones their execution (hanging) until 1965, and of course a year later he finished the literacy account that would redefine modern non-fiction. Also starring Chris Cooper as Alvin Dewey, Bruce Greenwood as Jack Dunphy, Bob Balaban as William Shawn and Amy Ryan as Marie Dewey. The story is very compelling, the supporting cast work very well, but for me and I'm sure many others it is Hoffman that is what makes this film so watchable. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Director for Bennett Miller and Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Film, Best Adapted Screenplay and the David Lean Award for Direction. Very good!"

","Though insightful - I will not be one on board simply to be on board - this movie bored the life out of me. Tracking the story of ""In Cold Blood"", which in itself is a great book and a wonderfully portrayed movie, this movie was bland, non-griping in any way whatsoever. Stick a fork in me, I'm done! Hoffman's portrayal of Capote was wonderful, his interpretation of Capote was equally wonderful, and understanding the type of movie that it was intended to be, and did become, in my opinion didn't make the grade. But when you make a movie about Hollywood, and then let Hollywood rate it is quite nepotistic, again, in my opinion! With that being said, waste of time!"

","Ill get the bad of this film out of the way first. The fact that Bennett Miller is new to directing really shows; most scenes seem to be cut off early, and there is no flow between scenes. He by no means deserves the Oscar nomination, as far as I'm concerned. Also, in some parts near the first and, less frequently throughout the film, the script seemed forced. Capote's line about being ""pegged"" would have fit perfectly later in the movie, but was totally out of place when it was said. Now lets move on to the good stuff, shall we? Though the praise is directed almost solely toward Hoffman, I think the entire cast deserves a round of applause and a pat on the back. Hoffman put in a great performance that he deservedly won the Oscar for, hindered only by some fairly weak sections of the script. In my humble opinion however, Cliffton Collins Jr. was the best supporting actor involved by a long shot. I don't think I blinked once during his monologue near the end; his tone and expression...wow. I don't think this film deserves any of the Oscars it was nominated for aside from Best Actor, however Collins certainly should have got a nod for Supporting Actor. His performance seriously blew me away almost as much as Hoffman's. Overall, this is a great movie. Starts out slow, but from the introduction of Perry Smith onward, you wont want to miss a second.<br/><br/>8/10"

","I will admit to getting wrapped up in Capote's dilemma by the second half of the film, but as interesting as the man's real life story is, the film offers too little backstage access to Capote for us to understand the central relationships which make the crux of the film. The fact is, as played by Hoffman or anyone, the man is too engimatic on screen to elicit our sympathies. It might have helped if the movie wasn't shot like a stage play; with long, staid scenes that never build up enough steam to carry the audience into the next. For all its faults the movie is well paced, and it kept me invested in its outcome. And I've just got to say it, that voice is aggravating, real or not."

","Great film. The images and shot selections conveyed a wonderful sense of location from New York, to Kansas, to the Costa Brava of Spain. I learned quite a bit about this writer who I never knew was such a vivid character. Tonight I'll have to go get a copy of In Cold Blood to round out the experience. Anyway, this film is quite an interesting exploration into the thin line between the interviewer and the subject as well as the struggle of the creative process. Hoffman's character struggled with this in the film, and one has to wonder what was really going on in those dark prison cells. The question I have is - are we, as viewers, supposed to sympathize with this Capote character?"

","By now, everyone has said that Truman Capote--I mean Philip Seymour Hoffman--is brilliant as is Catherine Keener as Harper Lee. So is Bruce Greenwood in the role of Jack Dunphy, though the actor like the real-life character he plays, becomes overshadowed by the star.<br/><br/>I found Chris Cooper as the K.B.I. agent understandably intense since he has to carry the weight for all of the folks in Kansas who were p.o.ed at Capote for doing things like finding Hickock and Smith an attorney for their appeal. Capote also found that he had to come down on the side of the victims or the killers in his focus if not his sympathy (though there is that, too, of course), and he ended up giving the victims short shrift. People who knew the family were ticked about that, too. (In an early scene, Capote tells Cooper's character that he doesn't care whether they find the killers or not. Cooper says that he cares very much. That is the start of the bad feeling between them, which never seems to resolve amicably.)"
"jdesando","Null","1","3","1 November 2005"," With most miraculous organ.
","""For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak With most miraculous organ."" Hamlet Yes, Hoffman is Oscar-worthy in Capote. No, you never learn how the acclaimed author of Breakfast at Tiffany's actually wrote, but you do see how he researches. The latter is aided by a 94% retentive memory, freeing him up to look at his subject with piercing eyes.<br/><br/>The subject of this film is as much the murderers of rural Kansas's four Clutter family members as it is about Capote. Perry Smith (Clifton Collins, Jr.) and Richard Hickock (Mark Pelligrino) were the subject of Capote's In Cold Blood, an innovative approach to historical depiction by way of fiction (non-fiction novel) that allows the author to intrude and create narrative pieces at will (Our ""docudramas"" are the descendants).<br/><br/>Hoffman's imitation of Capote's eccentric mannerisms and high voice is close to perfect, in the tradition of a flamboyant Southerner, but more is the sense that Hoffman understands and ""inhabits"" his character, a very modern method acting achievement. His relationship with Nelle Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), about to become famous for her To Kill a Mockingbird, is touching, especially since she appears to be someone who tells him off when necessary. Capote's interaction with his longtime lover, novelist Jack Dunphy, is treated with quiet grace. Smith occupies most of Capote's time and interest, some suggesting the gay author had fallen in love with him.<br/><br/>As if the complexities of Capote's relationships were not enough, director Miller and writer Futterman ever so gently weave in the possibility that Capote did not do enough to stay the executions because he needed to finish his novel, a feat he couldn't do without their deaths: ""All I want to do is write the ending, and there's no end in sight,"" Capote's wrenching the story from Smith is the ongoing struggle that reveals the writer's manipulative and mendacious nature.<br/><br/>At the very least, Capote struggled with the business of his writing and his growing affection for Smith, strongly identifying with his abandonment as a child: ""It's as if Perry and I grew up in the same house. One day, I went out the front door and he went out the back."""
"rosscinema","8","1","3","24 October 2005"," The events that left Capote a shattered man
","Unlike other efforts that described themselves as being biographies I think a better way of looking at this film would be as a haunting remembrance and a synopses of events that would forever change a man. This certainly isn't about the life of someone but instead is about the most important time in the life of one of the most talented writers this country ever produced. Story starts out in 1959 where writer Truman Capote (Philip Seymour Hoffman) notices a news article about a Kansas family being murdered and persuades the editor of The New Yorker to allow him to do a series of articles on the effects it has on the residents. Truman brings his childhood friend and fellow writer Nelle Harper Lee (Catherine Keener) to Kansas with him to help out with the research and while they interview some of the locals the police arrest the two killers.<br/><br/>*****SPOILER ALERT***** Perry Smith (Clifton James Jr.) and Richard Hickock (Mark Pellegrino) eventually confess to the murders and it's at this point when Truman decides that he will write his next book on the events. The local officials allow Truman to visit both of these men but it's Perry that he becomes friendliest with and eventually it grows to be an attraction. Truman does use his charm to get vital information for his book but eventually it dawns on him that after 6 years of appeals the only way he will be able to finish it is when they both are finally executed by the state.<br/><br/>This is directed by Bennett Miller who's only other film was the documentary ""The Cruise"" and one can't help but be impressed with his direction but of course it helps to have a special actor like Hoffman in the starring role. This film does belong to Hoffman and his performance can easily be described as riveting especially during the scenes when he talks about himself growing up as different and one gets a good sense of why he became such a charmer. One of the more interesting things that the film lets on is that Harper Lee actually helped Truman gain information for his book ""In Cold Blood"" while still working on ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" and in fact, her book was published and made into a film while he still waited for the appeals to end. The 6 years that Truman worked on ""In Cold Blood"" was the time that changed him forever to the point that he never wrote another novel again and this film does a splendid job of making sure that audiences understand that this man was so disturbed by his own behavior that he never forgave himself. This isn't really a biography but the film does a remarkable job of capturing the time and events that led to Truman questioning his own humanity. Miller is certainly a director to watch but it's Hoffman who once again demonstrates that he's one of our finest actors working today as he provides one of the year's best performances."
"mockturtle","9","1","3","24 October 2005"," Brother's Keeper?
","Capote has two and a half problems.<br/><br/>1) It is never addressed that, while declaiming autobiographical fiction and then writing a non-fiction book in which he was highly involved but deleted the biographical element, that his friend Harper Lee's book ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" not only was autobiographical, but included Truman Capote himself as a character (Dill).<br/><br/>2) It is never addressed what punishment Capote believed was fitting for the two killers: the question of whether Capote's final reluctance to get another lawyer for the killers may have been because he initially did that to guarantee a fair trial and then, a fair trial having been conducted, did not see any reason to further the possibility that they would escape a deserved punishment because of a technicality. The basis of the appeal was ""Inadequate Counsel,"" Capote provided them with adequate counsel and they lost. I am not saying that they deserved death, or that Mr. Capote was for or against the death penalty, only that after a certain point he perhaps felt the State had decided their punishment fairly and had no wish to further contest that. It still wouldn't invalidate his own personal crisis.<br/><br/>Â½) For shorthand's sake, sometimes Capote the character has to be less subtle in his manipulation than he undoubtedly was at the time.<br/><br/>Apart from that it is possibly the best film so far this year. Expertly cast, written, directed and paced, it is a measured study of a man whose intelligence pushes him towards a moral ambiguity that his core decency cannot reconcile. Like the two ciphers for Leopold and Loeb in Hitchcock's ""Rope,"" Capote attempts to live as though he is above the moral classification of people as either decent and good (Harper Lee, Jack Dunphy, his lover, played by Bruce Greenwood, and lawman Alvin Dewey, played by Chris Cooper) or immoral. It is an oversimplification that he seems to find quaint, but in using Perry Smith and allowing himself to be used by him while at the same time valuing Smith's friendship and being valued, he finds that he cannot play Smith's game; he finds that he is essentially moral and that it is too late, he has already betrayed his morality. The dissonance wrecks his life.<br/><br/>Catherine Keener, cast perfectly for the first time in her life, radiates goodness, decency, intelligence and warmth; one can see how her Harper Lee's belief in Capote could of itself be the explicit endorsement of his core decency the film wisely declines to otherwise provide. Nearly certain Oscar Nomination, and I pity Sandra Bullock to try to match this next year. Bruce Greenwood adds shadings of caution and shows how another essentially moral, decent person can chafe and bristle, can be a complicated human and not just a box of sunshine. That and his expert projection of a lack of neediness are what make his attraction for Capote apparent. Chris Cooper can't win an Oscar for this film, but only because the part is too peripheral to the story; if there had been opportunity for more involvement (denied by history and therefore unrewriteable) he would have walked off with the show. The character is one of his best since ""Matewan"" and could merit another movie: The Adventures of Alvin Dewey, of course. Bob Balaban is dependably excellent. Clifton Collins, Jr., is quite serviceable as Perry Smith, but I sometimes had the feeling that he was deliberately blurring lines and obfuscating instead of making precise choices, playing ""keep-away"" with his characterization. I was also a bit surprised that Perry's character did not use Capote's attraction to him more explicitly for manipulation. It makes him at some times as nuanced and subtle a manipulator as Capote; the duality is warranted, but perhaps Smith should have been cruder and hence more of a messy human being and less of a theme-serving foil.<br/><br/>The script is expertly paced, and Dan Futterman shows a great facility for the shape of a scene; all biopics should manage to have a through-line like this one. Hopeful Oscar Nomination. Director Bennett Miller obviously has complete faith in his cast yet does not turn make you feel like the camera is a puppy dog licking them all over the way John Madden does (inexplicably) in ""Proof."" His attention to detail and scope makes this not just a star-vehicle movie like ""Proof"" or ""Sylvia,"" where complex characters were drafted into vanity projects. Another hopeful Oscar Nomination.<br/><br/>What Hoffman makes apparent is that Capote is always the most interesting person in the room. He holds himself above other people, but he probably should. He is able to be manipulative and heartbreakingly honest at the same time and doesn't seem to feel that it takes away from the value of the confidence related that it was done to obtain something. Often, it almost feels like he views these exchanges as barter, and would not feel comfortable if he was simply telling without receiving anything concrete in return. He is condescending and ingenuous at the same time. He attempts to write ""In Cold Blood"" in cold blood, with complete objectivity. He ultimately cannot outsmart himself.<br/><br/>Philip Seymour Hoffman will be nominated certainly, and may win, and should, at least at this point. We'll see what the rest of the year has to offer. I can't really imagine anyone trumping this performance, but just because he deserves to win doesn't mean he will; remember that the Oscars are a joke and that if he does win it is liable to make his life more, not less, difficult; remember that Samuel Jackson said that he doesn't really want an Oscar because he already has the career he wants and it would just drive his price up; and Hoffman has that theatre to run."
"alicecbr","10","1","3","24 October 2005"," Won applause at Harvard Loew's
","Wanna know how seldom the sophisticates at Harvard Square clap for a movie? Very. Yes, Hoffman does a great job of mimicking Capote. Those who have pronounced characteristics as Capote did are easier to mimic than the more ordinary American. The guy acting the part of Perry Smith was fantastic in being able to show without camp, the ""Po' little me, I shouldn't die for killing 4 people."" charm AND the hard-eyed, conniving ex-con. Both very subtle characterizations.<br/><br/>As co-ordinator of the Gore Vidal Yahoo group, AND an Alabamian as Capote was, I can't pretend to be objective. This movie was a powerful depiction of the struggles that TC must have gone through internally: He needed them to die, he thought, to get the ending properly tied up....so there's his ambition and career. Yet he so much identified for this short half-native American, discarded child of an alcoholic, just as he was. Perry's brother had committed suicide, so did Capote's mother.<br/><br/>The fact that he never wrote another book after this is telling. As sensitive as Capote was, the sight of the executions and his empathy for Perry were probably fatal blows to his delicate psyche. Hoffman does a great job in the final scene, where he is fumbling all over himself, knowing he's a catalytic agent in these kids' deaths.....and the killers KNOW it, and still FORGIVE him for it, ""We know why you didn't answer my letters"", Perry says. ""We understand."" And you believe it. There's not even sarcasm there, but someone knowing he's about to die, shirking off pettiness and showing dignity.<br/><br/>Perry Smith is shown to be someone of a high intellect, if uneducated. Reminded me of Timothy McVeigh and Gore Vidal's interest in him, as he awaited death. Many similarities.<br/><br/>The movie does NOT give you any answers, as to why these 4 people had to die......other than as a result of the boys' frustration at finding only $50.00 in their search and wanting to eradicate witnesses. I can only guess that the hideous childhood of Perry and his life behind bars up till then produced these actions, someone who cared little for his own life, and therefore cared even less for this family's.<br/><br/>The cinematography is magnificent, with many horizontal shots: the train cutting through the middle of the frame traveling across the plain. The shot of the prison amidst the snowy winter landscape reminds you of the Doge Palace in Venice. The up close and personal shots of the last seconds of a person's life about to be executed is extremely powerful. Do they still read the Lord's Prayer to convicted murderers as they lethally inject them, frying their insides? I used to despise these 'ministers', considering them as I did the Army chaplains, complicit in the death industry. But I now understand why it is important for them to be there. ""Dead Man Walking"" gave me that understanding.<br/><br/>The director gives us an evenhanded treatment of the capital punishment quandary: seeing that mother with a cotton head mask in the coffin does a number on you. As someone whose stepfather was murdered and who testified to keep his murderer in prison 2 months ago, I must ell you that I cannot sanction the state murdering in my name-- by taking a murderer's life. However, that said, once a human being takes a life, he should forfeit his freedom for the rest of his own life. So I'll be heading to Montgomery every 5 years for the rest of my life, to keep this guy shut away.<br/><br/>The best line in the movie is when Harper Lee replies over the phone to Truman's protestations, ""You may have THOUGHT you did all you could."" as you see him turn down call after call, letter after letter from the murderer. She doesn't let him off the hook, since she knows Truman has condemned them to death by dropping the good lawyers needed to plead successfully before the Supreme Court.<br/><br/>By the way, I was one of those who showed my appreciation for this movie by applauding at the end, breeching the usual silence in a somewhat shocking manner and reminding me of why I go OUT to see a movie, rather than watching it here at home. I say Oscar for Hoffman, Oscar for the photographer, and Oscar for the Perry Smith actor."
"Michael-70","Null","1","3","23 October 2005"," Suspense From The Art Of Writing? Capote Does The Impossible!
","This is a very deliberately paced story following Truman Capote as he researched and wrote In Cold Blood. Beginning when he sees a small article in the New York Times describing the shotgun killing of four members of the Clutter family in Holcomb, Kansas; Truman Capote for some reason thinks there is something broader and more meaningful to write about in this simple murder case than meets the eye.<br/><br/>He was more correct than he could have imagined. As he explains in the film, there is the whole conservative, safe, behaved part of American society that we idolize and then there is a depraved, uncontrollable, violent part not very far beneath the nice surface and these two extremes met on the night of November 14, 1959 in an isolated Kansas farmhouse.<br/><br/>The screenplay by actor Dan Futterman (Urbania, The Birdcage) is well written; not just in story structure (he actually builds suspense while waiting for Capote to write)) but especially in fleshing out the characters. Maybe there is a little skimping on the character of Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper), the Kansas police guy who is in charge of investigating the killings, but it looks to me like there was more shot for the film and it just got cut out to make a more agreeable running time. The film does seem long and it is over two hours.<br/><br/>Still, Phillip Seymour Hoffman is mesmerizing as Truman Capote. Truly, this is not just an impersonation of him, which would be easy to do given Capote's fluttery hand gestures and high-pitched voice. In real life, Truman Capote became such a caricature of himself that he was even made fun of in Woody Allen's film Annie Hall when, playing himself as a passerby in Central Park, he was ridiculed as coming in second in the ""Truman Capote Look A Like"" contest. This is a very controlled performance that must have been a bitch to achieve, but Hoffman never lets you see the sweat. He is so totally in character that even in such throwaway moments as Capote watching a taxi pull away or looking around a hotel room, he is spot on.<br/><br/>Hoffman is so good; you might forget there are other people in the cast. Catherine Keener as childhood friend of Capote and novelist Harper Lee (To Kill A Mockingbird) is her usual quiet strong self and Clifton Collins as Perry Smith is not as terse and ""psycho"" as Robert Blake was in the same role in the film of In Cold Blood. Collins plays him as more of a sly charmer in this film and you can see why Capote was attracted to this muscular, tattooed convict. As cult film director John Waters claimed, there is something about a prison sentence that makes a man sexy. But Perry Smith is really just as much a user of people as Capote is, except that in this situation, Perry Smith is manipulating people to save his life; Capote is just doing it for a book.<br/><br/>There is a palpable sense of how Truman Capote changed the art of writing, but maybe that's because I'm a reader and I know what Capote has done. Will someone for whom there is no American culture until Star Wars get a lot of the time period details and meaning? I don't know?<br/><br/>One wrong period detail that stuck out to me was during a long conversation Capote has on a telephone and the phone handset clearly has an RJ11, four-pin jack on it. It may seem minor but those ""Registered Jacks"" were not in use until 1976 and this scene takes place in 1961. Still, I was only momentarily bothered by this. Errors like that are inconsequential if the over-all film is worth watching and Capote most definitely is."

","I admit, I know nothing about Truman Capote, so I found this movie to be completely boring. Sure Hoffman did a great acting job, but since I have never heard anything about the real life Capote, I can't compare his acting performance to the real thing. I know his voice was very annoying and difficult to understand because it was so soft. At the end, it is mentioned Capote died from alcoholism, which explains why he is with a drink in hand during most of the film. He even adds alcohol to what looks like applesauce to eat. The Kansas murders weren't a mystery because the police catch the killers fairly soon after the incident. Most of the story revolves around Capote interviewing the town folk and killers for his novel. So, as you can see, there isn't a lot of action or plot twists, so it makes for a boring story.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: I only watched it because Hoffman won the Oscar. Yes, his acting is very good, but the film overall is not. It's not worth seeing."
"niezone","8","1","4","10 December 2006"," Great performance, touching movie
","What is the best thing about Capote? None other that a truly great and flawless performance from Philip Seymour Hoffman as the late novelist Truman Capote. The movie takes us into the antics of a famous openly-gay writer who has found the possible topic for his next novel: the murder of a family in rural Kansas. Unlike many of today's Hollywood movies, this one focuses entirely on the characters, especially in the relationship that slowly develops between Capote and Perry Smith, one of the brutal killers. Capote uses Smith to get vital information from the killings but as he does, he finds himself at a crossroads, developing a fascination for the man and slowly falling in love. Nevertheless, his ambition to obtain information from Perry to make his new book over shadows the depth of his feelings. The climax of such a profound movie is found when Capote meets Perry for the last time and breaks down before the killer's imminent death. A powerful story and a truly great performance makes for a good movie that lacks intensity and that fails to keep us entertained at some points."

","Other than Hoffman's performance, I wasn't impressed. I haven't seen any footage of the actual Capote, so I'll just assume that his performance is spot on. That voice really got on my nerves, though. The rest of the film really never got me involved though. I was never as interested in the killers as Capote was, and the interaction between Perry and Capote became overtly redundant. The story moves at a snail's pace and never really goes anywhere. The cinematography is impressive, and there are some nice shots, but it fails to make the movie any more interesting. It is really a great performance in the lead role, though not an appealing one, as it seems Capote was a real asshole and incredibly selfish. I'd barely recommend it, if only to watch Hoffman's deserved Oscar-winning role."
"Norwegianheretic","7","1","4","6 December 2005"," A Mixed Blessing
","This biographical work, though well acted, draws on material from Capote's life that puts an ultimately unsatisfying and simplistic cap on the life of a writer who was complex and compelling. For starters, having been produced by the star of the film reveals quite a bit about the nature of the work. It is filled with moments for Mr. Hoffman to portray his work. And while his portrayal of Mr. Capote is stunning, there's something about the screen moments that are all about the acting and not so much about the character of Truman Capote.<br/><br/>There is, also, an annoying reverent tone about the unmasking of Capote's inner ambitions and how they manage to destroy him. This is where the movie completely collapses as a biopic. To imply that Capote's life was destroyed by his writing of IN COLD BLOOD is to ignore a million other possible reasons for him not to be able to complete another book.

","Philip Seymour Hoffman does a wonderful job as Truman Capote in this film, so much so that he carries it from start to finish and is the sole reason the movie has received such positive reviews from critics and audiences. Hoffman is difficult to fault, but the film as a whole is far from perfect.<br/><br/>'Capote' is supposed to be a biography of novelist Truman Capote, yet offers very little background on the man himself. People going into this film with little knowledge of Capote will be disappointed when the credits roll and find they don't know much more than they did 2 hours ago. Surely that's not what you would expect from a so- called 'biographical film'?<br/><br/>For all it positive aspects, including an outstanding lead acting performance, 'Capote' is let down by its narrow approach.

","After reading 'In Cold Blood' i was intreged to find more artistic strains containing Mr Capote, i was not disappointed when i discovered 'Capote'. This is a brilliant film from start to finsh; one of the most important aspects that the director, in my opinion, excelled in was his choice of setting. The Clutter house is perfect in every way and remains loyal to the classic book. Mr Hoffman received widespread critical acclaim for his role and i would endorse this wholly. He did not just play a role in this film (as explained in the extra features of the DVD)he transformed himself into a new entity. He spent 6 months additional time before the beginning of rehearsals to perfect the unique posture and diction possessed by Truman Capote. He executes it perfectly but not to the point of 'mimiccing' as he admits during interview. Perry Smith is cast perfectly as well, his nondescript features and piercing stare ring true to the novel and the compassion between him and Truman is truly touching by the end of the story. I am always cautious about remakes of classic books (although this is technically not a book) but this is a break from the mould, the entire production team deserved an Oscar for this and i look forward to Hoffman's next role with anticipation, (Along Came Polly was a let down!)."

","Was there ever in the film any mention of ""Jack""'s last name, or who he was? We know that he finished his novel, but I can't recall if we were given any other identifying information. ""Jack"" did come across as being a fixture in Capote's life, & if he seemed a little judgemental of his ""partner"", that attitude never rose to the level of rejection. I was trying to think of famous novelists named ""Jack"", but the film never goes into whether Jack becomes as well-known as Harper Lee or Capote. We were thinking possibly of Keraouc (sic)? as a possible Jack. Capote's ""Jack"" did not appear to begrudge Truman his success though. So, who was ""Jack""?"
"Camoo","5","1","5","23 October 2005"," Hoffman brilliant in otherwise lackluster film
","I really wanted to like this movie. But it was doomed to start, since I found myself repelled by Capote, and sympathetic towards Perry Smith. This is not the fault of the script, since Capote was so much the odd narcissist in reality, I just found myself removed and uncaring for anyone by the end of the film, and no matter how true this is to life, I don't want to sit through any film and not care about any of the characters. Thats not to say it was bad either. Philip Seymour Hoffman will win the Oscar for this role, his performance was the single light in the whole film, if he had not been in it, it would have failed entirely in my mind. He drove the wagon here, and everything else just came off like background noise. I read In Cold Blood, which I thought was brilliant, then I saw the film and didn't enjoy it as much as everybody else seemed to. Same goes here, I read his biography, loved it, and didn't think it translated into film. It was simply meandering and boring and at times over-dramatic for my tastes - I love slow, moving thoughtful pictures, and in a land inundated by floodwater, it was definitely refreshing to see 'Good Night and Good Luck' and 'Capote' in the same week. But I found this sprawling, poorly edited, beautifully photographed in neutral tones that only served to match the distance I felt from all the characters and the story. And I was extremely disappointed by one scene of gratuitous violence: The climax and one of the best acted monologues I've seen in a while takes place in the prison where Capote is interviewing Smith and has finally gotten him to talk about the night he murdered the Clutter family. Clifton Collins Jr, whom I had never seen before was incredible, and speaks with raptured intensity, while the camera centers on his sunken eyes. This was literally the first time in the film I was entirely captivated, Then, there's a flashback and some fancy jump cuts and you're taken to the night of the murders where we see him committing them. I found this entirely unnecessary in the context of this film. While the violence in the flashback was restrained compared to other violent films, it de-captivated me and contaminated the rest of the experience. I'm not against violence in pictures, but I'm against bad decisions made by directors. I could not find a purpose for it. We are for the entire film in Capote's head, seeing everything from his perspective, so why now are we suddenly inside Smith's head? Is it supposed to show some kind of transference that occurred between them in that moment? Did he psychically transmit those images to Capote's head? Or was it just to shock the audience? If it was it did just the opposite, it turned an otherwise disturbing and effective monologue into a novelty, my imagination is such that I believed for that moment that Collins was Perry Smith, and that he had murdered those people and I was really feeling the pain that both of them felt during that confession, and the moment it flashed back and the music started up we're back in movie land. Utterly confusing. See it for Hoffman."

","I enjoyed the film and PS Hoffman's performance was excellent as always, especially here; however, I have a thing about seeing modern modular telephone cords when I'm supposed to believe that the scene is taking place during the heyday of Ma Bell. Kudos to the film maker for getting it right in every telephone scene but one, a close-up of Capote talking on the phone with a modular (plug-in) handset cord clearly visible attached to a more recently-styled handset. Seems to me a simple, inexpensive detail to have gotten right. Also, in the wake of a photo-shoot scene with the two suspects for The New Yorker, we see some proof-sheet images, clearly showing the film type, Agfa APX 400. Maybe Agfa paid a promotional fee (though they are leaving the film business). I wonder if Agfa B&W film labeled as ""APX"" 400 existed back then, and it seems probable that Agfa film was nowhere nearly as common as Kodak in the US during that era. They wouldn't have gone wrong by using Kodak Tri-X, for authenticity's sake."

","I feel like a real chump for rushing out to see this movie on the day it opened. <br/><br/>I guess I went cause PSM is such a great actor, but a great actor can't invest a cardboard character from a crappy script with life. And I didn't even think his performance was all that impressive from a purely mimetic standpoint. I mean, we've all seen lots of Truman on TV, if we are old enough. The voice was only about halfway there. I guess the reality just doesn't seem real enough, and this is why the watered down version of Capote works for audiences really well? I don't know. But frankly I think any really homophobic lout could probably do a better Capote imitation! Crinkling your nose a lot and getting about 70% of the quirkiness of Capote's delivery doesn't add up to a staggering performance for this viewer. I was also really disappointed by another actor I like in this picture, Clifford Collins, Jr. but he had so little to work with, nobody to impersonate but Robert Blake...and no real lines to speak of. no wonder he just resorted blinking and fidgeting on overdrive.<br/><br/>The script is really to blame<br/><br/>2 spoilers:<br/><br/>such transparently contrived writing at times, like when Capote waltzes into the FKI office and announces ""I don't care whether you catch the killers or not; I'm here to write about the impact of the crime on the people of this town!"" I mean I think Capote would have a little more savoir faire. But you see, this BS is 'necessary' exposition so that later the other little plastic exchanges will 'work': when he tells the friend of the clutter girl ""I know how hard it is for the boyfriend: everyone used to think they had me pegged cause of how I am and how I talk and they were always wrong!"" (now this is neither here nor there, but were they?!?) and she melts at this self obsessed sharing and presents him with the victim's diary. To Chris Cooper he does a little bit about how after her death, his mom's husband asked him to please ""talk, talk about anything! because you see he couldn't bear to be alone with his thoughts, he couldn't stand the pain of it all!"" and this of course is when Chris cooper melts, etc... These moments, and every single other one designed either to demonstrate how insensitive or, contrastingly, how terribly sensitive and universally in touch with us all as great writer he must be... are pure drivel. And each of them concludes with we the audience sitting there along with the camera, waiting for the ""cut!"" as we are supposedly having it sink in that something profoundly humane has just occurred. pathetic!<br/><br/>disclaimer:<br/><br/>my phone started vibrating a little over an hour into the movie and I had to leave to go back to work, so I didn't see it the whole film, but I'm sure I saw enough to peg this film as a typical kitsch Hollywood artist biog. maybe PSH actually did get to do some acting in the 2nd and 3rd acts, portraying the decline of Capote... <br/><br/>all you have to do is watch the maylses brothers short of Capote talking about in cold blood to know that he wouldn't be sitting there with his editor going ""Oh, Tenesee loved it! gee!!!"" leaving the praise to come from the editor! and you'd see that even so young he had that incredibly weird delivery happening, it's not like something he saved for Dick Cavett and hadn't perfected yet,,, till after the period this film portrays!<br/><br/>0 stars!!!"

It was certainly an informative movie as well as an entertaining one. This movie illustrates the relationship Capote had with the two murders and how much his novel meant to him. A lot of the movie highlights how much time and care he took when gathering the information for his novel in order to make sure he got the story right and served both Dick and Perry justice. I would certainly not call this movie boring if that is a concern of yours, I recommend it to anybody, but be aware that it is graphic if that is something you are not comfortable watching.

","Great performance, but there's something very myopic about this film--it's essentially a old- fashioned ""whodunnit"": the entire focus is on Capote, how he lies and how he manipulates Smith in order to arrive at ""the truth"" (i.e., the story of the murders). There is only the slightest suggestion in the film that Smith might be manipulating Capote (his paranoid remarks about Hickok), but those seem dismissed as irrelevant. Finally, after years, the Great Capote gets his man--Smith confesses, or gives his version of ""what happened that night."" It is obviously only a version, and a self-serving one--but the film presents this as The Truth (it's been forty years since I read In Cold Blood; I believe that is how Capote presented it in the book as well--I may be wrong here). But why would Capote need to know The Truth? Would he recognize it if he sat on it? Why should Perry Smith tell The Truth? Is what Perry Smith remembers The Truth? And the Truth for whom? All these questions could have been raised, and they're certainly familiar to even a Film101 student fresh from Roshomon. But not, apparently, to those who made the film, whose doting on Capote (and the great performance by Hoffman) kept them from dealing with any of these."

","I guess they thought that making a movie out of the MAKING of an interesting book would be interesting by extension.<br/><br/>In the end though this movie has very little to offer. Anyone who has read ""In Cold Blood"" knows that Capote got a little close to the killers, especially Smith.. It seems like the central moral dilemma of this movie is that he lied to them a few times and *gasp* he was more interested in turning a profit than being a humanitarian.<br/><br/>Of course, he is dealing with people who killed an entire innocent family and are not really deserving of a lot of sympathy so it's hardly the shocking dilemma that the movie makes it out to be that he ends up having (at best) mixed feelings about them in the end and not being totally up-front with his ""friend"".<br/><br/>His moral hand wringing just seems like much-ado about nothing. The movie does paint Capote as rather unlikable, but that seems to be its only real accomplishment. There's a bit of interesting background information for people interested in ""In Cold Blood"" but that's about all."

","It has been many years since I read ""In Cold Blood"" but one incident in it was Capote's depiction of the hanging. In the film the execution is conducted on a scaffold. As I remember the book there was no scaffold and these murderers were hanged from pipes in the basement of the prison. Any input on this would be appreciated. Another interesting incident in one of the recent movies on this story that always baffled me was why the authorities allowed Capote complete access to a men on death row. Capote never wrote of this in his book apparently because one movie had a prison official accepting money allowing such access which would seem to be a felony if revealed at the time. By the time the movies were released the statute of limitations applied and thus rendered this issue moot."
"Cosmoeticadotcom","7","0","1","9 September 2008"," Good film
","The only reason to make a film about someone as controversially repugnant as Truman Capote would be to illuminate his greatest quality- his superb prose writing. At his best, Capote was one of last century's greatest wordsmiths. Instead, the current film, Capote, focuses on the lesser things the man was known for- his showmanship, sensationalism, and homosexuality- although in that last category what is shown is tame and watered down. Now, I'm not saying that a full fledged swordfight between Philip Seymour Hoffman (who plays Capote) and Bruce Greenwood (who plays his lover Jack Dunphy) was necessary, but since the film focuses on the six years Capote was researching and writing his 1965 non-fiction novel In Cold Blood, because of his homoerotic attraction for one of the two killers the book follows, Perry Smith (Clifton Collins, Jr.), it would have illuminated something more about the man. Of course, what creative processes were behind Capote's creation of what he termed 'a whole new form of writing'- the 'non-fiction novel'- would have been even better.<br/><br/>That said, these elements, which are the fault of the screenplay by Dan Futterman, adapted from Gerald Clarke's biography Capote, are the only things that keep this good film from greatness. All the rest of it, including the direction by Bennett Miller, is superb, starting with Hoffman's stab at the icon. This is not a hagiography, and the film makes several wise choices, of which showing Capote's flaws is one. Another excellent choice is to not do a cradle to grave biopic. By focusing only on a few year period it allows us a look at a pivotal point in the character's life. But why, then, not go deeper into the creative processes of the artist? Why not try to provide some insight into why this meek, little man would be so attracted to an amoral thug? Manifestly, there is nothing left to get at with the November 15th, 1959, Holcomb, Kansas murders of the Clutter clan by Smith and Dick Hickock (Mark Pellegrino). As with Leopold and Loeb, before them, and any number of spree killers after them, they are relative ciphers. So, why Capote's need to 'understand' them, especially Smith, if not the homo-eroticism? Unless the whole point of the film is to show us Capote as a vampire, waiting for the pair's execution so he could have a good ending for his book.<br/><br/>Yet, there was so much more to be mined- Capote's relationship with Jack Dunphy- both as a lover and artist. Considering that Dunphy was not in a league with Capote as a writer would have made their dynamic all the more interesting, as well giving the criminally underrated Greenwood (so good in the cult TV series Nowhere Man and as JFK in the Kevin Costner film Thirteen Days) a chance to show his considerable acting chops in a major role, in an arts house film. Another waste was the whole presence of Capote's childhood friend, Catherine Keener's (Nelle) Harper Lee character, despite her solid portrayal, especially considering her own one hit wonder, To Kill A Mockingbird, was big right at this timeÂ…. A final point, though, and that is with the title of the film. Given the wise decision to not go cradle to grave, why such an all-encompassing title? Why not something more specific and germane to what is on screen? As with much else in the film, such as Hoffman's over-hyped, but solid, performance, it is these little niggles and wrong turns that make so much of what the film does right go wrong enough to just miss being something truly great."

","How much you enjoy this film may depend in part on whether or not you've already seen Richard Brooks's 1967 adaptation of ""In Cold Blood"". Sure, there are some fine performances here, particularly from Hoffman, Cooper & Keener, and while Clifton Collins Jr. is no match for Robert Blake as Perry Smith that isn't a major detraction since the killers aren't given the central role that they deserve. Therein lies my main problem with the picture: I find that the story suffers from a lack of focus, or rather a case of misplaced focus. Frankly, I didn't care about Capote's relationship with these men, partly because the film-makers didn't convince me that I *should* care. Instead, I kept asking myself, ""Why shift the focus to Capote when the really compelling characters are the killers, particularly Perry Smith?"" If that's the angle that appeals to you then I urge you to seek out ""In Cold Blood"". If, however, you are looking for a peek into Capote's life and creations, then you may appreciate this film more than I have."

","This should have been brilliant: Truman Capote was a great writer with a story of his own begging to be told; ""In Cold Blood"" changed literature; Smith & Hickock were a special case of murderers. And PS Hoffman is one of the better actors working today.<br/><br/>So what happened? Why is this movie dull, boring, lifeless - or if nothing else just plain disappointing? For one thing, it's a lot like ""Ray"". PS Hoffman and Foxx get into the character, live the character, are the character. Foxx WAS Ray Charles; PS Hoffman IS Truman Capote. And that's the problem: the movie watches PS Hoffman BE Truman Capote: the accent, manner, tone, movements, attitude. It's lets him go and do what he wants. It was Ray all over again. You can here the crew clapping after every scene - folks fainting with disbelief at how perfect, how brilliant, how exact, how PS Hoffman IS Capote, ""you're more Truman than he was"", ""you are Truman"", ""it's so ..."", ""you're so ..."", ..... And so each scene is wrapped based on how perfectly nuanced Hoffman was.<br/><br/>This makes it like one of those one-man Broadway shows where somebody is FDR, is Truman, is whomever. Yes, Hoffman was Capote. He's even incredible in parts eg. when he's lying to Smith about the book's publication and title. But that doesn't make a decent movie.<br/><br/>Kenner is a bossy and distant Harper Lee, with lots of side looks and glances and innuendos on the phone.<br/><br/>The dialogue overall is trite and forced. At least the dialogue you can hear. Hoffman-Capote speaks softly and in a mild Southern accent that is difficult to follow. I turned the volume up and down so many times that I finally realized it was impossible to hear and just gave up.<br/><br/>The cutting is impossible. Often you just start to get the feel for a scene when it jumps, sometimes even ""one year later"". Unnecessary cuteness is thrown in for no reason eg. (someone seeing Harper Lee) ""You're that book - 'Kill a Bird'"".<br/><br/>What is especially hard to follow is the mixing of the sensitive emotional Capote with the callous center of attention at parties Capote. I assume this was the real and much-conflicted Truman Capote. Unfortunately it just doesn't work - when we see him being touched by Smith near the end it seems like acting.<br/><br/>Worth seeing to watch PS Hoffman work but a major disappointment."
"rmax304823","8","0","1","28 March 2007"," A Story of Two Men Who Had Something in Common.
","Richard Brooks directed an earlier version of Capote's book, ""In Cold Blood,"" in 1968 that seems in retrospect to have been made for a mass audience. For the most part it takes the point of view of the killers, Smith and Hickock, their childhoods, their fantasies, their travels, their barbaric crimes. Truman Capote doesn't appear in Brooks' film. Instead there is a journalist (Paul Stewart) who shows up at the end to witness the executions and mouth humanisms about capital punishment.<br/><br/>In this film, Capote is front and center, with capable support from Clifton Collins, Jr. (Perry Smith), Katherine Keener (Harper Lee) and Chris Cooper as the bitterly angry detective, Alvin Dewey. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is excellent as Truman Capote -- not just his impersonation, which is sometimes as difficult to understand as Son Soong's Cosmic Engine, but because he gives Capote a fully formed incarnation.<br/><br/>Capote begins to look into the case for a New Yorker article about how the murders of the Clutter family affected the small town, but after the boys are captured and he begins to get to know them (particularly Perry Smith) the short piece begins to look sensational and very bookish in length. The problem Capote is faced with is that until the death sentence is either carried out or some other permanent solution is arrived at -- Capote has NO END for his story! Well, you can imagine the conflict he finds himself in. He's under pressure from his publishers to finish the by-now well-ballyhood piece. But he has become friends, in a manner of speaking, with Perry. And Perry's death turns into a tool for Capote's professional advancement, a consideration of which Capote is keenly aware. (In sociology this is called ""role conflict"".) It is to Hoffman's and the screenwriter's credit that they treat this conflict honestly. There is no doubt that Capote is sincere about his friendship with Perry and Hickock and his desire to see them live. He helps find a lawyer to represent them at their appeal. (It isn't until later that he realizes his work requires their death.) And he weeps convincingly at his last meeting with them. But this doesn't prevent him from lying repeatedly to Perry about matters such as who chose the gory title for Capote's book -- ""In Cold Blood."" Capote tells Perry that his publishers chose it just as a working title for a one-night reading and that he had nothing to do with it, and that he hasn't chosen a title yet. But we know that he proudly announced his decision about the title to Alvin Dewey some time earlier. He also dissembles in order to wheedle out of Perry the details of events at the Clutter farm so that the book's popular appeal will be boosted.<br/><br/>So did Capote want the pair to be executed for the sake of drama? Or was he being sincere about his emotional involvement with them. The answer is ""both"". He was sincere, and then he used it as an instrument of manipulation. That two-dimensionality is what makes this a more adult film than Brooks' 1968 version. Capote, like all of us, is a flawed and very human moral entity.<br/><br/>""In Cold Blood"" indeed. Alvin Dewey asks Capote if the title refers to the boys' crimes or to Capote's attempts to get them off. Hoffman hesitates before replying, ""Why, the former."" The script at times seems a little generous with the Capote character. He's given to telling amusing stories about celebrities -- true enough. But during interviews he's given the presence and demeanor of a caring shrink oozing unconditional regard. It isn't until the end that we realize that this is partly, but only partly, a mask for his ambition. Over the phone, after the execution, he tells Harper Lee that he is distraught because he couldn't save them. Lee tells him not unkindly, ""You didn't want to."" The direction is functional, the pacing deliberate. The photography is really magnificent with arty, if somewhat derivative touches -- a long flat Kansas landscape with a tiny train rolling along the horizon. The Clutter murders are shown briefly on the screen. Perry's hanging is shown too, but not from Perry's point of view, as it is in Brooks' film, thank God. Details of executions pander to our basest impulses. ""Ted Bundy"" is a good example of what I mean.<br/><br/>Capote was a good, clear writer, and ""In Cold Blood"" was a straightforward extended New Yorker piece, even if it was in book form. It was also a great success, critically and publicly -- ""a non-fiction novel."" It irritated the ever-envious Normal Mailer so much that he subtitled his next book ""The Novel as History, History as Novel."" Capote wrote several more fragmentary pieces about such things as the arrangement of paintings in Greta Garbo's living room, and he continued puffing his next book, ""Answered Prayers,"" which didn't happen. The epilogue suggests that Capote drank himself to death because the effort of producing ""In Cold Blood"" destroyed him, but maybe he'd just written himself out. Or maybe he figured he could never follow up such a glorious success. Maybe when you get everything you've ever wanted there's nothing left to live for."

I saw some movies where Philip Seymour Hoffman appeared, but Capote he acts is completely different from all of the characters he acted before. <br/><br/>This film depicts how Capote got into a horrible murder of a family of 4, which happened in Kansas(USA) in 1959 and he interviewed the local people, including the two killers and finally wrote a novel about it. Capote is said to be the first person to have established non-fiction novels. And, he claimed he was gay in public. It was not common in those days. Capote came over to the killers in the holding cell and prison and talked to them a lot as their friend. Capote had the two feelings for Perry, one of the killers. On the one hand, he wanted to use him to get a story. On the other hand, he had compassion or love over him. Just before the death sentence was executed, these two extremes met in his mind. He visited the prison to talk with them and witnessed the excution. He was traumatized by this experience. So he couldn't finish another book.<br/><br/>I've never read his book, In Cold Blood. So I think I have to read it examing the background of the murder and Capote's bias about the killers."
"irinaver","7","0","1","3 November 2006"," quite good but lack of depth
","Good movie, quite well done and an interesting story but there is no characters development: Capote seems to be the same all the movie through! I would have liked to see the change in the way he talked and spoke and behaved while he was getting more and more involved in the case. In addition, I am afraid that S.Hoffman didn't manage to put across Capote's ability to charm people. I didn't find him being charming or charismatic at all; to me he didn't look that he had any personal power which could have attracted people to him. It was a good impersonation but lack of depth and integrity, I thought. Overall, it was good, though."
"Boba_Fett1138","7","0","3","11 October 2006"," Intriguing character, intriguing story, yet the movie as a whole fails to completely intrigue.
","""Capote"" might at first sight seem like just another biopic and it was also advertised that way. But beware what to expect when watching this film. In fact this movie is not a biopic at all. The story follows the writer Truman Capote, while doing research for his new book 'In Cold Blood', about the brutal killings of an entire family in a quiet peaceful little town. The movie merely tells the story of one event out of a persons life and does not concentrate at all on the entire life span and/or career of Truman Capote. I applaud this movie for choosing this approach. It makes ""Capote"" a refreshing movie with a story and main character that you don't see in movies everyday.<br/><br/>But the movie does not only chooses a different approach with its main character, it also chooses a different approach with the story in general. The movie concentrates on the developing compassion of Capote with the two murderers. People always tend and also want to see murderers as nothing more than just cold-hearted monsters, while of course in reality things are far more complex and rarely ever just as simple or black & white. This movie has the guts to show that and tells the story from a different approach. It's one of the reasons why the story is an intriguing one.<br/><br/>Another reason why this movie is intriguing is due to its main character. Truman Capote was an one of a kind person, with his quiet little voice, who didn't hide his homosexuality, unlike most other persons who lived in the same era, and he had his very own style and sense of humor. He was who he was and wasn't afraid to live his life the way he wanted to. It all helps to make ""Capote"" an unique viewing experience.<br/><br/>Of course the movie is also helped with Philip Seymour Hoffman Oscar winning performance. I, like almost every other movie lover, predicted years ago that Hoffman would once win an Oscar. Ever since his role in ""Twister"", I followed his career with great interest, wondering when Hoffman's Oscar winning performance would come along. When I first read the premise of this movie I immediately knew that this would be the movie for which he would be rewarded with an Oscar. This movie and his performance have everything in it an Oscar winning performance needs. It's a worthy role winning an Oscar for but to be honest I can't say that I'm too sure about this being Hoffman's best role. Nevertheless this of course doesn't take away that his acting in this movie is outstanding. He basically is strong enough in his acting to carry the movie on his own and he for most part also does so.<br/><br/>Here begins the trouble with this movie as well. It focuses mainly on the main character, leaving the side- also interesting characters, mainly blank and distant. The story could had worked out more powerful and engaging if it had only concentrated more on the other characters- and their emotions, as well. The movie now mostly is nothing more than a one man's show, tour-de-force from Hoffman. The Harper Lee character and Capote's homosexual boyfriend were severely underused in the movie and they could had been used in the movie to provide the movie with some more required depth.<br/><br/>But frankly this is not even my biggest complained about this movie. I found the directing and story flow to be severely lacking. The movie is filled with some way too short sequences. Some sequences are as simple as Capote hanging on the phone in his hotel room and literally 5 seconds later the movie cuts to the next day, outside, in a completely different place. I really didn't liked the story flow and style of directing, although it obviously was done deliberately to give the movie a style and identity of its own. My guess is that director Bennett Miller is a stage director who is not yet experienced enough to also direct full length movies, at least not in the way I like to watch movies.<br/><br/>Besides Hoffman the movie has some other truly excellent actors in it, that unfortunately aren't always given enough room in the movie. Catherine Keener was really, really great as Harper Lee and she truly deserved an Oscar as well. Unfortunately she got nothing more than a nomination. The movie also has the always excellent Chris Cooper and the solid acting Bruce Greenwood in it.<br/><br/>The cinematography is absolutely stunning at times and helps to set the right mood for the movie and its time period. Wonder why it wasn't even nominated for an Oscar. The movie was nominated for 5 Oscars in total, mainly the most important ones (best movie, best directing, best screenplay, best actor in a leading role). The movie only won one in the end, for Hoffman's performance of the main character. It's a typical Oscar worthy movie, based on true events and a real life character but I'm glad it didn't won any of the big awards. It just isn't one of the best of 2005 in my book, which is mainly due to the bad story flow and missed opportunities with the story and characters. ""Capote"" is a solid movie and perhaps also more than that but in the end it didn't all impressed me as much as I expected and had hoped it would.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","This is a film about Truman Capote's research into a quadruple murder in a small Kansas town. Not the murder itself, but how it affected the people in the town, and who the murderers were. Capote is an eccentric character, and somewhat infectious. I don't want to give away too much of the story, so I'll go right to my thoughts.<br/><br/>This film deserves all of the awards and nominations it received. Every character was perfectly cast, and the acting was superb. Each shot was carefully framed, and the colors were balanced and saturated beautifully. Capote is the best film I've seen (from a technical standpoint) since Brokeback Mountain. But unlike the latter movie, Capote did manage to be compelling, and connected the characters to me, the viewer.<br/><br/>This is not one film I would rave about, but it is worth watching for those who enjoy a beautifully crafted movie."

","The acting is this movie is superb, the best, outstanding and the only reason I give it a vote of 7. I found the movie to real to really allow me to enjoy the movie. Don't get me wrong; if you want to see someone come off as the ""real"" Truman Capote, or you want some one to recreate him (why would any one want that), then this is the movie for you. Hoffman was just as obnoxious on the screen as Truman Capote was when he used to make the talk show circuit. Hoffman did a wonderful job of portraying an alcoholic, self absorbed, homosexual, literary genius. The story was weak in my opinion. I could never decide if it was a glorified rehash of ""In Cold Blood"", or if it was a true insight into the life, works and accomplishments of Truman Capote. In the end it accomplished neither for me."
"TimeForLime","8","0","1","11 July 2006"," CAPOTE (2005) ,,,,, Looking back at the 1950s in America
","This is a VERY minority opinion. With respect both to CAPOTE and GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK, two look-back films of 2005 ,,,, I felt for both films a cloud of doubt. WHO CARES? Of course I care because I was alive in that era. More aware of Edward R. Murrow than I was of Truman Capote.<br/><br/>When I read IN COLD BLOOD, it ranked for me with TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD and PEYTON PLACE (Yeah, I know). To a young kid, all three books were about times and places far way but credible. These places had to be true because the writings were so vivid.<br/><br/>As is reflected in the voting for this film, the 18-34 age group knows of Capote and Murrow only on an exception basis. I don't believe it is the norm to know about them. This would be true, also for Bobby Darin (BEYOND THE SEA - 2004) but not for Ray Charles (RAY - 2004). Ray Charles appears to be much better known.<br/><br/>Where does that leave POLLOCK (2000)? I can't say. I know in my public school, CAPOTE was discussed, very discreetly -- as if he had done something slightly wrong; but POLLOCK was unheard of. The broad middle class hungered for blood, but certainly not for bohemians from Manhattan / East Hampton who spilled, dribbled and spritzed paint and got paid for it.<br/><br/>""Bulah, do you KNOW what goes on in Greenwich Village?"" To get a feel for the times, try MONA LISA SMILE (2003). We are all just looser and mostly better informed these days because there aren't so many heresies -- or at least the heresies are different.<br/><br/>Did this pallor of obscurity -- ALLEGED obscurity -- affect the films themselves? Well I found GOOD NIGHT to be crisp, credible, continuously interesting. Whereas I found CAPOTE to be a bit of a 'museum piece' right off.<br/><br/>The was a biography done for the A&E Channel about Capote with the title TRUMAN CAPOTE: THE TINY TERROR (also 2005). This documentary is rentable from NetFlix. I learned MORE from this documentary than from the film, because it covers a longer period of Capote's life. Thus the declines in his health and fortunes -- which for the most part occur after the film closes -- and which one learns about only from the CAPOTE bonus tracks, are perhaps easier to understand if you can get your hands on that 'Biography'.<br/><br/>All this being said, and the drift here is more negative than positive, THE FILM IS AN ACCOMPLISHMENT. Philip Seymour Hoffman, it seemed to me, ""got it"" just the way Jamie Foxx ""got it"" in RAY.<br/><br/>Even more than Hoffman, THE FILM ""GETS IT."" You weren't supposed to write about such things in such ways back in 1959, ,,,, and you weren't even supposed to 'go to the source' and know about killers and the like. CAPOTE helps to spell that out for us I think the strongest point in the film is the suggestion that Capote fell to the temptation of CREATING news by involving himself in it. (I don't want to create an unfair SPOILER here.) <br/><br/>That's another thing you weren't supposed to do back in '59. News believed itself to be dispassionate -- more like the 'scientific method' that we learned about in high school. To see how reportage has changed, you could compare the coverage of Watergate (ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN-1976) vs. Monicagate. Reporters seem now to have an 'obligation' to tidy up the news if it doesn't fit our icons. ,,,,, Oops, now that's getting into current heresies.<br/><br/>And, importantly, IN COLD BLOOD was a book, not a newspaper column. That gave (the real) Capote some 'elbow-room.' For some parallel film interpretations of random killings, a particularly lurid favorite of American journalism, you could compare to CAPOTE the film treatments of the Starkweather-Fugate murders. Check out Terrence Malick's BADLANDS (1973), and the disappointing STARKWEATHER (2004); or better the 1993 TV production with Tim Roth and the indelible Fairuza Balk, MURDER IN THE HEARTLAND,,,,, and viewed again from 30,000 feet in NATURAL BORN KILLERS (1994). This latter film examines what the 'media circus' has become. And to it a degree, it all traces back to the headwater of Truman Capote's genius (or at least his flair.)"
"parhat","7","0","1","24 June 2006"," Cold Blood Parallels the Murderer and Capote Himself
","The movie Capote was well acted, by Philip Seymour Hoffman, and it represents a microcosm of a small part of his life during the writing of his non-fictional book, In Cold Blood. A large portions of the movie is devoted, somewhat unbalanced look on the murderers, which we only see Capote interviewing only one of the murderers, Perry. While we were left in almost complete darkness, with possible exception near the end of the movie, the other murderer, Hickock. The movie was not clear cut as to why he never engaged in any conversation with the other one. It is obvious that screening time for the other murderer would have helped at least for the audiences to compare the differences in personalities between the two murderers.<br/><br/>The movie stresses that Capote himself in a desire to finish his novel had to manipulate the prisoners in a somewhat less than honest confrontation with them to get the story he wanted on the night of the murder. Of course, he had to spend an enormous amount of time just to get that. As a result,he resorted to a somewhat cold blooded method of getting the facts by telling the prisoners false lies and that he is interested in the case, when in fact he isn't. It therefore makes you wonder the parallel of two not so bright thugs who murdered the family in cold blood, were matched with a person who is cold blooded, in a different way concerning the welfare or his actual interest in the two murderers. So in fact we can say the murderers and Capote were both cold blood, but in different way, one is real blood, the other is your attitude.<br/><br/>A more direct way to deal with them, but a gentler approach would have worked by bargaining with the prisoner that I will provide you with the lawyer to fight your case, if you please just tell me what happened on that night, and I promise you the information will not be released until the case is over. I think Truman did not try a more direct approach. It would not only save Truman an enormous amount of time, but it is also more ethical and that too might have save Truman's own soul in the future and as a result his own productive output. Who knows? That brings me to the other issue of the problem about that movie, it is whether there is in fact the writing of Cold Blood was responsible for Truman's own demise as implied by the movie. The implication is not that clear cut as that if you read encyclopedia descriptions of Truman Capote. His Grand Party he held was not even emphasized, it just showed him only just a small player, where in fact it is well known that he is in fact a major player. These are some mistakes that I would like to point out, if only the movie can show this casual relationship between the writing of Cold Blood did in fact lead to his demise. I for one still can't see it and his output in writing for short stories and novels does in fact continue right until up to his own death. So the problem of the movie appears to be a somewhat inaccurate portrayal of historical facts with the movie. The movie would have been better if people would have known that he does make himself a bigger than life character, instead of just someone enjoying the party, instead of the Party Master himself."

","I finally got around to seeing this in a London with unseen good films thin on the ground. Whilst I found it less than riveting it did keep me watching and I was able to wallow in Caroline Keener's fantastic support as Harper Lee. Hoffman is just as brilliant in the eponymous role as everyone said he was yet nevertheless it was difficult to become engrossed in the story and I found myself wondering why - when a caption announces the time as November, 1956, the leaves on the trees are not being stirred by a wind whilst Capote and Lee are definitely dressed for winter, which is hardly the sign of a gripping movie. In my case I was equally, if not more so, interested in William Shawn and Harper Lee as they figured in Capote's life as the two killers. Like I said interesting but not memorable."

","Why can't more movies be this good? Well written, well acted and just well done all around. I don't see a lot of movies these days, but it's movies like this one that give me faith in Hollywoods ability to tell a good story. Hoffman is outstanding as the brilliant, obsessed, and slightly tortured Capote trying to chronicle the brutal murder of a family in the mid-west for his book ""In Cold Blood"". And Catherine Keener is also outstanding as his...I guess the right word is side kick. Clifton Collins Jr. was perfect as the outwardly calm, but internally raging Perry Smith. Cinematography, wardrobe, sets,...pretty much everything was really spot on. A great film that I would recommend to anyone."

","DVD from my public library, excellent picture and sound, with few extras, but of interest is some actual footage of Truman Capote.<br/><br/>This movie spans late 1959 through 1965. Capote already was a successful writer, but the results of his exploration into the small town Kansas murder of the family of 4 catapulted him to international recognition and riches.<br/><br/>Philip Seymour Hoffman is superb as Truman Capote, winning the Oscar for Best Actor. His friend and assistant was Catherine Keener as author Nelle Harper Lee (to Kill a Mockingbird). Chris Cooper is local law enforcement man Alvin Dewey. And Bruce Greenwood gives a low-key performance as Jack Dunphy, Capote's long-time companion.<br/><br/>In a real sense, the events and resulting book that gave Capote fame, also took his life away. As the 1960s grew on, and the two convicted killers' executions (by hanging) were delayed by appeals, Capote grew frustrated that he could not complete his book. Even though he had befriended the two men, in the last stages he was impatient for them to die, to write his final chapter. It was perhaps the guilt of those feelings which pushed Capote to the drug and alcohol abuse that killed him at age 59.<br/><br/>Superbly made and acted movie."

","Though thanks to this movie I know a bit more about Capote than before I started, this is hardly a biographical movie which should have been more accurately titled :The Writing of In Cold Blood.<br/><br/>Having found the author insufferable during the many years he spent being merely a personality after the completion if this last book, I confess to some bias in his regard. Though I can hardly flaw the acting, the plot is rather limited and slow in its development. In the final analysis, one is left more or less with just a general feeling about our hero(?). The man might have been extremely talented with his use of words, but there is little creativity or imagination that I could find in the writing of his revolutionary(?) non-fiction novel. Capote is similar to a vampire drawing blood from his victim(s) in order to achieve or retain his status. Just a vain, deceitful, despicable little man. It is hard to imagine that anyone actually loved him in his lifetime.<br/><br/>For those that may not be too familiar with his brilliantly imitated style of talking, I recommend watching this movie with subtitles and possibly even turning the sound off."

","When a movie buff sermonizes, ""They don't make 'em like they used to,"" have him/her watch ""Copote,"" one of the best films to come out of Hollywood in years. It succeeds where so many other artsy features bite the dust. The direction is first rate, not too slow nor too fast. Take the exceptionally filmed scene when Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.) is led to jail past a throng of curious bystanders. In the crowd is Copote (Philip Seymour Hoffman). The camera work is amazing. The viewer automatically sees the bonding taking place between criminal and writer on first encounter. Bennett Miller's direction is that good throughout the entire film.<br/><br/>Philip Seymour Hoffman is one of the few actors who actually become the character being portrayed. Ben Kingsley in ""Gandhi"" also comes to mind. Hoffman has the uncanny ability to speak like Copote and to mimic his mannerisms. His appearance is similar too. The viewer believes he/she is seeing Copote back from the grave. Catherine Keener as ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" author Harper Lee is almost as good as Hoffman but her secondary part limits her scope.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is fine with two exceptions, the killers, Richard Hickock and Perry Smith, played by Mark Pellegrino and Clifton Collins Jr. respectively. Though they do their best, those who have seen ""In Cold Blood"" compare their performances to those of Scott Wilson and Robert Blake who were outstanding and near impossible to better.<br/><br/>The story centers not on Copote's life, though fragments enter here and there, but on the writing of his masterpiece, ""In Cold Blood,"" and more specifically on his unnatural relationship with the cold blooded killer Perry Smith. Copote sincerely believes, ""It's as if Perry and I grew up in the same house. And one day he went out the back door and I went out the front."" This is countered by Perry's sister's statement to Copote,""He'd just as soon kill you as shake your hand."" His own sister sees through the pretense of innocence and excuses of a depraved childhood. Copote does not, because he becomes too attached to the similarities between Perry and himself.<br/><br/>There are two parts in ""Copote"" that are truly horrendous. When Perry finally talks about the murder of Herb, Bonnie, Nancy and Kenyon Clutter, in flashback the events of that fateful night in Holcomb, Kansas, are recreated. The direction is flawless which makes for nightmarish viewing. The sound editing is so refined that the gunshots will echo through the mind long after the shooting stops. The other is a vivid reenactment of the hanging with Copote being one of the witnesses. It is more grueling than the one in ""In Cold Blood."" <br/><br/>Copote was an intellectual who loved to babble. His parties were the talk of the world and being invited was considered an honor and a privilege. It was as if he paid for and set up his own little cosmos where he would be the center of attention. For him his greatest moments were on the talk show circuit where he became a celebrity. But at heart he was a creative genius with a tortured soul, hence his problem with alcohol that eventually killed him. Harper Lee was intellectually the opposite. She loved privacy and felt ill at ease in public. She saw through Copote's facade. When Truman wallows in self pity that he couldn't have done anything to save the two killers, Lee shoots back, ""The truth is, you didn't want to."""

Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance is an uncanny embodiment -- greater and more effective than any kind of fancy special effects. (Supporting work by Clifton Collins was incredible as well, and it was an absolute travesty he was overlooked completely by the Academy Awards.)

","Capote is a tricky film to comment on. It is about one of America's most famous writers. Truman Capote (Philip Seymour Hoffman). But this is not a biopic on his entire life. But like the other films in its genre this is about the build up to his finest hour. The build up to his most famous book ""In Cold Blood"". It bizarrely portrays the actions of this eccentric man as he investigates on the a shocking murder of a family in Kansas. When the 2 killers are finally caught Capote desperately tries to earn one of the killers trust in order to complete his book.<br/><br/>But throughout the film i didn't know whether the film was boring or interesting. It seems as though director Bennet Miller purposely made this film not to be thrilling or compelling as such, or even to draw the audience in, but just to tell the story of this strange mans selfish journey to use this prisoner and to fool him into believing that he is his friend just so he can use his story. Capote almost admits to using this man when he tells his friends that ""He is a goldmine"".<br/><br/>Although the film doesn't really have any qualities to it. It does have the power to make Truman Capote both the hero and the villain. This is told through his selfishness and the way he uses this guilty prisoner. but at the same time a hero as we the audience are almost fooled into thinking he actually is this mans companion. We are also never told too much about Capote's character. The only evidence on his past is proved when We are told that his mother killed himself and although there is a close relationship with fellow author Alvin Dewey there is no evidence that Capote is a homosexual despite his eccentric nature.<br/><br/>I really wouldn't recommend Capote as it is not a film for everyone. If it wasn't for Phillip Seymour Hoffman breathing life into this film i would of definitely walked out or passed out with boredom. Fantastic performances keep this poor novel a best seller."

Brian obtained an illegal advanced copy of the film on DVD (from where I will not tell because security concerns prohibit me to). ""Capote"" stars Phil Seymour Hoffman as Truman Capote and includes a plethora of other familiar faces who nobody knows unless you're a movie nerd. Phil does an excellent job playing Truman and emulating his infamous nasally voice and asthmatic cackle.<br/><br/>After starting the evening off with a delicious meal at Broadway Grill, accompanied by Scot and Liana, we returned to the O'Neill/Tynan residence whereas Brian worriedly noticed that he was out of beer. He convinced me to walk to the nearby store named ""Frozen Meats"" with him to pick up a gross of 22 ounce Icehouses. While there, I added sunflower seeds and sausage sticks to my grocery list. We departed the little grocery mart with our paper sacks of beer, talking nostalgically about the Capital Hill neighborhood I used to call home, and returned with the simple essentials for a perfect night of cinema. Bridget and Amy were reviewing the wedding invitation that Bridget designed and we all agreed that they turned out fabulous (even though the printing company couldn't provide the envelope paper she wanted). Scot and Liana arrived to the apartment after a considerable search for parking space, and Liana planted herself on the red velvet chase lounge (given to Bridget by her mother because it didn't match her furniture any more). Scot sat on an uncomfortable dining chair behind the couch dwellers (Brian, Amy, and I), and Bridget stationed herself on the floor between Brian's legs. After some channel jockeying and nonsensical conversation about TiVO, Brian cued the illicit movie on his new Osso HD DVD player.<br/><br/>The group quieted down, except for my sunflower seed crackling and the gentle laughter stemming from Liana's bemusement of the two housecats, Mogwai and Gizmo. The lively kittens continued to interrupt concentration throughout the film with their harebrained and zany antics. The evening was also dotted with Scot's flagelence, which was routinely released to punctuate a dramatic moment in the film. Typical Scot! Although the messages ""For Your Consideration"" and ""Not for Sale or Distribution"" periodically appeared on screen, ""Capote"" was an excellent film, worthy of all the Oscar accolades it's been receiving. ""Capote"" inspired and disturbed with its unconventional protagonists, forcing the viewer to challenge his moral judgment- having to choose between revulsion and sympathy for the movies antiheroes. Although the movie only gives you a snapshot of Truman's life (the period when he was writing his famous non-fiction novel, ""In Cold Blood"", which follows the brutal murder of a rural Kansas family by two imaginative ex-cons), it gives a good portrait of who Truman Capote was- narcissistic, compassionate, distrustful, brilliant,-qualities that would advance his legend until his horrible demise at the hands of alcoholism in 1984. (To learn more about the life of Truman Capote, I recommend the oral biography ""Truman Capote"", edited by George Plimpton, in which his friends and enemies are interviewed about his life).<br/><br/>Anyway, I must implore all to run out and see ""Capote"" before it deservedly wins multiple Oscars this Sunday."

","Bennett Miller's 'Capote' is an excellent showcase for the talents of the always capable Philip Seymour Hoffman, an actor of astonishing range who has, until now, not enjoyed the credit he deserves. Tracing the decline of the fine (if fickle) faculties of a wit such as Truman Capote was never going to be an easy task, but Hoffman succeeds in making the writer, for all his conceit, self-absorption and moral duplicity, a genuinely sympathetic character  rather than a shadow of the self-caricature the author himself adopted in later life. Katherine Keener (again, an often underrated performer), as Harper Lee (whose importance in the writing of the source novel, 'In Cold Blood', is all too often forgotten, but is honourably credited in Gerald Clarke's study of the writing of that text which, in turn, provided the basis for this screenplay), provides solid, sympathetic support, as indeed do Clifton Collins, the ever reliable Chris Cooper (superbly suited to the role of the stolid Alvin Dewey), and Bruce Greenwood - as Capote's long-suffering partner.<br/><br/>My only real criticism of this film  superbly scripted and directed as it is  is that more could have been made of Capote's empathy/infatuation with Perry Smith. His attraction to the murderer is clear enough, as indeed is his growing sense of guilt at lying to and manipulating his subject in order to learn the truth of the Kansas murders which sparked his writing  but the points of parity between the two which helped establish their relationship are largely neglected. Perry's final 'revelation' is stark and, by all accounts, helped unbalance Capote's emotional and creative equilibrium, and greater detail of how the pair connected might have added weight to our understanding of Capote's 'fall'.<br/><br/>All in all, though, a thoughtful, sensitive and refreshingly stark approach to what in other hands might have been a run of the mill murder mystery"

","""Capote"". What a heavy movie! Philip Seymour Hoffman did magnificent, he totally deserves an Oscar for his interpretation of Truman Capote, as he did deserve that Golden Globe. I'll forever see Truman Capote as Hoffman put him. He doesn't need to even move much on screen for his feelings to be captured, his eyes are intense throughout the entire movie. Even if you don't like the genre of this movie, it's worth seeing it for Seymour Hoffman alone.<br/><br/>The atmosphere of the movie bothered me, as I believe was the intention. The movie is slow, but you never feel like it's stretching, it's just the right lenght to capture you from start to end. Keeps you glued on the screen and tensed up the entire time, and when it ends, there's still this dense air around you. Incredible work."

","Phillip Seymour Hoffman was amazing in the title role, as were the supporting players. The art direction and cinematography were first rate too. I really felt I was there, in the late 1950's and early 1960's (despite the anachronism's detailed in IMDb!) But I think the film is let down by the script. I wish we'd got a stronger sense of the love Capote apparently felt for murderer Perry. It would have made Capote's withdrawal after hearing Perry's disturbing personal account of the slaughter much more powerful. As it stands, Capote's feelings feel somewhat watered down and they needed to be stronger to give the story more push and pull. I liked it, but it won't stay with me."

","""More tears are shed over answered prayers than unanswered ones."" I wonder what Truman Capote meant by the use of the statement. Besides the literal meaning of the statement, how did it apply to his own life and experience with Perry Smith? <br/><br/>I take it to mean a lot of things, but mostly it boils down to, ""Be careful for what you wish for. You might just get it."" I wonder what Capote was wishing for and got but then later regretted receiving.<br/><br/>Maybe Truman Capote found this revelation when the experience of being with Perry Smith overtook him. It was a blessing to get the story from Perry, but then ultimately, the emotion that resided within him afterwords soured the experience."
"lee_eisenberg","10","0","2","20 February 2006"," I wouldn't be surprised if Hoffman wins Best Actor.
","Beyond just showing Truman Capote (Philip Seymour Hoffman) writing ""In Cold Blood"", ""Capote"" shows how he got very interested in the killers and basically made a celebrity out of Perry Smith. And you'd better believe that Hoffman really gets into the role; he gets into it the same way that Jamie Foxx got into Ray Charles and Joaquin Phoenix got into Johnny Cash. If this movie has any faults, it's that we leave wondering what else happened during Capote's lifetime. But since that's not really important to the plot, there's no need to worry about it. This movie is well done in every sense. Not only does Hoffman seem very likely to win Best Actor, but Catherine Keener seems likely to also win an Oscar for playing Harper Lee. Also starring are Bruce Greenwood, Chris Cooper, and Bob Balaban.<br/><br/>The Golden Globe wins of GLBT-themed movies ""Brokeback Mountain"", ""Capote"", and ""Transamerica"" led Jay Leno to call it ""God's way of punishing Pat Robertson"". There is an interesting similarity in the setting of the first two. They both have very remote settings (although the former is moving into the Rocky Mountains) and somewhat low-key plots leading up to something more severe. All in all, ""Capote"" is a modern classic.<br/><br/>One really funny part is at the beginning when we learn that Capote, who came from the South, had previously written a novel in which...well, you'll see what I mean if you watch the movie."

","I loved this movie, and I noticed that the writer and director very delicately handled an intellectual debate that has been circulating for some time. That is, the debate on whether or not Harper Lee wrote ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", or whether Truman Capote actually wrote it and gave it to her as a gift. In the scene where Lee is congratulated on the book at a cocktail party, she is noticeably uncomfortable. Seconds later, someone mutters ""I didn't even know she was a writer."" Furthermore, I think Hoffman's brilliance as an actor is evident as he is riding in a car on the way to party celebrating the TKAM movie premiere. You see in his countenance ""I should have held onto this book - look at the money and acclaim. Menawhile, I may have committed social and career suicide by putting everything into this book which may never even be completed."" What do other people think if this aspect of the film. I was astounded by how the issue was touched on without being delved into."

The filmmakers clearly know how to make a movie, and the acting and writing is topnotch. It's just that...the movie is boring. It drags out for what seems like hours, but are only painful minutes. It harps on some plot points, but misses others or just pokes at them.<br/><br/>It seems like they were going for a real arty feel, and just ended up forgetting to add any invigoration to it. While being topnotch in many categories, it just doesn't have the uplifting, or movement needed to make a film be enjoyable on all counts. I wanted to fall asleep for much of the movie, it just was too boring for my liking.<br/><br/>The story itself is tremendously interesting, but the movie just lacks the life force and power to make the entire thing work. If they chopped a bit out, and added some more interesting elements to it, then it would have been a whole lot better.<br/><br/>Of course, Hoffman is fabulous as Capote himself. The mannerisms he inhibits are excellent, and you can really almost see the real man he's portraying. Whereas Charlize just wanted glory for Monster, and Jamie Foxx faltered in more than a handful of areas in Ray, Phillip Seymour Hoffman is perfect as Capote. He chews up every scene he's in, and completely blows all the other actors in the film into the wind. Catherine Keener may have got an Oscar nod, but she completely lost out on making any sort of impression, because Hoffman stole it from everybody.<br/><br/>The movie may be lacking, but he is not. He deserves the award hands down. It's a boring film with a astonishing Oscar worthy performance. If you have to see it, see it for Hoffman, and nothing else.<br/><br/>7.5/10."

","* * ½ In 1959, a small Kansas town is shattered by the brutal murders of four people. Writer Truman Capote (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), along with his friend Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), travels there to write about the effect on the town, but ends up writing a ""nonfiction novel"" about the killers, painting a portrait of what the two killers were like --- and, in the process, emotionally destroying himself. This true drama is certainly well made. The script, by Dan Futterman, is intelligent, creating incredibly human characters and real dialogue. Hoffman does a good job capturing his eccentric subject, and Keener is superb as Lee. The period detail is absolutely perfect. Director Bennett Miller gives a very talky, slow story enough energy to keep your interest. Miller and cinematographer Adam Kimmel create heartbreakingly beautiful yet subtle images throughout, assisted by an equally beautiful and subtle score by Mychael Danna. And yet, for some reason, the film never grabs you emotionally at all. Never once did I really have any strong feelings for any of the characters or events. It's a sad, dismal story that's interesting, but not that interesting. Only the images provoked any emotion from me. And, while it is intelligent, it didn't leave me thinking about anything. In the end, as Capote says, ""I frankly don't see what the fuss is all about."" There really isn't anything here that's compelling, moving, or entertaining. It's just intelligent and well made in every other way. In other words, this is a critic's film. It you're interested in a quiet, subtle, and intelligent drama, this is top-notch, but it fails for any kind of actual appeal. Also, if you want to see brilliant imagery in the film, you can't get much better than this. But if you don't have exceptional patience when watching a film, you will fall asleep. In fact, I like slowly-paced films, and my mind wandered several times."

"evanston_dad","8","0","3","31 October 2005"," Highly Intelligent Look Into the Mind of an Artist
","The recent onslaught of bland, paint-by-number Hollywood biopics may leave you completely disinterested in seeing ""Capote,"" the new film about eccentric author Truman Capote, directed by Bennett Miller and starring the chameleon Philip Seymour Hoffman. I hope you will reconsider if that is the case. ""Capote"" is not a biopic in the style of last year's overrated ""Ray""---show childhood of celebrity (ideally working in some liberal doses of strife or abuse if possible), show scrappy rise of celebrity from modest beginnings, show celebrity reach peak status, show celebrity self-destruct (usually due to drugs and/or alcohol), show celebrity hit rock-bottom, show celebrity seek peace and affirmation, and end on fuzzy, heart-warming scene in which celebrity is honored with a standing ovation as the soundtrack music swells. ""Capote"" is not that kind of film. In fact, ""Capote"" is not really about the life of Truman Capote, but rather is about the chain of events that led to Capote writing the book for which he is best known, ""In Cold Blood."" This is perhaps the most intelligent film I've ever seen about the relationship between an artist/journalist and the subject about which he is writing. The movie asks: how morally responsible is a writer for his subject? As depicted in this film, Capote becomes fascinated by a brutal crime in a tiny Kansas town, in which two men brutally murdered an entire family because they thought a large amount of money was hidden in the house. As he spends a great deal of time with one of the men (Perry Smith) and begins to piece together his story, he becomes personally interested in helping him fight his case; eventually, however, Capote's desire to write a work of art overrides the personal interest he's taken in Perry Smith, and he leaves the prisoner clinging to a false hope that Capote is bringing the ""true"" story (that is, the story of the men's innocence, though they're not innocent) to the world.<br/><br/>Miller's film is unflinching in its portrayal of Capote as a selfish artist who plays with the lives of his creations; it's as if he's become so used to writing fiction that he forgets he is telling the story of real people, and moreover real people who trust him to have their best interests at heart. Hoffman has been great in just about every movie he's appeared in, so it was no surprise to me that he would be great here as well. His performance is more than a mere impersonation. He is so good at showing the audience the two sides of Capote: the endearing, lovable side that make people want to trust him; and the cold, manipulative side that takes over when he becomes Capote the artist. It's to Hoffman's credit that you don't leave the film necessarily despising Capote for his actions, but neither do you feel like you've just participated in a two-hour session of hero worship.<br/><br/>Catherine Keener drabs down to play novelist Harper Lee; Clifton Collins, Jr. is soft and articulate as Perry Smith, which makes his final confession of the murders all the more chilling; and Chris Cooper adds another fine character performance to his list of character performances as head of the Holcomb, Kansas police department, leading the investigation.<br/><br/>My only problem with the film is its monotonous pacing. I feel like the film makers wanted so hard to avoid any of the artificial traditional Hollywood trappings that they felt any burst of energy or activity would be betraying the film's realism.<br/><br/>""Capote"" is a fine addition to the genre of films committed to exploring the motivations that drive artists, and Hoffman may finally get his due from the mainstream establishment for his award-worthy performance.<br/><br/>Grade: A-"

"jessied","8","0","1","12 October 2005"," Capote. Man and Film--Imperfect but Captivating
","Truman Capote (Philip Seymour Hoffman) lied to the people he pursued for stories that made him one of the most laudable American writers of the twentieth century. While the screenwriter (Dan Futterman), director (Bennett Miller), cast and crew of Capote deserve praise for an overall entertaining film, one must wonder if this creative team employed similar, manipulative tactics to please audiences and critics alike. The film does not tell the story of the Kansan family brutally murdered by Richard Hickock (Mark Pellegrino) and Perry Smith (Clifton Collins, Jr.) on November 15, 1959; famed writer and director Richard Brooks accomplished that task in 1967 with Capote's In Cold Blood starring Robert Blake as Smith and Scott Wilson as Hickock. Instead, it tells the story of its namesake who suffered through a self-imposed mission to return the convicted murderers to the realm of humanity. The story is captivating, but it is also rife with details altered from Capote's original account. Hollywood conventions effectively trivialize the life of the author and his work and diminish the credibility of the film and its creators.<br/><br/>Audience members should not limit filmmakers to original texts. Entertainment value typically trumps dedication to an original narrative if the alteration does not interfere with the story's integrity, but one must scrutinize artistic liberties utilized in films that aim to inform as well as entertain. Creative teams should not substitute sentimental falsities for mundane realities. Choices that substantially differ from the reality of a situation must be made with great care and caution. The filmmaker must remember that he or she rewrites history for the masses with each detail that he or she changes, and that these changes cannot be justified simply for dramatic effect. A lack of thoughtfulness cheapens the richness of life that exists outside of the movie projector and disrespects those who lived and died with experiences suitable for the silver screen. One who attempts to capture absolute truth on film will usually fail, but this failure exceeds any attempt that procures cinematic greatness at the expense of humankind.<br/><br/>Capote does not necessarily mislead its audiences or distort the author's memory of events that served as the basis of the novel that followed Breakfast at Tiffany's and became the last work Capote would complete before his death in 1984. All noticeable changes relate to details concerning the Clutter family if Capote's account is to be believed: names of minor but significant characters have been changed, characters' stories have been combined for cinematic efficiency, a sappy last line appears in Nancy's last diary entry, Perry kills all four family members, and the author rather than Sheriff Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper) receives the murderer's tearful confession. Filmmakers cannot be limited to reality, but they risk losing their audiences' trust with every artistic variation. Name changes and the compilation of characters might have been unavoidable and necessary for practical and legal purposes. Hollywoodisms such as the diary line, a furious rage in which one killer storms through the house killing four helpless victims even though both men pulled the trigger twice, and a tearful confession made to Capote appear from start to finish, however, and they cannot be satisfactorily justified. The writer and director simply did not trust the abundance of character, suspense and tragedy inherent in the Clutter story, and in attempt to create more drama they undermined their credibility and made the Capote story difficult to believe.<br/><br/>Capote finds the Clutter story on the front of the New York Times, travels to Kansas with friend Nelle Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), spends three months interviewing the people of Holcomb and the surrounding area, sympathizes with one of the convicted murders, fights to preserve the Sixth Amendment trial rights of Hickock and Smith after their initial conviction, writes the majority of the novel that he tells people was the ""book (he) was meant to write"" and one that would be the book of the decade, stops visiting and corresponding with the men, tires of the long and laborious appeals process, and finally attends their executions after a near-catatonic and pathetic experience of self-pity due to the impending doom of his literary subjects. The story follows the basic plot. Capote's eccentricities, effeminate mannerisms and speech patterns are illuminated. One sits in the audience wondering how Nelle Harper Lee of To Kill a Mockingbird fame tolerated her miserable and egoistic companion with such patience, and also fully comes to understand why he ultimately dedicated this labor of obsession ""with (his) love and gratitude"" to her and also to his patient lover, Jack Dunphy (Bruce Greenwood). The characters and relationships seem real, but only as real as any Hollywood creation. If the creative team allowed significant changes to one storyline, one might easily assume they did the same to enhance all others.<br/><br/>While entertainment value arguably trumps informative value in this film, one cannot fairly criticize its shortcomings without giving credit where credit is due. Futterman told an incredibly paced story with powerful dialogue and memorable images. Miller skillfully directed a talented cast and, as did Capote, subtly developed the murderers into sympathetic human beings despite their faults and horrendous deeds. One cannot point to a weak-link in the cast, but Hoffman unquestionably delivers the most notable performance by capturing the stereotypes that formed a reputation Capote both loathed and purposely exacerbated with his caustic attitude, mannerisms, and oftentimes inexcusable behavior. Capote could not handle criticism. He could not handle situations that he could not control. He was ultra-effeminate. He was ultra-vain. He was Capote, and Hoffman embodied his persona with perfection.<br/><br/>One may lament the use of Hollywood devices and the inability to fully trust this film, but it deftly captures the essence of Capote's curiosity, torment, extreme vanity, eccentricity, perseverance, devotion and retreat, desire to be loved, and gradual descent into perpetual misery and alcoholism. Capote cannot escape deserved criticism, but neither can it escape its deserved status as of one of the year's best films."
