"Rickting","7","14","14","26 December 2015"," It's got more sting than one may think
","Everest looked like a generic disaster movie made purely for the big screen in the trailers. Not so. It tells the true story of a disastrous climbing expedition which took place in 1996. Since this is a true story, there's less room for the emotional manipulation and over the top set pieces which would have been expected. The film admirably follows the true story faithfully and doesn't sensationalize events. The way in which the film was marketed was misleading. There isn't as much action as the posters and trailers suggested. It's more of a realistic survival story than a big scale disaster flick. As a result, some may leave the theatre disappointed. Everest is an unexpectedly solid movie, but it certainly has its problems. There are definitely moments where the film loses your attention a bit, while a lot of the character deaths aren't given enough impact and seem rushed. In some ways, the part involving the climb to the top is more enjoyable than the slightly underdeveloped and occasionally rushed second half focusing on the disaster.<br/><br/>Still, this will surprise you. It's a tense movie rather than a really thrilling one, which is a pleasant surprise and shows the film's maturity and restraint. Despite the many characters, they are all developed enough to sympathise with. It's got a very good cast for a disaster movie, and they all give good performances. Even Keira Knightly and Sam Worthington are bearable. The film's big surprise is its emotional impact. This is a tragic story with one of the best- and saddest- final shots of the year. Not everyone makes it out alive. As a result, it's not as forgettable as it looked from the marketing. The direction is pretty good as well and doesn't show off the visuals, instead focusing on the suspense and the characters. Obviously it's not full of really developed characters, but not every film can be so that's not a problem. Everest is a solid, satisfactory survival film with a strong cast, tense set pieces and a surprise emotional punch, although it feels somewhat rushed despite it's 2 hour runtime.<br/><br/>7/10"

","I think the main problem with this movie is a loose focus. It seems like they tried to make a disaster, drama and documentary stories at the same time but failed to develop any of that properly. But the good things first: stunning scenery, overall tension and a few really great scenes make this movie worth watching without a doubt. It is just somehow not working as a single piece. With a fast start you expect some eventful action to follow but there's nothing like that. The characters developing is limited to a couple of sentences excluding Rob Hall and Beck Weathers what makes others a little more than forgettable 'guys who die first'. For some reason, Scott Fisher, being a smart capable mountaineer is shown as a careless hippie-like person, Anatoli Boukreev as a cliché tough Russian playing garmon in a tent, Beck Weathers as a hardly-realistic guy from Texas. But it doesn't matter anyways as when the masks put on it's really hard to follow who is who and and their position on the mountain, especially on descending. The whole day of May 11 is clumsy and hardly could be learned from the movie, on the summit the story switches to Rob completely and gets distractingly touchy-feely then slowly turning into the aftermath. The drama feels a bit out of place when other participants dying with little or no attention. I was disappointed. The most vivid scene of the movie turned out to be shown in the trailer (crevasse ladder). Another Beck Weathers scene was really powerful too, but otherwise I didn't feel the pressure of surviving, the height itself (the stormy clouds could be seen from 2000 as well), an incredible effort to even try to step on that track.<br/><br/>Andre Bredenkamp writes about Everest climb: ""You get completely disorientated. I had to keep reminding myself I was climbing a mountain. Every step of the way I had to try to motivate myself. At that altitude I took at least 10 to 15 breaths each time I moved one foot.""<br/><br/>So if you really want to feel the height I would rather recommend to read the books about that night as this movie failed to show it properly."
"thegreatape","9","192","247","15 September 2015"," No good guys, no bad guys, just the facts as they are known
","I always find my viewing experience of the retelling of historical events ruined when I come across scenes which I know have been added for dramatic effect or when someone is played as a bad guy just to let us know who to root for.<br/><br/>The King's Speech was particularly guilty of the former, the portrayal of other teams in Glory Road had the latter, and The Imitation Game was shamelessly guilty of both. I'm not saying this made them bad films, but it certainly made me feel like the experience had strayed away from a retelling of the facts as known.<br/><br/>Everest is everything that is good in such a film. There is no needless good v evil addition and no leading the viewer to conclusions. It tells the story and I have since spent three or four days thinking about the hows, whys and wherefores... whilst knowing I will never find an answer.<br/><br/>The other touch that really elevates this film is that there are no added action sequences that have been added to make Everest more of an action move. The film makers have been intelligent enough to realise that climbing Everest does not need any exaggeration, the characters involved were three dimensional people, and the story was interesting enough not to need embellishment.<br/><br/>I expected an action film but left pleasantly surprised by a biopic with a light touch.<br/><br/>The one mark deduction is for the totally unnecessary 3D. The film absolutely didn't need me wearing dumb glasses to be three dimensional."
"aadamhgafar-68237","6","9","9","15 April 2018"," Everest - review, 6/10
","Everest is based on the true story of Robert Hall and Scott Fischer's expedition to the summit of Mount Everest. It's a premise that suggests an emotional character-driven story of two men braving the elements as the ascend Everest. Unfortunately, the movie never reaches the dizzying heights that its title suggests.<br/><br/>There are some elements of the movie that do really well; the majesty of Everest is excellently captured with beautiful aerial shots and visceral down-to-earth shots of the climbers which convey the lethality of Everest, imbuing the movie with a sense of tension throughout. However, this effect is severely diminished by the lack of characterisation that is the movie's greatest flaw.<br/><br/>Primarily suffering from a lack of focus, it attempts to introduce the characters of all those involved in the real life expedition, perhaps this was as a homage to them and their families but it stopped the movie having a clear protagonist. Additionally, the development that these characters get is very, very limited. It may be that the adherence source material was the downfall of this movie as there is a distinct lack of any character arcs.<br/><br/>As such, emotional moments are scarce. Despite the many on-screen tears, you will be hard-pressed to find yourself feeling for these climbers you barely know no matter how well-acted they are (and they are, Jason Clarke as Rob Hall stands out). Thinking on it, I can only recall the one scene which really struck a chord with me (once again, sold very well by Clarke) but, on the whole, I was apathetic to the plight of the climbers. <br/><br/>Do not expect this movie to blow you away with a story about people and their attempt to conquer Mount Everest, it settles for being a half-baked disaster movie that spends a lot of time building itself up only to sabotage its own potential with poor development of the cast."
"jackgradis","8","146","200","2 September 2015"," Good movie, Great theatre experience
","Got the chance to see Everest early in IMAX 3D. I'll start off by saying this, if you get the chance, definitely see this movie in IMAX. It adds to the experience and you feel like your on the mountain. That aside, let's dive into one of my most anticipated films of the year.<br/><br/>Everest is chalk full of star power. Jason Clarke, Josh Brolin, Keira Knightley, Jake Gyllenhaal, the list goes on. Everyone is believable in this hostile environment, going from optimistic and adventurous to mortified and forced to fight for their lives. Each character is given a back story, some more drawn out and centered than others, and you get attached to most but not all of them. When the emotional blows hit, they hit hard for some, but not as much for others.<br/><br/>The visuals are, as you might have guessed, stunning. The shots they get of climbers and the way the camera gives you an an idea of how dangerous this is are breath taking. The cinematography is definitely award worthy. IMAX only added to it, putting you in this environment and taking you along for the ride.<br/><br/>This film really did it for me because I have always been fascinated by Everest and the journey it is to make it up to the top and back. If there is a Netflix documentary about Everest, I've watched it. I even watched the one about the story told in this movie. What this film does so well is it immerses you into the environment as well as gives you characters to care about. It's all tied in well together.<br/><br/>At times, the pace is a bit slower than expected and the tones shifts from serious to light hearted are a bit messy. But that stuff doesn't bother you in the moment, your just wrapped up in the intensity of the story.<br/><br/>Overall, Everest gave me exactly what I wanted. It was intense, emotionally powerful, and the visuals were beautiful. It's not perfectly structured, but it sure is engaging. As someone who has studied the mountain, this offers a brutal look into how much time and energy is out into a trip to Everest, and how quickly things can go wrong. Definitely worth a trip to the theatre."
"SumanShakya","5","10","11","24 December 2015"," A Visually Stunning Disaster Movie but Not the Best One ....
","The film shows a statistics that only one in four have been able to return safely after Everest's ascent. The risk involved in mountain climbing is immense, with the possibility of avalanches, altitude sickness, hypothermia, frost bite, which has been briefed in the beginning. The story en-capsules the 1996 expedition to Everest by a team of 13 mountaineers who face a devastating snow storm after ascending the Everest, which is considered one of the deadliest disasters in Everest.<br/><br/>The film is superb in terms of visuals. The mountains, camps, glaciers nowhere look graphical. As I've been in the mountain flight (a popular flight in Nepal where twin engined aircraft fly as close to 5 miles to the Himalayas at a high altitude to show the breath taking views of the mountains), I've experienced how the Himalayas look at a close range. The views of Everest from the base camp, Lukla Airport, and a rescue helicopter trying to land amid the high wind are superb testifying the hardship of mountain climbing. The abrupt linkages of the facts and information documents the geographical setting well. But I limit my praise for the film only up-to this as in terms of story or character development, the film falls pretty weak.<br/><br/>Despite showcasing an important phase of history and technically made well, the film fails to become a memorable one. It's not another Cliffhanger or Vertical Limit (caper movies on mountain climbing with villains.) As a good point, the film doesn't dramatize much of the sequences. But it's also not ""Touching the void"", which is one of the most tense and visceral movies I've ever watched on mountain climbing. ""Everest"" doesn't raise more than a documentary failing to get deep into the skin or examine the human spirit of the characters which could have made the film memorable. The film gives a certain footage on history or recreate the adventure and tragedy, but the feeling tried to be created is inadequate which doesn't fulfill the hype created.<br/><br/>Rating: 1.5 stars out of 4"

","Like the real mountain, this movie is stunning to look at but a little painful to watch. I kept longing for the voice-over guy from The Deadliest Catch to chime in with some compelling back story about the characters or the situation, just to ramp up the tension a little. We don't get much time to get to know the characters; most of their lines are designed mainly to give us information rather than developing their individual personalities. We are left with archetypes: the Loudmouth Texan, the Humble Mailman, the Brash Adventurer, the Careful Tour Guide, the Taciturn Journalist. And then there's the annoying Keira Knightly, on hand with her squeaky mouse voice and her runny nose, to make sure everyone in the audience has a good cry.<br/><br/>I wish the movie had been more about Rob Hall--his hubris and his heroism is really the heart and soul of this story. But you can't have everything in two hours, can you?"

","Everest is not a bad movie, but it isn't a pretty one either, it's pretty bad! especially for anyone who has viewed mountaineering and/or survival themed movies before. <br/><br/>Cinematography: The cinematography is certainly good. Some panoramic scenes are breathtaking and successfully convey the awesomeness of the task that is scaling the Everest.<br/><br/>Music score: I can't recall now if the movie even has an original music score or any music at all. A rather odd exception for a movie that is bound to have elements of suspense and intense human drama.<br/><br/>Casting: There are some big names in the cast, who have been assigned small parts and the lead roles given to relative and complete unknowns. The audience has an obvious expectation of the significance of a character based on the reputation of the actor playing that part. Now, big names are sometimes used to play characters that die early and unexpectedly to put the reassured audience in a state of shock and real sense of danger about the remaining characters. However, Everest employs no such ploy. The casting is just plain nonsensical.<br/><br/>Character development: Rarely have I seen a movie that does a worse job of character development than Everest. There is a lot of time spent on absolutely irrelevant small-talk, boring background description, prosaic emotional dialogues and for so many characters. At the end of this we are left with one dimensional characters. There isn't a single character, including the protagonist (whoever that is?) that is even two dimensional. It is difficult to impossible to relate or care about any of the characters. One could not care less if a character went up the mountain, or down, or just round and round. It felt weird to be so enormously apathetic about any character falling in or out of peril on the slopes.<br/><br/>Acting: I suppose some of the bigger actors tried to do the best they could with the small parts and insipid dialogues, but the actors in the leading parts failed to deliver. The portrayal was dead-pan throughout.<br/><br/>Direction, Script-writer: The only thing that could compare to the everest in this movie is the colossal failure of the director and the script-writer. A mediocre school-boy writing and presenting his first essay ever in school would do about the same as these two. A directionless rambling of random excerpts from a book about the story. When you watch how some directors and script-writers can get a character under your skin in a few minutes you realize just how bad a job was done in this movie.<br/><br/>Movie is art ... not a tax-return form: One can understand that the director wanted to be true to the actual story to the letter, with no dramatization, with an assumption that the grandiose setting, that is the Everest, would naturally and automatically impress itself upon the mind of the audience. Unfortunately (or fortunately) the audience cannot implicitly feel the bone chilling winds, or the asphyxiating low oxygen air, or acrophobia, or fatigue sitting in their cushioned seats. They need to be shown these things visually, or through the condition of characters they have been made to care about conveyed through dialog or action. However, Everest director seems to forget these very fundamentals of movie making.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Go see 'Touching the void' instead of this movie and if you have already seen 'Touching the void', then go see it again and it will surely be more suspenseful, entertaining, and rewarding than watching Everest."

","""I want to see Everest"". Could you be a bit more specific? Assuming that you're not talking about making a trip to Nepal, there are still many ways to interpret your request besides seeing the 2015 docudrama. The world's tallest mountain is the center of the story in a 1998 documentary, a 2007 TV mini-series, a 2014-2015 TV series and another film project still in development. All of these treatments are simply titled, ""Everest"". More to the point, 2015's ""Everest"" (PG-13, 2:01) re-tells the specific story from the '98 doc and a 1997 TV movie (""Into Thin Air: Death on Everest""), but tells it more vividly than ever before.<br/><br/>The '97, '98 and 2015 films all take us along for doomed expeditions up the tallest peak in the Himalayas in May 1996, as told in at least five books by survivors, most famously in journalist Jon Krakauer's 1997 best-seller ""Into Thin Air"", which is the primary basis for the screenplay of 2015's ""Everest"". As the film tells us early on, by the late 1980s, climbing Everest had transitioned from the domain of adventurers like George Mallory and Edmund Hillary with minimal equipment to a tourist destination for thrill-seekers with little climbing experience, but enough money to buy state-of-the-art equipment, stay in established base camps, and hire local Sherpas as guides and, in some cases, to carry the climber's gear and cook meals. But as the films about the 1996 climbs (and subsequent major avalanches) have shown, no amount of money, gear, help or even experience can insulate anyone from the dangers inherent in this climb. ""The last word,"" as one character in the 2015 film says, ""always belongs to the mountain."" ""Everest"" follows two of the expeditions which suffered tragic losses on the mountain on May 10-11, 1996. Rival expedition leaders Rob Hall (Jason Clarke), of the company Adventure Consultants, and Scott Fischer (Jake Gyllenhaal), of Mountain Madness, decide to work together due to the large number of people trying to reach the peak on May 10th. The main focus of the story is Hall's team, which includes people with a wide range of personal backgrounds. Hall is an experienced New Zealand mountaineer who has already climbed to the top of Everest four times, including once with his wife, Jan (Keira Knightley), who has stayed in New Zealand this time due to her pregnancy. Doug Hansen (John Hawkes) is a mailman who attempted Everest once before and wants to reach the summit as a way of inspiring schoolchildren back home in Washington state. Yasuko Namba is a 47-year-old Japanese woman who has already climbed the other six of the famed Seven Summits and wants to become the oldest woman to reach the top of Everest. Beck Weathers (Josh Brolin) is an adventurous Texan who is also pursuing the goal of the Seven Summits, but has lied to his wife, Peach (Robin Wright), about his current trip to Everest. Jon Krakauer is a writer for ""Outside"" magazine, but has never been on a climb above 8000m. Several of the people portrayed in this film died on Everest and others barely escaped with their lives.<br/><br/>""Everest"" is much more than a high-altitude adventure movie or disaster flick. Besides learning about the personal backgrounds of the characters, we follow them on their entire adventure, from beginning to end, learning a good bit about mountain climbing along the way. One of the first things we learn is that, to these people, summit is a verb. Hall lays out the dangers of summiting Everest in his briefing to his team before they even set foot on the mountain. ""Human beings are not designed to function at the cruising altitude of a 747. Your bodies will be literally dying,"" he says. This group understands all that, but they've put their trust in the honest, personable and level-headed Hall. And they've paid him a lot of money ($65,000 each) to get them to the top of Everest – and safely back down. At base camp, Hall and his friend and colleague, Helen Wilton (Emily Watson), and their fellow Adventure Consultants employees, teach, coach and take care of their customers, including Hall taking them on some practice climbs. In spite of the danger and discomfort that everyone experiences even going only partially up the mountain, they're all looking forward to the real thing. They know they'll be cold, exhausted and scared, while having trouble breathing and facing the unpredictability of the mountain, but they didn't come this far to quit. Their experiences turn out much worse than anything any of them could have imagined.<br/><br/>""Everest"" is a fascinating and gripping adventure. Like other movies about mountain climbing, this one fails to give a satisfactory reason for why these people risk their lives for little more than a great view and bragging rights, but it's clear that there are a variety of justifications within the group. The script depicts this climb as an extremely risky venture, but allows us to marvel at the courage, determination and, in some cases, self-sacrifice of these people. The character development (thanks to a great script and a terrific cast) is outstanding and the cinematography is as impressive as you'd expect (especially in IMAX 3-D). The suffering of the climbers (even when things are going according to plan), the thrilling moments (when circumstances throw the plan into chaos), the heartbreak and the small victories along the way all make us feel like we're right there on that mountain. The hardships and the tragedies of this expedition are sometimes shot and edited oddly, but are never exploitive. Icelandic director Baltasar Kormákur brings us an engaging, eye-opening and beautiful film that most are likely to appreciate. ""A-"""

","Having read John Krakauer's account of the doomed Everest climb in his book ""Into Thin Air"" I was anticipating a much more dramatic film with a gripping script. The wonderful ensemble of actors didn't have much to work with. The film is monotone with no edge-of-seat moments -- given the life-or-death extreme setting. And not much of a dramatic soundtrack either. The film has no cadence at all and just comes off as a flat docudrama. The only highly emotional moment is when a dying Rob Hall makes a final call to his wife in New Zealand. <br/><br/>I am especially disappointed that a compelling part of Krakauer's narrative is almost completely left out. If there is one pivotal anti-hero in this story it is the NY socialite Sandy Pittman Hill. She's accused of causing many of the crucial delays to the other clients' ascent. Without these delays the climbers likely would have likely gotten back to base camp before the storm came. The film shows one of these critical delays in the absence of rope lines being fixed to the summit. But the film never bothers to explain why this happened. In reality Pittman's distraction of the Sherpa responsible for installing rope lines is to blame – at least according to Krakauer. <br/><br/>This would have made for high drama, but the filmmakers inexplicably show her character in just a few brief shots. One wonders if they were threatened with a libel suit by Pittman, or simply co-opted by her when, I assume, they interviewed her for background.<br/><br/>The blend of special effect and cinematography is excellent, and it's not to be missed in 3D. But the story suffers from lack of oxygen."
"Ramascreen","10","121","199","6 September 2015"," Majestic! I had never experience anything like it.
","A movie that's as stunning and as majestic and as spellbinding as mount Everest itself. Even for many of us who've never been to Nepal, just the fact that Everest is the world's highest mountain requires us to respect it from afar. And I think that's what this film by director Baltasar Kormakur has accomplished, it respects the story, it respects the nature and it respects the memories of the lives lost during that tragic 1996 expedition.<br/><br/>Baltasar is an Icelandic filmmaker who knows how to shoot a film in such an environment where the weather can be unpredictable and it can go against you at anytime. He didn't want all of this movie to be shot entirely in a studio, this is not entirely visual effects work, they actually went to Nepal and some of the other locations include Val Senales, Italy. It's out there in the elements, outdoors locations that force even the actors themselves to leave their trailer comfort zone behind. And that is evident on screen, it really shows, because every single frame successfully makes us the audience feel like we're there, we feel the danger, as if we're there climbing the mountain, feeling the pain that comes with excruciating cold because human bodies aren't design to survive such temperature. I think the timing of the arrival of this movie could not have been more perfect. If EVEREST was made a decade or fifteen years ago, for example, when filmmaking technology and the cameras weren't as advanced, I'm not sure if it could've given us a movie-watching experience of this quality. This is not a heist thriller ala 1993's ""Cliffhanger,"" this is an epic survival drama.<br/><br/>Many of us are familiar with Jon Krakauer's book, ""Into Thin Air"" since he himself was one of the climbers, but this movie is not an adaptation, because it's also loosely inspired by other accounts, other books about that same expedition, so in a way, what the scribes William Nicholson and also Simon Beauty and filmmaker Baltasar gave us is a reimagining but one that captures the essence and I think that's what the actors themselves aimed to do. Josh Brolin, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Jason Clarke, all of them play these real characters that have families, some may have personal issues, and so the backstory or who's waiting for them on the other side of the world serve as an emotional anchor and a driving force. But you only get a glimpse of it, the script doesn't spend too much time in every last one of them, there are too many grounds to cover, so it provides just enough and then brings the attention back to this whole man vs. nature, this ordeal at hand, all over again, just like one of the characters says in the movie, ""The last word belongs to the mountain."" EVEREST movie does make me wonder why anyone would want to climb mount everest, but it's basically the same as asking ourselves why we do certain things, why we choose to attempt to conquer certain goals, whatever they may be, whether it's the need to inspire and be inspired, whether it's trying to escape our problems, whether it's the love of the climb, EVEREST goes to show that that desire could be both prideful and humbling."

","Everest is a film that tells the story of the 1996 Mount Everest disaster, in which a climbing expedition is devastated by a severe storm. The film was directed by 2 Guns director Baltasar Kormakur and written by William Nicholson (Gladiator, Les Miserables) and Oscar winner Simon Beaufoy (Slumdog Millionaire and 127 Hours), starring Jason Clarke, John Hawkes and Josh Brolin. To start the film is beautiful; the director of photography Salvatore Totino presented the size and scale of the environment beautifully with multiple aerial shots. Totino has a clear and linear style, which is refreshing after the summer, which with the exception of a couple of films, has been dominated by shaky-cam and extremely quick cuts.<br/><br/>The dialogue in the film stands out, however the plot does not. The characters were underdeveloped, partially due to the lack of introduction that is given to our main characters; this combined with the slow pace of the first act causes the film to drag. However it should be noted that the film makes a point of showing the process of preparing to climb Everest. The second act is fine, not great though and is intense especially during the storm and finally the film just finishes, which really throws you out of the film. <br/><br/>Although none of the performances in the film were award-worthy they still were acceptable and in some cases quite good. Jason Clarke and Josh Brolin had the meatiest roles, and they both provided good performances. However out of the two, Jason Clarke provided the best performance. The side characters were forgettable, with the exception of Doug (John Hawkes) and Yasuko (Naoko Mori), with Doug being a postman and Yasuko finally completing the seven summits, two things which helped to distinguish them. Everyone in the film was 'care-beared', thankfully, and they had to be otherwise it would impossible to tell who you were looking at.<br/><br/>One part of production that deserves praise in this film is the lighting department who did a superb job on presenting a clear environment; especially during the storm. A quick side note- the score of the film was forgettable. <br/><br/>Ultimately, Everest is an intense drama thriller that has its problems, however is still beautiful to watch, I wouldn't purchase it on 3D Blu-ray, as after watching it in 3D I didn't find anything spectacular or noteworthy, however I would consider buying it on Blu-ray. Overall, I am going to give Everest a C+ or 6/10."

The special affects are amazing and the performances from Jason Clarke and Keira Knightley are great too.

","Having just this week returned from climbing all 19,341 feet of Kilimanjaro, I find myself intimately capable of reviewing ""Everest"", the new thriller from Icelandic director Baltamar Kormákur.<br/><br/>Based on a true story from 1996, Jason Clarke and Jake Gyllenhaal play Rob Hall and Scott Fischer respectively, rival organisers of commercial climbing ventures whose businesses involve training well-paying clients at Everest Base Camp and then taking them to the summit to experience the 'ultimate high'. When the climbing season of 1996 becomes hugely crowded, including a rather obnoxious team from South Africa, the two rivals decide it is in the interests of their clients to combine forces and attack the mountain together.<br/><br/>We are introduced to some of the clients including Texan Beck Weathers (Josh Brolin), second-attempt postman Doug Hanson (John Hawkes) and Japanese mountaineer Yasuko Namba (Naoko Mori) chasing her seventh and final major mountain summit. Supporting the teams is hen-mother from base camp Helen Wilton (Emily Watson), medical helper Caroline Mackenzie (Elizabeth Debicki from ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."") and hard-man Anatoni Boukreev (Ingvar Eggert Sigurðsson) who eschews the use of such luxuries as oxygen. To add dramatic tension to the situation, Rob Hall's wife (Keira Knightley) is heavily pregnant with their first daughter.<br/><br/>In an extremely hostile environment, as a storm passes through, the film neatly characterises how a single impetuous decision can have devastating consequences.<br/><br/>The action scenes in the film are well-executed with a number of vertiguous shots and heart-in-the-mouth moments, neatly escalated by Dario Marianelli's effective score. At its heart this is (without remembering the details of the original news story) a ""will they, won't they"" survival story of the ilk of ""The Towering Inferno"" and other classic disaster movies.<br/><br/>However, despite the long running-time and relatively leisurely built-up, I found there to be a curious lack of connection between the viewer and most of the key players. Perhaps this stems from the fact that you know they were all fully aware of the potential dangers? Or perhaps that the mountain seems a bigger character that any of the humans involved? Whatever the reason, it's only the future parental responsibilities of Hall that really resonate and make you root for him as opposed to any of the other characters.<br/><br/>Some of the hardest special effects to pull off are those that depict the natural world (as opposed to Krypton, Asgard etc), and in this regard the team led by Jonathan Bullock (from the Harry Potter series) does a great job. Whilst the ""top of Everest"" was in reality a set in the Pinewood 007 stage, you'll well believe a man can freeze there.<br/><br/>As such, this is a decent and entertaining telling of a true-life tragedy that will definitely work better on the big screen than the small.<br/><br/>(If you found this review useful please see the graphical version at bob-the-movie-man.com and enter your email address to receive future reviews.

Everest has been done and this type of tourism is dangerous, it does however show facts clearly, everyone is normal and are doing this because of the adventurous human spirit. It does indeed show the sad side effect of doing something like this for the sake of doing it. $65000 to climb Everest, if you want to be a hero I'm sure that money would save lives elsewhere. In that respect this movie has indeed succeed in showing us how lives can be carelessly thrown away."
"Troy_Campbell","6","20","30","18 September 2015"," Tense and beautiful, but lacking fleshed-out characters.
","Based on real life events in 1996, this dramatic thriller tells the story of Kiwi mountain-climber Rob Hall (Jason Clarke) as he leads a group of mountaineering enthusiasts on an expedition to the peak of Mt. Everest. Kicking off with Hall and his team boarding a plane to Nepal, there's very little backstory provided for any of the numerous players being followed, with the focus squarely on their physically demanding journey ahead. And here's the rub: the film homes in so intently on the climb itself, with gorgeous cinematography and tense, cleverly designed set pieces, that it doesn't take the time to actually make us care for those in this life-threatening situation. Additional groundwork from the onset getting to know the eclectic group of adventurers better could have upped the ante even more, adding extra heft in the second half when things don't go according to plan. Yet there's no denying Icelandic director Baltasar Kormakur (Contraband, 2 Guns) presents the action and generates thrills with impressive craftsmanship, aided by seamless CGI and Salvatore Totino's Oscar-worthy photography. It's one of those rare motion pictures where the employment of 3D genuinely intensifies the experience too, lending depth and height to the extraordinary environment that is Mt. Everest. Kormakur also lands a cast to die for – including Clarke, Jake Gyllenhaal, John Hawkes, Josh Brolin, Keira Knightely, Robin Wright and Emily Watson – but wastes most of them, especially the women, in slight roles with no meat on the bones. Everest is a solid cinematic outing with just enough excitement and tension to compensate for the frustratingly underdeveloped characters."

","The fragility of life in hostile environments is a phenomenon cinema rarely depicts. It is so unusual that it can almost be witnessed as comedy here. They, first of all, have zero reason to be there at all. So they just go there, everything goes wrong and they freeze to death and then collapse to their doom. It's funny! The way he fell off the mountain. The way the other stripped his clothes off and fell off next. Brolin dying, then waking up with frostbite walking the rest of the way. The mailman having no foresight or sense of self-preservation at all. Gyllenhaal's surfer bro who just lays down and dies practically with a thumbs up. It all feels so surreal and primal. Death is like this, not like in the movies. The film is an anomaly, a blockbuster achievement for how things can go wrong; the way you lose accountability, get lost among groups, everyone working together but mix-ups with the people and the oxygen tanks. A chain effect of it all going south with one small misstep. 'He might as well be on the moon', it really felt like the film was taking us on an alien terrain. Going to see the director's other work to see if this was lightning in a bottle or he really is this good."

","It is going to be hard to make a review of this movie last 10 lines because it is that bad. OK, some of the scenery of Mount Everest was good. There were a few well known actors in the movie, but they were given parts that were uninteresting in some cases. Some of the dialog was either at low volume or spoken in another language, it was hard to tell. I realize this was a true story, not a made up story. Another couple of reviewers mentioned that one would be better off watching ""Vertical Limit."" Unfortunately, they are correct. I love books and movies about mountains, but not this one. Here is my final observation of what I thought about this movie. After 30-45 minutes into the show, I was hoping it would soon be over."
"LemonLadyR","2","55","99","21 September 2015"," How Many Everest 1996 Tragedy Movies Do We Really Need?
","Is anything in this movie a spoiler? haha. I will try not to put spoilers, just as in any review I write, but I wanted to be safe, for those born after '96 and who missed it on the news, etc.<br/><br/>I can't even count how many ways this was a horrid movie. Even the photography seemed very claustrophobic much of the time (most probably those were the studio scenes depicting the mountain). That style may have been intended to give some intimacy to the huge IMAX format but it just made it worse. To be fair, the real mtn shots were wonderful, but not near as good as David Breashears' IMAX footage during this same tragedy (but Breashears is a multi-decade mountaineering filmmaker), and shown in *his* movie about 1996 (and his others). I have seen 5-6 movies/docs about this, read 3 books, and have seen tons of media about this, so was this movie really necessary, considering ALL the stuff that is out there for people to source? At least one reviewer was right, that it was just another attempt to make money from this tragedy. What about the 2015 tragedy due to the earthquake? 19 people died this year on Everest, which is *more* than in 1996. I would have rather watched a movie about that.<br/><br/>At first, I thought this was Rob Hall's version of the story, or at least cobbled together from his teammates and clients. And I was very interested in that, at first, but it was vapid and at a the cost of barely any information or character development of the other major players. SO much was left out as to make this more fiction or ""based on"", rather than a real docudrama. It is a such recent history that ""based on"" isn't appropriate yet. Things like Sandy Hill Pitman's need to be carried up and down the mountain by Sherpas who had other vital jobs was omitted. Many priorities got mixed up on that tragic day, and this film omits many. I guess this is the jolly IMAX version rather than an honest accounting and tribute to the deceased. Beck Weathers never has sounded like an ""Ugly Texan"", so his lines and bravado about Texas were silly and offensive, esp as I was born in Texas. His character here, besides being largely a generalization, is an outdated one and any truth that is in it has largely passed into history by now. Weathers has always come across as a quiet, considered guy. The mtn may have sobered up his ""Himalayan Mtn High"", but he was hardly a brash young man, even then. His incredible story is almost completely fiction here, yet it became solid history within a couple months after the event. David Breashears was hardly anywhere to be found, the director of the IMAX film that was shooting during this expedition, which he stopped in the middle of, on peak filming days, to help with the rescue. This resulted in a financial loss and a truncated movie for him (but far better than this one), but he did the right thing. There are many interesting and suspenseful side stories, all of which came together to cause the tragedy, like the oxygen canister mix-up, but where were they. <br/><br/>All in all, even the TV movie, based on Jon Krakauer's wonderful book, ""Into Thin Air"", was much better than this, and they didn't climb up Everest to film it, you can be sure! Krakauer's and Breashears' (who has summited 5 times now)great mtn films and books just made this look silly. I have not read Anatoli Boukreev's book, who was also pivotal in the rescue, and no doubt has a different outlook than the Americans, but he also was basically ignored here, except for a couple nebulous mentions. Even the love story of Rob Hall and his wife was mostly left on the cutting room floor. What about Scott Fischer? All of these guys, besides Rob Hall, were barely mentioned. And the Sherpas got no credit, which is a crime, as without them, no white man (or any other color) would have likely summited Everest to this day (one co-summited the first summit), and they held the records for most summits until Breashears matched it with his 5th summit, last time I checked. Yes, I am irritated, as the build-up was so big, although I wasn't sure what more could be told. I should have taken my suspicions more to heart! My advice, if not completely obvious by now, is to watch and read the other material about this story and skip this awful movie. And if you liked it, all the more reason to delve into those."

","Once again I've gone to the movies with high expectations and been disappointed. My expectations fell off the mountain and landed in a heap of ""what was I thinking and I want my money back!""<br/><br/>This film was way too long for the story told. Viewers are given the thinnest possible background of the people involved. One man is from Texas and apparently very wealthy. He can afford to hire a helicopter to come rescue him off the mountain. One woman is Japanese and has climbed six other peaks. One guy is a hippie type who likes to sunbathe in his undershorts at base camp. Another is a married man expecting his first child. One climber is pretty old to still be climbing mountains and doesn't seem well.<br/><br/>So, okay. That's all we know about them. After that, it's up the mountain they go and some of them don't make it back. It's pretty difficult to feel scared or concerned or any other emotion about complete strangers whose lives are not explained in the least.<br/><br/>I'm giving the film a ""3"" out of ""10"" rating because the scenery and the mountain itself is beautiful, but I could have found that out in a travel documentary.

","In 1996, the leaders of the commercial expeditions Adventure Consultants and Mountain Madness, Rob Hall (Jason Clarke) and Scott Fischer (Jake Gyllenhaal), decide to team up to climb the Everest together. After the brief preparation and training, they attempt to reach the summit. However a blizzard strikes the Everest and they need to urgently descent the mountain. Rob loses some clients and when the oxygen bottle runs out, Rob discovers that there are no spare bottles on the location that it should be. His friend Doug Hansen (John Hawkes) falls off the path and dies and Rob is stranded near the top of the Everest. Meanwhile Scott is totally exhausted and his clients continue to descent leaving Scott, the veteran Yasuko Namba (Naoko Mori) and the Texan Beck Weathers (Josh Brolin) behind. Later the rescue team succeeds in saving Beck that has lost both hands and nose. In the end, the survivors return home and Rob's corpse is left in Everest. <br/><br/>""Everest"" is an impressively realistic film based on a true story. It is hard to see what is real and what special effects along the film are. The screenplay uses personal dramas entwined with the lead story and the direction is tight. The cast with famous names has great performance and this film is highly recommended. My vote is seven.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Everest"""
"evbach","4","6","8","15 August 2016"," Everest: Cool shots, not much more
","To start, there are some positives in the film. The cinematography is excellent, with both the real-life backgrounds and CGI sequences blending very well. Along with this, the film also does a good job with creating an atmosphere for the audience. Things such as the special effects and the sound editing help to involve the audience in the film and make it seem, to some extent, that they are there on the mountain with the characters.<br/><br/>Aside from the previously mentioned things, nothing in the film exceeds mediocrity. There are attempts in the first half of the film to set up an emotional backstory and a family subplot for multiple characters. However, so little time is spent on the topics that they come off feeling completely unnecessary. This is made worse due to the fact that the family elements actually end up being revisited and take up a considerable amount of time in the final act of the film.<br/><br/>The script and performances by the cast range from average to bad and never really exceed what you would expect from a summer blockbuster. This is made even more disappointing because Jake Gyllenhaal, one of the most talented actors working today, was wasted in the film, barely filling and screen time.<br/><br/>Finally, the characters in the film are in constant danger, which is suppose to be the main ""thrilling"" element that is suppose to engage the audience. However, due to the lack of depth given to each character, it just leaves you not caring about the fates of the characters. Also, due to the large number of characters in the film, it is hard to keep track of their faces, let alone their names. This is especially true during the chaotic parts of the film, when you can barely see anything, let alone the faces of the people in the film.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Everest"" looks very nice, but nothing else in the film is done particularly well, with it never being able to exceed the level of a below average summer Hollywood blockbuster."

"Maladjusted_1","5","4","5","17 July 2016"," A disappointing account which squanders its potential
","'Everest' under-uses some of its key components, and some of its biggest potential selling points. When I think of Mount Everest, I think of it as part of a landscape. Baltasar Kormákur and some of his crew apparently don't. We don't get to see much of the Himalayas, as the cameras (in spite of the cover poster) keep us uncomfortably close to the characters. The heavy focus on the mountaineers and their distressed friends gave Kormákur plenty of opportunities to appeal to his viewers' sense of humanity, but he didn't capitalise on any such chance. We're therefore left with a paradoxically claustrophobic experience in which we can neither appreciate the scenery and magnitude of Mount Everest, nor become invested enough in the film's characters to really care (which is uncomfortable, given that it's based on a true story!). A number of very strong dramatic performers made an appearance in Kormákur's film, including Keira Knightley and Jake Gyllenhaal. Unfortunately, they aren't given much room to manoeuvre or display the extent of their talents. Frostbite-induced groaning is about as good as it gets for many of the cast... which may be preferable to the boredom-induced groaning of the audience."
"kosa-matyas","6","4","5","6 January 2016"," More should have been brought out of it
","Run-of-the-mill, definitely an average film. The soundtrack was utterly boring, Baltasar Kormákur could have utilized the script much more. Eventually it is a drama, terrible tragedies happened to the climbers.<br/><br/>The moment when they reached the summit of the everest in my opinion was too weak emotionally, not any dramatic catharsis nor emotive upheaval. I really missed these feelings. The memorable events and turning points was primitive and did not bring forth deep sentiment. For example when Scott Fischer died, not any portentous moment which caught me. The dead came and Fischer accepted it and fell into sleep, end of story. Naturally in case of Rob Hall(when he was dying) it was grandiose because Keira Knightley's acting was enthralling in that scene.

","For the 99.999 percent of us who will never climb Mount Everest, the new 3D Imax drama Everest provides plenty of vividly illustrated reasons to rationalize leaving it off one's bucket list. However, there are quite a few good reasons to see this robust dramatization of a 1996 assault on the world's tallest mountain that went disastrously wrong, beginning with the eye-popping, you- are-there visual techniques that make you feel glad indeed that you're not actually up there at 29,029 feet, but also including multiple characters sufficiently humanized to create real concern for their fates, and an attention to realistic detail that gives the film texture. Universal should be able to add this one to its impressive list of 2015 box-office successes. This autumn seems to be the season for vertigo-inducing 3D Imax releases, what with this and the World Trade Center tightrope-walking drama The Walk in the offing. All the same, Everest doesn't go in for cheap shots or sensation for sensation's sake, remaining close to the men and women who have journeyed to the Himalayas for different reasons but for the same purpose: to get to the top of the world. With its perilous central premise and gallery of individuals some of whom are destined not to make it, you could say Everest is a disaster movie in the old Hollywood sense of the term, but it doesn't feel like one. And that's a good thing. Telling the same story as, but not officially based on, Jon Krakauer 's best-selling book Into Thin Air (perhaps because it was already officially adapted for a 1997 TV movie, Into Thin Air: Death on Everest ), the film hinges on the freakish conditions that led to the deaths of eight climbers on May 10, 1996. Krakauer is present as a character (played by House of Cards' Michael Kelly), there to write an article for Outside magazine. The fact that some engaging, friendly Aussies are front and center as the main tour organizers and guides may account for a good deal of the films immediate accessibility; they're the competent, reassuring type you'd feel good entrusting yourself to on such an expedition. Running Adventure Consultants is Rob Hall ( Jason Clarke), a seemingly all-around great guy, and he's helped out most importantly by logistics coordinator Helen ( Emily Watson ), and guide and close friend Guy (Clarke's fellow ex- Terminator Sam Worthington)."
"nsharath009","8","20","39","5 September 2015"," Baltasar Kormákur's disaster movie is a physical experience that will leave you breathless—and possibly suffering vertigo.
","Everest is an unrelenting real-life disaster movie that strands you near the top of the world's tallest mountain and dares you to imagine what it must be like to be part of an expedition to the top going horribly, horribly wrong. Its screenwriters, William Nicholson and Simon Beaufoy, respectively have Gladiator and 127 Hours to their names, and Everest combines the muscular, sometimes sentimental force of the former with the sense of being party to an extreme physical endurance that made the latter so successful.<br/><br/>Like Gravity, another spectacle involving a conflict between humans and a hostile environment never meant for us, Everest relies heavily on awe, special effects and 3-D. Director Baltasar Kormákur's camera appears to glide just above the highest ridge of Everest, a mass of rock, snow and ice just as terrifying and mysterious as the vast blackness of outer space itself.<br/><br/>Based on an actual trip to the summit in 1996 that ended in tragedy, an air of doom hangs over Everest, forcing you to wonder which of its endearing ensemble cast will make it down alive. The inevitability of death makes it all the more tough to watch. Who, as mountaineering jargon has it, will finish up ""gone""? Maybe John Hawkes's gentle, unassuming postman, whose trip is part-funded by school kids? Or Josh Brolin's millionaire family man from Texas? Or Jason Clarke's affable team leader? Or Jake Gyllenhaal's extreme- sports dude? He's emblematic of the mid-1990s globetrotting outsider culture, which still saw Starbucks as cool and led to an explosion of commercial outfits operating on a crowded Everest.<br/><br/>When we're not squirming at the sight of deathly drops or feeling whipped by the weather, we're plunged into the emotional distress of those left behind: wives played by Robin Wright and Keira Knightley, and base camp coordinator Emily Watson, who's manning a satellite phone halfway down the mountain. The film crosses into soppy territory when it forcefully begs our tears, but Kormákur creates such a convincing world—the craft of this film is astonishing—that you're willing to forgive its less delicate touches in favor of a totally compelling depiction of what it must be like to ascend to a place that's heaven one moment and hell the next."

But when an unexpected storm strikes, Hall and Fishcer must get their climbers down before it is too late.<br/><br/>I am a man whom is VERY fond of films that have been based on a true story. The sometimes horrifying fact that an event actually took place is haunting to me, but immensely intriguing. Thus, I went into this movie with perhaps too high of expectations. Kormakur's movie '2 Guns' ceased to impress me so I should have maybe lowered those expectations. Alas, I believe in second chances so I gave the man a chance. And I was incredibly disappointed. Everest is a dull, boring, monotonous Oscar bait film that I had the displeasure of seeing. Nothing in this film is distinctly amazing, nothing in this movie is distinctly good. But this isn't one of those average movies where you think 'Oh it wasn't too bad; I could still watch it again sometime'. This is one of those average movies that was a chore to get through, not based on quality but based on entertainment value. I didn't expect Jason Clarke to wield a bazooka and rocket jump up the mountain, but the overly long and boring dullness that this film presents, once again, ceased to impress me.<br/><br/>Did I like anything in this film though? Yeah. I loved the performances. Not a single actor fails in this movie and they consistently displayed the hardships they're facing and barbaric nature of the event they find themselves in. Two standouts for me are easily the two I initially billed: Jason Clarke and Josh Brolin. Clarke is an actor that I've never took issue with, but has never been blown away by. That is until this movie. Clarke delivers a gut wrenching and harrowing performance as Rob Hall and he was, perhaps unfairly, one of the only two characters I felt a genuine connection to. I think you can guess who the other was. Surprise, surprise - it was the other character in the movie who gave a stand out performance. Josh Brolin is an excellent actor and I truly loved his performance in this film. He is the other character I was even remotely interested in, and that is down to Brolin's excellent performance. Was anyone Oscar worthy? No. But I was definitely fulfilled and pleased with the performances in this film. <br/><br/>Another aspect of the film I was impressed by, was the visuals. The cinematography in this movie was excellent, and Kormakur definitely succeeds in enveloping the audience in his cold, calculating blanket of snow and ice. I actually got shivers at certain point from the way Kormakur utilised the camera and visual effects to manufacture a chilling, icy atmosphere of isolation. The editing was also very well done and incredibly concise. Visuals are honestly the greatest praise I can award this movie. Alas, amazing visuals are not enough.<br/><br/>I don't think I can call the story of this film weak without possibly offending someone. But in all honestly, I did. As insensitive as this may be to say, I don't think it was that interesting OR a story that needed to be told. Don't get me wrong: it's absolutely horrible was happened on that mountain, and my sympathy forever lies with the families and victims, but I just didn't find the event itself that interesting. I was frequently bored throughout this film. I had little to no interest in what was happening and didn't really care for any of the characters, as cruel as that may be to say.<br/><br/>Expanding on that point, films like this rely on the audience feeling sympathy for the characters. But I didn't. The two I did actually care for were the only two that I actually knew something about. They have a little meeting that is designed to give me an insight into their lives, make me care for them and bloat the already overly long run time(seriously, it's 2 hours long but it feels like 4). Alas, all of these goals fail except the last one. I have no interest in that the woman has climbed ""6 of the 7 peaks"" or whatever; I don't know anything about HER, only what she has achieved. It's this unfortunate lack of sympathy that lets this film down for me.<br/><br/>As a whole, I was disappointed by 'Everest'. It succeeds in being one of the most mind numbing films I have watched in ages, so credit for that. It has gorgeous visuals and great performances but the disconnect from the situation and characters that I felt made me see no reason in watching it. I didn't like 'Everest' and so I cannot recommend it. I'll rate 'Everest' 5 out of 10."
"DareDevilKid","7","9","15","28 September 2015"," Worth Watching Just for its Cinematography and Effects and Pretty Much Nothing Else
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)<br/><br/>Rating: 3/5 stars<br/><br/>""Everest"" boasts all the dizzying cinematography a person could hope to get from a movie about mountain climbers in today's times, even if it's content to tread a less challenging narrative terrain. Sadly, the scenes of peril and danger don't have the breathtaking, gut- wrenching wallop you'd expect from a movie about people pitting themselves against the highest peak on the planet, even if the visuals do well in establishing where the many climbers were on the mountain on that fateful day, and the very real, mortal dangers that lurk beneath the beauty of this place.<br/><br/>What's really remarkable and effective about ""Everest"" is that, on a visual level, it's thoroughly convincing. There is not a single moment here that looks like it was computer-generated or shot against a green-screen, though in actuality it was. Also, the film succeeds in showing the logistics necessary in such a climb.<br/><br/>Eventually, ""Everest"" is worth seeing because of the visual beauty and daring camera-work involved. The story itself is a downer and only accomplishes in highlighting the folly and insurmountable risks of such a trek. If you do decide to see it, make sure you get the 3D, IMAX treatment – it's so involving that you leave the theater checking for frostbite and never wanting to look at a mountain again, which in all probability is this movie's actual accomplishment."

","Couldn't wait for this movie to be over and had zero sympathy for these fools that put their lives at risk to climb a mountain. The Brolin character claimed that he was bored when at home but felt alive when climbing. Later admitted when on the mountain that he had eyesight problems. Real smart guy. Duh. Was the loss of his hands and nose worth it? Think of the self created anguish through which they put their families. Like skiers, who venture into dangerous territory after being warned of an avalanche risk, relatives ask the authorities to put others at risk to save these macho idiots.<br/><br/>I'm reminded of a movie that I saw years ago about two Austrians attempting to scale the north face of the Matterhorn. Near the end of the movie one of them was hanging helplessly from a rope shouting that he didn't want to die (which he did). Thought about that a little late didn't he! Totally boring."

","If, when you think of Everest, you think of a film where a bunch of suicidal people embark on a basically pointless expedition, then (unlike the main characters) you're on the right track. Okay, that's selling the film short a bit. The fact is that Everest is what you might call a slow-burn thriller. But we'll get to that in a minute.<br/><br/>Rob Hall is a guide for the people willing to climb Mount Everest. Several people have signed up and are assigned to his team, so he says goodbye to his pregnant wife and gets on the plane to Nepal. Rob and his group of climbers head to base camp near Mount Everest where they meet the rest of the team and prepare for their arduous climb.<br/><br/>It's the attention paid to this preparatory part of the film where we get an idea of who these people are and why they do what they do. When I saw the trailer, I was expecting an action-packed modern action flick, but I was pleasantly surprised by the time spent in these preparatory phases. It's all too easy to succumb to relentless action without laying the groundwork in advance. Ideally, by allowing the audience to get to know the characters well in advance, the emotional payoff is supposed to be greater when there's trouble brewing.<br/><br/>The keyword here is 'supposed'. Whether or not the early character development is adequate enough to tug at anyone's heartstrings depends on the people behind the camera. It's here where the film can fall a bit flat, particularly in its attempts to explain character motivation, why do these characters (and by extension, similar people in real life) risk their lives just to make it to the highest peak on the earth? Each character provides different answers and we kind of understand them, but the film never really digs deeper. After all, there's a pretty huge mountain to climb which leads us to the best aspect of Everest...<br/><br/>...the cinematography. No, not the 3D, the actual cinematography. The 3D is decent, but the way the film looks and feels doesn't just come from a gimmick like 3D. Great production design and cinematography look great on their own and aren't necessarily improved by 3D glasses. The Everest looks and 'feels' immense, the snow and ice feels cold. There's a few instances of makeup that also impress, particularly when one character wakes up hours after falling asleep high on Mount Everest. When he wakes up, it looks like the only way he'd get the frost off his face is if his face came off with it. Nothing wrong with Everest in the visual department.<br/><br/>The action scenes themselves are thankfully quite grounded. You won't find any flashy editing techniques around these parts. This extends to the death scenes as well which I find very refreshing. Think about it: you've got a film about climbing Mount Everest. It's the perfect opportunity for literal cliffhangers where one guy always says how he just...can't...hold on...much longer. But Everest avoids these pitfalls (pun intended) and when someone falls in the mist-filled abyss, we don't even see him drop; he just disappears from view while the camera remains centered on the point where he just stood. It's this lack of audience manipulation that I'd like to see more of.<br/><br/>And that's Everest in a nutshell: a visually stunning experience that prefers characters over action. If only the character development itself was a just a little more fleshed out, we'd have a real winner on our hands. On a scale of base camp to summit, I give this a camp four."

","This film attracted me by way of its huge advertising campaign, brilliant cast ensemble and a thrilling premise. Unfortunately, it was very boring. The set up in the first thirty minutes seemed rather promising and although the pace and characters seemed gentle and unassuming, I assumed there might be just a little more to look forward to than the hour and a half that followed. My time could have been summed up by simply having someone explain what happened next, which would have taken no more than thirty seconds.<br/><br/>If this film didn't have the cast it did then there is no way it would have the score it does here on IMDb.

I didn't think the cinematography did the beauty of the mountains much justice and about the only redeeming feature was Jason Clarke who i thought carried this film. There were times on the mountain in blizzard conditions i hadn't got the foggiest who was who or what they were saying and there was a point where it felt like there were scenes missing as it seemed to jump very quickly without the proper development of the plot.

"con_au","3","6","11","25 March 2018"," A reminder of our silliness
","This film chronicles the events of a particularly bad year for fatalities among the largely white, upper-middle class cohort who actualise themselves by climbing high things. 
It's a hard story to tell. These days, Everest climbers aren't adventurers, they're suburban thrill seekers laying out large amounts of money to traipse all over a pristine and eminently hostile landscape, leaving their poop and beer bottles behind. Notwithstanding the meagre contribution they may make to the local economy, they're basically suicidally self-indulgent. 
Making matters worse, this film has a tonne of characters, played by a terrific cast, all of whom are indistinguishable in their puffer vests and in pelting snow. 
Our ill-fated crew set out to summit, competing with scores of other climbers from across the globe, all desperate for the high altitude selfie. Between the human traffic jam they create, and the sudden onset of a devastating storm, the story becomes a race for survival in which all men (and one woman) have to face off against, you guessed it, 'the mountain'. 
I'm sorry for the losses that occur on Everest, and this movie is a terrific reminder of how easy those deaths would be to avoid. 
What this movie isn't, is particularly good. The mountain scenes look pretty cool but the dialogue is mostly lame, the characters - when you can tell who they are - don't really inspire much empathy. There aren't any villains, but there certainly aren't any heroes either. As for the story itself, it's a fable of how commercialism, self indulgence and stupidity end up littering a mountain with unretrievable bodies that lie as witness to human folly."

","With perhaps one of the best ensemble casts of the year, Everest is a solid disaster flick. The story of anyone climbing Mt. Everest is absurd to me, but this group had a particularly devastating adventure. Everest tells the story of a group of explorers in the mid 90's taking on the dangers of climbing the tallest mountain in the world before a deadly storm made them alter their plans mid trip. Led by the strong performances of Jason Clarke, Jake, Gyllenhaal, Josh Brolin, Sam Worthington, and Keira Knightley, Everest is one of the most impressive looking and acted films all year.<br/><br/>The film starts out slow and I think for awhile didn't really know how to structure the story. With such a big cast and a ton to focus on, the film just doesn't flow for a good hour. In fact, it wasn't really clear who was in what expedition group for awhile, no thanks to them being covered with snow and snow gear for a good portion of the film. I think that's just the nature of this story though, no pun intended. I also thought it was interesting that we only really got back-stories for a few of them, and only two with family members show. But the scene in which each of them describe why they are going on this trip was where the film started to have the emotional edge that I had hoped initially. But you go to see a movie like this for the final 40 minutes or so. The ending picked up for the lackluster first hour or so and it turns out to be a solid film.<br/><br/>Knightley and Clarke have great chemistry without really being on the screen together at all, along with Brolin and Robin Wright having a few memorable scenes together. Clarke is becoming one of the most underrated actors working today. The entire cast is magnificent though. Everyone sells everything they are doing incredibly well. The visuals are also very good for a 50 million dollar budget. If you forget about the weak first half of the movie than we may have had an Oscar contender on our hands.<br/><br/>+Clarke's incredible performance<br/><br/>+Visuals<br/><br/>+Emotional pull<br/><br/>-Weak and slow start<br/><br/>7.7/10"

","****WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***** <br/><br/>Out of respect for the sterling cast of actors, they did a tremendous job bringing the cast of Adventure Consultants and Mountain Madness to life. We all know the plot, so the only thing this movie could really do was bring the infamous disaster to life using up-to-date technology. It's really just a reenactment.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the movie lacks the weight of truth. Rob Hall had known all along that the storm was coming. During weather meetings at Everest Base Camp, Rob Hall (alongside Scott Fischer) discussed highly accurate weather forecasts that were provided by the UK Met Office and the Danish Meteorological Institute. These forecasts predicted rising wind speeds beginning the 8th May 1997, reaching full intensity on the 11th. David Breashears and Ed Viesturs from the IMAX expedition knew too: Breashears himself had coordinated the weather forecasts from the UK Met Office in London even BEFORE leaving for Nepal. Rob Hall's unilateral decision making meant he kept his clients and guide Mike Groom out of the picture concerning the reality of an approaching storm. It's a miscarriage of justice that with such a bug budget, the movie fails to deliver the real punch and chooses instead to stick to the established narration we all know from Into Thin Air. Guess we'll never learn huh?<br/><br/>Do yourself a favour: spend the movie money and get a copy of A Day to Die For by Graham Ratcliffe. If you want the truth, start there, not the cinema."
"jedi-jones","6","9","19","3 September 2015"," Stronger on atmosphere than character, cold but grimly compelling.
","It's not an adventure story. Everest is a harrowing and heartbreaking tale of man vs. nature that reaches great dramatic peaks after suffering through an overly long and slow ascent. The movie starts out on unsure footing with storytelling as uneven as the giant mountain's slopes but by the end it had my eyes frozen on the screen.<br/><br/>The ""true story"" on which the film is based is filed on Wikipedia under ""1996 Mount Everest disaster."" It concerns organized bands of hikers attempting to scale Mount Everest with an emphasis on ""attempting."" The story was chronicled in a 1998 IMAX documentary and has now been resurrected in this $65-million-dollar dramatic film directed by Baltasar Kormákur who was born, appropriately enough, in Iceland. In a month when U.S. President Obama purports to warn the public about the dangers of global warming, this movie comes along to make us stop worrying and learn to love global warming.<br/><br/>In a belabored, tension-free and yawn-inducing first act, we're introduced to the members of the ill-fated climbing expedition, most of whom, judging by their accents, seem to be from New Zealand. We're only nominally introduced to about half of them, or at least I think their names were mentioned once. Little insight is given as to what inspired (possessed?) these people to want to scale Mount Everest. ""Because it's there"" is one of the few reasons mentioned. Some of them don't seem to know why they're doing it. Judging by their personalities, it appears most of them were just bored.<br/><br/>Jason Clarke (John Connor in Terminator: Genisys) as the expedition leader serves as a calm and steady center in the ensemble. The undemonstrative nature of his performance does nothing to enhance the low energy of the tepid early dialogue scenes, but it does add to the sense of eerie, fatalistic hopelessness that the characters face after the ""perfect snowstorm"" arrives. When the most skilled character in the story quickly and calmly seems to embrace his dark destiny, it's a clear sign that there isn't much hope. If only the characters had been more energized in the beginning, it would have been easier to notice later that they were slowing down on account of being half-frozen.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin plays the only character that approaches having a dynamic personality. At first he seems to have just a minor part, but it eventually becomes clear why his character was played by the biggest name actor in the cast. Brolin has the closest thing to an actual character arc, but it's based more on basic life and death than on any lessons learned. Jake Gyllenhaal plays a character who is of so little consequence that I think he could've been cut out of the movie without anyone noticing a difference.<br/><br/>Where Everest succeeds beyond compare, no doubt enhanced by the premium IMAX 3D format, is in vividly capturing the characters' descent from the top of Mount Everest into multiple levels of wintry hell. This is not a disaster film in the conventional, mainstream sense, like the melodramatic and unconvincing San Andreas. This is a dark, stark, dramatic and intensely realistic portrayal of human beings swallowed up by a grim force of nature who are unable to do much except hope that they'll be spit back out again with most of their pieces still intact. The script does a good job of explaining in advance some of the specific things that can go wrong on this journey, even though the discerning viewer should expect that whenever a movie like this tells you what can go wrong, it will go wrong.<br/><br/>The technical prowess of the filmmaking in the back half of the film is unparalleled. Whatever combination there might have been of location shooting and digital work, the final effect looks seamless. The howling winds, blowing snow, gleaming skyscapes and cavernous crevasses, supported by a quality 3D conversion, all create a completely believable and harshly beautiful environment that is fully engrossing. Even a brief sequence involving a helicopter is more realistic and exciting than the phony, staged helicopter action scenes in lesser titles like the aforementioned San Andreas.<br/><br/>Everest is not a cliffhanger despite all the cliffs and hanging you may have seen in the trailers. This is the tragic tale that the mountain-climbing industry does not want you to see. It starts out making the pastime of mountain-climbing look like an unpleasant compulsion and ends up making it look like outright suicide. After seeing Everest, you might find that the best reason not to climb the mountain is because it's there.<br/><br/>*I viewed the movie in an IMAX 3D preview screening shown in the U.S. on September 2nd, 2015."

","""Everest has always been a magnet for kooks, publicity seekers, hopeless romantics and others with a shaky hold on reality."" ― Jon Krakauer, Into Thin Air: A Personal Account of the Mount Everest Disaster Walking into the cinema... I have never wanted to climb a mountain, but seeing it portrayed on film can be a fascinating experience. <br/><br/>Cinematic rating: 3.5 stars Reel Dialogue Rating: 3.5 stars<br/><br/>In 1996, unknown to most people around the world, the greatest mountain climbing tragedy occurred on Mount Everest*. During freak blizzard conditions, eight people died on various expeditions that traversed the sides of the mountain. There have been various accounts of the events and different opinions of who was to blame for the tragic situations that occurred. Regardless of the controversies that came from the stories, the heart of the story bodes well for this cinematic adventure. Many of the accounts can be found in various books which include journalist Jon Krakauer and climber Anatoli Boukreev. From these accounts, the readers can determine what portion of the story to believe and see how it effects the film adaption. <br/><br/>Baltasar Kormákur directs the tale that surrounds the fateful days of two primary expedition teams led by Rob Bell (Jason Clarke) and Scott Fisher (Jake Gyllenhaal). The climbing story weaves through the competitive culture of mountaineering and the sacrifices that the men and women undertake for these excursions. From the adventure journalist to a determined Texan to the humble postman, the back stories of the various climbers help to humanise the experience and open the door to the motivations that each person had to participate in their harrowing choices. After leaving the basecamp, every step leads to life and death choices that effect every member of the expedition. The effectiveness and depth of the mountain climbing styles is shown in the different leaders, but regardless of their methods, the teams are at the mercy of the weather and the mountain's terrain. Bell and Fisher were experienced mountaineers, but they carried with them their own personal flaws and had to manage the strengths and weaknesses of each soul that was under their charge. Everest provides a dramatic look at the magnificence of the mountain and the unforgiving nature of the journey before the climbers. <br/><br/>Mountains have played an active part in cinematic history, usually as a goal for mankind to conquer and an adversary to all who try to attempt to traverse its exterior. Some of these films have been better than others, but Everest delivers an experience that manages to reach the summit of expectation. Kormákur manages to convey the majesty of the legendary mountain, the tragic secrets it holds within its layers of ice and snow and the raw human desire to conquer the heart of the mountain. The cinematography is an incredible visual experience and Kormakur does capitalise on the tragic, but majestic elements of the mountain. Each character brings a story to the mountain and some are more compelling than others, but the human interest tales all add to the drama that unfolds. Jason Clarke and Jake Gyllenhaal portray the contradictory leaders well and show the value of an effective leader. Josh Brolin, John Hawkes, Keira Knightley, Sam Worthington, Emily Watson and Robin Wright round out an amazing supporting cast for this tale of the human spirit. The story is compelling, but it is unavoidable that it suffers through a slower pace because of the multitude of characters. This is not the fault of the direction, but causes some significant lags between the key climbing scenes. This journey shows that some stories end in tragedy opposed to the triumphant, but this realism makes for a fascinating story within the human experience. <br/><br/>Coming out of the theatre, the discussion was around the motivation for climbing the mountain. What is it in mankind to seek to achieve something beyond our reach? There are so many books and seminars to achieve goals and dreams. Yet, why do we desire to 'climb the next mountain?' Much of the inner desire comes from seeing something bigger than ourselves. Not to get overly spiritual, but thinking that we were made for something more than the day to day existence. Some may say it is human will, but maybe the consideration can be explained in being created that way by a creator. In Jeremiah 29 of the Bible, God talks of knowing the plans for us, plans for welfare and not for evil, to give us a future and a hope. Could it be that we seek something bigger, because we ultimately are seeking after God? It might be the last thing some consider, but even if it is the last thing, shouldn't it at least be a consideration? The consideration that we desire something beyond ourselves, because there is a God that made us that way, come on, be brave and at least consider it. <br/><br/>* Other events have occurred since 1996, but this was the worst event up until that point in history. Leaving the cinema... I still do not want to climb mountains, especially after seeing this film. Everest was captivating and confronting. It going to see and hopefully will challenge the audience to consider some of the bigger questions of life. <br/><br/>Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. What does the future hold? (The book of Revelation, James 4:13-16) 2. Can we solve our own problems? (Proverbs 3:5, Philippians 4:6) 3. What does the Bible say about achieving our dreams?

"ngpers","9","5","10","18 September 2015"," Everest definitely dares you to imagine what it must be like to be at the top of the world with everything around going horribly, horribly wrong.
","1996 - The deadliest year (19 fatalities) ever on Mount Everest during a trek, chronicled by writer Jon Krakaeur in ""Into Thin Air"". With 1 fatality for every four successful hikes to the summit, what does it take for one to dare into Mount Everest's ""death zone"". Man is it simple named that way? With low-oxygen and harsh and rapidly changing weather conditions, Director Baltasar Komakur provides us the ultimate experience and this is the closest most of us viewers are ever going to get to scaling the world's highest peak.<br/><br/>Rob (Jason Clarke) is the leader of an expedition guiding company called Adventure Consultants, specializing in commercial mountain climbing of Mount Everest. He leads eight of his clients to the summit. The director gives the viewers' time to acclimate to the expedition group and the dangers involved, while the cast acclimate to the altitude and oxygen deprivation.<br/><br/>The entire cast and crew have done an excellent job in crafting and bringing to life this real-life disaster with an emotional consistency as well. Everest definitely dares you to imagine what it must be like to be at the top of the world with everything around going horribly, horribly wrong. With the fates of the different climbers unsure, Everest is nail- biting tense. But as the true consequences of the disaster becomes clear, that tension turns into grim sadness amid frozen corpses.<br/><br/>Everest boasts of a handful of spectacular shots that show how small the climbers are against the awe and majesty of Everest (definitely watch in IMAX if you can). Those shots are relatively scarce and one of the most effective uses of IMAX is when Beck slips while trying to cross a terrifyingly deep chasm over a wobbly ladder. Maybe if we experienced less of the climber's suffering and more of the mountain's majesty, their adventure would have been more inspiring.<br/><br/>While there are moments where the towering peak is overshadowed by the human dram, the viewers can forgive them in favor of the compelling experience of ascent and descent to the summit which is heaven for a moment and hell the next."
"supatube","5","5","10","14 September 2015"," A beautiful piece of sentimental boredom
","The 1996 Mount Everest disaster took eight lives on that spring day in May, where the Adventure Consultants 1996 expedition, led by Rob Hall (Jason Clarke), loose four climbers in their expedition. The other climbers include Scott Fischer (Jake Gyllenhaal) and three border police (which the film kinda totally skips) who died trying to rescue the stranded climbers. <br/><br/>What's good about 'Everest'?<br/><br/>The scenery is impeccable. Crisp Mountain peaks, swirling cloud, glimmering skies. Salvatore Totino (The Davinci Code) truly turns 'Everest' into a visual spectacle, which sets up the tone for a great mountain adventure. But Everest itself does not feature as a character. Not enough was done to bring it to life. <br/><br/>Emily Watson and Keira Knightley do a splendid job of portraying a helpless Base Camp manager and the equally helpless wife of Rob Hall, respectively. Mainly because out of the entire cast they were the only ones who could pull off the accent from down under, the men in 'Everest' seemed to have accents that would come and go. <br/><br/>What's bad about 'Everest'?<br/><br/>It's pretty boring. The set up is well paced especially if you're not too familiar with the 1996 disaster but the lack of character differentiation on the actual mountain climb detaches us from the characters. It's no longer Rob Hall or Scott Fischer stumbling in the snow but someone. It's a movie; surely they could have done something with the outfits to read as the perspective character? Major costume design fail in this regard as we get lost in the snow with them. Is this perhaps the point - to feel the loss? Unfortunately it only serves to detach us, emotionally, from the characters that were actually lost. And then to have the anonymous climber slowly stumble in the snow drags down the pace of the film. Sure, the climbers probably did experience hazy disorientation like this but again; this is a re-enactment not a documentary. Put some life into it. The life the filmmakers decide to inject is sentimental nonsense where we are supposed to feel tragedy as these wealthy holidaymakers die on the tallest mountain in its Death Zone - the clue is actually in the name.<br/><br/>The story also chose the wrong main character to follow only amplifying the attempt and sentimentality over story telling. Beck Weather (Josh Brolin) is the story and is passed off as the supporting cast (Although, another fail for the make up department. Did they even do an image search of what Beck Weather's face looked like afterwards?). Nonetheless, Jon Krakauer's (Michael Kelly) character would have even been a better central focus jumping between his book and the mountain, so why choose Rob Hall to carry the story. Because he was a father in waiting and never got the chance – this is an emotional ploy writers' William Nicholson and Simon Beaufoy love to do. It's a cheap and easy shot at trying to draw out some tears. It did not yank at my ducts but pulled at my patience. <br/><br/>And what's ugly about 'Everest'?<br/><br/>Misrepresentation. If, like me, you are unfamiliar with the story and begin to research it you will find fascinating aspects about this story that are never touched on. It is plugged as the biggest tragedy on the mountain as the most people died on the mountain that day however, should they not have sent a rescue team it would have been the fourth biggest tragedy on the mountain. And not the largest tragedy from one single expedition.<br/><br/>Climbers of Everest are seen as adventure seekers but in reality they're wealthy people who have their stuff carried up the mountain by real mountain climbers. And the Sherpa's barely feature in the film. <br/><br/>Rob Hall is far more compassionate in the film than the written work of the man. From research you will see a man driven by competition, success and accolade for achievement. His highly successful 94' summit with the fail in 95' only makes his decision to push for the climb to be completed in 96', in spite of the knowledge of the weather conditions, even more believable. <br/><br/>Furthermore, 1996 may have taken many lives but it also had the most amount of successful summits in the history of Everest summits. <br/><br/>Poor Doug Hanssen (John Hawkes) even seems to take some of the blame for Rob Hall's death when research will show his cause of death as unknown.<br/><br/>What made this story so large is the aftermath; a book by Jon Krakauer ( a reporter on the expedition) with a rebuttal book shortly after from one of the guides, Antanoli Boukreev, helped this story gain infamy and then the rich, spoiled, socialite, reporter, Sandy Hill, did the same. <br/><br/>The meddling of a South African team took some blame - in the movie - because in reality the guide was actually British and the South African sponsors (and team) pulled out of the expedition because of the guide, Ian Woodall (Justin Salinger). <br/><br/>The film is trying too hard to make money and be successful, be polite and not place blame, and make us cry without focusing on the fact that the adventure seekers spent $65 000 a person to climb and die. It focuses on a 'western' body count tragedy not the mighty Everest and in the end is nothing but a beautiful piece of sentimental boredom. The final shot really cements the sentimentality.<br/><br/>150 bodies remain on that mountain today. Not just Rob Hall. <br/><br/>Agree? Check out keepingitreel.info"

","Everest is directed by Baltasar Kormákur and stars Jason Clarke, Josh Brolin, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Robin Wright. First off, I saw this movie in IMAX 3D and I definitely recommend seeing it in IMAX also. Now back to movie I will start with the acting. The acting was fantastic by everyone, Josh Brolin was great as always but one person who stood out was Sam Worthington. He didn't have a big role but when he was one the screen he did great. There wasn't a lot of action but it was more intense thought out the whole movie seeing these people survive Everest. Overall Everest was great movie with fantastic acting and intensely that will keep you wondering what will happen next. See it in IMAX if you can."

With the 15 second attention spans of today, it is disgusting that a segment of the population will be in awe of this banal worthless attempt. I was at the edge of my seat as the helicopter clipped the snow bank (yeah, not really, only complete idiots would have bought into that).
Next time, change the name of mountain, the characters and everything else and see if you can sell such an insulting script to people who actually have a 3 digit IQ.
Dr. Weathers could not have possibly given consent to this feeble attempt of mis-represented drama and tragedy where the man who risked his life to rescue him was not even mentioned by title or accurate portrayal.

","There are two types of movies that I don't like. Movies that take place on a plane, and movies that unfold in mountains or frozen lands. No need to say that I was destined to dislike Everest. Well, surprise surprise. I didn't. I actually quite liked it. I think Everest is a good movie, that wins points also for being a movie based on real events. Everest makes you wonder what pushes men and women to put themselves through the need to walk the highest and most demanding mountain on earth, especially knowing that too many of them do not survive this crazy adventure. The movie tells the story of a group that decides to go up the mountain when bad weather is approaching. Bad management and a surprisingly awful storm traps many of the mountaineers. A mix of survival knowledge, luck and perseverance will be needed to go through the toughness of what lies ahead. Will they all make it? You'll need to watch the movie to find out."

"charleswjoke","8","3","5","28 October 2015"," An emotional and physical climb
","The movie starts slowly but only to establish and humanize the different important people so the viewer can figure out who is who once they are up the mountain. There are many characters that the viewer can attach too as many of these characters die. Many of these people are played by some of the very talented actors and Jason Clarke is very likable as Robb Hall. This movie feels like two different genres: it starts out as a Oceans Eleven kind of movie, meeting the characters and planning for a caper/ amazing feat. Then as they try to achieve this amazing feat the movie becomes a horror film as each character is progressively killed, one by one by this gigantic storm. The viewer really does feel as if they are in the storm experiencing this violent force of nature. All in all a very emotional recounting of a true story that does justice to the people who died there with a very good movie."

","Everest stars Jason Clarke and Jake Gyllenhaal, two tour leaders who band together on the lucky day of the year (10th May) and tackle Mt. Everest. Various A-listers are amongst them, some making the ascent (Josh Brolin, John Hawkes), others are part of the story in different ways (Sam Worthington, Keira Knightley). The two groups face peril when a storm hits. You can see where this is going. Disaster are on a middle level scale. Everest is gorgeously shot, the mountain friendly during the day, by night an active presence waiting for its next victim. The snow is blinding, and the sheer steeps and drops will put off any acrophobian. The A-listers' performances are just as grand as the mountain, but almost no emotion is sent their way because their numbers outstrip our emotional demand. In the end Clarke and co. never get the recognition they deserve."

","more than 100000 votes , 7\10 rate , 64 Metascore , Jake Gyllenhaal and Kiera Knightley , All this encouraged me to watch the movie . I started the movie and I was so excited but I really got disappointed , here is why : The movie is based on true story in 1996 about climbers who want to reach the top of Everest Mt which is really dangerous , you could die there! , each one of the climbers paid 65 thousands dollars to do this ! and not all of them are reach ! , one of them left his pregnant wife of their first baby ! and the other is a poor mailman ! Adventure :there's no adventure in the movie , because at the start of the movie they tell you that all of the climbers will reach and no one of them will die !!! and the first hour of the movie is about reaching to the top of Everest , why did they let the watcher know this ! I really have no F***ing idea ! Drama : why would I have sympathy for stupid people who paid 65000 thousands dollars to do something dangerous , while they could do so many better things with the money for themselves and for the world ?! why would I have a sympathy for a wife who married a stupid husband who left her while she's pregnant for her first time ! , I really don't give a sh*t about them ,simply they're an a**holes.<br/><br/>what's the point ? really , why do you tell me a story like this !? why do you make a movie about this story ? why did you pay 55 millions dollars for this ! ... there's a lot of suffering in this world , people die because they can't find water , food or medicine , women get raped by ISIS , people die because of their color or religion ...etc! go and open any history book and you will find a lot of suffering and a real drama stories , (don't make another movie about holocaust , enough!) instead of this you tell me a story about bunch of American di*ks who waste their money ! come on ...<br/><br/>the music and the cinematography , the directing and the acting was good , but they don't matter because the story sucks."

To make matters worse, the movie is based on a true story? I'm not sure how much of it is true, the main guide's body is still on the mountain, I'm not surprised since he was taking advice from his customers rather then doing his job and ending up killing both himself and the mailman. This is the true story the guys behind the movie chose to turn into a picture? Why? The acting was good."

","Right now, take a minute and think about what you would expect from a movie like ""Everest"". Have that thought in your head? Well, that is exactly what ""Everest"" is...no more, no less.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Everest"" tells the story (based on real-life experiences) of a group of climbers attempting to ascend to the mountain's summit in 1996. The problem that year, however, was that there was more traffic than ever before at the base of the mountain. Seemingly everyone wanted to make that climb on a single weekend. As such, the groups led by Rob Hall (Jason Clarke) & Beck Weathers (Josh Brolin) decide to team up in order to reduce traffic and increase the likelihood of success. What they don't count on? A terrific storm that whips up and threatens every single climber on the mountain.<br/><br/>First and foremost, ""Everest"" is very much a traditional ""based on a true story"" survival type of film. All the typical beats, characters, and situations you've seen in disaster movies are all present and accounted for. Not until the last 30 minutes or so does it really produce anything unique or off the beaten path. Depending on your point of view, this could raise or lower the overall star ranking quite a bit. I went into the movie not knowing what to expect, and just by personal preference was a bit disappointed in that I like films that stretch storytelling boundaries a bit. This film doesn't do that (mainly through no fault of its own, as it is based on a true story), so just as long as you know that going in you'll know what you are in for.<br/><br/>Besides being relatively ""paint by numbers"" in terms of storytelling, ""Everest"" does enough things right for even someone like me to still get something out of the experience. The visuals are stunning, the acting is well done, and those last 30 or so minutes provide some legitimate unexpected moments and emotional material.<br/><br/>What it comes down to with ""Everest"", then, is that your enjoyment will almost wholly be based on your expectations and what type of movie you like. If you love ""true stories"" and survival tales, this one is for you. If you (like me) are looking for a bit more dramatized plots and originality in technique, you might be a little disappointed. Again, the film can only ""be what it can be"", obviously, so that is why your mindset going in may just determine the star ranking coming out."
"writeguyr","5","2","3","21 October 2016"," Thrill seekers Beware!!
","Everest as a film honors those who had died climbing the treacherous famous mountain in 1996. Yet learning that some of these thriller seekers each shelled out $65,000 for the chance to reach the summit of Everest. Made me think what a waste of money that could have been used in investing in their family's future or donating to some worthy charity. It is a selfish act to attempt the dangerous climb of Mount Everest. If you are not a professional mountain climber and do not have the experience and stamina to do so. To put their lives in harm's way to risk their lives for this high priced folly. Making widows of wives and leaving their children one less parent, not to mention the long enduring heartache of those who must mourn for their deaths. I would like to see filmmakers who want to show courage and hardship. Film those homeless people in cities. They have no option but to sleep on frigid streets and push heavy carts with their worldly belongings. Not for a few weeks as in climbing Mount Everest, but for years. They are not athletes these are sometimes elderly people who must face the wrath of snow cold temperatures lonely nights with very little nourishing food. They have no team like the climbers of Mount Everest to help them or direct them. They are on their own, lonely and discarded from society. They survive by taking on the challenge of the canyons of the streets of Manhattan and other large cities, dwarfed by the spiraling towers of skyscrapers surrounding them. Yet they have no desire to ascend the heights of the monolithic mountains of concrete and steel. For they would not even be welcomed inside if they wished to do so. Everest is a mountain thousands of miles away, yet it beckons to those who have challenge in their hearts to risk their lives to reach its summit. I would urge them to see if they could take on the challenge of a homeless person living on the streets of large cities, live in the streets, pushing a heavy cart, sleeping on the streets in freezing weather, living on a meager amount of food. And have the undignified experience of having wealthy people driving by in limos starring down at them without lifting a finger to help them. That is a challenge I'd like to see them take on."

","I read the book ""Into Thin Air"" when it came out and loved it. It is one of my favorites. I also like documentaries and docudramas. This film could have been a solid 7 or 8, but sadly is a 4,, at best. This is because it seemed inaccurate and agenda driven- it was as though they could not show a woman in a bad light.<br/><br/>The movie is about two teams who are into the commercial venture of taking climbers to the top of Mt. Everest, People routinely die trying to make the summit, so the fact that some rich people with pseudo expert climbing abilities pay somebody to take them to the top is dangerous, and difficult to respect. Great shots of the mountain, and of Nepal. There is also a compelling story behind the tragedy, i.e. a hideous storm coming in making it difficult, or impossible , to make it down alive. The problem is not so much that the movie is inaccurate , the problem is the liberties seem so agenda driven. <br/><br/>SPOILER- In the movie they don't just soft peddle the fact that socialite Sandy Pittman had to be short roped up by an exhausted Shirpa, they don't mention it AT ALL. The short roping was partially, possibly mainly , responsible for the disaster, since said Shirpa wasted his energy on ONE person. Thats what I got from the book at least, but maybe thats just me. News Flash to film makers- when you mutate the story , people notice. instead they blame it some Texas doctor, who delays them and acts like a jerk. It was as though they were afraid to show a woman in a bad light."

The film definitely has its flaws on storytelling, it lingers for a long time where nothing really happens and everything appears too safe, it jumps around to different characters too often, it wanted to give each of them as much depth as possible, but because there is so many, we are left with having no character that feels fully developed, it dosen't really have a lead role, which is something I feel every movie should have, this leaves it feeling like it's not using its full potential. The cast is definitely the movies highlight, it's a star studded, ensemble cast, and there really isn't a weak performance, the best moments definitely come from the phone calls between Jason Clarke and Keira Knightley, as well as Josh Brolin and Robin Wright, the one on one scenes between a husband and wife for all four cast members is very passionate and they give their all for every scene. It may have its weaknesses, but Everest is still a very intense and well acted film that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good drama. <br/><br/>A deadly snow storm causes catastrophe for a large group of climbers on Mount Everest. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Josh Brolin Worst Performance: Elizabeth Debicki"

","Being based on the true story of the 1996 Mount Everest disaster, it was important that this film stuck to the facts and didn't get carried away for the sake of entertainment. Thankfully, it did, and the result is a realistic portrayal of the events in 1996. That aside, by far the best part of the film is the stunning visuals and beautiful scenery which really makes the film a joy to watch.<br/><br/>It is, however, far from perfect. For all the drama, the film failed to build up tension and goes through dull and flat patches with little happening. The film is, perhaps predictably, very slow-paced and takes a while to get going.

","i was actually really looking forward to this movie, the premise seemed good, and the cast of actors seemed like a sure hit on paper, the finished product isn't so great which can be blamed on the films rating (pg) being constructing for what they could of done with it while the cinematography is breathtaking, and the actors mostly on point, what we get is a slow moving film, that really feels more a glorified reenactment of the what happens, then a Hollywood film. Everest moves at a sluggish pace all the way to end, while being predictable and bland throughout this film really struggles to know what it is, as it tentatively makes moves to be dramatic, slightly thriller with jump scares and nothing else much.<br/><br/>I must say keeping track of the characters is rather hard as unless you see there faces, you mainly cant keep track of who is where, as they all were similar clothes, but credit is needed for trying to give back story to everyone in the main story, but you really don't form any emotional connection with any of the characters I cant stress how much this film could of either been an intense thriller or a serious drama and it would of been a hit instead your just waiting for this big tense climatic moment to come that never does, and suddenly after one scene more, it just end making it feel anticlimactic Hence the 5/10 RATING"

","While so many documentary movies have been made regarding MT. Everest and the lives lost taking on the challenge of climbing that beast. Everest 2015 being a 2 hour film I must say added a bit more personality to what was based on actual events. Other similar movies jumped right into showing you what the nightmare of trying to climb Everest is like with huge dramatics. I have to be honest about this film. It had long drawn out moments in the movie that made it a bit slow. This movie gave an insight on why each person was climbing the mountain and got an idea of what their personal lives were like before making that journey. Another thing to point out is that this version also includes the beauty of its native land while even reaching the base camp. With some recognizable cast like Jason Clarke, Jake Gyllenhaal, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson. This movie had its moments of laughter with random jokes and oh a scene where Jake Gyllenhaal is topless on the mountain drinking that reminded me of a certain other similar film. Everest is not on the top greatest films nor the bottom. The movie is more for documentary lovers with a tad bit of let me touch your feels in it. Everest is a decent movie.

"matt-764","6","1","1","8 October 2015"," Bring the noise
","Based on a true story and events from an expedition in 1996 that ended in disaster, Everest is a film due to the sheer size and scale of the subject that demands to be seen on the big screen. Early on a question is posed after all the life threatening risks that are involved to scale a mountain of this size are explained 'Why climb it then?' the answer in unison is 'Because it's there!' Rob Hall (Jason Clarke) is the expedition leader and owner of business 'Adventure Consultants' who will act as guide to take them up the mountain, but more importantly to get them down. We have a group of thinly sketched characters, Beck Wethers (Josh Brolin) a grizzled Texan who is the character of the group we learn the most about outside of Hall. Therein lies the problem. Gyllenhall plays Scott Fisher a rival tour operator but apart from rocking a great beard we get to know very little about him and there is never any real dynamic between (any of) the characters. As the film develops it becomes more obvious that of those who have gone up will not all come down. With base camps communication hub we have Helen (Emily Watson) being the conduit between those on the mountain and the families, including an underused Keira Knightly as Hall's wife. The real star of the film should be the mountain, and we do get some stunning shots, which in IMAX brings out the sheer size of Everest, but never really long enough to appreciate, even when the camera pans down to show how small we humans are in comparison the film moves at such pace and doesn't seem to stand still at all. While the visuals are disappointing, the sound is the real star, from early on ice melting to the fizz of the snow, crunching underfoot and the power of a storm. So is this a film about man conquering nature or how nature is our master? A bit of both. Early on in the film, Hall picks up a number of wrappers that people have dumped at one of the camps and I was expecting more of an environmental message. But no. Everest is a solid if not unspectacular piece, a disaster movie that should have done more with the characters but also the actual mountain."
"estebangonzalez10","6","1","1","28 September 2015"," Nice visuals, weak character arc
","""Human beings simply aren't built to function at the cruising altitudes of a seven- forty-seven.""<br/><br/>Based on the true events that took place in Mount Everest on May 1996 during a climbing expedition to reach the summit of the mountain, this disaster movie directed by Baltasar Kormakur stands out for its fantastic and impressive visuals. However what it has in its visual department, it lacks in character development. The only strong character here is Jason Clarke's Rob Hall who is the heart and soul of a story that is a bit overpopulated with characters who don't get enough screen time for us to really identify with them. The narrative could've worked better with fewer characters, but the magnificent mountain does end up taking center stage and the visual style makes up for all its flaws. Some patience is required as we are introduced to each character at the beginning of the film, but once the preparation for the climbing begins its hard not to fall in love with all the beauty surrounding them and the passion these climbers had for reaching the summit. Kormakur does manage to establish the harsh conditions these men would have to endure to reach the top while they acclimatize to the region, which makes the approaching menacing storm during the second half of the film even more dreadful. Including so many characters and trying to remain true as possible to the real life events may have hurt the narrative arc of the film, but the scenery more than makes up for it.<br/><br/>By 1996 the climbing expeditions to reach the peak of Mount Everest had become a sought out tourist attraction. The nearly impossible task wasn't only achieved by professional climbers, but now amateurs could achieve their dream by paying for the service of well trained expedition companies that facilitated the acclimatizing process. One company is being led by experienced climber, Rob Hall (Jason Clarke) who is preparing his new crew for the upcoming adventure. He leaves his pregnant wife, Jan (Keira Knightley) at home and heads off to Nepal to meet the team. This year the clients are Doug (John Hawkes), a returning customer who hadn't been able to reach the summit the previous year, Yasuko (Naoko Mori) who has climbed 6 of the 7 highest peaks of the planet and is hoping to complete her adventure, Beck Weathers (Josh Brolin) who is so immersed in the experience that he's forgotten to call his wife, Peach (Robin Wright) for their anniversary, among many others. Rob is worried about the growing amount of expeditions that are heading to the summit around the same time so he asks other experienced leaders like Scott Fischer (Jake Gyllenhaal) to team up with his people. Other employees working at the mountain include Helen (Emily Watson) who is in charge of communications from the base camp and Guy Cotter (Sam Worthington) another experienced crew member who is a friend of Rob's. As hard as they were working to give their clients a memorable experience, there was nothing they could do to anticipate the storm that was heading their way. <br/><br/>Kormakur had previously directed two very different action flicks starring Mark Wahlberg (Contraband and 2 Guns), but this is more of an epic disaster film with some tense moments of human drama. The cast is brilliant, but as I mentioned before there isn't enough time to get to know them all. Jason Clarke is the actor who is given more depth and he is allowed to flesh his character, but the rest are simply there as recognizable names: Worthington, Gyllenhaal, Knightley, Hawkes, and Watson don't have much moments to shine which is a shame because they are talented actors. Perhaps the only other actor we truly get to know beside Clarke is Josh Brolin who gets some more screen time as well. But despite all the big names, the truly breathtaking character here is the Mountain which imposes an immense threat for everyone, even for the professionals who think they are part of it. I was a bit underwhelmed with the movie because I wanted to care more for these characters, but I did enjoy the breathtaking visuals and the marvelous landscape. <br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
"martinramos1996","6","1","1","28 September 2015"," Not what I expected
","I had the normal hopes that anyone would have for a movie of this kind. I did not have extremely high hopes, but they were not low, too. We'll have to admit that the film is visually stunning and presents a very good cinematography. The acting is quite good and solid, but not out of this world, like you should expect in an Oscar bait film, that after watching it, I believe it might get nominated for Best Sound Editing. The story is, indeed, powerful, but it didn't live up to itself. You should expect powerful intense scenes of survival and near death in a film about climbing the Everest, but you DO NOT get it. It causes nail biting at times, but it never lives up to the gut-wrenching film that you'd want to see here.<br/><br/>In the end is a 7/10. A reasonable cinematic afternoon that you can give yourself. I had given 6.5 but I rounded it up to 7. Something that you can expect is that the film is, sadly, very forgettable. EDIT: After further analysis, I believe that the film does not deserve a 7. Therefore I'm reducing it to a 6/10<br/><br/>6/10"
"gordonlukas62","7","5","12","7 September 2015"," Everest is Exciting, Character-Driven Spectacle
","Famously chronicled by Jon Krakauer (one mountaineer involved who actually survived) in his book Into Thin Air, this movie brings the horror to the big screen. Many mountaineers are here, ready to take on the mountain, and an all-star cast is there to portray them. Beck Weathers, a Texas pathologist (Josh Brolin), Doug, a mailman (John Hawkes), Jon Krakauer, the writer (Michael Kelly), Scott Fischer, an experienced mountaineer and guide (Jake Gyllenhaal), and Guy Cotter, another experienced climber, played by Sam Worthington, as well as assorted others. In base camp, there's Helen Wilton (Emily Watson), and back at home, Beck's wife (Robin Wright), and Rob's pregnant wife, Jan (Keira Knightley). As said before, all these climbers are here, under the watchful gaze of Rob, to conquer the ultimate peak. Rob has done it more than a few times, but every climber has their personal reasons. The movie strongly begs the question of what brings so many diverse people, from so many different backgrounds and life stories, together on a possibly suicidal mission of the body and soul. All of them are hopeful, opportunistic, even excited, all completely scared, and nothing can prepare them for the disaster that lies ahead. The looming nightmare that lurks in the clouds distant from the mountain for the first half of Everest provide a definite amount of the suspense, and also the dread. It's not easy to see characters that you care about heading towards their possible deaths, especially the ones you know are going to die. Though partly due purely to human nature, it's also helped along by the fact that the performances, as well as script, on which this film lies, are fantastic. For a spectacle movie, the performances are astonishingly realistic, and fabulously written, as to make the characters even easier to empathize with. These aren't characters, they're real people, real people who faced the struggle of a lifetime, and just barely, possibly, could make it out alive. Everest is built on realism, a reason that I was skeptical the all-star cast was really a good decision, but they are. Like I said, the performances are fantastic, and well-written as they are, I got a really good feel for the characters relationships, mindsets, and backgrounds, which helped in then being able to understand their various drives for survival. Once the groups have reached the top of Everest, a few sentimentally-driven decisions, as well as just pure bad luck in the harsh force of nature, doom the party. It's a hellish situation. People don't know which way to go, struggling with oxygen and injuries. It doesn't help that the blizzard blocks out basically any vision whatsoever, and also that they are, as Rob puts it, at the ""cruising hight of a 747."" In technical aspects, this movie is also very well done. The cinematography is beautiful, and the effects used to put the characters on Everest are impressive to say the least. I believed it from the start, and the film does a really great job of putting in perspective the sheer scope of the mountain, and how small the climbers are compared to it. Yet, this movie is less spectacle-driven than character-driven, and though the circumstance though true, is extreme, the characters, and their internal, as well as external struggles to survive, are what drive the story forward. At home, both Beck and Rob's wives are helpless at the phone, so far away from the struggle of their spouses, yet so close in heart, and feeling all the more pain for it. Beck's wife is ready to get into action, while Rob's pleads with him on the phone over the broken connection of a walkie-talkie. Those words, however, only go so far. There's no villain here to hate, no excuse to be given, it's a disaster, a pure tragedy, and the movie accepts that, portraying the event as is, with not much fluff to even out the harshness of the events that take place. It's exciting, breathtaking, but also tragic. I don't want to give too much away, but the only flaws I really have with this movie are in a few scenes (which I won't mention), that I possibly would have filmed differently to carry across the dramatic effect. This isn't flashy directing, so there's nothing very attention- calling to the way that it's presented. Everest is a very realistic disaster drama, so much that as the disaster takes place, it's hard to tell which A-list cast members you're even looking at. Honestly, this is a hard movie to grade, because in it's heart, it is an experience film. This is a movie that you go to see in the theaters, in fairly astounding and totally immersive IMAX 3D (like I did). Everest both operates as a touching tribute to those unfortunately involved, and doesn't try to find false beauty in the tragic outcomes had by some people. It becomes quite emotional at times because of that. Overall, Everest is a very good movie with very good performances by a stellar cast who take their performances to heart. The cinematography is beautiful, and technically, this movie accomplishes it's aims at being both a character-piece and and a gigantic spectacle movie at the same time. Is it happy? No. Is it scary? Sometimes. Does it make me want to climb Everest? Hell no, the opposite."
"brianberta","7","4","9","18 September 2015"," A gripping movie which has intelligent action, great visuals, and depth to the characters
","This is my most anticipated movie for 2015. I really enjoy survival-thriller movies and this one interested me greatly. When I got to see it, I was not disappointed at all and my anticipation more than paid off.<br/><br/>This movie details the true story of the mountaineering disaster of 1996. After a snow storm hits Mount Everest, it strands a group of people on top of the mountain and the people down at the base camps have to rescue them before it's too late.<br/><br/>I could see this movie claiming Oscar gold in 2016. It is an amazing visual experience. The cinematography, lighting, and sound all combine to make this one realistic movie. You actually feel like you're on Mount Everest and you can not get much closer to the mountain unless you actually visit it in real life. Some scenes work very well. Certain scenes show them walking over thin strips of land and we see a very deep void at the bottom. There are many of these scenes and they work so well because of the great sound design and camera angles. Don't miss out on seeing this in Imax.<br/><br/>Also, this movie is not just style over substance. It has depth to many of its characters also. Most of the depth goes to Rob Hall (played by Jason Clarke). The depth surrounding him mainly revolves around how his wife and kids react to him being stuck out there. Also, some of the other people have depth to them as well. Some of them obviously have more depth than others but keep in mind that there are a whole lot of actors and actresses in this movie and there is only so much depth you can put in a movie. I think that this movie put just enough depth to the characters.<br/><br/>Also, the acting is phenomenal on all parts. I can see Jason Clarke getting an Oscar nomination in 2016. I'm not sure if he'll win an Oscar for ""Best Actor"" because I don't know what 2016 will have to offer in terms of acting but I can definitely say that he has a pretty good chance of at least getting a nomination. However, there are many other Oscars which I feel that this movie has the potential of winning and I hope that it ages well Many people disliked the 3D in this movie. Also, many people tend to dislike it when many other movies use 3D. Unlike many others though, I don't really think that a movie being in 3D is a bad thing. I know that it technically is a gimmick to make extra money at the box office but I wouldn't say that having 3D lessens a movie's quality at all. I thought that the 3D in this movie was very good and I felt that it enhanced the movie's visuals. I can understand why some people don't like 3D but I don't really mind it.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie is a great example of how to write survival films. Hopefully, this influences other films of the same genre in the future. It contains just what I feel is mandatory in survival-thrillers: intelligent action, great visuals, and depth to the characters. I said this earlier in this review but I will say it again - do not miss out seeing this film in Imax. It is an amazing experience."
"Lolinna","9","4","9","17 September 2015"," Everest is as de facto"" as blockbuster can be.
","Everest did a fantastic job of blending two different movie styles together, the blockbuster style versus the documentary. If you are expecting to experience the same adrenaline rush as from watching movies with unreal plot of Man vs. Mountain, for instance Cliffhanger, you will not be satisfied with this film. Not that I didn't like watching Cliffhanger back then, it was a fun roller coaster ride, but Everest is a totally different beast all together as Rob Hall says in the movie.<br/><br/>The emotions Everest brought out in my case was insecurity, hopelessness and sadness but also I felt the presence of the characters in the first part of the film really well. They are of course no superheroes, like in so many of the films today, but ordinary people, just like you and me, but still not that ordinary, since they are different from most of us. If you are willing to climb Mount Everest, something that I would not even consider, that is out of the ordinary.<br/><br/>I guess I will never understand it why people feel the need to risk their lives in that way. I guess that most of us want to live as long as possible with our family and friends and try to stay out of danger as much as we can, but still taking chances in live, otherwise it would be rather dull, right? But then there are people who feel the need to tackle really risky environments, that most of us don't even consider and get a kick out of it, even if it means that they could get short-lived, i.e. live your live to the fullest no matter what. I can kind of see the appeal in that, I just choose not to take that road.<br/><br/>I haven't read Into thin air"" yet, but I will definitely be doing so, and most likely other books on this tragic event. I researched this tragedy online before I saw the film, so I came into it, knowing how it would end, but all the same, it was so intense. I can only imagine how it's going to affect people who know nothing of the story behind it, and are maybe expecting a happy ending, like in so many Hollywood movies today, i.e. going through a real struggle, but living to tell the tale.<br/><br/>The pros of Everest are:<br/><br/>Fantastic performances from the cast, especially from Jason Clarke and Josh Brolin. The cast did put themselves through a lot while filming this movie and they did a great job making the characters as REAL as possible. I really respect them for that. They really did earn their pay in my opinion. I don't think they will receive Oscar nominations since like so many critics have mentioned, there wasn't enough meat on the bone character wise in the movie in their opinions, and the characters are believed to be not so interesting"", but I myself beg to differ.<br/><br/>Unbelievably beautiful and effective cinematography. There were so many WOW moments but still not intrusive shots for show-off and it just flowed so well. I will be really surprised if Salvatore Totino will not be nominated for Cinematography.<br/><br/>Great directing from Baltasar Kormakur, since this must have been a tremendous undertaking, both telling a true story without adding some extra for artistic purposes, i.e. sticking to the facts to respect the people involved and their families, and to decide to make it as authentic as possible by shooting it in harsh conditions as much as he could instead of relying mostly on CGI. In my opinion he should be nominated for best directing, but I'm not sure if it's realized how difficult the filming process really was.<br/><br/>The sound was topnotch. The footfalls, the sound of the wind, the heavy breathing, the cracks in the icefall, the avalanches. It totally surrounded you in such a real way. The Dario Marianelli soundtrack blended so well that you hardly noticed it, which is a good thing, but I will be listening to it again later for sure.<br/><br/>The con of Everest is:<br/><br/>There is only one con in my opinion, and that is the ending. It ended kind of abruptly, like the director didn't feel the need to give the audience more than just a little glimpse of how the survivors and the families of those who died on the mountain fared after this tragedy.<br/><br/>I highly recommend it if are looking for a movie that is both tense and beautiful, but above all as AUTHENTIC as a blockbuster can be."
"tjgoalie13","7","3","6","28 September 2015"," Beautiful, but Not Powerful.
","Everest is beautiful, well acted, and exciting, but reverts to clichés and lacks characters to care about. All movies based on a true story, about fighting the weather has the opportunity to be great. The premise lends itself to make an engrossing, emotionally gripping, and sometimes heart wrenching story. However Everest, lacks the character development necessary to be all of these things. The cinematography is stunning, and the actors are great, but a small piece is missing, and thus I feel the characters are clichés, that you struggle to feel for. To make an example, when I watch Casino, at the end when Joe Pesci's character dies, I get emotional, despite that the character is a murderer. I never felt truly emotional about the struggles of any of the characters in this film. Some characters die, and the way you know is you see a frozen corpse, there isn't an emotional moment for the character or the audience. In the end the film, is beautiful, and does a lot of things well, but I can't help feeling they missed the mark."
"Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki","4","3","6","22 September 2015"," Exploitative, unfocused; it should have been a documentary
","A bit traumatised for a moment afterward. Rather exploitative, filming it in gimmicky 3D. It made the cinematography of the mountains even more impressive, but during dramatic moments, it seemed out of place (plus, it seemed distracting just to be wearing those silly glasses during those scenes) . <br/><br/>The immense, massive scale and impact of the mountain itself clashed with what was the smaller scale horror the hikers were enduring. I wasn't expecting some generic action movie, but it really seemed like those two elements worked against each other.<br/><br/>Effectively horrifying scenes of the approaching storm itself, completely enveloping the mountain and unfortunate climbers, and of hikers almost casually tumbling over the mountainside. Good acting all around, but also an unfocused narrative; an All-star cast with no central character. Almost everyone seemed to have only an extended cameo appearance, but nothing more.<br/><br/>Parts of it I enjoyed, probably couldn't watch it a second time, though."
"3xHCCH","8","3","6","17 September 2015"," A Glorious and Grim Adventure
","This film tells the true story of a group of men who dared to climb to the peak, braving a harsh environment physiologically-incompatible with human life. Bob Cotter ran Adventures Consultants, a service to guide climbers willing to shell out $75,000 up to the Everest summit. His support staff includes base camp manager Helen Wilton, medic Dr. Caroline Mackenzie, along with a number of expert climbers and native sherpas for guides. <br/><br/>For the fateful climb on May 10, 1976, we follow expedition group leader Rob Hall and his group composed of doctor Beck Weathers, mailman Doug Hansen, journalist Jon Krakauer (who eventually wrote the book about this climb), female Japanese veteran climber Yasuko Namba and others. Before their big climb on May 10, they first had a month-long training camp on the lower levels of the mountain in order to acclimatize their bodies to the inhospitable conditions. While the group was up the mountain though, a deadly blizzard descends upon the mountain, placing all the men on the mountain in extreme peril.<br/><br/>Jason Clarke radiated a lot of warmth as compassionate New Zealander expedition group leader Rob Hall. His conversations with his pregnant wife Jan (played by Keira Knightley in a brief yet remarkable supporting performance) were touching and heartbreaking. <br/><br/>Josh Brolin was loud and arrogant as the wealthy Texan climber Beck. John Hawkes was perfectly self-effacing as Doug, a poor working man whose climb was partially sponsored by school children. Despite his prominent billing, Jake Gyllenhaal plays only a small role as an unconventional surfer-type rival guide. As in his previous films, Sam Worthington was not really very memorable as Bob Cotter. Emily Watson was motherly as the distressed manager Helen. <br/><br/>I am partial to mountain adventures more than the beach. Based on my limited number of hikes up mountains like Pinatubo or Diamondhead, reaching the peak gives such a victorious feeling of exhilaration and accomplishment. Knowing my limitations as a climber, I know that climbing even a segment of Everest is but an impossible pipe dream. <br/><br/>That is why I liked this movie a lot. With its spectacular cinematography, this film brought me up to the summit of Everest in such a realistic, involving way. The places on the majestic mountain which I never would have even dreamed of seeing, like the Base Camp (17,000 ft), the Balcony (27,390 ft) or the Hillary Step (28,740 ft), were right there in front of my eyes! <br/><br/>We see everything along their snowy way -- those elegant yaks, those serene Buddhist monks, all the way up to the legendary peak with the little flags summiteers have planted their as a sign of their successful conquest. We will also see the various faces of the human spirit when challenged by the elements -- from triumph, valor and brotherhood to despair, defeat and resignation. <br/><br/>Thankfully, the very real dangers of the climb, like the wide crevasses to be crossed on rickety ladders, the icy wind burning the skin off your face, the nasty frostbite that could cost you to lose frozen body parts, or the avalanches that can rumble down on you at anytime, are to be experienced from the safety of your theater seats. <br/><br/>The parts of the film when the characters were just making their way up the mountain and training for the big climb may be slow for certain audience members. You will learn a lot about the medical aspect of climbing up to an oxygen-poor altitude such as that of Everest. For me, I vicariously immersed myself in that literally breathtaking climbing experience which for certain I will never have myself. <br/><br/>Man, in his quest to prove that he the master of this world, has this unquenchable desire to conquer the earth's highest peak -- Mt. Everest. However in climbing Everest, the last word, as the film tells us, always belonged to the mountain. 8/10."

","Just to correct Adarsh Bohra's review on here ""Another Classic from Jake Gyllenhall"", where he incorrectly states "" The fact that some engaging, friendly Aussies are front and center as the main tour organizers and guides may account for a good deal of the films immediate accessibility; they're the competent, reassuring type you'd feel good entrusting yourself to on such an expedition."" The main tour organizers, principally Rob Hall (played by Jason Clarke), are in fact New Zealanders. Hall's wife Jan Arnold (Keira Knightley) who he communicates with via satellite phone, is a New Zealand academic, at the time of the disaster teaching Sociology at my alma mater, the University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand. Christchurch, like Nepal has sadly been devastated by an earthquake in recent years, with 80% of the city centre destroyed.<br/><br/>New Zealand has close links with Nepal since the first conquest of Everest in 1953 by New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Nepalese Sherpa Tenzing Norgay. Many climbing parties continue to be lead by Kiwis just as Rob Hall's in the movie. Edmund Hillary preferred to be remembered for the many schools and hospitals he built in Nepal.

","Based on the 1996 Mount Everest Disaster where several climbers lost their lives, director Baltasar Kormákur ('2 Guns') shows us what happened in those days that led up to that horrifying experience. I consider myself a little bit of a daredevil here and there. I love to bungee jump whenever I can, although I admit it's been a while since I have, but I don't think I have the guts to climb a mountain like Everest, which is the tallest mountain on the globe at almost 30,000 feet in the air. But year after year, people trek out there and climb it and succeed, where others don't.<br/><br/>'Everest' plays out like two separate films.The first half introduces us to our climbers in 1996, including a doctor from Dallas Beck Weathers (Josh Brolin), a mailman Doug Hansen (John Hawkes), journalist John Krakauer (Michael Kelly), and Everest guides Rob Hall (Jason Clarke) and Scott Fischer (Jake Gyllenhaal), who implore to their civilian climbers that they need to rest up and train their bodies to weather the harsh and dangerous conditions of climbing Everest. The guides even tell them that once they are at a certain altitude, their bodies literally begin to shut down and die and that it's imperative to reach the top and get back down the mountain in a certain time frame.<br/><br/>So in this first half, we see the bonds and the triumphs of climbing the mountain, making it from camp to camp as each climber struggles to breathe and make it higher. There are a couple of scenes that are fairly intense with swooping camera angles that look down off the mountain that would make anybody feel dizzy and hold onto their seat arms. However, the turning point here is once several climbers reach the glorious peak of Everest and start their descent down, when a bad storm hits ferociously upon the climbers, which ultimately kills several people off.<br/><br/>This second half is so intense and packed with a mighty sound from the IMAX speakers that I literally thought I was in the middle of this storm as well, and found myself bracing the seat in a panic. It almost seems like these people were on another planet, as most of us have never seen terrain or weather like these people experienced. Since this is a true story, we all know what happens, and it's heartbreaking to watch the inevitable as Kormákur shows us the final moments with each climber and the base camp notifying their families.<br/><br/>Towards the end of the film, this aspect seems to drag the pace of the movie down and goes on a bit too long, but some might think it's a nice and refreshing breather from the chaos that came before it. Kormákur did an excellent job with his camera-work here, making us feel like we were actually on top of that mountain, in addition to giving us enough time with each key player here, although we center mostly on Rob Hall and Josh Brolin most of the time, which is unfortunate, because Gyllenhaal's character of Scott Fischer seemed to be more interesting and conflicted than anyone else, but he's a side player here.<br/><br/>I'm not sure why the film was in 3D, as nothing really popped out, other than the depth of the land, but the IMAX screening was fantastic as well as the roaring sound. 'Everest' is intense as hell and reassures me that I'll never want to climb that mountain.<br/><br/>Recommended!"

","As i was watching Everest i had a strange feeling i was about to share the fate of some of the characters in this movie, that i wouldn't make it. And sure enough my journey up Everest lasted roughly 80 mins. I understood that this mountain movie was not going to be in the same vein as flicks like Cliffhanger or Vertical Limit, so i was quite interested in this movie as i thought it would be a deep driven character narrative story not some lame absolute soul sucking dreck of a movie. From the get go this flick had no hope as the actors involved were lumped in to performing some of the most laughable dialogue i have heard in any movie for a long time and once they finally decided to leave one of the 3000 base camps they continuously traveled between and begin the ascent up Everest it turned in to an even more hilarious clichéd piece of crap. The only saving grace for this movie is the drop dead gorgeous camera work that captures the beauty of such a harsh environment, but i'm sorry i need a bit more in a movie then just that. I must note as well due to the quality of actors i thought that at least the individual performances would bring something to the table,but i was wrong. I have seen better acting from extras in porno movies so this would have to go in the back of the resume of every involved. Overall just a horrible experience and one i hope anyone who reads this review will avoid."
"gcook2014","6","2","4","20 October 2015"," My experience with this the movie.
","Spoilers is advised, stop reading after this message!<br/><br/>Seeing the trailer to ""Everest"" was great, knowing about it being a thrilling survival movie that's based on a true story, it can get people interested. But coming out of the movie theater, i wasn't too impressed. The story was way too simple, get up the mountain and don't die. Not a lot of the characters had a real reason to go up the tallest and most dangerous mountain in the world, either just to be another mountain they climb or to get away from family, because the are miserable. The main himself knows that he's going to have a daughter, so what does he do...goes on a suicide mission to be in the newspaper. When it comes to characters, the writers of this movie, could have gone deep into these characters to show the audience the real reason why they're doing this, but no hand wave it away and then kill almost all of them. This movie lacks music, the movie ""Argo"" was based on a true story and it had more amazing kinds of music. Where in this movie I just hear snow or tragic music, but i get the idea, some people died, but not through the whole movie. My biggest complaint about this movie, the camera continues to shape, making me seasick sometimes. But once that camera stops moving; what a relief that is to just appreciate the settings in the movie. My favorite element to this movie is the setting; the view on the top of Everest was unbelievable with just that moment of silents. The movie ""Everest"" to me is a slightly above average movie that is a movie to see at least one time."
"ClaytonDavis","6","2","4","19 September 2015"," Thin Air and Thin Characters
","Baltasar Kormakur's ""Everest"" finds itself in a precarious position. One half of the film is a harrowing and emotionally resonate story of survival, loss, and the human condition. The other half, is a massively underdeveloped story, chalk full of celebrity heads that are thrust into a movie that offers no type of care and engagement for the audience to latch onto. I'm unsure I could even tell you any of the character's names. The audience struggles to identify them by their ""group name"" and multi-colored Northface coats.<br/><br/>""Everest"" tells the story of the 1996 Mount Everest disaster, where a group of climbers were killed. Starring Jason Clarke, John Hawkes, Jake Gyllenhaal, Josh Brolin, Sam Worthington, Robin Wright, Emily Watson, and Keira Knightley, the all-star cast are offered basic blueprints into the emotional center of their real-life counterparts. However, vaguely expressed through the script by Justin Isbell and Lem Dobbs, most of them are left in the dark and are unable to convey much of anything other than ""be really worried or be really scared.""<br/><br/>Starting with the positives, a 3D IMAX experience is well earned with the visuals that look like their plucked out of the Discovery Channel or NatGeo. Cinematographer Salvatore Totino leads a spectacular look upon the largest mountain in the world. Totino offers the audience a first-hand account of the power the mountain entails. The height, cold, and wind, are apparent and exist vivaciously in every frame he chooses to portray. Dario Marianelli's subtle score is appreciated as he doesn't go overboard in scenes where he could have easily let his organs reign.<br/><br/>From a technical standpoint, editor Mick Audsley seemed to be the one who dropped the ball. Quick cuts between a dozen characters, all who apparently have their own story and agenda, was not a good idea. We never get a clear introduction to any of the character's lives with the exception of Clarke and to some extent, John Hawkes (but credit must be given to Hawkes who delivers each line with clarity and certainty). The second half of the film jumps between so many people, all of which are at different locations, but we never have a real sense of where anyone is or worst yet, why or how they died?<br/><br/>From an acting standpoint, there are bright spots. The aforementioned John Hawkes is an everyday man, who gives ""Doug"" a sense of purpose and identity. Keira Knightley's emotional pregnant wife is an audacious presence, and one that we truly care about. In the film's most emotional moment, its her dedication to that moment, without overdoing it, that the film comes alive. Jason Clarke helms the film with an energy that works well and his interactions with Knightley are the film's true highlights. The rest of the cast well, they're there. Some bearded, some crying, and some really cold.<br/><br/>It's hard to completely ding ""Everest"" for what it sets out to do. What I keep coming back to is the question, why? Why is this disaster given a platform, in the form of film, need to be told? Is it a pregnant wife at home that makes it more compelling? Is it a person losing body parts? I overheard someone once say, this is ""White People Problems: The Movie."" It's morose in the sense that individuals lost their lives, and there is a moment in the movie where you get the sense of why they choose to climb the mountain. On top of the highest peak, where 747's fly high, they look upon the earth like God. I get it but I can't say I care any more or less following the credits. ""Rocky"" made us want to be a boxer. ""Gravity"" scared the hell out of us going to space (if we ever planned on it). ""Everest"" makes us just say ""okay?""<br/><br/>The final shot of the film chosen by Kormakur, is weirdly inserted and I'm completely unsure about what I was supposed to be feeling. A comparison can be made to something like ""The Impossible"" by J.A. Bayona, a film that set out to do some of the same things. Where ""Everest"" misses the mark, is in giving the audience the tools needed to make an investment in a story, and then see a return on that investment. Let's just say the DOW dropped on this one."

","A stunning, moving dramatization of the 1996 Mount Everest disaster, drawn from the accounts of several survivors. This incident actually involves author Jon Krakauer, who documented his own experience in the '97 page-turner Into Thin Air, though some disputes have been raised against his work and it's not cited as a reference for the film. As one might expect, there's no shortage of breathtaking scenery and bowel-shaking peeks down into the gaping abyss, and those are clearly a high priority for the production. They're a grand mix of CGI and on-location footage, real IMAX-quality eye candy that should scratch a giant itch for lovers of the outdoors or fans of air-sucking Earth porn. The film's dramatic turns, surprisingly enough, are just as effective. Though it's overloaded with big names, from Josh Brolin and Jake Gyllenhaal to Keira Knightly and Robin Wright, each effectively fades into a more pedestrian role and none, save a few appropriately loud-mouthed scenes from Brolin, threaten to take the production over. Though the passage of time is occasionally a bit underplayed, especially as the climbers acclimate to altitude, it works very well as both a pulse-pounder and a gut-punch. Powerful and arresting, it reaches brazenly for the heavens without losing track of its human origins, which is far easier said than done."

","Films about adventures in extreme conditions like space, underwater, desert are already evoking expectations as we are ready to buy whatever we are served. This is definitely one of them. The scenery is great, I wonder how much of it belongs to real Everest. The pace of the film is regular and gets into the subject without boring romantic stories. Some shortcomings, however, do exist concerning technical issues. For example, in most of the movie the mountaineers were wearing ordinary sunglasses or nothing at all to protect their eyes. I was expecting that they wore goggles and balaclava at all times. They might have been purposefully removed so that we could distinguish the characters. Whatever, it is easy to criticize this way. Other than this, in my opinion the ordeal of surviving in extreme conditions could have been augmented even further. Despite all these, it is rewatchable and deserves an 8/10."

","I managed to watch this on an HBO channel while hanging out in the Colorado Rockies for a few days. It is a pretty well filmed story of the tragedy on the Everest climb in May 1996. Several people died, including some experienced guides, when the weather turned mean. Perhaps the best part of the movie is the first half, showing the people and what it takes to train and pay for such an adventure. <br/><br/>I remember it because Beck Weathers, a Dallas area physician, was one of the men in the expedition. He had some grave difficulties and was left for dead on the mountain. However he stumbled down the mountain in the morning, badly frostbitten, eventually losing part of his right arm plus all the fingers on his left hand, parts of both feet, and part of his nose.

","No matter how trained you are, you can't win against the nature on its own grounds. When you have passion for something, you naturally want to be best at it. If you are passionate about climbing, your ultimate life goal must be to climb the highest mountain in the world Mount Everest. There are companies to help you achieve that goal. One of those companies is called Adventure Consultants led by highly trained professional Rob Hall (Jason Clarke). The plot of ""Everest"" is based on the true story of the 1996 Mount Everest disaster. This disaster occurred on 10-11 May 1996 killing 8 people including Rob Hall. The story focuses closely on the lives of these mountaineers and their struggles and what it means to climb on Everest. The film was directed and produced by Baltasar Kormákur. Adapted from Beck Weathers' memoir Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest, ""Everest"" opened on 72nd Venice International Film Festival on 2 September 2015 with a total runtime of 121 minutes<br/><br/>Until the actual climbing, director takes your hand and walks you through the film explaining what is going to happen. Dead bodies and blood vomiting people are just the visual proofs of the expected. Human body is not built to climb on Everest. That's why achieving this, makes it so special. The strong point of the film is that, it is not focusing only on the disaster but also the lives of the mountaineers from camping to climbing. We get to learn a thing or two about climbing. A couple of times you witness the greatness of the mountain through the eyes of the mountaineers and through the information provided to us. The director literally prepares you for the film. The perception of the tragedy depends heavily on the transmitting of this early message. Because how audience will perceive the rest, is based on this early tour and director makes sure that, his warnings are heard loud and clear.<br/><br/>The visual effects are breathtaking because you are watching a film about the highest mountain in the world. Even though it is a disaster film, you get to enjoy the scenery pretty much. This is the reason why ""Everest"" was released on 3D and 3D IMAX. It must have been a real pleasure to watch ""Everest"" in the cinema but it still managed to give me chills while I was watching it at home. I literally felt cold while watching the film. This made me anticipate how those mountaineers must have felt during the disaster. This feeling made me live the film and eventually enjoy it. ""Everest's"" ultimate goal is not to deliver a message but to help you understand the greatness of the tragedy. This is what the film aims for and it is successful.<br/><br/>The tragedy is real but the conversations and the struggles of the mountaineers are added up in the story. That's why real-life actions of the mountaineers are not open for discussion. To judge the actions of those characters, you need to be fully aware of their circumstances. Rob Hall dies making a huge mistake by listening to his feelings. One of his customers, Doug (John Hawkes) is climbing slowly behind the group. While Rob makes the summit and turning back, he meets Doug and Doug insists to go up because he came all the way until there and he will not be coming back again next year. Also, he has already failed 3 times to reach the summit. Rob accepts his wish and climbs back to the summit with him which eventually causes both deaths. So, I was mentioning earlier that, Rob is a professional climber who wouldn't make such a mistake under these conditions and we are not sure if this is really the reason why he died. That's why the actions in the film are not very much open for discussion.<br/><br/>In ""Everest,"" there is no place for feelings. It shares the coldness of the mountain. This is the weakest point of the film. Director doesn't focus on the humane part of the plot too much. He is just telling the story and gets it over with. Even the conversations between Rob and his pregnant wife Jan (Keira Knightley) are superficial and not real enough as intended. The director could have worked a little bit more on that. It is a good thing that he shows the real pictures of those people at the end of the film, and in my opinion, that is the saddest part of ""Everest."" With its tragic story and beautiful outdoor scenes -except the dead people around- ""Everest"" is a nice biographical adventure film."
"rmax304823","6","0","0","6 September 2016"," Imperfect Storm.
","This is ""based on a true story"" of people who climbed, or tried to climb, Mount Everest in 1996. It was difficult enough getting to the peak but on their way back to base camp a storm blew up and four of the team were lost and one lost his hands and nose to frostbite.<br/><br/>It's more like a National Geographic Special than a feature film. The locations are magnificent and indifferent. The top peaks are wind whipped and the storm, when it appears, is congested with roiling black clouds and lightning. There have been other movies about mountain climbing but they've never used such effective computer-generated imagery.<br/><br/>The personalities -- some of them -- are established well enough without any complicated back stories but individuals are more or less lost during the climb, when everyone is bundled up and masked.<br/><br/>And the story is otherwise confusing. The director and, especially, the editor, Mick Audsley, are responsible for making it clear who's who and who's where. The occasional location titles help -- ""Camp Number Two -- 2 PM."" But I gradually lost track of what was happening except to two or three members of the team, and even then I didn't know just where they were. Some of the incidents must have been improvised for dramatic purposes. Doug is panting and exhausted but lets the rest of the team descend while he struggles towards the peak. The leader, Rob, helps him, and the two men finally stand alone, with Doug whooping and planting his fingertip on the point of the highest boulder. Since both men died, the scene is cast in doubt.<br/><br/>One of the film's more admirable aspects is its lack of sentiment. There are a few too many minutes of Rob (the sympatico Jason Clarke) moaning his last words over the radio to his wife Jen (the refulgently gorgeous Kiera Knightly) but otherwise the deaths are well handled. Two men slip off a cliff during the storm but there is no Wilhelm scream. There's no exceptional sound at all, just the constant whoosh of wind. Nor does the camera follow the falling body, tumbling over and over. Nope. The two guys slip on the snow and fall out of the frame. Nicely done.<br/><br/>Not to be picky but when one of the men (Doug, played by Josh Brolin) finally stumbles back into base camp on his own, all frostbitten and hypothermic and half blind, the first thing they do is take his frozen fingers and dunk them into bowls of steaming water. Eskimo mythology gives us several layers of hell, where the bad folks go, just as our mythology does. The lowest level of Eskimo hell is eternal torment associated with the thawing out of frostbite. There's no indication of pain here, just relief. And I hope that steaming water was merely warm rather than hot.<br/><br/>If one wanted to, he or she could read the analog of an organic lifetime into this story. Everyone begins in high spirits, calling each other ""mate"" and ""man"", all of them exuberant -- ""What a GREAT VIEW."" Then they reach the peak or almost reach it and begin a descent that ends in tragedy for some and distress for the rest.<br/><br/>What is it that drives someone to climb Mount Everest anyway? What the hell is the point? Nobody knows. ""Because it's there,"" is too flip, and the reasons given by the team members are fatuous. It probably has something to do with self testing, seeing how much we can get away with, whether seeing how fast we can run without collapsing, parking illegally, or outwitting a mountain."
"bobbysing","6","0","0","2 August 2016"," Its a visually stunning but not so thrilling adventurous ride, realistically talking about the loss instead of any triumph achieved.
","EVEREST is about a real life tragedy of 1996 when such expeditions were arranged for the interested (wealthy) clients and one of those teams lost its eight unfortunate members while climbing down the hill (post successfully reaching the peak) facing some extreme weather conditions and breathing problems. The film is no doubt a 3D visual treat with a breathtaking cinematography making you feel the fear of heights as if you are right there with them fighting the mountain range, snow, wind and lack of oxygen. But overall it doesn't turn out to be anything highly exciting, roller coaster ride kind of film as per the expectations raised by its impressive trailer.<br/><br/>Yes, the fearful camera angles, scary heights, the sudden falls and an excellent use of computer graphics thankfully offer few (much awaited) exciting moments at intervals, particularly in the final hour. But the film mostly drags and is actually a sad and tragic account of a real life struggle between the man and nature, instead of any entertaining and enjoyable adventure.<br/><br/>The first hour of EVEREST focuses on its various characters and how they all form a team finding their common commercial guide. The pace remains slow without any great engaging moments, but following a different realistic vision, here we do not have any individual heroic figure leading to some predictable dramatic sequences of a disaster movie. Besides, the action actually begins much later in its concluding hour, when the team gets to face the sudden snow storms and changes in weather conditions while returning from the peak in a joyful mood. However I personally found that huge feeling of victory missing in the sequences when they all reach the top and start clicking their pictures. At times the visuals are simply terrifying, forcing you to think that why the hell they are so desperate to just climb that famous hill? In fact a question that can only be answered or understood by the people who truly share this crazy mutual passion of conquering the highest peak.<br/><br/>Putting the best of their individual efforts, the entire cast ensemble in EVEREST comes up with a fine show under the splendid direction of Baltasar Kromakur getting great support from his cinematographers, sound department and graphic artists resulting in many stunning visuals. But the written proceedings do not really generate any heart-stopping, enjoyable tension that is obviously the first thing expected from such adventurous venture.<br/><br/>In all, EVEREST is indeed worth watching on the bigger screen alone because of its great visual appeal in 3D. But the film is surely is not the one you were looking for after watching that lively trailer. Also, focusing more on the sad deaths than the proud triumph achieved in its final moments, the film doesn't allow you to move out of the theater in any celebrating mood at all, deeply thinking about many precious lives lost in just an attempt to win over an unconcerned mountain?"

Everest but then talks about how expeditions are set up to held people reach the summit. This film tells the true story of one such expedition in 1996 where the climbers ran into a disastrous storm with tragic results.<br/><br/>EVEREST is a very grim, depressing and rather unpleasant movie that I really wish was better. I had high hopes going into the film but sadly there are all sorts of problems that overshadow what great qualities that are on display. I think the biggest problem is the opening hour where we get to know the characters and like a lot of the disaster movies from the 1970s these scenes are all too familiar and they really don't add much. I think the direction of Baltasar Kormakur could have handled these scenes much better or at least added a bit of energy to them.<br/><br/>The film kicks into high gear once the climb actually starts and once the storm hits. The greatest aspect to the film is the terrific cinematography, which is just downright beautiful and at times breath-taking. Even greater is the fact that it really does show you the dangers of making such a climb and I think the one thing the film does brilliantly is show you what a remarkable accomplishment it would be to reach the top of the mountain. I've seen several documentaries on Everest but this movie really does a remarkable job at showing how difficult the climb would be.<br/><br/>The performances are all very good. Jason Clarke, Jake Gyllenhaal, Emily Watson, Keira Knightley and Josh Brolin are all very good in their roles. All of the roles are rather small but it's easy to see what would attract them to such a project. The film also benefits from being technically very good with the score, the editing, sound effects and various other effects coming across quite good.<br/><br/>As I said, the first hour of the film is rather sluggish and I think the overall pacing is just off. The film features some intense scenes of action and peril but as I said the overall feel is just so depressing and unpleasant that I really wouldn't recommend the movie to people. I really wish the film was better but in the end it falls well short of being a good movie."

Sure it suffers from some of the pitfalls of the disaster movie genre, such as weak characterisations and fake sequences, but emotional investment is high and ready to be grasped by those so inclined. The drama on the mountain is gripping, and thankfully this is matched by the frantic concurrent story strands involving the family and friends waiting at base camp and the family homes.

Really stuck to the genuine article in terms of time-line and locations.<br/><br/>It reminded me a bit of ""World Trade Center"" with it's cliché'd grieving, worried-wife characters, and similarly lacks the early scenes to create an impact down the stretch. At least World Trade had two powerhouse performances from Cage and the under-rated Michael Pena.<br/><br/>Here we have a film with similar acting firepower but it never comes to fruition. The most interesting character here is Jake Gylenhaal, but much like the rest of the characters - he just doesn't have enough screen-time. I think the film tried a little too hard to depict all the characters that lost their lives, and in-turn didn't flesh-out any of them.<br/><br/>I mentioned I liked the set-up... I also liked the climbing scenes.. really well-done. Especially near the summit. You really feel like you're rt up there.<br/><br/>The film is just above average overall, and for me falls in the middle of the pack of movies I've seen from 2015(probably about the 30th best film out of about 60 so far).

Now I know that seems harsh but we never really got an insight into their true personality and other than the obvious ""We're having a baby"" there wasn't much to push for you to care for these people. <br/><br/>In my personal opinion it lacked a more in-depth look at the people themselves rather than the over exhausted process of the climb which could have been cut down or turned into more valuable scenes. In the end I felt this is what let the film down and as much as I know this a true event and people lost their lives which is always sad, I have the opinion that these people knew the risks they were taking and they took them anyway which is on them.

An average family could book a few all-inclusive vacations for that kind of money. And it could also be something adventurous where you could admire breathtaking panoramas. Only the chances you'd die during such a voyage is significantly smaller. And just like the traveling journalist Jon Krakauer (Michael Kelly), I asked myself the big question : why the hell would someone decide to do something like climbing Mount Everest? Is it something masochistic? A dream that they are pursuing? Is it about pushing your own boundaries? Or is it to boost your self-esteem, knowing that you are one of few who managed to achieve this? Unfortunately, however, you won't get an answer to that question here.<br/><br/>And yet I couldn't resist to go watch this movie on the big screen. Partly because I was expecting some impressive images in this mountainous landscape. And this time I wouldn't make the same mistake as with ""Gravity"". I'm not going to wait for the DVD or VOD version and then think of Mount Everest as being a measly little mountain. Even though I have a huge flat screen. ""Gravity"" turned out to be a deep disappointment. On the other hand there are all these famous actors who collaborate in this film. If you succeed in convincing Jason Clarke, Sam Worthington, Emily Watson, Keira Knightley, Josh Brolin and Jake Gyllenhaal to co-operate in this semi-disaster movie, you're holding all the trump cards anyway. For me personally, the fact that Jake Gyllenhaal is in it, was already a reason to watch this film. And he didn't disappoint as the somewhat eccentric expedition leader Scott Fischer (although his contribution is rather limited). Even Knightley (her smile frightens me more than my fear of heights) didn't stop me.<br/><br/>""Everest"" can be split up into two main parts. The first is dedicated to the participating mountaineers and their background. Ample time will be taken to study those characters in depth and explain their motives. First there's Rob Hall (Clarke). A kindhearted person who respects the immense mountain. He's the first who commercialized the concept of reaching the summit. You could call it a city trip to the summit of Mount Everest. Then there's Scott Fisher (Gyllenhaal) who leads a competing tour company. An eccentric who couldn't care less about strict regulations and who has a ""we will swiftly climb up that mountain"" attitude. And in the field of competitors we first see Doug (John Hawkes), a not so wealthy ordinary postman who almost reached the top before and now is determined to succeed in his final attempt. The only female participant is Yasuko Namba (Naoko Mori) who has already climbed six of the seven major peaks. Then there's Beck (Josh ""Oldboy"" Brolin) whose motivation for climbing the notorious mountains is fed by a marriage that is faltering. And finally Jon Krakauer (Michael Kelly), the journalist who wants to make a documentary about this venture. Obviously this is the least action-packed part.<br/><br/>The ascent to the top is of course the second main part of the film. Superbly visualized and filmed. The physical suffering and perseverance of the participants is more realistic than expected. You can admire hallucinatory panoramas which make you feel as if you were on that hillside yourself. And when the weather changes drastically, it's all just about surviving. It's another demonstration of how small we are as human beings in relation to the elements of nature. A trial of strength between man and nature. Of course, this is the most exciting and intense part of the film. Unfortunately the outcome is known in advance. The only surprise element that remained was who'd survive this hellish journey in the end.<br/><br/>What was the cause of this disaster eventually? Was it because of overconfidence? The fact that it was reasonably crowded at the foot of the Mount Everest and thus the commercialization indirectly caused it? Or was it just bad luck that a severe storm hit them? This is a story of human failure in the annals of world mountaineering. That's irrefutable. But what about all those other victims worldwide while climbing gigantic mountain peaks? Ultimately, one can only conclude from this that we are powerless against murderous nature. Eventually the leading role in ""Everest"" is reserved for the mountain itself. Notwithstanding the hallucinatory images and suspense, this wasn't a highlight for me when it's about movies in 2015.<br/><br/>More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT"

","believe it or not, i didn't know the story, never heard about it and i'm old enough. The 1st time i've seen the trailer i believed it was about top climbers who had a very bad day on the Everest and because of the cast, worth watching, kind of sport movie like Vertical limit . Jack Gyllenhaal, Jason Clarke, Josh Brolin are really great everywhere, Keira Knigtley and Emily Watson as well.<br/><br/>But then in the opening you have a few sentences explaining who was the 1st to climb and reach the summit and who died or did the same the next 40 yrs and..... this: Rob and his Adventure consultant business who takes every day people on one of the most dangerous mountain in the world I mean what?! how is this possible, people are free to do whatever they want with there lives but guys, use common sense right,are you insane? my view change instantly from a good sport movie to what it must be, an horror and catastrophic story. It's amazing to watch people using ladder to pass over a crevasse, as Beck says, '' yes i'm scary, i know i can die but i didn't pay to die like i was in Walmart''<br/><br/>at the end you can't blame Rob Hall, he died trying to make every customers happy.. against all safety like Doug the Postman, what is he doing here? none of them meet the requirement to be there, even Beck who was training 6/7 days is a miracle, the man is alive but shouldn't.<br/><br/>i loved the movie because of the Everest's beauty, the cast who delivered, and most importantly the story which was, for me, incredible. the survivors can't be proud of this adventure but really be happy to be alive. it's a must see"

","You'll know what to find here, a disaster movie with people stranded on a mountain, grit and elegy in the right spots. At the same time it isn't more than that, grit and elegy merely in the right spots, exactly where you'd expect to find them on the way down.<br/><br/>But now a film like this, where do you want to see it rest? is it enough that it chills the body, perhaps warming up the heart a bit? It is such a bravely foolhardy endeavor where so much can go wrong but exactly on token of this I find myself hankering for something else as well, worldview.<br/><br/>See, we are up on the highest mountain on earth, the terrain is sparse, human character is laid bare by the elements. The endeavor is poetic anyhow; doing something for the sheer capacity of pushing yourself to do it. Not purely poetic as motives of different characters suggest. But we are primed to find a summit, a closeness to that human spirit that wants to lift itself up.<br/><br/>A worldview means to see all the things that happen to us, unfortunate as a lot of them may be, as more than just the result of dumb accident and negligence. They are of course also that but it falls on us to amalgamate the experience into vision for living. This is exactly what survivors in this case would ponder on for the rest of their lives, the meaning of it.<br/><br/>It is damage, hurt, loss, the parts that we have chiseled out of us that provide the opportunity for reflection, the impetus for a response to the world where these things happen. Can you hate a mountain for claiming a loved one or your limbs?<br/><br/>And it's common for amputees to feel a phantom limb where a hand or foot used to be, feel it as if still there. Is this any different with losing someone close? The mind not only surges through the entire body, it surges through the entire space of what we have known as life (it starts with memory but goes beyond).<br/><br/>We get a little of that here. The loving wife's voice reaching out to him 8000 km up in the frost, urging him on to her, and soon after the same thing as hallucinated vision that lifts a dead man up from his stupor. You have to climb back down on your own sometimes, no one will be coming, but the power of making a full return from the edge rests within.<br/><br/>But for the most part we have survival physics here. I would have liked to see more of this notion of persisting vision evoked with a roaming eye that lifts itself up from a body. We could for a start have a more visual eye of the mountain, crevasses and shelves of rock that we don't really explore. To see with an ecstatic eye after all means to go where common sense won't."

","My summary above is actually just a joke. I will never even attempt an activity where you have a 25% chance of losing your life! Since the film is based on true events, I don't want to be too critical and harsh on the characters that lost their lives in this tragedy, but clearly instructions were ignored (Leave the summit by 14:00) and some basic precautions (oxygen tanks) seemed to have been completely missed. With all due respect, many of the people that died in this tragedy made the wrong decisions, an it cost them dearly. Many decisions were selfish in my opinion. Many did this because of their ego or wanting to prove something to themselves or their families etc. When the journalist asked why people want to reach the summit, none of the answers were really convincing to me.<br/><br/>What I liked about this film is obviously the cinematography and some solid acting. It also seems to follow the actual events quite closely. It did make me think much further than only Everest. Many of us are faced daily with decisions. Some are small and some are life changing. How we react to these challenges can change our lives forever. This has clearly been illustrated and confirmed in Everest.<br/><br/>I see that people mention that the first hour of the movie was boring. I actually really enjoyed to see what work and effort actually go into an expedition to the summit. It was really insightful. I do however now firmly believe that Everest has been conquered and I don't understand how people still want to take the risk to go up there."

","It is really a shame that despite featuring a star-studded cast placed in a highly dangerous environment where anything could go wrong anytime, where the element of unpredictability is high, and where tension can be created in the simplest of scenes, Everest simply fails to create such nail-biting moments and for the most part, is nothing but an empty spectacle.<br/><br/>Based on the 1996 disastrous expedition to scale Mount Everest, Everest follows Rob Hall; the leader of an expedition team whose task is to guide his clients to the summit of Mount Everest and bring them back safely. The plot covers the adventure he & his group embarks on and the devastating turn it takes when a severe snow storm hits them on their way back.<br/><br/>Directed by Baltasar Kormákur, Everest could have been so much more with the resources its plot provided but isn't thanks to mediocre direction. The film takes so much time to get us acquainted to its characters and yet the characterisation remains poor and is evident in scenes when their life is at stake. At times, the writers try too hard to make the viewers feel for these people but it just doesn't work.<br/><br/>The technical aspects are a mishmash of impressive & absurd work. Set pieces are refined & detailed while the shooting locations bring an authenticity of its own. Cinematography is arresting when it comes to landscape photography, colour tones are smartly utilised but it fails to enhance the action in any way. Its 121 minutes of runtime feels a tad too long. VFX is expertly carried out while the background score is absolutely useless.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Everest features a fine cast in Jason Clarke, Jake Gyllenhaal, Josh Brolin, John Hawks, Emily Watson, Keira Knightley, Robin Wright, Sam Worthington & Michael Kelly and yet there isn't one performance that leaves its mark. Clarke still lacks the charisma to lead a film on his own, Gyllenhaal does well with what he's given, Brolin is very much wasted, Worthington has no idea what he's doing here, Watson is fine while Wright & Knightley don't have much to contribute.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Everest could have been one of the best survival films to surface on the silver screen in recent years but thanks to basic direction & lazy writing, it falls very short of what it went out to achieve. With so many characters inhabiting this disaster story, it sucks that not even one manages to strike a chord as the film fails to capture the very excitement & danger of a larger-than-life voyage like this. Entertaining in bits n pieces, photographed in splendid detail but lacking the element that makes a good movie great, Everest is unable to take the advantage of its massive canvas and is more or less a disappointment."

He has a twin, his name is Mark Duplass.or that one guy from office space, KEVIN something... so anyway....here we have Jason Clarke doing tours up the mountainside of mt. Everest. Josh Brolin is one of his clients. Jake Gyllenhall is a climber who either like lives on the side of the mountain or is a part of another team of people who have guided tours and assistance of going up the mountain.This film kind of highlights the unpreparedness of people. Like when Jason Clarke had teamed up with another crew so they could use the ropes, or when another team used the ladder and the other teams wanted to know why they were so professional but didn't have their own equipment. Also, there were levels of analysis in which the climbers analyzed whether or not some of the crew were fit enough to continue, or if the weather was too terrible to go on any further. that was the spectacular portion of the movie to me. then there was the role of kiera knightly who played an adult who responsibly married the grown up Jason Clarke."

","Despite the stellar cast, this adaptation of the doomed summit in 1996 fails to capture the intensity of similar tragic-docu-films. Perhaps watching on a small screen spoils the majesty of the Himalayas in the cinematography? I guess what the film really lacks is the element of suspense because if you know the synopsis of the plot beforehand, you know that as soon as the weather turns, the events that unfold are not going to bode well for those on the mountain...although there is the surprise survivor who, despite suffering frostbite on his hands and face, manages to stumble to camp and is airlifted in a precarious helicopter rescue. A film worth watching, if only to remind ourselves how foolish adventurers can be in achieving their goals."

","That isn't to say the Oscar bait of a cast goes completely to waste. Jason Clarke exhibits perhaps one of his best performances inside his recent string of action movies, rebounding from this summer's lackluster 'Terminator Genisys' and building upon his solidifying appearance in 'Dawn of The Planet of The Apes.' With an impeccable Kiwi accent and sincerely heart wrenching exchanges with his wife, Clarke as expatiation leader Rob Hall skillfully suffers the very fate he so desperately intended to protect from the team and himself. Applause should also be reserved to Robin Wright and Keira Knightly, whose portrayals of distressed yet strong-willed wives are especially commendable, granted that they were forced to concoct pure pain, hope, and determination without co-stars Clarke or Brolin in the room. Josh Brolin as the hard-nosed Beck Weathers is one of the film's more well rounded showings, evolving the character from subconsciously terrified yet confident climber to a frost eaten walking dead.<br/><br/>FULL REVIEW HERE: http://indieadam.com/2015/09/20/everest-review-indieadam/"

","Everest, which is directed by Baltasar Kormakur, bills itself as a true story that's based on the events on Mount Everest when an avalanche struck with devastating effect in 1996. What this film is, however, is essentially a disaster movie on Everest, with the typical set-up that establishes numerous characters who are lead to their fate up a mountain as opposed to on a cruise liner, on an island or up a huge skyscraper. But it's very impressive, being shot and staged on an epic scale that's something to behold on a huge screen. I saw it in 3D, which done little for me, but the cinematography and special effects are really outstanding and help make for a thrilling and an involving movie that's full of fine performances. The cast includes Jake Gyllenhaal, Robin Wright, Josh Brolin, Keira Knightly, Sam Worthington, Emily Watson, Martin Henderson and Jason Clarke in a central performance as a tour guide who takes groups of climbers up Everest. But here lies the film's main problem, which, aside from some glaring holes in the writing, establishes so many characters that dramatic potential is lost and individual stories get snowed over. Less so with regards to Jason Clarke, whose character is afforded more focus from start to finish, with Knightley playing his pregnant wife who stayed at home this time out. Keira's role is quite thankless, but she gets lots of mileage from a small amount of screen time, whilst there's one standout scene in which Emily Watson is relaying a phone call from base camp to Knightley which she's feeding into the radio so she can speak with Clarke, who is up the mountain. Watson says little, but everything that's running through her mind can be read in her face. It's a remarkable bit of acting from a fine actress. And Everest does manage to move in places, as human nature is pit against mother nature and a will to survive can only take you so far when the odds are so tremendously stacked. What I also liked about this movie was the way it depicted Kathmandu and showed the respect Tibetan monks have for the mountain, with this being shared among the climbers. Dario Marianelli's score is also very good. But if you like spectacular, thrilling movies, this is one to see."

","1996. Rob Hall says goodbye to his wife Jan. He and his team go to Nepal to guide clients to summit Mount Everest, at more than 8,000m. His clients include Beck Weathers; Yasuko Namba, who had been to six of the seven summits; a journalist Jon Krakauer; and Doug Hansen, an ordinary man enthusiastic about summit-ting Everest. They reach the Everest base camp at about 5,000m. Rob meets his competition team leader Scott Fischer who quips about Krakauer originally being Scott's client. The team gets to do three acclimatizing ascents to adapt to the thin air. On the first ascent Doug coughs, repeating his problem that made Rob turned him back last year. Beck calls home. His wife feels something strange about him since Beck never calls when on a mountain. On the second ascent Rob turns the team back for a storm. Rob did the same on the third ascent. But they get stuck on the Icefall region due to a crowding on the stairs. Beck almost falls on the stairs and Rob guides his hand, although Beck gets grumpy about it. <br/><br/>Rob persuades Scott to work together, to Scott's agreement, although there's friction between their Sherpa guides Ang Dorjee and Lopsang. May tenth, they go on to summit. After a while Scott goes back to base camp for a missing client. He then goes back up, despite Rob's advice. Past Camp 4 Beck starts having sight problems so he stays put while the others go on. Ultimately most of the them reach the summit. Scott tells Rob to go back first. Rob guides the pack down as his schedule arrives. He finds Doug late to reach the summit, but Doug persuades Rob to help him summit. Rob helps Doug, passing his own schedule. Soon a violent storm engulfs the summit. Rob struggles to guide Doug, who's now half conscious, to the Oxygen stash point, where they find none. Rob radios back for help and his crew Harold climbs back up to help them. Scott tells Lopsang to leave him due to him running out of breath. The rest of the team going down finds Beck and brings him too. Beck and Yasuko get separated in the storm while the rest of the team make it back to Camp 4. None is willing to go back out to help due to the storm. In the storm Rob and Doug shelters on a narrow ridge. But Doug rips his fastener in his hallucinations and falls to his death. <br/><br/>Harold reaches Rob with Oxygen but the cap froze. They have no other choice but to wait the storm out through the night. At night hypothermia catches on to Harold and he too falls to his death. In the morning Rob wakes up numbed down to frostbite. The team at base camp tries to motivate him by patching him to Jan. They send Ang Dorjee to find Rob but he turns back when the storm descends again. The base camp radio him this message and he talks again to Jan. Beck miraculously wakes up from the ice and walks himself back to Camp 4. Other climbers guide him back to base camp where his wife arranges a helicopter to come and pick him up. Rob, Scott, Yasuko, Harold and Doug died on the incident and their bodies are still on the mountain.<br/><br/>The story is good enough that it captures a balanced portion of the incident and the general view of the more dangerous side of mountaineering or summit-ting, particularly at Everest. The movie nicely spots a highlight at how summit-ting Everest has become a business, and how the lack of governance on that part of the world has resulted in the strong competition between guide teams and also dangerous crowding on potentially dangerous areas like the Icefall.<br/><br/>The first half still seem very nice If you sit yourself down and try to learn some new things about mountaineering. Even if you are actually a mountaineer, you can instead sort the true practices beside the gimmicks added to make the movie more dramatic.<br/><br/>I think the second half of the movie is where its real main attraction is. The struggle of the characters to survive and the harsh ordeal most of them had to go through seem very much in contrast to their confidence and mountaineering experiences at the beginning of the movie. The refusal of those who made it to Camp 4 to go back and help out also adds to the contrast.<br/><br/>Furthermore, for people like me who haven't read the book, this movie nicely gives a variation to our mindset about Hollywood movies' ending. It's now too often to see a happy ending in many Hollywood movies, even in disaster movies like the last ""San Andreas"", that people tend to generalize that a movie's ending will be a happy one where the characters get to go back to their lives. I have another friend who told me she is annoyed that the main character dies at the end. <br/><br/>The acting overall is quite good. A starry cast list helps very much. Although we don't get balanced character developments, at least the movie managed to present a believable level of acting. Jason Clarke did well in portraying Rob Hall as a 'hand-holder' as Scott says. Jake Gyllehaal, Kiera Knightley, Sam Worthington and even Elisabeth Debicki nicely adds to the factor that attracts our eyes to the screen for seeing familiar faces in the movie.<br/><br/>A solid score of 7 out of 10 is deserving for Everest (2015). A recommendation is definitely a yes to go and see it in the movies."

","Docudrama climbs new heights - in fact, to the summit of the world's highest mountain - in this adrenaline-intensive re-creation of the tragic climbing season of May 1996 when eight people died in a two-day blizzard on Everest. Although there are big-name stars here (Jake Gyllenhaal, Sam Worthington, Keira Knightley), no one is allowed to grandstand: what counts is the ascent. The script gives us glimpses of the climbers' everyday lives - the wives holding their breath at home - and the support team at the various Camps; and, never forget, the Sherpas. But the movie's biggest star is the mountain - and, it must be said, the cameramen who surely took serious risks to obtain the footage.<br/><br/>The CGI people have seamlessly joined scenes shot in the Italian Alps to the Everest shoot. You totally feel (especially if you see it in 3D and IMAX) that you are up there with these people crawling across bottomless crevasses and dizzying slopes. You also get a sense of what drives these mountaineers, a force somewhere between bravery and foolhardiness, to take on one of the greatest challenges our planet has to offer."

","In 1996, the dreams of a group of Everest climbers ended in tragedy at the top due to poor decisions, short supplies, and blizzard conditions. This is a well-made and fascinating story, but it lacked emotional power for several reasons: In 3-D, every time the camera panned, the background images were an unrecognizable, shaky blur that left me queasy. I didn't feel the 3-D added anything to the scenery, which was already awesome (They really did film at Everest Base Camp). Another problem I had was that the characters were hard to tell apart with the beards, goggles, caps, and other gear hiding their faces. And lastly, there were a variety of accents that I found hard to understand, so I was basically just following the action like a silent movie.<br/><br/>The old question of ""Why do you climb a mountain?"" is never answered in this film, and there was only a very brief epilogue, but the movie does make you think about the costs versus the rewards of scaling the peak.<br/><br/>(There was a 1997 TV movie, ""Into Thin Air: Death on Everest,"" which had a smaller budget but packed much more of an emotional wallop because it focused on personalities and backstories of the climbers.)"
"ironhorse_iv","7","0","0","26 September 2015"," Everest was hard to watch. It was kinda rocky & way too depressing. Still, the film was worth the climb
","This movie was indeed a hard mountain to climb over. It's even harder to watch, when you, stop and think, that people indeed die, trying to make this movie. While, the movie was being filmed in Nepal in 2014, an avalanche struck, while the second unit crew was shooting remaining scenes of the film at Camp II on Everest, killing 16 Sherpa guides. The Sherpas were carrying equipment and supplies for the filmmakers. Lucky for the film production, they were not present where the disaster took place, but they were nearby. Indeed, that was close-call. Still, this movie was released, way too soon after April & May 2015 Nepal earthquake. That disaster alone, triggered an avalanche on Mount Everest, killing at least 19; making April 25, 2015 the deadliest day on the mountain in history. So, I really don't get, why the film distributer, Universal Studios really felt, like this was a good year to release this film. I guess, they were really trying to capitalize on the recent Mount Everest craze. I really don't like, the idea of people capitalize on people's death, but whatever; at least, they could push the release date, Sept 2, 2015 back, a few months later, for a little more, for respect for the recent victims. Anyways, like the 1998's IMAX film that share the same name, Everest tells the story of the same event. Everest tells the story of the 1996 Everest disaster, when eight people were caught in a blizzard and died on Mount Everest during a summit attempt. Directed by Baltasar Kormákur and based on Jon Krakauer's bestselling book, 'Into Thin Air: A Personal Account of the Mt. Everest Disaster' and Beck Weathers' novel, 'Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest'. The movie is a tear-jerker, disaster film. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, the movie is pretty much, historic accuracy to many of the film portrayal of true events. However, there are somethings worth noting that didn't happen, weren't mention or was change at the last second. First off, there were a lot more other team expeditions that were climbing the mountain, those days, besides the South African, Mountain Madness & the Adventure Consultants. There was a Japanese, Taiwanese, and Indo-Tibetan expeditions, climbing, both from the North Col & South Col side. There is no mention about the three-man expedition attempting to become the first Indian team to reach the top of Everest from the northeastern route in this film. Another thing that the film fails to mention is that the helicopter that was sent to help them, rescue two people, rather than one. One of those survivors in the helicopter rescue, wasn't even discussed in the film. Another thing, the movie didn't show, was that the helicopter pilot took two dangerous helicopter trips from base camp to Everest. Still, for the most part, it was pretty intense movie. Not because of the action, but because of how grim, the settling are. The movie has some really good moral messages, worth exploring. Explores issues of life and death, such as when is a dream, worth risking your life? Another question would be, when is it OK to abandon morality and save yourself -- or to stand by someone even if it could cost you your safety? It's a movie about ethics and what does it takes to be a team. All the actors show this. They were pretty good in their roles. They all, look like they could be real mountain climbers. Jason Clarke as the leader, Robert Hall is perfectly cast as organized, detail-oriented man. Josh Brolin is great as Beck Weathers, as the fearful newbie, trying hard to fit in, while, not show, how scare, he really is. John Hawkes is wonderful as Doug Hansen, the ordinary every man trying to do the unordinary. Jake Gyllenhaal as Hall's foil, wild ski bum/mountaineer Scott Fischer was pretty interesting. Last, worth noting is the delightful, Naoko Mori as Yasuko Namba, a woman so driven to reach all of the Seven Summits, that you can't help, cheering for her. I really like, how the film gave enough time, for each one of the team members, to have a little bit of character development, and backstory. Most of the characters in the film were pretty memorable. I just wish, the movie focus a little more of a few core characters than everybody. It was hard to keep track, of each of these character. It was even harder to comprehend, what's going on, when the blizzard scenes hit, because you can barely see them, hear them or see the surroundings. Also, once the characters put on all their gear on, most of the characters are hard to distinguish, unless you memorize what were they wearing. Sadly, the IMAX 3D isn't worth the price, because of this. I don't recommended. Most of the 3rd act is in night & blizzard, so you wouldn't even see anything, anyways. The 1998 IMAX movie is better to watch for the visuals, than this, in my opinion. Another movie worth checking out is 1997's Made-for-TV movie Into Thin Air: Death on Everest was also based on the same events. Overall: Everest is tragic, but watchable. This gripping drama is a harsh mountain of a film, worth checking out."

","Never again will I look at a mountain the same way after seeing this movie.<br/><br/>The story is about a group of climbers tackling Mt. Everest must fight to survive after a devastating snow storm leaves them stranded. The film is based on a true story of the 1996 Mount Everest Disaster.<br/><br/>So I've just seen Everest and it was pretty good. What I thought the movie did a great job is making me care for the characters and I also liked how I felt like I was 29 or however thousand feet high on this mountain with the characters.<br/><br/>The cast in this movie is freaking huge and every single one of them and yes even Sam Worthington was great in this movie. Jason Clarke and Josh Brolin were both absolutely phenomenal in this film and easily the biggest stand out of the movie. Jake Gyllenhaal was great too and I was quite surprised that he wasn't the main character as me and everyone else thought he was, because I watched the movie not knowing too much about the real life disaster itself and I actually thought that Gyllenhaal was the main star at the first, but he wasn't.<br/><br/>There was never a point in the film that I can say that was bored, I mean at the beginning of the movie it's just these guys camping for a month getting ready to climb the mountain and you would think that will be boring right? nope, not here as the performances, the characters and every detail about climbing Everest kept me interested and locked on.<br/><br/>The score is another thing that was great in the movie, and so was the cinematography that was just flat out gorgeous and truly breathtaking to watch.<br/><br/>Now for the problems: The movie did feel a little bit too long and yes I know it's two hours long, but at some point I did felt like it went a little bit over in parts. The movie did have some pasting issues in some parts and that's really it for problems.<br/><br/>Overall Everest isn't a movie that I'll call ""great"" but I can say that I enjoyed watching the movie and it's worth seeing."

I've read that the odds of dying while climbing Everest differ based on how it's calculated, but seems to break down at about one for every 61 attempts. People pay thousands of dollars to take that risk. It's so dangerous that, if you die, they just leave your body there. It's like riding Space Mountain and seeing trails of dead bodies from people who did not finish Space Mountain. This is something viewers will have to wrap their mind around while watching people fight for their lives. This isn't a plane crash; no one forced these people to climb the tallest mountain in the world. Their fight for survival was completely their own doing. For the 99% of us who will never climb Mount Everest, this new 3D Imax drama provides plenty of vividly illustrated reasons to keep it off our bucket list. In fact, watching this film is all the experience with Everest I will ever need. However there are quite a few good reasons to see this solid dramatisation of the 1996 disastrous trek of the world's tallest mountain.<br/><br/>First of all, the cast is rock-solid. Not knowing who survives and who doesn't beforehand, I did find myself rooting for characters, because they are real people. Including multiple characters sufficiently humanised to create real concern for their fates. With a gallery of individuals - some of whom are destined not to make it - you could say Everest is a disaster movie in the old Hollywood sense of the term, but it doesn't quite feel like one. And that's a good thing. The fact that some engaging, friendly Aussies are front and center as the main tour organisers and guides may account the competent, reassuring type you'd feel good entrusting yourself to on such an expedition. It's sometimes impossible to identify who's who under all the coats, hoods, goggles and masks. Moreover, Jason Clarke is an actor generally cast as the bad guy or hothead, but not here. His character, Rob Hall is the smart, capable, responsible professional. He has to enforce discipline and make his team of paying customers realise the dangers of doing something unnatural as scaling Everest. Plus, Josh Brolin's character becomes kind of a gag, masking real vulnerabilities. <br/><br/>You expect the movie to be centrally about Clarke & Gyllenhaal and their friendship or enmity, as they begin the film by having a tense conversation about approaching Krakauer and whether their rivals team should co-operate. But this idea disappears into the snow as well. Jake Gyllenhaal has a role which is surprisingly peripheral and small. The poster appeared to give him third-wheeling. It's hardly that. His star power means that fans and even non-fans alike will be waiting for him to save the day or fail to save the day in some interesting way - or do something, anything at all. Director did a very good job at keeping the action coherent and involving. Everest seems bigger and more complex than anything he's done before. In narrative terms it's a little messy - as true stories tend to be. The dramatic focus is split around half a dozen characters based on real people and it's not clear who we should root for, or why this exactly particular expedition went as wrong as it did compared to all others. Everest doesn't go in for cheap shots or sensation for sensation's sake. Remaining close to the women and men who get to the top of the world. beginning with the eye-popping, you-are-there visual techniques that make you feel glad that you're not actually up there with them. <br/><br/>Attention to realistic detail gives the film texture. Plus, In a way that is engagingly welcoming rather than just informational, the film provides an account of the 40-day- prep period. Where camaraderies develop, fear are exposed, anxieties and anticipation appear. The very fact that climbing Everest had become bu the second act of the film, if not simple, at least somewhat commonplace, is part of what led to the disaster that has been effectively condensed at the end. The second hour is devoted to the final ascent and its aftermaths, which is all quite intense. I also wonder if anyone will watch this movie and think to themselves ""You know what..? This looks great! I now want to climb this mountain and give it a shot!"" I would guess no but climbers are wired differently than I am. <br/><br/>Overall Everest is beautifully shot (one of the few times I'd recommend watching a movie in 3D) but despite its height this film doesn't quite delivers the edge-of-your- seat thrills that many were hoping for and all those moderately engaging characters means that there is no centrally powerful character."

","On a holiday in Nepal, I made two early morning attempts to fly over Mount Everest but, on each occasion, I reached no further than Kathmandu airport before the flight was cancelled due to averse weather over the mountains. So I need no convincing that climbing Everest is immensely hazardous, not just because of the terrain and height but because of the temperamental climate. In any event, I had already seen the 1998 IMAX film of the same name which depicts the same true events of 10-11 May 1996 when a record eight climbers were killed after a ferocious storm caught them near the summit.<br/><br/>This version of the disaster - which I saw in 3D - was shot by Icelandic director Baltasar Kormákur with the scenes on the lower slopes of Everest being shot on location and the replication of Camps 1-4 being filmed in the Dolomites in Italy. So the film looks authentic with great cinematography and some effective makeup and prosthetics, so the viewer is absolutely part of the action. The problem is that, with so many characters, so much body and facial clothing, and such appalling conditions, it is not always clear who we are looking at and what is happening.<br/><br/>If there is a central character, it is New Zealander Rob Hall (played by Australian Jason Clarke) who led an adventure group who faced crisis on the South Face, but this is a movie with some big-name actors - notably Jake Gyllenhaal and Josh Brolin - effectively in support roles. Perhaps necessarily, since the action is on the mountain, the wives at home have very small roles in spite of being portrayed by fine actresses (Keira Knightley sporting a Kiwi accent and Robin Wright). In the case of both the 1998 IMAX film and this new feature, for me the satellite call between Rob Hall and his pregnant wife Jan was simply heart-breaking.<br/><br/>Note: For 14 years, the events depicted in this film represented a record death toll on Everest. Yet, during the actual shooting of the work in Nepal in April 2014, a worst disaster occurred when an avalanche killed 16 people. Most of them were Nepalese Sherpas though, rather than Western climbers, so it is unlikely that we will ever see a feature film about their loss."

","Breathtakingly beautiful and immersive as few movies have been recently and nail bitingly tense. ""Everest"" is one of 2015's most pleasant surprises. A thriller that doesn't overdo it's true story and makes for one of those experiences where you will be stuck on the screen for two full hours be it for the tension or just for the magnificent photography.<br/><br/>This could have easily been a throw away film with some good imagery and maybe a couple of good moments, but actually the director cared about every aspect of the movie and with one of the most impressive casts of the year, which gives its all in an assemble of very committed and convincing performances, he made a film in which you get to know about ten or twelve characters very well, you relate and care about them, but most importantly every single one of them has a full fleshed arch, that you understand and empathize with. That is actually very, very difficult to do with so many characters. They don't obviously all have an arch worthy of a Michael Corleone, they aren't explored so deeply, but it is very remarkable to see a film treat so many characters so respectfully and balance them all out in two hours.<br/><br/>Yet easily the most impressive part of the film is the setting and the camera work. This is one of those very, very rare movies nowadays where I actually asked myself ""how the hell did they do that?"". This film feels real in ways that I couldn't even have imagined going in. Really this is as impressive as it gets. I kept asking myself how did the director achieve this, he made it actually look like they were truly climbing the Everest, he made you feel there in that mountain with the characters. It was amazing. The filmmakers really had an understanding of their geography and managed to bring the audience in and never, ever loose it. The combination of this and the characters really made for an experience that will be remembered.<br/><br/>Of course the movie has limits and I think it actually has set limits for itself. There isn't any superior storytelling or revolutionary techniques. The film knows what it is doing and does it perfectly, but it tells the story in a very conventional way. That is obviously perfectly fine, but don't excpet to come out from this film feeling your life has changed. It doesn't explore deeper themes that are only mentioned, it doesn't put a personal style on things. It also becomes very pushy with its true story material in the final note and may I say needlessly so. I really hate when movies do this. There is no absolute need to do it: shoving down your throat on the last thirty seconds an emotional punch that feels forced and unnecessary.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I was both moved and thrilled by the film, I really enjoyed it and had a blast in the theater, I really recommend to see this in the cinema even though I don't think it will be ever worth a rewatch."
"jmoneyjohal","7","0","0","25 September 2015"," A visually stunning film, but Everest has it's flaws.What could have been a epic film is still a great watch.
","The first thing that struck me in Everest was the films huge grandeur which was evident when one watches the trailer, and having a star cast which consists of Jake Gyllenhaal, Josh Brolin,Keira Knightley, is also a huge plus. However what the film ends up being in the end is what I call a ""spectacular mess"". Spectacular because the film has some of the best visuals I have ever seen on screen, whether it be the 3D or not, Mount Everest just looks so beautiful, at times one feels like that there actually at Everest. The films sound quality is also superb, I watching the film in a normal theatre, but it felt like I was seating in a IMAX theatre. However I call the film a mess because Everest being a human drama, at times has almost no emotional connect with the chrarcters,we hardly know anything about them excluding one or two characters, and the film has way too many characters to follow which gets confusing at times, but more on the positives and negatives later.<br/><br/>Story wise the film is about climbing the most deadly (read hardest)mountain ever created,Mount Everest. Many have climbed and succeed but 1 in 4 people who climb Mount Everest end up dying on the way. Everest was just not made to conquer. Everest therefore narrates the true story of how a man named Rob Hall, and Scott Fischer together tried to take there two groups of climbers to the top of Mount Everest and back. Rob we know had a wife, and a baby girl on the way. This expedition took place in 1996. Many groups from different countries tried to climb Mount Everest around the same time, but the film follows these two groups, because they were the only ones to make to the top successful. However when the groups starting coming down, a horrible storm hit them, how they handle the storm is what makes up the rest of the plot.<br/><br/>Acting wise from the whole plethora of actors only a couple make a impact in there act.The first being Jason Clarke who is in fine form,he wins your heart in the films 2nd half when he wouldn't leave Doug by himself, an amazing job.Josh Brolin is superb as Beck, and ones feels like clapping when he wakes up in the pre climax. Jake Gyllenhaal has a smaller role compared too the others actors, but he leaves a major impact, and performs well.<br/><br/>With a film like Everest one needs to feel for the characters, and for the most part thats not there, and with so many characters running around the film can get a little confusing at times. Also at the same time when Everest turns into a suspenseful film in the 2nd hour, one isn't clutching his seat enough, or feeling enough tension for a film of this calibre. But let me be brutally honest even though Everest is plagued with issues the film still succeeds in being a good film, I say this because I was cheering whenever a person made it safely to base camp from Everest. One feels like there watching hero's on screen. And like i mentioned earlier the film is made on lavish scale, the visuals, the sound, is some of the best I have seen in a film ever. You will be in awe of Mount Everest's beauty.<br/><br/>Overall all blemishes withstanding, I highly recommend you watch Everest because you have probably never seen a film so visually beautifully before, and most importantly the film talks about a true story of real life hero's who lost there lives while climbing Mount Everest, watch it for them to know there story.<br/><br/>I going with a very very nice 3.5/5* or 7/10"
"phd_travel","8","0","0","25 September 2015"," Spectacular cinematography and gripping story
","The photography and cinematography and effects are worth seeing on the big screen. Very realistic sense of being on the mountains and in the storms. Can almost feel the cold and the physical suffering. The story is gripping too. It gives an interesting look at the arduous journey - the practicalities and physical weaknesses encountered by the different climbers along the way.<br/><br/>The big name cast makes this interesting to watch. The spouses: the New Zealand accented Kiera Knightley to Texan accented Robin Wright. Emily Watson makes an unlikely but sympathetic base camp manager. Like Jason Clarke more after this role as expedition leader. Josh Brolin smiles a bit too much but at least he is easily recognizable. Jake Gyllenhaal is quite easy to identify even in the snow.<br/><br/>After watching this movie I do feel more sympathy for the climbers. Before I saw this movie I like many people felt climbers knew what they were getting into by taking such a risky venture etc. But while watching the movie I didn't feel that at all. In the end couldn't help feeling sorry for the pregnant wife left behind and the farewell phone call. Although it is entertainment maybe it will serve as a warning to people not to tempt fate doing dangerous things.<br/><br/>A couple of faults. The New Zealand or Aussie accents are unnecessarily strong. Maybe a more neutral accent would have sufficed. Didn't help that the wind was howling and snow blowing in many scenes. Half the dialog is not comprehensible. Another problem is it was a little difficult telling who was who with all their masks and hats on. The death of some of the characters could have been more clearly shown especially Jake Gyllenhaal's character and the Japanese woman.<br/><br/>Worth watching on the biggest screen you can find."

","First of all, bravo on the cinematography. This film has some of the best visuals i have ever seen on film and it really makes you feel like you are 29.029 feet up touching the highest point on earth. The IMAX experience was unlike anything i have ever seen. I was almost expecting to feel the cold wind in my seat as the group struggled for survival after their expedition goes very wrong. I would not be surprised if this film wins an Oscar for best cinematography. it was really that good. <br/><br/>The characters were a bit underdeveloped i thought with an exception of Jason Clarke and Josh Brolin who were the two standout performances for me. Sam Worthington was exceptional as well but with limited screen time. Jake Gyllenhaal was the biggest waste of a character since as far as i can remember. you knew his fate from the very first time you saw him and he was extremely under utilized. after all the main character was the mountain itself which got the most screen time. (not necessarily a bad thing)<br/><br/>I did not look up the story until after watching the movie because i didn't want anything ruined and while watching this movie i found it to be rather slow in getting the momentum going. Its really only the last 30-45 minutes of the movie where things get pretty intense. I was expecting Jason Clarke and Jake Gyllenhaal to team up and combine leadership skills and resources and fight back down the mountain but that does not happen at all. However the filmmakers did not stray too far from the actual story so i can't really knock the film for that as it is probably the most realistic portrayal of a disaster/survival story since ""The Impossible"" and some of the main characters deaths are pretty emotional. <br/><br/>overall it was a very enjoyable theater experience and i look forward to watching the bonus features on the blu ray a few months from now and seeing how this film was shot because it was absolutely stunning. 6.5/10"

","In this movie the players have an objective: climb a big hill. However, something bad happens along the way. That's the movie. Based on a true story, the original title was ""A Bunch of Gits With Too Much Time/Money Take on a Needless, Time-Consuming, Fruitless Task: Climb a Dangerous Hill."" More than a few times over the movie's 121 minutes you can catch the film's Nepalese players exchanging dry looks.<br/><br/>Without even seeing ""Everest,"" you know exactly how it's going to go. The ""team"" climbs the mountain, rubbing and blowing into their hands (lol) along the way, just to, you know, let you know it's an ordeal (or something) and, by and by, that ""bad thing"" I mentioned above happens. As I've learned from watching this movie, Mount Everest is, like, really quite tall, and the ice up there is *super* slippery in places. One of the team members slips and things quickly go pear-shaped. Commence even more grunting, gritted teeth, and long, long looks down the side of the mountain.<br/><br/>I'm sorry if I sound like Mr. Sourpuss, but I just really think there could have been something at the top of the mountain. They spend all that time getting there and all you see are little markers left by people *who have already climbed it.* It would've been nice if they got to the top and found an ogre. Or a dragon. Or maybe a giant robot! Wouldn't it have been cool if they got to the top and saw one of the robots from Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow? <br/><br/>But no. Not one lousy robot-- they couldn't have even given me that. Instead, one of the team (or two or whatever) slips on their way down, and that's what the second half of the movie is about. (The first half is about the way up, in case you were wondering.) <br/><br/>It's not all sub-par, however. It's nicely shot, the colours are beautiful, and the part where the Nepalese helicopter pilot (smirking the entire time) flies out from near the mountain's peak is pretty cool. But I just can't get beyond the fact that a.) the name ""Everest"" is being used in such sentimental Hollywood schlock, and b.) the conflict in this movie was entirely avoidable. Seriously, it's not like the cure for cancer or the next great Canadian novel was up there. Check out the motives of these people: the Japanese woman was doing it to be the oldest woman who's climbed the most mountains. Another guy was doing it because he's getting old and is feeling self conscious. I guess I just don't get their motivations, but to me, it's vanity. The closest thing you can have to a meaningful life is a productive life. Go give to charity or write a book instead, you pompous gits!<br/><br/>Early on, there's a scene where one character is climbing a slope (I know 99% of this movie is like that, but listen) and he slips momentarily. That wasn't acting-- that was an actual moment where the actor lost his balance and then righted himself. You'll see it and remember it too if you watch this. <br/><br/>That unscripted, half-second blip was the one authentic, unsentimental part of this movie. The rest... Hollywood dross."

","I saw ""Everest"", starring Jason Clarke-Terminator Genisys, White House Down; Josh Brolin-Guardians of the Galaxy, Planet Terror; Keira Knightley-The Imitation Game, Domino; Michael Kelly-Man of Steel, Law Abiding Citizen and Jake Gyllenhaal-Southpaw, Jarhead.<br/><br/>This is based on a true story. It's based on the book 'Into Thin Air', by Jon Krakaver, a reporter that went on the tragic climb. Everest is the world's tallest mountain, situated in Nepal. The story takes place in 1996, when lots of teams of climbers were making the treacherous climb, sometimes bumping into other teams or having to wait to cross a gorge. They also did it for different reasons; some, just to say they did it, others because it was a challenge. They were usually led by seasoned guides, such as Jason and Jake. Jason was always careful because he was married to Keira-if I was married to her, I don't think I would be climbing mountains-and she was expecting their first child, so he had something to come home to. Jake was careful but he also had a wild side to him where sometimes, he would tend to take chances. Michael plays Jon Krakaver, the reporter that wrote the book that the movie is based on and Josh is a Texan millionaire that is along for the kicks of climbing and just getting out of his boring home life. The shots of the mountains are breathtaking and made for viewing in IMAX-I saw it in IMAX 3D. The climb is very dangerous for beginners because of the weather and lack of oxygen-near the top is as high as the cruising altitude of a 747 airplane-so they have to carry extra oxygen tanks to use, not to mention the freezing temperatures. If you are not a professional climber, you might as well stay home. Not all of the climbers make it back alive and some of the ones that do have physical problems-one guy lost both hands and his nose to the cold temperatures and at one point, he was given up for dead before he came staggering into the base camp. It's rated ""PG-13"" for intense peril and disturbing images and has a running time of 2 hours and 1 minute. I don't know if I would buy it on DVD-one viewing was fine-but it would be a good rental."

","Inspired by the incredible events surrounding an attempt to reach the summit of the world's highest mountain, Everest documents the awe-inspiring journey of two different expeditions challenged beyond their limits by one of the fiercest snowstorms ever encountered by mankind. Their mettle tested by the harshest elements found on the planet, the climbers will face nearly impossible obstacles as a lifelong obsession becomes a breathtaking struggle for survival. The epic adventure stars Jason Clarke, Josh Brolin, John Hawkes, Robin Wright, Michael Kelly, Sam Worthington, Keira Knightley, Emily Watson and Jake Gyllenhaal.<br/><br/>I have seen many IMAX and/or 3D films in my time. For most of those films, I have found IMAX to be more of a gimmick. First of all, it is expensive, and second of all, it rarely adds anything to the overall experience. I would say that the last time I've seen a film appropriately using IMAX/3D was the space movie Gravity which came out in 2013. It was my best film of 2013. I think that Everest is the first film I've seen since then that has used IMAX and 3D appropriately in that I thought it added to the overall experience more than took away from it. So if you haven't figured it out already, I saw this film in IMAX. I thought it really captured what it would be like in a mountain. You can feel the height and depth of the mountain, all of the different types of terrain, and the difficult weather these people had to face which helps us as viewers understand what these people had to go through. Yes this film is based on a true story of two rival expeditions trying to reach the summit of Mount Everest back in 1996. Despite the fact that the film is based on a true story, there were some moments that did feel a little silly for me but these were minor. I also felt the plot did move a little to slowly for my liking but I did enjoy the buildup because of the cinematography encompassing beautiful shots of Nepal and the mountains (which were probably not the real Everest), and the good acting of everyone involved as they were mostly all even for me. The exception to that is that of Robin Wright as Josh Brolin's character Beck Weathers's wife Peach as I was not a fan of her bad Texan accent. But luckily we did not get to see too much of that as most characters' backstory were never really explored other than the main character Rob Hall (Jason Clarke) and his wife/girlfriend (I was never really sure of that) Jan Arnold (Kiera Knightley). Most of the film takes place on the mountain (and the surrounding area) as it should but I would have liked to have known more about the other characters other than during a montage at the end. Overall, there isn't too much excitement to be had but it was definitely nice to look at (I'm not sure if it would look as good not in IMAX/3D) and the acting and special effects did keep me engaged.<br/><br/>Score: 7/10 keithlovesmovies.com"

","First the good: The film had many captivating scenes of high alpine environs. The film makers did a good job portraying the rigors of contemporary mountain climbing, even if most of the high alpine footage was actually filmed 10,000 feet lower than suggested in the film.<br/><br/>Now the bad: The characters in the film were utterly unlikeable. These folks were no Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay let alone Charles Bruce and George Mallory. Unlike early climbers, these TOURISTS had all the amenities they could dream of: lots of technical and logistical support, pre-set paths, experienced guides, etc. etc. How heroic is that? Furthermore they were all full of pomp and attitude, especially the men. The line ""100% Texan, here"" still rings painfully in my ears. I found myself rooting against the men on several occasions, especially near the end. <br/><br/>Now to address the elephant in the room. HOW IS IT THAT THE FIRST MAJOR FILM ABOUT AN ASCENT TO EVEREST WAS ABOUT THESE IDIOTS? <br/><br/>Please, somebody, make a proper film about climbing Everest, such as the ill- fated 1924 British Everest expedition. These were REAL explorers, not the guided tourists from this pathetic film. There is even wide speculation that the 1924 climbers, Bruce and Mallory, were actually the first to reach the summit, something films like to explore. They didn't have much technical and logistical support, and were reliant on early 20th century technology. Unlike the characters in this film, their story is actually interesting."

","Very impressive technically, well enough acted given the difficulty of making any kind of mark when there are so many characters, and nowhere near as badly written as I'd anticipated, this is a solid movie that tells of an episode in the existence of a mountain.<br/><br/>The huge scale of the scenery is pitted against the puniness of the humans. As the cast make their way over bottomless crevasses and veer far too near the edge of the next ridge, it does get genuinely scary from time to time. The action sequences are skillfully filmed and edited, and definitely worth experiencing in 3D and big sound.<br/><br/>Those are the plus points. The minuses are to do with the compromises required to fit the story into the tight shoes of commercial cinema. It's not just a matter of clunky exposition. It's the presence of big name actors who, excellent as they all are (and I am a real fan of Jake Gyllenhaal) inevitably stand out as faces against their lesser known colleagues. They can't help but turn EVEREST into one of those all-star disaster movies like THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE or THE TOWERING INFERNO. I think it would have been better not to have the stars. They militate against the true-to-life, in memoriam aspect of the film."

","Everest centers the story of the three group of hikers climbing to the peak of Mt. Everest. The movie however struggles getting an exact focus among this high number of main characters, but of course, it's all essential, it's just told in a totally straightforward way based on the accounts of this true story. And when things go wrong, the movie portrays their struggle really effective. The scenes capture the terror in Mother Nature and also the characters' fight pushing against their limits. There isn't much to be found in its thematic side, but when it comes to the experience, it gets real interesting.<br/><br/>There is too much characters to look after and the film keeps taking turns to which to focus. Not saying this is bad since it is following the true story, but there isn't much consistency, even if it tries its hardest to squeeze all of these characters for a heavy first half of their personal exposition. It tries to put in some thrilling moments, but of course it keeps messing off its momentum. These scenes are definitely not time wasting, it did help making up for the next half of the film which makes the hopeless scenes more compelling. The movie is better handled when it's pure in suspense, having this supposedly victorious accomplishment a darker fate afterwards.<br/><br/>And it's all about the depiction of how difficult to deal with this environment. We see the hikers slowly fall apart, having their bodies get bad effects from the extreme cold, with the storm keeping them from any absolute control. It's all survival through this weather and environment, while their loved ones are nearly helpless below. It's a downright compelling examination of how things go wrong even with tough strategies already planned at the very start. The cinematography is astonishing and the visuals are impressively lifelike, you could really buy that these people are really at the top of this mountain. The acting is what really made these characters beyond than just details. Jason Clarke, Josh Brolin, John Hawkes and Jake Gyllenhaal made a lot out of their roles; both as characters and as people struggling in the mountain.<br/><br/>Everest is thankfully as simple as it is; it's basically just showing us that climbing to this mountain is just plain dangerous, nothing more and nothing less; no matter how big your dreams are or how daring you can be, there's always consequences to deal with in this harsh, cold environment. Is it inspiring and life changing? Maybe, or maybe not. It's complicated, but it depicts these challenges at the right ways. Yes, the first half is still tough to sit through unless you have the keen focus, but when things get in trouble, the experience is just ultimately compelling. And if you are seeking nothing more than a bunch of people trying to survive Mt. Everest, then you'll definitely get what you've expected. You'll get the fortitude and remorse towards their journey, and I believe that's enough to make it worth achievement."

This song is from a movie Kabhi Kushi Kabhi Gam which was released in the year 2001. But the everest disaster happened in 1996. five years before initial release of song.

","Icelander Baltasar Kormákur, whose career starts with 101 REYKJAVIK (2000), is another European talent recruited by Hollywood, after two mediocre Mark Wahlberg's star vehicles CONTRABAND (2012) and 2 GUNS (2013), his latest is an ambitious USA, UK and Iceland co-production retells the story of 1996 Mount Everest disaster, and it just opened this year's Venice film festival, and now a 3D format arrives in the local multiplex.<br/><br/>One initial question (for me at least) is what compels the climbers to engage themselves in such a perilous enterprise (especially those who are not up to the challenge)? The film only delves into it superficially, the central expedition team is called Adventure Consultants, lead by New Zealander expert mountaineer Rob Hall (Clarke), who shepherds his eight clients to climb Everest, among which there are two prominent participants: Beck Weathers (Brolin), an American amateur who states that depression is cloaking him like a black cloud, only through climbing, he can get that behind, as frank as he is, it is just typical escapist strategy; another one is Doug Hansen (Hawkes), a middled-aged mailman, a plain newbie in the game, but what he pursues is the populist American dream, to prove even an everyday man can achieve an extraordinary feat like that (with a discount on the fee being the key precondition), even though (as the film tells us), it will not only cost his life and unwittingly but detrimentally with the expense of other two pros who could have survived the calamity. Therefore, both cases are not wholesome to encourage amateurs to follow suit.<br/><br/>One can detect Kormákur's resolution to tell the story as authentic as possible, employs an ensemble cast to introduce at least two-dozens real-life characters (which means it is rather tough to recognise each of them in the end of the day), tones down the hyped catastrophic spectacles and allows the formidable nature being the invisible but merciless executor, human lives are really so puny in the face of it. Curbed by the real-event boundaries and out of the respect (or avoidance of legal litigation) to those who are still with us, it is understandable but also pitiful that Kormákur doesn't dare to venture into a darker side of what-is-really-going-on in the expedition on the human side - especially the clash with other teams and whether the tragedy could be avoided, say, if the team hadn't wasted their precise time waiting for ropes to be installed en route, or the sloppy weather forecast should also hold partial responsibility? - and whitewashes the personal schism among them. The only exception is Robin Wright's Peach, Weather's wife, during her brief scenes on the phone, betrays a relatively complex inner struggle could have thickened the plot, she is incredibly subtle in her discontent when Beaches calls her to confirm his adventure, and singles out an almost undetectable mixed feeling when she receives two life-changing phone calls, one informs Beck's demise and a later one about his miraculous survival. Whereas the rest of the bulky cast are either banally one-note (Knightley and her snot cannot save the thankless pregnant wife stereotype) or doesn't allot enough screen time to a thorough moulding, and you have Gyllenhaal, the most inspiring and versatile leading man in the Hollywood, in the line-up as Scott Fischer, the inexplicably suicide-inclining leader of another expedition group, clearly is the most interesting character, yet, Kormákur lets him slide into a man of no importance, this is unforgiven. Nevertheless it is delightful to see Emily Watson, who plays Helen Wilton, the base camp manager, is given a sizable role to be the direct emotional barometer of the situations, she is perfect, although it is not a big stretch from her under-utilised mother typecast in her recent filmography, after all she is the surrogate mother of all the group members.<br/><br/>Great effort has been deployed to lend viewers a vicarious feeling to witness the stunning scenery which can only be admired by the privileged few, however it also makes the problematic character-development a more rueful decision, the film has all that required for a viscerally compelling adventurer, the authentically-looking landscape, the grand SFX, a capable cast headlined by Clarke, a late bloomer to the leading-man-ship, why shortchange all the assets with a compromising narrative under the pretence of the faux-documentary approach? What a cowardly missed opportunity!"
"FelixMater","Null","0","0","21 September 2015"," What an amazing story
","This film was special to me. And watching it was an experiment for me. I have read all the reports of the eyewitnesses. And when you dig you can find that almost every person that climbed Everest in 1996 has written a book about what happened. Most interesting to me was that every single person had an own view on it. And as things went wrong - terribly wrong and ended in chaos everyone had an own truth. Some blamed each other - some blamed the nature, or the mountain. Most of them blamed the climber and adventure business and some came to a catharsis point of view on it.<br/><br/>Knowing all those stories, the shared emotions and views i was very interested how someone can adapt this complex story into a film. Is this even possible? I was sure that i will be disappointed at the end as i was sure that it's impossible to fit such a complex story in 121 minutes.<br/><br/>So i went to a blockbuster cinema, bought the obligated pop corn and put on the 3D glasses. In the end i went out and had the following in my mind: wow: 3D is really amazing. Maybe it has even more effect when i don't take seat in the 11th row. Maybe the 5th would be better. Some really great shots from the mountains of the great Himalaya. Some amazing and really good made Spezial effects that gives an impression of the storms. Really good actor performance and i also liked the cast.<br/><br/>But, well, the story. I think it must be really difficult to tell a story that was designed by reality and that is so complex. Krakauer really did that job. Even if we can blame Krakauer for his blaming against Anatoli Boukreev, even when we don't agree with all his point. His book ""In the Thin Air"". is the best source for getting an overview to the whole story.<br/><br/>What else is to say? Well, the film was Okay. Nice film - but the story is just too big for a single movie."

","This movie was the first I have seen in IMAX 3D and will be the last. I had noticed in previous 3D films that the camera focus on the central shot of the scene is brilliant, but it washes out all the background and peripheral into a blur.<br/><br/>Well, this would have been a majestic film full of incredible shots if it had NOT been ruined by this fact of 3D. Perhaps not everyone feels this way about 3D, but everyone in my group of 6 that went left with headaches, eyestrain, and disappointment.<br/><br/>I know personally two people who have climbed Everest, and they say it is a harrowing life changing experience. This story is very well told, and reflects much of the challenge realistically. One thing it did miss though, the environmental problems at base camp. Base camp in reality is a trash heap, unlike most US National Parks and Forests which require backpackers to pack out what they pack in... the Everest base camp is a pit of garbage, The film makes one tiny reference to this when a character picks up a few items of discarded litter.<br/><br/>The story itself reflects the great and sometimes tragic conflict between personal ambition and common sense. Climbing Everest was a lifelong goal for these people. One that entailed great risk. But when faced with the choice between failure and death, personal ambition led some to choose the course which led to death. And the real tragedy is that others then died trying to help them achieve their goal, or trying to save them. There are no villains in this story, except perhaps the dangers of Everest, but there were several heroes. This movie is well worth seeing, but if you aren't really into 3D, see it in regular format."

","Well, the movie is a real life story without any external ingredients added to it to make it more interesting, which is the best part of the movie. Well shot and directed. Everest, the peak, has been shot beautifully. Best to watch it in 3D. As the climbing proceeds in stages, each stage has been shown in a distinct manner, such that one can enjoy each and every step of climbing Everest. Every emotion has been captured perfectly. Sometimes it becomes spooky for the people who are unaware of the risks on such slopes. But that is the thrilling part. The way deaths are filmed couldn't have been better. Everest is the dream of every mountaineer, whether be a trekker or the one who do expeditions, and this movie is the perfect treat for the one. Such a Nostalgia!!"
"david-fisher26","1","2","5","30 January 2020"," Absolutely no sympathy
","That idiot who said that he climbed Everest 'because it was there' should have been jeered to the rafters rather than being emulated for ever more. Was it in the way of some proper goal? Did he not know that the Earth, to scale, is as smooth as a billiard ball? Climbing Everest is a task fit for a microbe. But it is all part of the macho game; the same game that drives many people to go to war just so that they can forever hold their heads high in the camp bars of the future. This film is all the more irritating because groups of blind, disabled and other minority groups have made the ascent successfully; why focus on failures who started out with every advantage? Moaning about the deaths of these moronic show-offs somehow demeans the very concept of tragedy."

","This is my review for Everest the film about climbing Mount Everest in case you didn't know this review is spoiler free.<br/><br/>Plot: Robert Hall was a mountaineer who went on the most dangerous voyage a man could take he decides to climb Everest, where the unexpected can happen the mountain really takes it's toll on the mountaineers.<br/><br/>This heroic biopic can really play with your heart strings but not in all ways this film isn't what I thought it was but I enjoyed it. There is wonderful acting form the main cast member Jason Clark (Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Terminator Genisys)who plays Robert Hall. There isn't really much character introduction but I think the film was trying to get to the best bits really fast, in other films I would hate that but didn't in this one.<br/><br/>This film has quite a lot of stars in it Josh Brolin (Sicario), Jake Gylenhall (Southpaw), Sam Worthington (Avatar) and Michael Kelly (The Adjustment Burau. The lack of story of the characters is slightly annoying but you can get over that. I think this film should at least be mention in the Oscars in my opinion.<br/><br/>Overall this is a very brave and enjoyable that needs a little more attention. 9/10 a mountain of a film, must watch."
"adhikari-18644","10","2","5","18 October 2015"," Well researched and made !!!
","I just got home, and literally two hours ago, I was standing from my seat as the credits for ""Everest"" rolled up in theater, clapping with other audiences. The memory of the movie is still fresh in my mind, and coming out of theater was like coming out of an extravagant expedition of the highest mountain in the world, Sagarmatha (Mt. Everest).<br/><br/>The first thing that impressed me was the photography or cinematography. When the crew lands on airport and tour the city of Kathmandu, the camera movement is done in such a brilliant manner that a Kathmandu resident like myself keeps on wondering - ""Is this really my city?"". But the real deal comes when they reach near Sagarmatha. Sagarmatha. The way the mountains are shown, it makes us feel we are really in the place. Then is the actual itinerary to the Everest summit. One has to pass through 4 camps, including the base camp to reach the top. And the writers of the movie has made sure that they get the location and terrain of these camps as close to real as possible. The scenery captured by the camera is wonderful, however, the story adds a cherry to the top. The brilliant story telling technique resulted in an emotional reception. The happiness in the people's face, and the way they reacted and they were shown by the camera, will be the scene I shall never, ever forget (Like the scene of Rose and Jack from Titanic). <br/><br/>I recommend this movie to everyone out there who are impressed with great visual in cinema."

"virek213","10","2","5","25 September 2015"," EVEREST--The World's Tallest Mountain...And The Most Unforgiving, As Well
","No mountain on Earth is taller than Mount Everest. Straddling the border between Nepal and China, in the Himalayas, it rises to a height of 29,028 feet above sea level, near the median height of where most commercial aircraft actually fly, and is perpetually covered in snow and ice even in the summer. While expeditions have tried to reach this lofty summit from either side, it was Edmund Hillary and his Nepalese sherpa climber Tenzing Norgay that made the first successful ascent to and descent from the Everest massif. Since then, dozens upon dozens of expeditions have made the trek up this dangerous mountain; and of all of them, an average of one out of four people have perished. One such incident that caused the deaths of several climbers was one that occurred on May 11, 1996, and which had been documented by Jon Krakauer, one of the participants in that ascent/descent of Everest, in his book ""Into Thin Air"". That same incident (though not adapted from that book) is also depicted in the 2015 film EVEREST.<br/><br/>Filmed in IMAX 3-D, the film involves the group of expeditionaires, led by Rob Hall (Jason Clarke), who made the trek up the southeast slope of the mountain during what was, relatively speaking, the best time of the year, mid-spring. But Everest is not exactly a forgiving mountain, not in the ascent and certainly not on the descent, even in the best of conditions, because, even with base camps scattered along the approach, the air becomes considerably thinner as the altitude increases, and the weather can change sometimes within a matter of hours, if indeed not minutes. This is what the 1996 expedition, which included Krakauer (here portrayed by John Kelly), encountered. While many of them manage to get to the 29,028-foot summit with its icy, top-of-the-world view, on the way down, a monsoonal storm roars in off of the Indian Ocean and, as it ascends the Himalayas, envelopes the expeditionaires in an epic blizzard two thousand feet below the summit. Frantic efforts to rescue everyone, including an ambitious Texas climber (Josh Brolin), end in a wash; and by the time all is said and done, eight of them have died on the mountain, two of whose bodies are never recovered. Clarke is among those eight fatalities.<br/><br/>Icelandic director Baltasar Kormakur, working from an original screenplay by William Nicholson (GLADIATOR) and Simon Beaufoy (127 HOURS), shot a great deal of Everest in the Italian Alps, as well as on-location scenes in Nepal, not far from where the real Mount Everest is. In doing so, he captured a great deal of the sub-zero cold, treacherous climbing and weather conditions, and the frequent instability of the mountain itself (huge avalanches caused by the weight of thousands of tons of snow piled on). Actors like Brolin, Jake Gyllenhaal, Sam Worthington, and John Kelly (the latter portraying Krakauer) do a great deal of depicting the cockiness of their real-life counterparts prior to the start of the expedition, a cockiness that soon gives way to a stoicism amidst a very nightmarish white reality when the weather turns deadly just below the top of the world. In complete contrast to many previous films of this sort, there is no attempt by either Kormakur, Nicholson, or Beaufoy to melodramatize or make this story more exciting according to Hollywood standards; the facts themselves, and the physical details of the thing are plenty exciting enough, and, above all else, frequently terrifying.<br/><br/>Just the physical attributes of this film alone, not just in the ascent and descent but also in the frequent changes in the mountain's stability, and the often crazy weather that can envelope both it and those that climb it, is enough to make EVEREST one of the most challenging and grueling films of any kind made so far in the 21st century. Instead of just being another high-octane action thriller with a lot of explosions and migraine-inducing sound-and-fury, EVEREST is a hugely entertaining and incisive docudrama, and one of the best films of 2015."
"mrcibubur","9","2","5","24 September 2015"," An amazing and gripping edge of your seat real Life Drama
","Like everyone else, I had waited many months for this film to come out and I was not disappointed when I got my chance to watch it this afternoon with my wife and four year old Son. Yes, I took him along too and he loved the helicopter scene towards the end but the sound effects were a little bit too loud and overpowering at times (for him at least).<br/><br/>I am hugely interested in the story of Everest ascent from an educational and scientific standpoint. I am no mountaineer or climber and I am in total awe of anyone who attempts such a challenge.<br/><br/>The film successfully tells the story of what happened to the eight people who died on the mountain in this 1996 tragedy. I agree with many of the other posters about the negatives. Sherpas are very much a part of the Everest story and they are hardly featured. Also the heights relative to getting to Everest did not seem relative to the 'Mother of the Sky' but maybe that was impossible to achieve.<br/><br/>Criticism has been directed at one or two of the actresses, notably Keira Knightley. She had very much a supporting role and overall she acted well. It seems unjust to criticise for the role she played.<br/><br/>I also got confused with many of the characters as the guys all had bushy beards, were of course heavily clothed and it was not easy to know who was who.<br/><br/>They tried to address in group discussion as to why people like these mountaineers are motivated to climb Everest and I think this was very relevant indeed.<br/><br/>No doubt all the filming was done prior to the Nepal earthquake in April 2015. Do we know if the original Everest Base Camp site was used for the movie? Not sure it is relevant yes or no.<br/><br/>The first half an hour was an excellent starter for the main story to come on the mountain itself.<br/><br/>Two hours of afternoon entertainment, though of course, it is a story of heroes and villains in a sense because I have to wonder whether an actual weather forecast was communicated to the climbers at any appropriate time which might have changed some of the decisions made and averted many if not all of the dangers, given the severity of the blizzard which, according to the story in the film, struck at least twice.<br/><br/>Tremendously well directed, the cinema effects of the films were simply stunning and the actors clearly put great endeavour into their character portrayal."
"Anurag-Shetty","9","2","5","20 September 2015"," An emotional & poignant true tale, that doesn't exaggerate any details.
","Everest recounts the actual events that take place during 1996, when two separate teams led by Rob Hall(Jason Clarke) & Scott Fischer(Jake Gyllenhaal), attempt to scale Mount Everest. To accomplish this near impossible feat, Rob & Scott have to work together. That is the only way they can successfully complete their ascent & descent of Mount Everest. However, they face several adversities along the way, including a fierce snow storm. <br/><br/>Everest is a visually stunning & great film. The beauty of Mount Everest & the various dangers that await you when you climb the highest mountain in the world, have been portrayed beautifully by director Baltasar Kormakur & cinematographer Salvatore Totino. The 3D has been put to great use for the most part of the movie but, during the many emotional moments of the film, the 3D doesn't add anything. I recommend you to watch it in IMAX 3D, instead of regular 3D like I did. Apparently in the IMAX version, you feel like you are with the climbers on their perilous adventure. The first half of the movie can be a little slow but, the second half makes up for it. I loved the fact that the makers of the film, don't exaggerate anything that happened during that time in 1996. It truthfully portrays the happy times & the sad times that the climbers face on Mount Everest. Jason Clarke is brilliant as Rob Hall. Josh Brolin is spectacular as Beck Weathers. John Hawkes is great as Doug Hansen. Robin Wright is superb as Peach Weathers. Emily Watson is effective as Helen Wilton. Keira Knightley is outstanding as Jan Arnold. Sam Worthington is impressive as Guy Cotter. Martin Henderson, Naoko Mori, Michael Kelly & Elizabeth Debicki are good as Andy 'Harold' Harris, Yasuko Namba, Jon Krakauer & Caroline Mackenzie respectively. Last but not the least, Jake Gyllenhaal is awesome, in the limited screen time he's given, as Scott Fischer. Everest is a must watch on the big screen. A truly magnificent experience!"
"bartonj2410","8","2","5","19 September 2015"," Stunning and immersive cinematic experience that takes you to the top of Everest
","Remember when the IMAX format was used sparingly? There would only be a select few films a year released in the said format but now it seems to have become a bit of a gimmick. Many films released in IMAX screens nowadays don't take full advantage of the format and use it as a ploy to make more money.<br/><br/>Then there are films like Everest. <br/><br/>Everest is more of an experience as opposed to just a film, along the same lines as Gravity. While it doesn't reach the same heights as Gravity, Everest makes full use of the larger image and sharper sound that the IMAX format offers.<br/><br/>In 1996, a climbing expedition, led by Rob Hall (Jason Clarke), aimed to reach the summit of Mount Everest. Often regarded as one of the most dangerous places on the planet, Everest takes no prisoners; a fact we are made well aware of before the film even gets going.<br/><br/>When a severe snow storm hits the mountain while Hall and his party are on their way down from the summit, they face a monumental challenge to stay alive. The brutality of Mother Nature certainly takes its toll however, it also brings out the one thing that every human possesses; the natural instinct to survive.<br/><br/>Everest is by no means a classic but it is a powerful example of how spectacle and narrative can be combined to great effect. We all know just how big Everest is but through Salvatore Totino's cinematography and some well executed shots, the sheer scale of the mountain becomes something else entirely. The mountain is brought to life in the film as one of the most beautiful and scary places on Earth.<br/><br/>As expected nowadays, the special effects are flawless and on an IMAX screen, Everest looks stunning. The brilliant sound editing adds to a totally immersive experience for the audience.<br/><br/>At the heart of Everest and amidst all the glorious visuals is a moving story about survival with a well written screenplay from William Nicholson and Simon Beaufoy. They avoid turning Everest into your usual cheesy disaster movie which may be down to the fact that this is based on a true story and there were fatalities.<br/><br/>Each and every one of the cast delivers a good performance and no one lets the film down in any way. I thought Jason Clarke, Josh Brolin and Emily Watson were the best of the bunch and was surprised to see Jake Gyllenhaal play a smaller part in proceedings than I initially thought he would. Robin Wright and Keira Knightley too have small roles but they both sell it as the wives at home waiting to hear news on their husbands.<br/><br/>Everest is quite an intense ride that pushes the IMAX format to its absolute limits. Stunning visuals and solid performances make it a film you have to see on the biggest screen possible and definitely one of the best films to involve mountain climbing, better than Vertical Limit anyway."

","Why, oh why, would you want to do it? Climbing Mount Everest sounds like a pointless exercise and before I sat down to a film where the outcome is a foregone conclusion, I remember the countless people that have asked me why I do the things that I do. At the end of the day we all want to feel as though we are alive and that our existence on earth hasn't gone unnoticed. Our need to achieve the impossible far outweighs the risks and dangers to the extent that we are willing to die for personal glory. It's more than the thrill and the story. It's about feeding our soul the very thing that it yearns for, whether it be climbing Everest, jumping out of a plane or leaping off a bridge. Some of us can ignore the impulses and others just have to see them through.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin's character, Beck Weathers, explains his state of depression when he is away from the climb and that the only cure is for him to be chasing the outrageous adventure. John Hawkes character, Doug Hansen tells of his commitment to show his children that an ordinary man can achieve extraordinary things. Whatever the reason, everybody has something that drives them to make the trek up 'the most dangerous place on earth', but the mountain will always have the last word.<br/><br/>You have to remember when watching this movie that the star is Everest itself with a memorable supporting role by Mother Nature. These two gigantic characters determine who will survive and who will meet their demise. Along for the ride are antipodeans, Jason Clarke(Rob Hall), Sam Worthington(Guy Cotter) and Elizabeth Debicki (Caroline MacKenzie). Throw in the likes of Jake Gyllenhaal, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson and the film has a formidable line-up worthy of conquering the greatest challenges the famous peak can throw at them.<br/><br/>Being based on the true event that happened in May, 1996, we know that lives were lost and the physical, mental and emotional cost that it had on the survivors will live with them forever. The story centres around two climbing teams that fatefully join together because of the popularity of the expeditions that had marshaled at base camp that year. They make the enormous trek to the peak only to find that on their descent down the mountain, a sudden storm does its best to wipe them from the face of the earth. I am unfamiliar with Baltasar Kormakur's work but I believe that he has successfully been able to take the audience right onto the mountain with inspiring views and scaled shots of the climbers against the backdrop of a harsh and unforgiving terrain. You get the opportunity to see just how small the individual is, putting into perspective the near impossible odds that a human faces when he or she decides to ascent such a structure. Not all shots of Everest are in fact taken in the Himilayas with some scenes coming from mountain terrains in Italy but the audience cannot deny the spectacle that unfolds before their eyes.<br/><br/>Kormakur does an outstanding job delivering a film that will keep the viewer on the edge of their seat. Many scenes can become confronting and uncomfortable to watch as we see the characters fighting for their very lives. The authentic nature of their struggle makes you live in hope that just once, the director will deviate from the true life story and produce a film with a happy ending, but this is where the film has the most impact. The cast give everything they can with a narrative that is limited and an outcome that is already known. I was on the edge of my seat watching the tragedies unfold and was genuinely left heartbroken by the nature of some characters endings.<br/><br/>'Everest' is a must in 3D to truly appreciate the magnitude of this harrowing event."

I know. I was amazed to find a single disaster movie which couldn't be described like that. However, I came across 'Everest' – a filmed based on an ill-fated expedition to the titular mountain back in the nineties. The team of climbers was left in a pretty bad way after a freak avalanche and what followed was a harrowing tale of human versus the elements as they tried to survive in one of the most inhospitable environments in the world. I have to say that I was quite optimistic. I'd watched similar films in the past like 'Alive' and thoroughly enjoyed them, plus 'Everest' boasted a cast which included Jake Gyllenhaal, Josh Brolin and the latest 'John Connor' from that 'Terminator' movie which no one apart from me liked.<br/><br/>However, despite my optimism I was left with a feeling that this film was nothing I hadn't seen before. A team climbs Everest. They get stuck. They have to survive and get back down. I knew that going into the film so I suppose I can hardly claim to be disappointed about what I got, as I got exactly that. No more, no less. Everything about the film can be summed up in a single sentence.<br/><br/>I don't know what I was expecting, obviously just more than was on offer. Yes, the actors were predictably sufficient in their respective roles and the scenery (filmed in picturesque mountains with epic views – don't know whether it was technically filmed on Mount Everest or not, but it was suitable to fool a geographical novice like me!) was truly magnificent. However, there just wasn't that much to keep me interested. I know it was a true-to-life story, so they hardly bring in a fleet of alien spaceships with death-rays, but there just wasn't much there to keep me interested.<br/><br/>I also have a problem with certain war films where soldiers are basically all dressed alike. I find it quite difficult to tell one actor from another. Here it's a similar problem as they're all wrapped up so tightly to protect themselves against the harsh elements (not to mentions porting full facial beards making identification even harder!) it made telling who's who quite hard sometimes.<br/><br/>I certainly didn't hate the film. The quality of acting talent on offer and the great filming locations made it just about worth sitting through. However, when a film can be summed up in one sentence I just feel it doesn't offer (a) much in the way of shocks or surprises or (b) little when it comes to making me want to sit through its two-hour run-time again. Pity, but only the once. Maybe I'm now so brainwashed by Marvel-style movies that I can't appreciate a film that doesn't involve Optimus Prime smashing his way through New York with a battleaxe for an arm."

","The movie is a sad story of the disaster than took place on an Everest expedition of a adventure guide group of about 20 people. The movie does a good job of highlighting the thrill, the motivation of those who dare to venture and the dangers associated therein.<br/><br/>The dialogues are few. The one I would have liked more on was the motivation part. Would have liked to get into the minds of these people, being an amateur enthusiast myself. <br/><br/>It is hard to make out from movie if it tries to make any point. Perhaps it does not. It just present the drama of the disaster without any life lessons one might be looking for.<br/><br/>I found the movie lacking a bit in terms of depth. Was hard for me to feel the sorrow at the happening of disaster, and I am emotional one."

","I am very surprised reading bad reviews about Everest. What did you expect it to be then? I sincerely did enjoy watching Everest. Also because it's based on a true story, what makes it even better to feel the despair they had at the end. It amazes me people would pay so much money to live an experience like that, where your life is at risk all the time. Okay it's a great achievement once you've done it, but I'd rather spend that money on a lazy sunny vacation trip. The fact is the top of the Everest is a graveyard with bodies of people that tried this expedition. The movie shows perfectly how hard it must be to climb the Everest. The lack of oxygen, the altitude, the sudden change of weather, it's all too much for a normal human body. The movie itself is beautifully shot, with good actors, a lot of tragedy. I didn't get bored for one second watching this movie. It keeps you on edge the whole time, because you can feel the courage and determination it takes to climb that mountain. Good movie if you ask me. Would watch it again in the future."

","This film tells the story of a group of mountaineers who attempts to climb to the summit of the mighty Mount Everest. They encounter a severe snow storm while descending, and their supplies of oxygen runs low, creating a disastrous situation.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty much predictable just from looking at the poster, but fortunately the visuals make it a great film to watch. The mountain landscape is stunning. There are plenty of perilous situations that are life threatening. The constant cliff hanging makes my adrenaline soar, and my palms sweat most of the time during the film! The scene of a Rob talking on the phone with his wife is very touching, because I do feel for Rob's character. However, there are many characters in the film that are poorly developed, such as the Japanese mountaineer, and I don't know much about them to care about them. If the film makes us care for many of the characters, the film would have been a sure tear jerker."
"spookydudedh","5","1","2","27 February 2016"," Just disappointing
","I watched this movie going in thinking that I was going to see a heroic and nail-biting story about some climbers making it back down the highest mountain in the world during a storm. Now, I might have had high expectations, but that doesn't excuse how bad the story of this movie was. Now, I realize that it is a true story, but I don't understand why they made it a movie. Rob, (a character) for example. The whole movie was building him up, seeing his relationship with his wife, the other climbers, and the mountain. You think, ""This guy will lead everyone to safety!"". They even show him instructing the other climbers, which, from the start, usually tells you that they know what they are doing. But, some of the last scenes he is in, shows him running out of oxygen, barely able to talk. Then they let him talk to his wife to help motivate him. They talk for a bit, say they love each other, then they stop. He then dies. Its not a heroic death either, not trying to disrespect him, may he rest in peace, but from a storytelling point of view its just so sudden. Why get you emotionally attached to this character if they die without much of a fight? They didn't make it seems like he was going to die, he seemed OK. Multiple others die as well, such as a guy, Doug I think, who planted a flag for elementary school kids, to help motivate them to follow their dreams, he died by falling off the edge, presumably so rob wouldn't have to risk his life to come back for him. He was OK, we learned his motives, got somewhat attached, then felt sad for his death. And the whole story as a whole is bad. They climb up, have problems, make it, then climb down. Like 4 people died on the way down, and then it ends. I had no idea who was who on the way down, with the masks, and the snow, it was just hard to tell. This make me wonder, ""Wait, who just died? Wait did that one guys make it?"" Overall, it's a pretty nice movie, but with a bad plot. Visuals are AMAZING, tensions are high, and it took risks. But the plot was boring. You only get attached to a couple characters, and it reached climax, falling action, but no resolution."
"tomsview","8","1","2","10 February 2016"," Because it's
","This film strips away much of the mystique about climbing Mount Everest. It's about the ill-fated 1996 attempt to climb the mountain, when 20 teams lined up to hit the top of the world.<br/><br/>These days, you get the feeling that the path to the top must be littered with bits of discarded equipment, empty drink cans, McDonalds cartons, and of course, the odd dead body. Over time, the Nepalese authorities have also become worried about the amount of human waste left on the mountain – not a place for ripple soled shoes anymore – it was something Mallory and Hillary didn't have to worry about.<br/><br/>The film is brilliantly photographed with some truly heart-stopping scenes, but it takes a while to get into the human drama. Also, when you watch the climbers struggling to survive near the summit of the world's tallest mountain, you realise why all 31 seasons of ""Survivor"" were filmed in warm locales where people don't need much clothing or even none at all. In this movie, if the stars aren't buried under an avalanche of snow, they are buried under layers of parkas, jackets, vests, hoods, anti-glare goggles and sunscreen – as well as quite a few bushy beards – it's sometimes tricky sorting out who's who.<br/><br/>The film concentrates on two teams: one guided by New Zealander Rob Hall, played by Australian Jason Clarke, and the other by American Scott Fisher, played by Jake Gyllenhaal.<br/><br/>The teams are mainly from English speaking nations and it is intriguing to hear the variations on the language through American, New Zealand, Australian and South African accents.<br/><br/>Emily Watson and Keira Knightley bravely tackle a Kiwi accent and both give emotion-charged performances, while Jake Gyllenhaal's laid-back almost ethereal attitude contrasts with other, more intense characters.<br/><br/>In one group scene, the question is asked about what drives them to attempt the climb. But no one seems able to verbalise effectively what it is that makes them risk their lives and their health doing something that even in 1996 had been done many times before.<br/><br/>The film has a powerful score by Dario Marianelli; at once triumphant and tragic. When the killer storm descends, the film hits home with scenes of sacrifice, heroism and tragedy as one by one the climbers meet their fate.<br/><br/>There have been quite a few mountaineering movies, but this one raises the bar out of sight as far as effects are concerned – there are some scenes that make you feel you are really climbing up towards the Hillary Step – without having to worry about hypothermia, high-altitude pulmonary edema, frostbite – and piles of human waste."
"mrbarooee","5","1","2","29 January 2016"," Some die, some survive
","Every day we read in the newspaper and on TV that some people died in an accident somewhere but we don't make a movie about them. Honestly, I don't know what they found interesting in the story which made them spend all that money and gather an outstanding group of actors even for small roles. The idea of some climbers who guide normal people to the top of Everest is intriguing enough to get our hopes high. But then what? What about the story? In the first paragraph I used a lot of some's and there was a reason. To the very end of the movie they remain some people. We never identify with them because they are never introduced well enough to arouse our sense of sympathy. Moreover, some of them die in an absolutely ridiculous way. Take for instance the guy who fell off the ridge and we were supposed to feel sad. Well, I laughed. On the other hand, when some of them come back to life ( big surprise, right?), best case scenario we feel indifferent. In other words, it is not explained why that particular character should live and others not. Although efforts are made to make the characters more humane. For example Rob( the protagonist) has a wife at home and another surprise, she is pregnant. But wait! There are more. Rob still doesn't know if it's a girl or boy. Too familiar, right? Or Beck whose marriage is going through a rough patch and his last conversation with the wife ( Robin Wright, great performance; in fact, too good for this movie) before his presumed death is less than friendly. Instead of these old techniques we wish there were stronger characters.<br/><br/>In the first hour, before the storm hits, nothing happens. Then when finally the action starts the audience is exhausted because of the wait and confused because of numerous characters. At times we don't know who is going up and who is coming down, and wearing those oxygen mask did not help. Frankly at the end we almost forget who lived and who died.<br/><br/>In the past few years there have been a number of movies about survival in harsh conditions and most of them are overrated. For instance 'Impossible' which is as entertaining as a two line piece of news in local newspaper (and because the family was not Asian they just had to make a movie about it). Or even 'Gravity' about a woman who didn't die. Well, OK in space! But where is the drama here? However, there is 'The Martian' which is actually a great movie with a humorous, attractive performance of Matt Daemon who single handedly takes the audience to Mars.<br/><br/>'Everest' can be summarized in the title of this review. Some die and some survive. Read it again and you don't need to see the movie. If you are interested in a story with a survival theme, check the news."

","The catch line on the movie poster says ""Never Let Go"" and right at the bottom, based on incredible true story. Never let go of what precisely? Doug, Harold, Rob Hall, Scott, all let go of themselves. The Sherpas sent to rescue Rob Hall turned back at the earliest sign of a storm and his buddy at base camp literally just say, OK. and honestly, i don't know how incredible a story is when more than half the climbers end up dead? For the dead climber's sake, i seriously hope that what was shown in the movie did not accurately reflect the true event, because, most, if not all of the dead climbers wasn't killed because of the storm, they're dead because they're unbearably stupid. Take Scott for example, being a guide, he must have been to the top more than once. What's the point of wasting your life just to be up there again? Rob being an experienced guide should know better than to allow a weak climber already low on oxygen to make summit way PAST the turnaround time! and it didn't take much effort to persuade him either. This movie is so disturbing and depressing. What's the point in making a movie where everyone end up dead? While i understand this is based on true events where people actually died, i feel the writer shouldn't have made it into such a morally depleting movie. Writer should at least try to make someone a hero. If you're thinking of scaling the Everest, or any mountain really, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. Hell, you might even retire from climbing after watching this movie."

","This was a great movie. Fantastic cinematography, solidly directed and great performances. Empathy for characters who spend a small fortune to go up a mountain with the understanding that they could be killed and for that eventuality to be realized is difficult to achieve. Even the script is self aware of that and in one scene the characters ask what the appeal is. But do we need this justification?, the extremity of mountaineering, its toll to the human body and ultimately the human spirit is drama enough. To that end Everest beautifully charts the beauty and horror of mountaineering as well as its impact to powerless onlookers. This would have been easier to make as a documentary but bravo to the filmmakers for scripting and acting this piece out. A great technical achievement. The performances are great too, Jason Clarke is knock out. Josh Brolin was great too putting in a very honed in nuanced performance. However the usually brilliant Jake Gyllenhaal plays it too cartoonish and his performance was just that believable. But thats a very minor negative, I strongly recommend you view this movie on the largest screen you can fine."
"drqshadow-reviews","8","1","2","8 December 2015"," Appropriately Striking, For Reasons Both Visual and Emotional
","A stunning, moving dramatization of the 1996 Mount Everest disaster, drawn from the accounts of several survivors. This incident actually involves author Jon Krakauer, who documented his own experience in the '97 page-turner Into Thin Air, though some disputes have been raised against his work and it's not cited as a reference for the film. As one might expect, there's no shortage of breathtaking scenery and bowel-shaking peeks down into the gaping abyss, and those are clearly a high priority for the production. They're a grand mix of CGI and on-location footage, real IMAX-quality eye candy that should scratch a giant itch for lovers of the outdoors or fans of air-sucking Earth porn. The film's dramatic turns, surprisingly enough, are just as effective. Though it's overloaded with big names, from Josh Brolin and Jake Gyllenhaal to Keira Knightly and Robin Wright, each effectively fades into a more pedestrian role and none, save a few appropriately loud-mouthed scenes from Brolin, threaten to take the production over. Though the passage of time is occasionally a bit underplayed, especially as the climbers acclimate to altitude, it works very well as both a pulse-pounder and a gut-punch. Powerful and arresting, it reaches brazenly for the heavens without losing track of its human origins, which is far easier said than done."
"hjbuhrkall","7","1","2","2 December 2015"," The story is brutal, but we're missing out.
","I can tell that like many other early reviewers of this movie; I already knew most of the story by heart.<br/><br/>Having watched many of the early documentaries of the '96 disaster, and having read multiple of the written accounts from the survivors, including Krakauers book several times; watching this movie, I can't help the feeling that there is so much we are not shown<br/><br/>Any disaster is always the result of a series of unfortunate events or decisions, and following '96 there have been so many conclusions to why this one in particular unfolded so violently.<br/><br/>The decision of trying to drag Sandy Pittman to the top, even though she should have been told to go back long before; this decision was resulted partly in the missing ropes near the Hillary step; and hence the long line who kept everybody else up the for far too long a short scene shows Pittman being dragged up the mountain by one of the Sherpas, but the movie never explains anything about it, nor does it try to explain why this is a very bad idea.<br/><br/>It is shortly mentioned that Anatoli Boukreev does not wish to use bottled oxygen while guiding on the mountain, today this would actually be illegal, but back in'96 it was just not well seen. Because of oxygen deprivation Boukreev has to leave the summit fairly quick, and hence abandons his clients there. In the movie he is (fair enough) depicted as an hero, since he alone rescued multiple people. But if you think about it, a number of these people might not have been in need of saving, if Boukreev had just stayed with them in the first place. <br/><br/>The movie does actually use an amount of time to show the large number of climbers on the mountain, and how this were actually creating ""traffic jams"" up there, this was an extremely contributing factor to the chaos that happened.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I like the movie it's well directed and shot, the views are wonderful and breathtaking, and I have a tremendous amount of respect for the production crew to actually shoot most of the movie on the mountain I would just have liked it to have a 45-60min longer runtime, so it could more accurately tell the many aspects of the story."

Some very good performances can be found here and I am happy to see that they stay away from overacting and overdramatic emotions as sometimes films about disasters tempt actors to give. Everyone played their parts in such a way that they look perfectly fitting for them so what stands out is the character rather than the actor.<br/><br/>The dialogues are well-written and delivered. They are just enough to guide through the story and reveal not only the facts but also the human part behind them.<br/><br/>The film has many picturesque sets and what makes them even more outstanding is the brilliant cinematography which increases the feel of realism.

"oragex","9","1","2","12 November 2015"," A movie that will satisfy the outdoor lovers and the occasional climber.
","A movie for purists? Certainly no. But a movie that will satisfy the outdoor lovers, the occasional climber and - at least at it's beginning - the trekking crowds.<br/><br/>Good news: certainly not a typical Hollywood flick and surely miles away from the rather commercial K2. Surely not the kind of movie I would recommend for unadvised people to go spend a tuesday night with popcorn because this movie contains technical aspects that will make it boring for the crowd.<br/><br/>Talking about technical aspects others are better skilled to comment on this. The movie doesn't exactly illustrate the difficulties of climbing above 8000m. It was not shot on the Everest slopes either, as the closer to Everest scenes are filmed at the base camp, and not above.<br/><br/>The marking points of the movie are the moments of struggling for live and also the extremely important moment of decision making. I read a bit on the events of the 1996 and I don't remember any passage where the guides were instructing before ascension their clients that when the guide says 'you go back' the clients will have no choice but to obey. I wonder if they instruct this to the clients before the expeditions. Basically, this is the most crucial rule in high altitude climbing, a rule Messner and other great mountaineers followed like a law. No matter how close to the summit - even for a matter of hundreds of feet, no matter how many times the ascension was unsuccessfully tried before, no matter what the financial pressure; when it's time to give up and return, you have to stop and to go back.<br/><br/>On the flawed side, I felt the movie was giving too much time to the first 'trekking' part of the expedition, and too little from the moment the storm sets in. The movie also surprisingly skips an important passage when Beck is left for dead to slip alone in a collapsed tent for a night because the climbers in the nearby tents were thinking ""he is going to die any way"". So perhaps not all elements are shown in this film but it's still quite close to the facts. Interestingly, there is a black helicopter scene when Beck is rescued from Camp 1 that is perhaps the best 'risky' helicopter scene I've seen in a movie. This scene almost doesn't belong to the movie, but rather to a Hollywood production. Still, it is awesome. And the cherry on the sundae is this scene is close to the facts. The helicopter that rescued Becks is exactly as the one in the film, and only one passenger was rescued at once because the heli had reached the lift limit."

So when this movie was released It got my attention. Picking Aussie Jason Clark to play Rob Hall was an interesting choice . Naturally us Kiwis squirm when Australians are selected to play NZ characters . However Jason Clarke did admirably and he never really tried to do the kiwi accent . Thankfully kiwi Martin Henderson played his assistant. Over all I felt the movie gave a good summary of the events that happened in 96 , although Rob Hall probably needs a separate movie. The events happened over 48 hours so it would have been a stretch to try and contain everything in 2hrs. I was satisfied at the portrayal of Rob Hall. My girlfriend got quite emotional near the end."
"stephendaxter","6","1","2","25 October 2015"," Get through the disappointing first hour and you get an INTENSE and DRAMATIC movie
","Everest is an Adventure/Drama film based on the incredible true story of pain and survival where a group of climbers in 1996 attempt to reach the top of Mount Everest but are hit with complications that test their will to survive. I was looking forward to this film for a few reasons, mainly because of the incredible cast, the intense drama, the 'Biopic' label, and Jake Gyllenhaal. And in the end, these were the things that i loved the most but it wasn't enough to make this a memorable film due to a narrative that really doesn't deliver and let the film down a lot.<br/><br/>I will start with the performances because this was a very stacked cast with a lot of quality actors and actresses. So it runs the risk of having too many people to focus on resulting in no-one getting enough time to shine. But they handle it really well for the most part, Josh Brolin and Jason Clarke have a lot to do in the film and they put on great performances and carry most of the scenes they are in. They did a great job at capturing the fear and pain these people would have been going through and conveyed it really well. Also i have to say, in the limited amount of screen time they got, Jake Gyllenhaal, Keira Knightly, Sam Worthington and John Hawkes also did a great job. All of these actors added to the emotion really well, they added to the drama and tension you feel later on in the film and were great supporting roles. It still needed more Gyllenhaal because, well, the more the better but for what he was given he did a really really good and convincing job. In terms of the characters, i thought they were mostly really well handled, towards the end you end up getting a good idea of who most people are by name and face, but for the first hour you really only remember like 3-4 characters and everyone else up to that point was just there for a line or two occasionally. <br/><br/>The film had a lot of intense drama and some really tense moments that have you holding your breath for minutes at a time. The film makers did a great job at capturing the scope and size of Everest and really showing the amount of dangers they have to avoid. The cinematography is astounding, the wide shots of them climbing the mountain were great, the large shots aiming down an endless pit were freaky especially if you hate heights. And the very close up dramatic scenes during the storm were filmed so great that you start to feel cold as you feel like you are right there suffering with them. The last 45 minutes to an hour especially were just insane. It was gripping, intense, dramatic and especially emotional and if it was like that for the entirety of the film i would have liked it a lot better. Emotion really did play a big part in the film, most notably in that last 45 minutes, but no emotion would be felt if they didn't introduce us to these characters in a way so that we cared about them. And that is why the first 20 minutes of this film were very valuable in having events later on pay off. They introduce these characters and have you really get behind their goals so that when they go through something bad, you feel it, same for when something good happens. But after saying all that the film was still a let down. <br/><br/>This movie was 2 hours in length and i have to say, half way through this movie, i thought it had already been 2 hours. After they get most of the characters introduced in the first 20 or so minutes, the next 40 minutes really had almost no substance whatsoever. It was moving really slowly and you get a lot of them just preparing for the climb and then sections of the initial parts of their journey. It was wearing down the film a tonne and if it wasn't for the brief moments focusing on the development of the characters i may have just given up on the film then and there. It looked like it was really struggling that whole time to find something good to focus on and i was hoping it found something quick. A lot of that i felt should have been compressed down to like 20 minutes and it would have moved on much quicker and not left as big a mark on the film. <br/><br/>In the end, Everest was a bit of a let down, we did get great performances all across the board from all of the actors. The characters were well introduced and some of them were very well developed which gave the last 45 minutes of the film a lot of emotional impact. the last 45 minutes was intense, and dramatic and made for some very engaging moments. But despite all of that, the overall narrative i felt was weak especially in the first hour, nothing much was happening of interest and apart from very few individual moments it was moving too slow and not really focusing on anything interesting. If you can get through to the last 45 minutes to an hour you will end up enjoying it as it does make up for the film's earlier issues. - 6.3"

","EVEREST VIewed At the Westend Cinemas, Budapest<br/><br/>Sunday, October 18, 2015, <br/><br/>by Alex Deleon<br/><br/>Summary: In 1996 A climbing expedition on Mt. Everest is devastated by a severe snow storm. Directed by Icelander Baltasar Kormákur (born Reykjavik 1966), a Universal release, RT 121 minutes. Big festivals usually have big films on opening night so it is easy to see why this picture was chosen to open the 2015 Venice Film Festival. Everest is a big film that takes up a big subject -- what it takes to climb the highest mountain on earth -- in excruciating detail. The Chinese have a wise old saying: ""Shang shan rungyi, shya shan nan!"" -- literally, 'Up mountain easy -- down mountain hard'-- which is what this film is basically all about.<br/><br/>Based on events in a book called ""Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest"" this icy breathtaker reconstructs every detail of a grueling Everest climb by an international group of adventurers that ended in disaster after the exhilarating triumph of reaching the peak -- the very top of the world. On the way back down eight of the climbers died, one by one, when a ferocious storm hit the ""Death Zone"" at the top of the mountain. One American survivor from Texas (Josh Brolin in the film), miraculously rescued by helicopter after being all but buried alive in the snow, had to have his hands and nose, frozen solid, amputated. One is tempted to ask ""why do people put their lives on the line just to get to the top of the tallest mountain?"" -- to which Englishman Edmund Hillary, the first man to reach the peak of Everest back in 1953, offered a most existentialist answer: ""Because it's there!""<br/><br/>The picture is basically divided into two interwoven parts: (1) The expedition and the climb itself with magnificent cinematography and views of the mountain from different angles at various levels --and (2) the calls back to base camp, and back home by overseas hookup to the wife of one of the climbers, and the agonized reactions of these people following the perilous mountain ascent from a safe distance below, or halfway around the world. The facial reactions of the expedition monitors are mostly in distracting full screen closeups, the wife back home mainly in bed with the lights out. Frankly speaking, the emotional reactions back home and down below could have been eliminated entirely, or at least shortened by 90%, because all they do is detract from the drama up on the mountain and tend to reduce a powerful experience to sentimental TV type drivel. <br/><br/>That being said, Everest is still a fantastic movie that puts you at times so close to the snowbound action and physical struggles of the climbers that it is almost a struggle to watch. The end is particularly gruesome (and realistic!) when we watch the Brolin character huddled up against the icy mountain top to brace himself against a vicious snow storm while smothering for lack of oxygen and watching parts of his body turn into black ice as he fights to survive on sheer will power alone. <br/><br/>The sequence with the helicopter rescue is also extremely realistic because the air at that altitude (29,000 feet above sea level) is so thin that the helicopter blades barely have enough air to bite into and the winds are deadly. The pilot is barely able to land his shaky aircraft on a tiny space being cleared away for him by hand, picks up a black faced half frozen Brolin, then nearly crashes on the lift off and swoop downward between craggy razor-sharp ridges -- zowie! -- a white knuckle watch for anybody who has ever been in a whirly bird -- (this writer, has been, a number of times! ) -- In actual fact the real helicopter rescue in 1996 was the highest a copter had ever flown. Altogether, Everest is a remarkable screen experience that will stay with viewers long after and give new meaning to the term ""mountain climbing"" -- Might also pump up business at North Face outlets around the globe."

","What killed this movie for me the most was their attempt at ""docu-dramism"" where they tried too much to be almost a documentary rather than a dramatic film. Things are told but never felt. You know some things about the characters but you never get to know them. There is little time spent in establishing them as people.<br/><br/>The biggest reason for that is that the film never really settles on a protagonist, but just sort of jumps from person to person. The film would have been a lot better if it had told just one person's story, then maybe it could have created some feeling in the viewer.<br/><br/>But besides all that Everest is by no means a bad film. What it does well is give you a sense of the experience of mountain climbing and the mind numbing danger of it all.<br/><br/>Everest is not a bad film, especially for a large screen experience, but drama wise it left me wanting more."
"daveygandthekeyboard","7","1","2","19 October 2015"," If watching grim adventure on the big screen is your thing
","Everest is the tale of a 1996 ill-fated expedition to summit the highest peak in the world. When an untimely rogue storm hits, the already-dangerous task turns deadly. The events in this film are described in the Jon Krakauer book Into Thin Air, though this is not an adaptation of that book but a dramatization of the same event. (Krakauer figures into the story.)<br/><br/>In the same way that I saw Flight 93 and walked out knowing that I had seen a great movie that I would never want to see again, so goes Everest, which is pretty good but really sad at the same time (it's not as good as Flight 93 but comparable in the way it made me feel.) <br/><br/>At the heart of this movie is the question of the over commercialization of something as inherently dangerous as climbing the tallest mountain of the world. Personally, I feel that a feat so dangerous that it claims lives should be left to people who know what they're doing, not simply awarded to those who can simply afford the experience. There are definitely people in this world who look at thrill seekers and the ""because it is there"" crowd and shake our heads.<br/><br/>That said, when you push past this and get to the human stories, Everest is a well-done but gut-wrenching movie. The personal stories, while not overly dwelt upon, give a fairly basic picture of everyone's motivations for climbing the mountain. One man simply wants to inspire some school children back home. Another simply doesn't feel right doing anything else. And one woman is trying to complete the feat of having summited the highest peaks on every continent and has left Everest for the end.<br/><br/>There is a good 20-30 minutes toward the back end where this movie is totally engrossing, when it becomes a race against the storm and the threat of death is very real. You want to hope for the best, and in some cases that works out. In the end, Everest delivers the visuals you'd expect and tells the story it was going for and if watching grim adventure on the screen is your thing, then this may be the movie for you."
"aharmas","7","1","2","17 October 2015"," Challenging Nature
","""Everest"" is the type of film that one wants to see because it offers the opportunity to see a very special part of the world, the most impressive mountains on the planet, majestic, forbidden territory, the ultimate challenge for those who dare to go there.<br/><br/>The story introduces a group of people who are apparently ready to take on the challenge. Some are going for the first time, some are veterans and have climbed a few of the other peaks in the chain. It becomes apparent that they will be able to handle most of what is there, and some might not make it, but what we don't know is how different the outcome will be because one element they haven't considered is the unpredictability of the elements in nature.<br/><br/>We are giving a passable amount of background, which becomes a weakness here. There's too many characters to follow, and the screenwriter just fails to focus on two or three of them, trying too hard to introduce too many, neglecting to focus on what should have been the main element, the challenge, the power of the mountain, the impending possibility that nothing should be taken for granted. Considerable care goes into telling us what could happen if something goes wrong, but it never feels as if we are there with the expedition members. We get to see them play the roles, but they are sketchy performances. We know we have jocks, addicts, adrenaline junkies, etc. We never really get to know anyone. It's a pity because Gyllenthal, Brolin, and other fine actors are given little to work with.<br/><br/>One thing that stands out is that the trip never feels that special. Yes, the winds are there, the storms are loud and deadly, the temperatures can maim and kill you because they're part of the film, but the emotional build up is weak, and we see something that is neither a good documentary or a very dramatic film. It's supposed be a thrilling ride, but we get something that never reaches that level."

"Likes_Ninjas90","4","1","2","17 October 2015"," Everest's technical feats aren't matched by a subpar script by William Nicholson and Simon Beaufoy
","This film is based on the true and fatal story of Robert Hall, a New Zealand mountain climber, who along with several others died climbing Mount Everest. Hall is played by Australian actor Jason Clarke (Zero Dark Thirty, Planet of the Apes) who leads the expedition featuring Beck Weathers (Josh Brolin), who is a wealthy American whose vision becomes impaired on the mountain and Dough Hansen (John Hawkes) who has had to take on multiple jobs to pay for the challenge. A drunken expedition leader (Jake Gyllenhaal) is leading his own group and decides to pair up with Hall. At home, Jason Clarke's wife (Keira Knightley) is pregnant and fearful that her husband might not return. One of Hall's major colleagues is Helen Wilton, (Emily Watson), a Kiwi camp manager, who corresponds with the group over the radio. Once upon the mountain, members of Hall's group start to splinter off from each other under the difficult conditions. Some perish and others are fortunate enough to make it off the mountain, in spite of the fiercely icy and deathly conditions. As a character says at one point: ""Our bodies will be literally dying."" On a technical front, this is a stronger film than some of Icelandic director's Baltasar Kormákur previous work like Contraband. It was filmed in several countries including Italy, Iceland and Nepal. The film on the whole, particularly the breathtaking landscapes and mountain ranges, is handsomely photographed. The snowy conditions raises a question rare in films today where you ask: ""How did they film that?"" It's something that has often been nullified by the ease in which computer generated images have replaced real, dangerous environments and stunt work itself. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, Everest's technical feats aren't matched by a subpar script by William Nicholson and Simon Beaufoy (Slumdog Millionaire, 127 Hours). The one philosophical question the film touches upon is: Why? Why are people interested in mountain climbing when it will not only cost them a small fortune to partake in these dangerous climbs but also risk their lives as well? The contemplation was the potential basis for a much deeper movie. But in this cut of the film, thirty minutes shorter than its original duration, that potential thesis question is addressed only briefly through rather corny responses like it'd be a crime to miss the beauty of the environment and Beck announcing that climbing is a cure for his depression. There's no depth to any of these characters, who are merely sketches, perhaps to share the airtime of all of the available stars. It's a splendid cast on paper. But sadly, the only conflict the script allows for is against the elements and terrain rather than building personalities to clash and boil over. There are too many good actors here for one movie, meaning some aren't used to their full potential. Jake Gyllenhaal barely features and Keira Knightley, Sam Worthington and Emily Watson have only small parts. Perhaps the reluctance to allow any of the actors to play the role of a villain, a source of human conflict, was in a bid for realism. But it's an objective undermined by the frequent cutbacks in conversation—an obvious and repetitive technique for building emotion—and which also lumbers the film's pacing to a crawl. Largely, the film is sunk by the difficulty of shaping a real life event into a two-hour narrative. How do you make a mountain out of an anthill of a story? This is not a film with a plot and character but one which tries to exist solely on its crippling atmosphere and conditions alone. Some died horribly and others were wounded terribly but survived—mostly on luck. There's not much more the audience can draw from the story or its coda. It is titled Everest and all the focus lands squarely on the conditions and the mountain itself. I would have cared so much more if the film had taken a personal, microscopic observation before its biggest steps."

","Mt-Everest. It is 21 times higher than The Twin Towers. This movie chronicles the tale of how a man from New Zealand who had set up a high mountain climbing adventure company gets himself into deep trouble on the highest mountain in the world. Its a saddening tale. In the film there are references by a character who says he is 'going snow-blind'-a thing that should have been foreseen by wearing sunglasses to cut down on the glare-indicating an unprepared climber- which brings me to another observation-the character who said the bit about going snow-blind had his head exposed in frigid winds which makes him even more unprepared to deal with Everest as if he was hiking in the woods in Vermont in November. The term 'snow blind' can also refer to ""white out"" conditions when the horizon merges with the ground in a snowstorm making you ipso facto: snow blind. Only a fool would attempt to climb Everest without extensive mountaineering experience and without the proper clothes and eye gear-as in even if its not very bright your eyes should be behind protective glasses that are flush to your face. Not in this movie though. In this film-which is supposed to be about real life events-the climb contains amateur climbers as well as experienced ones. Its a cautionary tale that says if you want to climb to the summit of Mt-Everest you have to be more than prepared and you have to be completely disciplined and you have to have extensive mountain climbing experience and even then-you must be ready for the unexpected. I don't think summit ascents are to be taken lightly and I think the high mountain adventure companies like the one depicted in this movie were taking mountain climbing too lightly. Apparently several books were written by folk who survived that day on Everest where a total of 15 people lost their lives. Also those written accounts give different versions of events. There are in total over 200 frozen bodies of dead mountain climbers on Everest as of 2015 and one or two are even used as 'mile markers' which I find gruesome."
"vav-61764","7","1","2","8 October 2015"," With Efficient Storytelling and Eye-Catching Visual Effects, Everest Portrays One of The Worst Mount Everest's Tragedies
","Every year lots of people try to reach the summit of Mount Everest guided by their passion to a mountain both beautiful and dangerous, a desire to reach what so few have managed to achieve even if their own body suffer unspeakable pain from the agonizing freezing temperature, Everest does it very well as building up the characters, telling their backgrounds, the explanation of why they're doing something so dangerous. Due to the camera angles, a vertigo sensation can be felt as the viewers glimpse huge cliffs and tops far away from the ground. The film creates a torturing atmosphere where the audience is affected by the characters' suffering and there is no uniformity in the characters, each one has their own personality, their own reason for doing something so dangerous, making them more captivating. Regarding the setting, there're some scenes which were actually shot in real locations, such as Nepal, and others that CGI does most of the work. In these scenes, the visual effects are impressive, although some scenes it's perceptible. The casting is composed by many good and talented actors and actresses, they deliver solid characters and when it's required a deep and emotional acting, they're convincing and heartbroken. The one who stands out is Jason Clarke, his character has such a charisma much due to his love for his family and they are his foundation to keep trying to survive the catastrophe.<br/><br/>The film is confusing, not of having a complex plot, but in it, some scenes seems to be dislocated or doesn't fit. There're several scenes throughout the movie where what happens in them aren't talked about later in the picture. They may not compromise the story's understanding, but then, why are they in the film. Looking as if they are present just only to increase the length of the movie."
"emdeecee15","Null","1","2","4 October 2015"," Almost great, but not quite
","As far as films about natural disasters go, ""Everest"" is a league above its dumber cousins. Films like ""Into the Storm"" (2014) and ""San Andreas"" (2015) are often just showcases of destruction, lacking any real substance or complex characters. They're more concerned with luring as many people into the theater as they can with their special effects and promise of catastrophe. ""Everest"" has more intelligent ambitions. <br/><br/>The film follows the true story of Rob Hall (played by Jason Clarke) and his team on their expedition to the summit of Mt. Everest during the spring of 1996. Fighting through freezing temperatures and gale force winds, the team makes it to the summit only to be greeted by a storm preventing their descent, putting their whole expedition, and their lives, in danger. <br/><br/>""Everest"" succeeds because it captures the camaraderie of those who take on one of the most difficult challenges in the world: climbing Mt. Everest. It takes a special breed of person to even consider such a trial and the film understands that. It imbues its characters with a romantic acceptance of fate; either they make it to the top or they die trying. The psychology of its characters is the most interesting part of ""Everest"" and its best asset. <br/><br/>But the film never fully delivers on that front due to the fact that instead of telling one story with Hall as the clear protagonist, we're told a number of stories, one for each of the men on the team. Featuring a large ensemble cast, the film briefly touches on the life behind each and every man on the mountain, desperately trying to make one just as important as the next; an impossibility for film with a 121 minute run time. <br/><br/>This is a shame because these fleeting glimpses really got me invested in each character. Hall is portrayed as a legend of sorts: the man to lead all men to the summit. His confidence and reassurance even had me believing that this expedition might be pulled off without a hitch. Others, including Beck Weathers (played by Josh Brolin) and Scott Fischer (played by Jake Gyllenhaal), are built up as equally fascinating people, and yet we only spend a small amount of time with each. This hinders the emotional impact of the film because we as the audience never get the full weight of any one character's story. <br/><br/>This shortcoming really comes into play towards the end of the film. When it comes to stories like this one, it's to be expected that not all of the characters you meet will live to see the credits roll. I won't spoil anything, but this holds true in ""Everest,"" and because we are never given a complete picture of any one character, these deaths lack the magnitude they deserve. In fact, some deaths come and go so quickly, I barely had time to process what had happened before the film had moved on. <br/><br/>This unceremonious treatment of death hurts the film precisely because its characters are so magnetic. These men take palpable joy in suffering for their art, but because the mountain doesn't pause when it ends a life, neither does the film. Although I wouldn't say it tells its story with impatient briskness, ""Everest"" certainly never lingers on any one plot point long enough for it to really set in with the audience. <br/><br/>But, to the film's credit, even this doesn't totally sterilize the moving story of Hall and his team. The passion that drove these men to the highest point on the planet shines through whatever mistakes the filmmakers made and the great ensemble cast embodies that passion well. ""Everest"" may not have the shocking realism of ""Gravity"" (2013) or the emotional intelligence of ""The Impossible"" (2012), but it does have a lot of heart, a respectable quality that not many disaster movies ever achieve."

","Everest is definitely a unique viewing experience. On the level of visual spectacle, the film is unmatched. The backdrop of Everest is captured with the majesty and visual intricacy of what you might expect in an IMAX movie but it does service at all this gorgeous scenery because there are people in front of that scenery who you're invested in.<br/><br/>The film is based on a true story. May 10th, 1996 was arguably the most disastrous day in Everest's history in terms of cost of human life and the film morphs from an adventure film into a tragedy in the film's final third (similar to ""Titanic"" although I'm sure fewer people are aware of how this film ends). The film juxtaposes joy and tragedy in a relatively jarring way that could be described as muddled.<br/><br/>The first part of the film is undoubtedly a celebration: Both of the camaraderie between a group of adventures from different walks of life, as well as the fulfillment these people get in conquering nature.<br/><br/>But in the film's final hour, the story becomes an allegory for how nature has a way of getting the last laugh when you least expect it. Like other natural disasters, there's little thematic rhyme or reason here (and one can't fault the film for being true to the story).<br/><br/>The film is jarring in that way, but it feels oddly complete and profound as well.<br/><br/>The density of the story lines can make the story hard to follow but the film does justice to the all the people involved in the story by denying us any composites or omissions. As a result, the film boasts a large part and big name talent (rising star Jason Clarke takes the lead with Oscar-nominees Josh Brolin, Jake Gyllenhaal, Emily Watson, Keira Knightly and John Hawkes all in the mix) lending their talents to many of the parts.<br/><br/>Ironically, character actor Michael Kelly plays the journalist who would eventually author the definitive account of the incident and he's given surprisingly little service here.

The characters were interesting at first and they did a decent job giving them background to generate sympathy for later.

With almost no warning, the expedition becomes devastated when a violent blizzard strikes the mountain. Stranded with harsh conditions including sub-zero temperatures, shortage of oxygen, and devastating winds, the trip becomes an intense and seemingly impossible fight for survival. Featuring a greatly talented cast of John Hawkes, Robin Wright, Sam Worthington, Michael Kelly, Keira Nightly, Emily Watson, and Jake Gyllenhaal, this film shines with dazzling cinematography, engrossing visuals, and a captivating screenplay.<br/><br/>This movie does not shy away from intensity. From the moment when the characters embark on their expedition on the mountain, you are left with your heart beating rapidly and your hands gripping your seats. This is greatly done by the amazing cinematography as we are treated with downward shots showing the depths of the canyons in the mountain and bird's eye views of the mountains. In the scene when the blizzard hits, the amount of suspense soars as we watch the characters suffer through harsh conditions. They run low on oxygen, suffer from hypothermia, and struggle through devastating winds, some of which fall to their deaths. One scene shows a graphic shot of a character's frostbitten hands. These scenes are shot so authentically and are tough to watch at times. You could literally feel the pain these characters are facing -- the freezing temperatures, the flying specks of snow hitting their faces. Then there is the cast who do such amazing jobs for their performances, although you do not learn much of the character other than Josh Brolin and Jason Clark's characters, but honestly it doesn't too much here.<br/><br/>Everest is one of the most intense and fascinating disasters films I have seen in recent years. I believe with this film has a great chance at earning some Oscars for its technical achievements such as film editing, sound editing, and cinematography. This is a film I encourage to watch.

"paul-allaer","9","1","2","23 September 2015"," Disaster movie that packs a emotional wallop
","""Everest"" (2015 release; 122 min.) brings the true story of the ill-fated 1996 Mount Everest climb that writer Jon Krakauer (who was part of the expedition) later immortalized in his 1997 book ""Into Thin Air"". As the movie opens, we see a group of climbers ascending to Camp 4, and then we shift to ""Six Weeks Earlier"", where a group is ready to leave the airport in Christchurch, New Zealand, on their way to Nepal. One by one we get to know who all is part of the expedition, including the expedition leader Rob, who has left his pregnant wife behind in New Zealand; Beck, a brash Texan; Doug, a humble mailman/carpenter, etc. etc. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: first, you may or may not remember that these events have been made into a movie before. In 1997, a quickie TV movie based on (and titled after) the Krakauer book ""Into This Air"" was made, and promptly dismissed and forgotten. This time around, no effort, expense, or star power was spared, even with giving the reins to below-the-radar Icelandic director Baltasar Kormákur (best known for ""2 Guns"" and ""Contraband""). Second, you may not remember the details of the expedition, but most of us do at least vaguely recall going in that things are going to be problematic, so the question is: will you still be transfixed? The answer is a clear yes! In fact, I will say that I was surprised how emotionally invested I became in some of the characters. In that sense, ""Everest"" is very much like ""Titanic"": yes, it's a disaster movie, but just as much, if not more so, it's also a love story. Third, is the movie worth the extra money to see in IMAX 3D? The answer is again yes! Mind you, I rarely go to a 3D or IMAX showing, let alone the combo. But unlike many movies shown in 3D these days, ""Everest"" was shot specifically to show in 3D. And the 'action scenes' on and around Mount Everest are nothing short of eye-popping. Fourth, the movie sports an all-star ensemble cast, with some interesting performances. Check out in particular Jake Gyllenhaal as the loopy 'rival' guide named Scott, and also Keira Knightley in a small but very powerful role as Jan (Rob's pregnant wife). Bottom line: this is big Hollywood at its best, bringing us a disaster movie with all the bells and whistles and also packing an emotional wallop.<br/><br/>""Everest"" started out one week early on just IMAX 3D screens, and that is where I saw this at. It set a record for an opening weekend on IMAX 3D, and it has garnered much critical and, even more important, also positive word-of-mouth. The screening that I saw this at was very nicely attended for a week day early evening screening. I expect to have ""Everest"" to have long legs at the box office. I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theaters, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, although it needs to be stated that a movie like this just begs to be seen on the big screen. Meanwhile, ""Everest"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

Yet here he makes a beautifully-executed film which never takes a misstep, capturing both the awe and terrific danger of Mount Everest. The film sets out to examine the disparate group of people who are willing to pay $65,000 and risk all by trying to reach the summit, which we're solemnly informed by Rob Hall, is at the altitude of a cruising Boeing 747.<br/><br/>Kormákur's strength as a director, allows the actors to imbue their real characters with a sense of naturalism, from the mailman Doug Hansen (John Hawkes) to the Texan bravado of Beck Weathers (Josh Brolin). The script, by William Nicholson and Simon Beaufoy, takes an ensemble approach to its narrative, a mosaic of climbers from which emerges a community with underlying tensions between experienced mountaineers and ""tourists"" paying to get to Everest's peak. Poor decisions made at over 29,000 feet can be fatal, especially when compounded by the fierce intensity of the Himalyan weather.<br/><br/>Kormákur actually shot at the Everest base camp and filmed climbing scenes in the Italian Alps, giving the film a powerful realism; watching it, you feel the sub-zero temperatures and the vertiginous heights. He's also adept at building tension, particularly in showing climbers crossing a ladder at Everest's Kumbu Ice Fall, where just from the sound alone, we wince at every step taken. It's an extraordinary tense film, especially as, being based on real events, we know some will not survive. Yet Kormákur refuses to sentimentalise the drama, lending a dignity to the ill-fated characters: death is not over-dramatised, instead the fragility of life on the mountain is emphasised. He's aided immeasurably by an excellent cast: Jason Clarke, Jake Gyllenhaal, John Hawkes, Josh Brolin and Emily Watson. If there's a criticism to be made, the film sometimes spreads itself too thinly, and actors like Sam Worthington and Ingvar Eggert Sigurðsson are relegated to the background.<br/><br/>The clarity of Salvatore Totino's cinematography enables us to appreciate the savage beauty of the mountains while the editing of Mick Audsley admirably clarifies a complex story, cross-cutting between base camp and the different groups fighting their way back down through a horrific storm. It's a dramatic survival film, rooted in humanity enduring the extremes of nature, but it never looses sight of the individual. It's the rare Hollywood film which believes in character and employs special effects in the service of the story, to create an entirely satisfying piece of cinema."

","Visually it was stunning, but found myself kinda angry during and straight up disappointed afterwards. The plot was weak (even if based on real events, they still could've have changed it a little), the actors underused, the climb felt too easy (except the oxygen problem, the only issue was with some missing ropes - solved pretty easily). While spending the last 30 minutes waiting for something amazing to happen, a miracle or something; and the scene I liked the most (in a climbing movie) was final helicopter scene. Regarding the 3D conversion: it was not great, did not bring anything to the experience. So a lot of lost potential, especially when I found out about the subject and cast last year.<br/><br/>See The Eiger Sanction and North Wall instead - those are masterpieces."

","In the capable hands of well awarded Iceland Director Baltasar Kormakur (2 Guns - 2013), this retelling of the 1966 climb to ""Mt.

Writers William Nicholson (Gladiator - 2000) and Simon Beauofy (Slumdog Millionaire - 2008) don't over write the events, instead they let the location and the situation speak for itself. While the film is packed with plenty of familiar faces (Jason Clark, John Hawkes, Emily Watson, Keira Knightly, Josh Brolin, Jake Gyllenhaal and Robin Wright - to name a few), many have not been casted in such a unique setting, and thus their performances are realistic and note worthy. Presented in 3D, the sheer madness of the films situation, and the magnitude of the mountain environment, don't require any additional visual effects. However, watching the film on a large screen is recommended."

","Everest is directed Baltasar Kormákur and is written by William Nicholson and Simon Beaufoy. It stars Jason Clarke, Jake Gylenhaal, Keira Knightly, Josh Brolin, and Robin Wright along with a slew of about ten thousand other equally talented actors.<br/><br/>A climbing expedition on Mt. Everest is devastated by a severe snow storm. Basically summarizes, the entire movie in a nut shell.<br/><br/>This movie is literally Gravity on Earth. That isn't a complete negative. Like Gravity it is well acted, well directed, and beautiful to a fault but just as thin plot wise. <br/><br/>For this review I'm going to break one of my rules and start with the negatives of this movie. This movie is very poorly scripted. The sheer potential of a story like this is as great as the title mountain. The fact that Gravity had a razor sharp edge on its themes of guilt and depression is what sets this movie and Gravity miles apart. Though the theme of redemption and survival is present they aren't as Hard hitting as they should be. Full of One dimensional characters galore this movie treads the line between watchable and enjoyable and luckily it manages to maneuver in just the right ways to succeed at both .<br/><br/>Part of its success is awarded to the stellar performances from the all star cast especially Jason Clarke and Jake Gyllenhaal. Clarke may very well be the only three dimensional character in the movie because of his phenomenal performance. It was magnificent. It offered a deep sense of dread to the already terrifying landscape and only upped the suspense factor ten folds. Gyllenhaal does the same but in a more minor way which did disappoint me. Another great aspect to the movie was the direction. Baltasar Kormákur sure hand approach to filming the actors and shot was spectacular and definitely deserves praise. <br/><br/>Now on to the single best part of this movie. This part should and will win best cinematography. The cinematographer, Salvatore Totino offers the best shots I've seen in a very long time. Rivaling Gravity in visuals if only at one thing Everest's cinematography was absolutely flawless. Every shot looked better than the last but my personal favorite was the first fall from the mountain. It was intense and unforgettable.<br/><br/>Everest is an intense thriller that doesn't let up but leaves a lot to want in terms of plot which is precisely the reason Everest Gets a B or a 6/10. This is a Thrilling Frost Bite."

","As climber, I must say that I liked the film. We must try not to compare it with the book (for evident reasons) which is much more complete, the characters are more defined, and the relationships between them makes the story more intense. I would say that the film is very focused on what happens to guide Rob Hall and Beck Weathers, but there are many interesting characters and events who are portrayed blurred. For example Anatoli Boukreev, who was instrumental in the story, appears in the background, the relationship between Rob Hall and Scott Fisher, Sandy Pittman...<br/><br/>Importantly, Krakauer's book has generated significant criticism to the point that the guide Anatoli Boukreev (which was criticized by some) wrote ""The Climb"" in response Krakauer's book.<br/><br/>Yet the film is beautifully shot and deserves note. It is appreciated that has not fallen into the sensationalism and lack of rigour of other Hollywood climbing movies as we all know.<br/><br/>7,5/10"

","Everest is a film that you know what you are going to get and it doesn't disappoint in that aspect. In fact, Everest may be something more then your typical Hollywood disaster film, with unpredictable moments and truly distressing, realistic scenes. However, with the fast paced action, you lose the ability to really connect with some pivotal characters and the film glosses over so many potentially interesting characters, that when some of them meet their demise, you care very little about their deaths.<br/><br/>Everest left me on the edge of my seat for the entirety of the film. Unlike other films of it's caliber, Everest manages to surprise and makes you positively invested in the story. Despite the loss of characterization and the addition of cheesy dialogue, Everest proves to be the best paced film this year and good for some deliberate fun."

","A majestic 3D experience and one that had full entertainment value. The funny thing was, both my brothers-in-law argued after walking out of the theatre that it was pretty cold inside, and whereas I kept quiet and let it be, the truth is that it wasn't. Although the season of autumn has taken its full effect, yesterday however was a pretty warm day as none of us wore jackets or pullovers; so there is no way that it could be cold inside, it was just the affect of what we were watching on the big screen in 3D. The great thing about the film is that the environment is such that viewers watching in theatres are bound to get a good feel of the experience of the climbers, and hence their suffering. One thing though, I would have waited a couple of months more and released this film in November or so, which would have allowed for it to have an even greater affect on people watching it.<br/><br/>Even though I know that this film is based on true events, I refrained from reading anything about the tragedy to avoid spoilers. I must add here that it is a thing very filmy to see someone going to rescue others and getting stuck, eventually dying himself, but in Robb Hall's case it indeed turned out to be true. Quite a hero he was I must admit. A brave guy. The film was going well and as one that one would rate as above good, but the tragic ending sealed the deal for me and made it a great, great film. Having had no knowledge of the event, I was stunned and shocked in the end seeing him dead, and saddened of course.<br/><br/>Andy's death for me was the most horrible scene. The first thing that I did after reaching home was to study whether such a condition exists - the one of feeling overheating despite being in the cold.<br/><br/>All in all, a brilliant film. The best thing that they did probably was to show the pictures of the people that they made the film on and to end the film with the picture of Rob's daughter. A very sweet gesture!"

","Having read the fabulous 'Into Thin Air' by Jon Krakauer I was excited to see posters around London promoting the film. The trailers certainly guaranteed a spectacular trip and the promise of 3d only added to my excitement. I watched the film last night but am sad to report that the film, as is often the case, failed to live up to the standards of the book. <br/><br/>Those that have read Into Thin Air will find the main protagonist being changed, serious omissions of the dangers of the climb but more unforgiving, omissions of the sequence of coincidental events that led up to the fatal tragedy. <br/><br/>The movie fails miserably in creating any emotional connection with the characters - Jon's character made largely insignificant. Scott Fischer is portrayed as a young hippie and Beck as nothing more than a loud mouth arrogant American with an estranged relationship with his wife. This lack of emotion ultimately sets the film up to fail as many of the protagonists meet their end. There is no shock and little empathy (perhaps none would be created if the movie had not started off by confirming it is based on a true event). <br/><br/>The use of 3d effects is minimal which is a real shame as I felt this type of movie would have had great potential. There are few jolting moments and the ascent to Everest is portrayed as fun and easy rather than harrowing and arduous. <br/><br/>All in all a film still worth watching in the cinema but best to keep expectations very low. This is neither a documentary nor an action adventure."

This movie is not about sport, neither a guide to climbing top of the world, but a weep of sorrow, a scream of pain and unfathomable risks that climbers impose on themselves.

In this movie you will see a decent camera work, which is incredible because of the conditions, not because of the amount like in the ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" (2015). Views of mountains would be appreciative for people who likes and enjoyed winter sports, for sure! <br/><br/>2. In this movie people represents mankind, no politics, no religion, no war, or something else. They are together and it's terrific! Ingvar Eggert Sigurðsson played in this movie ""Anatoli Boukreev"" who is Russian and in this climbing expedition is a hero. Thank you Baltasar Kormákur, for me it is mean a lot, especially during nowadays period. Naoko Mori played in this movie ""Yasuko Namba"" who is a hero and monumental person in Japan. When she reached peak of the Everest my eyes become wet. Jake Gyllenhaal and Josh Brolin played in this movie ""Scott Fischer"" and ""Beck Weathers"" who is from America. They played with all cons and pros, which makes me feel so amazed during the watching. ... ... .<br/><br/>3. Dario Marianelli is the composer of the movie Everest (2015). Whose works you could hear in the ""V for Vendetta"" (2005), ""Atonement"" (2007), ""Anna Karenina"" (2012), etc... His music in this movie been for me same as music Hans Zimmer in the ""The Dark Knight"" (2008), ""RUSH"" (2013) or ""Inception"" (2010). Especially I liked composition ""Summit""!<br/><br/>P.S: ""Everest wants to be Gravity for mountain climbing. It sorta succeeds."" - www-vox-com wrote that. I think you need to fire a person who compared this different kind of movies! The only movies that come to my head after the ""Everest"" (2015), are ""Vertical Limit"" (2000) and ""RUSH"" (2013).

"oscaralbert","8","1","3","4 October 2015"," EVEREST deals primarily with the pollution problem . . .
",". . . facing the main Nepalese national park, which is now littered with hundreds of human corpses. I personally have hiked ALL the trails--maintained and ""abandoned""--from the South Rim to the Colorado River in America's comparable leisure area, the Grand Canyon, and I've never seen so much as ONE human stiff cluttering a pathway there. (Several of my hikes were in the vicinity of a pack mule who had plunged to its death--or expired from old age and been kicked over the side by the wrangler--one mid-summer, and even THAT isolated carrion rarity stands out as an exceptionally odoriferous memory.) The Nepalese, on the other hand, have allowed the world's most famous peak to become festooned not only with the bodies of a plethora of suicidal rich Western geezers, but also with many tons of human waste, which constitutes a global disgrace. EVEREST glosses over this fecal nightmare, but it cannot sweep this mountain's wall-to-wall carpeting of cadavers under the rug. No one would hike into the Grand Canyon if the experience combined the outhouse scene from SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE with the set decoration for HOUSE OF 1001 CORPSES. It's surprising that the Nepalese cooperated as much as they did here in exposing their national disgrace--it seems likely some form of ""ambush journalism"" was involved. Normal people do not see anything ""heroic"" about carelessly losing hands and noses while visiting a once-pristine world treasure, but leave it to a Texan to shell out $65,000 for the ""privilege"" of doing exactly that!"
"guchrisc","Null","1","3","23 September 2015"," A small window to summit.
","As a small boy I remember seeing Spencer Tracy and Robert Wagner in the film 'The Mountain' (1956). Perhaps inspired, I enjoyed climbing trees and walls, and hanging off them, but not falling off them. I later graduated to do some hill-walking but nothing more adventurous than that. Thus, I have always had an interest in climbing films, but have avoided any recent films about chopping off ones own arm. My first thought about this new film 'Everest' was to avoid it as I had thought it set in 2014. However, the trailer looked exciting and good, and when I discovered that the film was not set in 2014, I decided to give it a go. The film is in fact set in 1996 and is a true story.<br/><br/>Named after Sir George Everest, Mount Everest is the highest mountain in the world, at 8,844m or 29,017ft of rock, with varying levels of ice upon that. The peak is actually in the stratosphere, thus exposing it to the jet-stream, and air-pressure is a third that of sea-level thus reducing the availability of oxygen. Winds can also reduce the oxygen by a further 14%. Above 8,000m or 26,000ft, is known as the death zone. In that zone you are actually dying all the time, sometimes slowly, sometimes quickly. Most deaths occur after summiting. There are 150 dead bodies lying on the mountain.<br/><br/>Thus climbing Everest is hard. Each Spring and Autumn there is a 7- 10 day window of lighter winds due to the start or end of the monsoon. Winter is cold and windy, and Autumn has the fresh snow from the Summer, thus Spring is the best time for climbing.<br/><br/>'Everest', a Universal Pictures film, is set in the Spring of 1996, and tells the true story of rival adventure companies trying to summit Everest. Adventure Consultants was led by Rob Hall and Mountain Madness was led by Scott Fischer. Both guides ran commercial companies that organized fee-paying climbing trips for clients.<br/><br/>Director Baltasar Kormakur had previously directed '2 Guns' a standard action-buddy-comedy film. Here though, he takes this true story and directs and shoots it magnificently. Some scenes were shot in Italy but others were shot in Nepal, including those shot at the South Base Camp of Everest. We see the clients arrive at the airport in Nepal, then travel from the hustle-and-bustle of the city up into the hills. An aerial shot up a valley gorge with bridges crossing it, is merely the first of many great shots. There were many others too. Watching the 3D version, you can see down crevasses, and round, and down, the sides of the mountains. The overall effect is of one huge landscape of rock carved by nature, and covered by rocks, snow, and ice.<br/><br/>John Clarke, who earlier this year played the legendary John Connor in 'Terminator Genisys', here takes on the role of Rob Hall. Curiously in both films he was a replacement for Christian Bale. Christian's loss is John's gain, and ours too, as he convinces in his role as the mountain guide.<br/><br/>Rival guide Scott Fischer is played by Jake Gyllenhaal, now highly regarded following such films as 'Source Code' (2011), 'End of Watch' (2012), and 'Nightcrawler' (2014). Here too, Jake makes his part a fully-rounded character.<br/><br/>Ingvar Eggert Sigurdsson plays guide Anatoli Boukreev and Michael Kelly plays client Jon Krakauer. Of other clients; Josh Brolin, son of James Brolin, first caught my eye for his strong performance in 'American Gangster' of 2007, he also did 'No Country for Old Men' in that same year. Here Josh plays Beck Weathers, an outstanding performance, as too was that of John Hawkes playing Doug Hansen.<br/><br/>Elizabeth Debicki, Emily Watson and Sam Worthington, play characters at base camp. Keira Knightley and Robin Wright play wives. Miss Wright is Peach Weathers and Miss Knightley plays Jan Arnold the wife of Rob Hall. Jan and Rob met and climbed a mountain for their first date, and in 1993, three years before this film was set, they had both summited Everest. Miss Knighley, who was recently in 'Begin Again' (2013), and in 2014 also appeared in 'Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit' and 'The Imitation Game', here in 'Everest', once more delivers a strong and emotional performance.<br/><br/>The dangers faced by the climbers is best exemplified by a short night-scene at base-camp. There is a hedonistic party with much camaraderie. However the next day these same people could be walking past one another, one surviving, and one dying. This atmosphere of life on the edge is caught well in the film. As too, are the issues regarding commercialization, competition, and other controversial issues. For those interested in further examining these issues, there are three different books that have been written about this Everest story.<br/><br/>An emotional rendering of a true story. 10/10."

","Okay, so Everest is a really simple story. This group, that group, all want to go the summit of Everest, with the proclamation: I have made it! But is this true story film, good enough? Yes...and no.<br/><br/>This film stars Jason Clarke as Robb Hall, Jake Gyllenhaal as Scott Fisher, Josh Brolin as Beck Weathers, and many others. Yes, this film is star studded. And that is not bad, as the film did not suffer from their presences. Everybody played their part, and good. <br/><br/>It has nice visuals, great sound design, dazzling cinematography, and at times rouses tension. But it is not tactful enough to make that tension prominent, instead the scene just passes, and another comes up. When the film wanted me to care to for a character, I just wanted to see some snow action; and this being a true story - it having happened to people, who are now dead - I think I should have felt sympathy. But I couldn't. Everest is disjointed in its narrative, containing some clichés, which could've have been left out, that I just could not care. It had its pacing issues. At points the film is moving slow, then suddenly - whoop! - action, then back to slow. <br/><br/>I think for films like this - based on true story - one should read the book to really get to grip with the story. But, no. This is a movie, not a book. The book does not matter here, and I'm reviewing the film as it was presented. And for a film based on a book about a true incident, it was okay.<br/><br/>I had fun with Everest, but in the end I just left the cinema of another movie. It does not stick with me, leaving an impression. Most probably IMAX was a better 'experience', but eh. It was okay, and that's all. And now the director is working on a film named Reykjavik.

"subxerogravity","8","1","3","20 September 2015"," Good but not all that it's cracked up to be.
","The movie did convinced not to go up a mountain, that's for sure.<br/><br/>Earlier this year, I saw a documentary celled Meru about mountain climbing junkies attempting to top a mountain that can't be climbed. I like Meru better, maybe because it was more inspirational. this movie is more grim. <br/><br/>What Everest did have over Meru was that it was far more beautiful in IMAX 3D, but the scenery did not make Everest that much more impressive than Meru, which probably worked on a fraction of Everest's budget.<br/><br/>The Best part of the movie was the climb down. It was intense dramatic and most of all harsh. Everest does not hold back the brutality of trying the conquer the mountain and getting your butt kicked.<br/><br/>Though the film has a greatly placed ensemble cast, I felt the character development itself was real weak. Most likely an overall play to keep real to those who braved the mountain, but it makes for a very cluttered narrative with too many people talking at once to truly focus on the heart string pulling moments of the few.<br/><br/>Not as good as the hype made it sound."
"lifefile2","8","1","3","20 September 2015"," If you love mountains or adventure, watch it.
","Mountains share a one-sided relationship with mountaineers. They do not necessarily give the love back. Mountains behave to their will, live by its own and retain their self-composure indifferent to the time and living beings in its proximity. That is why climbers can reach the summit but not win the mountain. They never can. If a mountain is won, it no longer remains a mountain. It reduces to a pile of rocks.<br/><br/>The film Everest understands well the fundamentally free nature of mountains. It could be because the film presents a real-life case that naturally observes this fact. But also because film makers made an effort to understand and accept it. Everest is not a tale of exaggerated heroism. Although the story has a lot of moments when characters could go out-of-the-way to save other troupe members, or demonstrate few acrobatics on snow. Fortunately, they do not. The film is also light on drama, saving some portion around the dying Rob.<br/><br/>The 120 minute adventure-thriller keeps you on the edge of your seat with many breath taking shots of Great Himalayas. I will not include it however in any special camera-work as one only needs a helicopter to fly around for these shots. The aesthetics were ready made since 450 million years back when the Himalayas were born. Rather the real skills on camera are demonstrated in climbing shots framing the climbing trails in an absolutely inspirational manner. And the camera just fires up during the hail storm creating the needed velocity and ferociousness.A Climbing Scene Viewers would enjoy the Everest travelogue, looking at the response of families as they see-off their kin to most dangerous of expeditions, how people unite at the Everest base camp, how expedition is managed by professional staff, the churning climb-up, bewitching summit clash and the flustering walk back to the lower camps. The story is compact, and keeps a solid pace. This simultaneously means film never enters the cervices, keeping a strong foot on the broad, top edge.<br/><br/>Certainly no points are scored by the film on focusing at the psychology of mountaineers, and sadly neither on the finer aspects of climbing as a skill and art. There is a bit of a mountaineer's mental process in the conversation when Beck tells Doug, he is surrounded by a sort of 'depression' at home, and it disappears when he climbs. And in the same follow-up they talk about suffering during the climb, and how it would end upon reaching back home. It is a common cycle for climbers, and in fact everyone who traverse the wild, to look upon their trail like madmen until it happens, then suffer its consequences, finally craving for the home they explicitly abhorred at the start. <br/><br/>Other than this insight, audience would no where feel the passion, grit and conditions that prepare those who engage in high altitude climbs. They'll also have no clue on the technical attributes of trails, ropes, hooks, weather forecast and equipment. I had no doubt that such a direction had made the film an Adventure Classic.<br/><br/>If you love mountains, like the wild- go watch Everest."
"eddie_baggins","7","1","3","17 September 2015"," A visually breathtaking slow burn
","While it never (please pun haters just let me have my moment and be done with it) reaches any truly great heights, Baltasar Kormakur's big screen spectacle documenting the true life Everest tragedy that befell a group of thrill seekers traversing the greatest mountain of them all, is most certainly a fantastically filmed exhilarating slow burn that is a joy to behold at the cinema.<br/><br/>Showing promise with his early Hollywood films Contraband and then 2 Guns, Icelandic born Kormakur delivers in spades here with his capturing of arguable the worlds harshest pinnacle, a peak of life or death battle of wills where quite literally your body is dying as every passing minute fly's by. Aided by an efficient behind the scenes team of D.O.P Salvatore Totino and screenwriters William Nicholson and Simon Beaufoy, Kormakur makes Everest an experience where you do feel as though your taking part in your very own type of mountain trek and it's a credit to the film that a big budget tale such as this can remain engaging in not only the big scale moments but the more small scale as well and for those uninitiated in the joys of modern filmmaking, Everest could almost be passed up as a documentary in many ways. This really is as close as many of us will ever get to such dangerous heights.<br/><br/>Capturing the land, the environment and the energy of the climb, Kormakur and his film do find themselves coming up short on characters however and while it's a staple of such disaster/survival genre examples, it would've been nice to feel a little more empathy/sympathy for our group of mountaineers. Led by the standout Jason Clarke (an Australian that keeps delivering) this all-star cast struggle to really make inroads into a loaded ensemble and while Jake Gyllenhaal and John Hawkes (as an everyday man that's both kind of inspiring and seriously annoying in equal measure) support Clarke well others in the film remain largely unmemorable.<br/><br/>From Josh Brolin's proud Texan Beck Weathers through to Sam Worthington's almost pointless appearance as concerned bystander Guy Cotter, Everest never whole heartedly gets us to commit our emotions to these people and while it's nice that human beings so often want to push the boundaries of what their capable of, it's hard to feel (speaking personally) too much sorrow when some people seem only concerned with personal goals no matter the cost to their families back home. In the end, you don't mess with Mother Nature and flirting with your life with her often ends up bad for us.<br/><br/>Everest is a worthy recipient of a trip to your local cinema and one of the better examples of its kind to come forward in quite some time. While it doesn't always make us care in the way it should, Everest is always on top of its game when it comes to providing the visual spectacle and for fans of pushing it to the limit, Everest will be a joy to behold.<br/><br/>3 ½ handy bottles of Gatorade out of 5"

","When someone takes a story like this which is based upon true events, there has to be a lot of emotions to justify the characters in it and to make people believe that its a true story. The film started off well explaining the characters a bit slowly but as time moved on and as more characters dropped in, the grip of the film started losing a bit and it ultimately failed to lose it till the end. I,for one strongly felt that the director has strongly failed in making use of the enormous cast given to him. The roles of Jake,Emily and Robin were such a waste which could've been given to any other small time actors because they ultimately failed to create any impact in the film. I felt the same even about Keira, these characters could've been given more importance or could've been attributed to more scenes. <br/><br/>Simon Beaufoy has done a great job in screenplay like his previous outings. The cinematography in the film definitely has to be given the top rank with its breathtaking shots and numerous close ups without making it look weird. On the musical front, there has been some justification but one cant find any grand music in the scenes involving Everest Summit which can be a disappointment to some people. Jason has done a good job with acting and has given exactly what was expected of him. The final verdict from someone who watches a lot of films in various genres would definitely be ""Slippery but decent"". Boasting with such a cast, one would definitely be forced to expect more but not of all our expectations will be fulfilled. The film had emotional scenes running through out the film but it was just displayed in the screen and it did not reach me even though I was sitting very close to the screen. I sincerely hope that this film will not be taken to Oscars. My personal rating to this film would be 6/10."

","Courage – Fear – Pain – Strength – all the words used in the trailer to describe this film based on a true story. Though after watching this movie I can't help but think they might have skipped a word – Insanity – because truly one must have a bit of this to even attempt to climb this mountain. To know going in that there is a 60/40 percent chance you might not come down..would and does deter most.<br/><br/>In 'Everest' we get brought back to 1996 when the big mountain had been actually been conquered enough times that it was no longer the specter it once had been. That didn't stop people from wanting to climb it, instead it ended up turning it into a business. Leader of the trend is the New Zealand business team ""Adventure Consultants"" with partners Rob Hall (Jason Clarke) & Helen Wilton (Emily Watson). The teams that head to the summit are a mix of seasoned pros and moneyed amateurs, forking over fortunes to earn both killer views they get momentarily and probably most importantly thing of course, the bragging rights. On one team you have the clients – 'average' guy, mailman Doug Hansen (John Hawkes), the big Texan, Beck Weathers (Josh Brolin), journalist Jon Krakauer (Michael Kelly) and the one small Asian woman, a 47 yr old climber of 6 of the tallest peaks in the world, Yasuko Namba (Naoki Mori) along with guides Hall, Andy ""Harold"" Harris (Martin Henderson) & Michael Groom (Thomas M. Wright) – on the other team ""Mountain Madness"" you have the college frat guy guide Scott Fisher (Jake Gyllenhaal) & Anatoli Boukreev (Ingvar Eggert Sigurðsson) who refuses to use oxygen even though they will be at a level noted by Hall as 'Humans aren't meant to function at the cruising altitude of a 747'<br/><br/>Having reached the summit and literally touched the peak — their moment of triumph – though problematic as issues with roping and lateness of the afternoon make the timetable of descent turn into a dire situation. A storm sweeps in before certain climbers have turned back. What follows is a brutal waiting game. Among those stranded in the inhospitable climate is Hansen, Harris & Hall – who finds himself curled up in a nook, patiently, almost inhumanly biding his time as numerous attempts to save him come and pass him by due to more storms.<br/><br/>Having years ago read Jon Krakauer's book ""Into Thin Air"" I hadn't realized this was going to be that story told so vividly so I recommend you go in with little knowledge of the body count as Everest plays a bit in the vein of Apollo 13, as you know the story history wise – but in this one there's only a slim chance the ones in trouble will make it.<br/><br/>The film truly focuses on the brutality of this type of climbing and what we now know was the beginnings of what the business end of this all is. All these climbs-for-hire have literally created a trash bin of Everest as what goes up, doesn't always come down. And of course the body count of those left up on the mountain has also increased exponentially since this first tragic event. And let's not ever forget all the sherpas with whom without them, most of these climbs could never be done.<br/><br/>So what's good about this movie? The 3-D is very good. Throughout most of the film you can't discern between what is the real on-location shots and what is sound-staged. Brolin & Clarke really have the lead acting roles here and both do well. Sam Worthington also comes on well more towards the end as Guy Cotter. Overall it will prove to be a rough watch with it's ending for some, but it's a good film nonetheless.<br/><br/>Grade: C+ @pegsatthemovies<br/><br/>Screening: Tuesday, September 15, 2015 ~ Courtesy of Universal Pictures"

Filled with endearing characters and impeccable private drama, it's a visually remarkable adventure and one of few movies that utilizes IMAX experience amazingly well.<br/><br/>Story follows groups of hikers in their attempt to reach the summit of Everest. It actually follows these men and women closely almost in style of documentary. The arduous process from the airport, the base camp until the highest peak is displayed in its entirety. Its story might be simple, yet the escapade itself is highly personal, one can't help being drawn alongside these modest characters.<br/><br/>This is a respectable cast, many charismatic names involved in the making. They bring their personalities to life, chances are audience will relate to most of them in their uplifting tale and they are very memorable despite mostly identified through the bulky suits. it's a humbling path and the movie aptly portrays these people not in their prime quest for glory, but also and more importantly, in their moments of weakness and need.<br/><br/>Visual is splendid as it gives magnificent view of the wintry mountain. The amount of details presented is many and thoroughly crafted. Plenty of nifty elements present aspect of mountaineering and its dangers that might not be familiar for casual audience. It's a movie that respects the source material, giving ample information to include audience in its journey. There are many moments of awe, either they are from daunting shots of the vista or the eerie psychological and physical torment of the hikers.<br/><br/>A grippingly cold and incredible engaging trek to the zenith, Everest is an inviting experience, one that is brilliant in its simplicity and deeply rich in its dramatic human relationship."

","Everest hits the heights quite well, thanks to successful acting performances and spectacular visual effects making the film an exciting, tense and suspenseful history drama popcorn thriller. This movie is based on a true story of the 1996 Mount Everest Disaster and dramatizes it very well. It's also partially based on the book ""Into Thin Air"" by Jon Krakauer, a journalist and one of the survivors. It's so intense, adventurous, thrilling and powerful thanks to brilliant direction and 3D special effects which makes this one of the best films of 2015 on my list after Jurassic World, Inside Out, Mall Cop 2 and Lazer Team. Michael Kelly does a great job portraying Jon. I think ""Into Thin Air"" is a long, tedious and a non film able book, similar to Yann Martel's 2001 Adventure fantasy novel ""Life of Pi"", yet it was transformed into a theatrical film by Director Mr. Lee, and with the help of an excellent cast, narration, changing between perspectives (haphazard flashbacks) as well as spectacular 3D visual effects, realistic green screen and computer generated imagery which made Ang's film a visual masterpiece and a faithful and delightful adaptation of Yann's book with pi's 227 day journey sure to impress the audience. Even if the movie ending is not as ambiguous as the book's, it's emotionally and spiritually insightful, beautifully coloured which amazingly portrays the book's imagery and so it overall sticks very well to the book. Same thing applies to this film. It's exciting to watch for the audience, thanks to great acting and spectacular visual effects. It's dizzying cinematography and CGI slam the heights perfectly. 10/10!!!!!"

In all honesty this film was a total let-down for me, especially as I was so looking forward to seeing it for the past few months, having read much about it.

Two commercial expeditions led by Rob Hall (Jason Clarke) and Scott Fischer (Jake Gyllenhaal) team up to climb the summit of Everest together. However a severe blizzard spells disaster for the climbers as they need to descent the mountain.<br/><br/>Despite starting slowly we never get much depth regarding the characters or their motivations.

","This is an excellent primer for anyone considering a mountain climbing experience. It ought to convince you to stay home and wait by the fireplace with a nice snifter of brandy on hand. And the thing is, for the amateur climbers who hoped to scale Mt. Everest, a lot of the prep work was already done for them, things like those ladder bridges and all the rope climbs that had to be in place in order to get up those icy verticals. Imagine if they had to do that themselves. Well, I'm convinced it's not for me, even if the end result would be that you're sitting on top of the world.<br/><br/>What one does get to consider regarding the successful climbers is what a reverence and awe they place in the accomplishment. The mountain itself is extremely unforgiving of mistakes and miscalculations, and even the pros take life into their own hands with every attempt. Then there's the often unknowable element of weather conditions that play havoc virtually at the drop of a hat. For those who make this their life's work I express my sincere admiration; it takes a certain rare individual to face all those elements on any given day.<br/><br/>The only thing that took me out of the story were the presence of the celebrity actors who participated in the project. You know going in that Jason Clarke, John Hawkes, Josh Brolin, and Jake Gyllenhaal aren't really risking life and limb for the sake of the movie. It might have been better to use less familiar faces in their roles to lend a greater pathos to the eventual fates that befell the ones who didn't make it. Still, it's a gripping story based on an actual event that occurred in 1996, and a powerful reminder that not all attempts at personal goal fulfillment will end successfully."
"paul2001sw-1","7","0","2","26 July 2019"," Characters lost in the scenery
","High altitude mountaineering is incredibly dangerous, and was once the preserve only of the most brilliant, and dedicated, climbers. But in a world where rich people look for the ultimate experience, some climbers have found they can make a living by guiding lesser mortals to the highest summits, none more desired than the highest peak in the world, Mount Everest. We know now what this has led to: queues of people on the highest point on earth, and periodic tragedy. And a big question is what it really means to ""guide"" under conditions so extreme, where anyone can lose their sense of reason under shortage of oxygen, and when demented ambition and fierce storms can wreck the best laid plans. In 1996, high altitude guiding was relatively new when tragedy struck the parties of guides Rob Hall and Scott Fisher. The presence of journalist Jon Krakauer in Hall's party ensured that the story was well-told; 'Everest' is in fact the second movie based on Krakauer's book. It's a higher budget affair than its predecessor, and a little less corny, but essentially very similar. Perhaps it brings out some of the individual stories a little less strongly, although the visuals are predictably stunning. Twenty years on, it's hard to know the right solution; but also hard not to conclude that people are very bad at calculating odds."

","The perfect oxymoron to describe the grandeur of the tallest mountain on Earth, and the tragic expedition that occurred in 1996. Due to the overwhelming number of tourists and expeditions at the time, the camps and ascent were fully occupied. Consequently, this meant certain expeditions were pushed back a few hours. Unfortunately for one held back expedition, a storm arrives that does cause icy chaos for the members. It really is a tragic story. The ambition and determination of humans against the brutality and ferocity of nature. Overcoming gargantuan obstacles that dictate life and death. In terms of the true story formula, it's fairly basic but the tragedy and emotion is delicately conveyed which enhances the compelling narrative. It does take some time to get going, particularly during the first act which showcases Nepalese culture and architecture, however once the ascent commences it pulls you in immediately. The stand out is the frozen landscape. Breathtakingly epic in scale. It's as if Everest is portrayed with its own personality. Harsh, cold and unforgiving. The white snow and icy winds look stunning (4K really enhanced this). The human characters were not developed as much as one would expect, yet during the final act you connect with them. Heartbreakingly tragic, especially between Rob and his wife over a phone call. Jason Clarke and Josh Brolin really owned the film, extremely understated performances. Emily Watson and Keira Knightley bring on the tears. Any deaths that do occur do not feel overly Hollywood, it just happens. Frozen solid, falling off the mountain edge...it's hauntingly realistic.

The film spends 40min (probably too long) introducing the characters and staying at Base Camp, but it does give you the chance to get to know them and their motivations - especially Beck (Brolin) & Doug (Hawkes).<br/><br/>That's the main question throughout - ""why""? I think it boils down to ego - man's desire to conquer everything, even nature's most extreme obstacles - highest mountain, driest desert, deepest ocean trench, outer space, etc. It is nice to see them fulfilling their dreams on making it to the summit, but once the inevitable storm blows in, it really does make you think ""these people are insane for being up there""! I definitely won't be climbing Everest!<br/><br/>It's a well-made film, with good pacing once they're climbing and some truly beautiful shots of the Himalayas - very glad they shot a lot of it on-site.

"gavondo","8","0","1","24 October 2017"," Everest (2015) in one word: Heartwrenching
","I had a pretty good idea of how Everest would play out. I read Krakauer's account of the 1996 tragedy, Into Thin Air, a number of years ago. I could recall the general story- a lot of people die. But, I couldn't remember who died exactly, so some of the story's suspense was preserved for me.<br/><br/>However, that suspense is likely to be present regardless of whether or not the viewer knows the details of the story. You almost can't help but be filled with dread as the movie progresses. The cinematography is breathtakingly vertigo-inducing at times, as the camera pivots under and around characters, highlighting the immense depths of chasms and the brutal, potential consequences of a misstep. Early in the film, it becomes evident that there is a problem of overcrowding on the mountain. Everest expeditions are businesses, and ones that seek to all accomplish the same goal in the same brief window, once per year. Rob Hall, played convincingly and endearingly by Jason Clarke, attempts to gather the different companies and work out some sort of solution. The tension between characters in this meeting serves as a precursor to the tension and confusion that will manifest itself near the mountain's summit.<br/><br/>There are many characters in Everest, yet I feel that all of them are adequately developed. They are developed to the point that when characters die it is genuinely heartbreaking. The death of expedition leader Rob Hall is particularly moving. In contrast to the deaths of other characters, several of whom simply fall off a ledge, Rob's is not quick. We spend extensive amounts of time with him, as team members and his wife (Keira Knightley) attempt to motivate him to keep him alive and moving. It is watching someone at the very edge of human limits, and it is painful.<br/><br/>There has long been debate about the veracity of accounts and depictions of the 1996 Everest expeditions. Krakauer, for one, is not a fan of the way Everest portrays what happened, calling it ""total bull."" It is, however, unlikely that we will ever be able to hash out all the details of the tragedy. Everest is successful in depicting perhaps the most important element of those events in 1996- that many passionate mountaineers, on a mountain that pushes people to limits, found their limits, and lost their lives.<br/><br/>More reviews: medium.com/@gavondo"

You're in a movie theater, the air conditioning is turned up a bit and you're almost out of popcorn.<br/><br/>""Everest"" is a visual and emotional roller coaster that retells the fight for survival of several climbers during the 1996 Mount Everest tragedy. The story follows two expeditions, one led by Rob Hall (Jason Clarke) and the other by Scott Fischer (Jake Gyllenhaal), and the storm that took the lives of five climbers from the two teams.<br/><br/>Rob is a kind-hearted, sympathetic guide who helps pioneer the idea of giving amateur climbers the opportunity of a lifetime. Scott is more carefree and rebellious. His philosophy is that if you can't make it up the mountain by yourself, you shouldn't be on the mountain at all.<br/><br/>The film's performances are one of its shining qualities. While no one stands out, Clarke, Gyllenhaal, Josh Brolin, Keira Knightly, Sam Worthington, John Hawkes and the rest of the cast deliver several tear-jerking scenes in the movie's two hour run time. The portrayals make you care about the characters. You root for Rob and his team because of Clarke's embodiment of a good man, wanting to get home to his wife (Knightly) and his soon to be born child.<br/><br/>While the characters themselves are played superbly, there's very little development of these characters, and they are placed in an uninteresting story. The movie plays out exactly how you think it will. Tragedy strikes and people die. There's nothing in the narrative that sets it apart from disaster movies that have come before it, and thankfully the story was not the focal point of ""Everest.""<br/><br/>""Human beings simply aren't built to function at the cruising altitudes of a seven-forty-seven,"" Rob tells his team at the beginning of the film, and it's not until they reach what is called the ""death zone"" that his statement begins to sink in.<br/><br/>The tension builds as the air thins, and each crunch of a footstep has you antsy for a potential avalanche, and for the perfect storm you know is coming. Baltasar Kormakur's direction and Salvatore Totino's cinematography envelop you in the icy drama, elevating the experience of the movie and overshadowing its bland narrative.<br/><br/>Over 200 bodies lay frozen on Mount Everest's slopes today that serve as a reminder for climbers of the price they may pay when pursuing such a feat. For most that set out to reach the summit however, the risk is worth the reward, and the reward comes in various shapes and sizes.<br/><br/>It's the final destination for professional climbers, the pièce de résistance of their careers. For others like ""Everest's"" Doug Hansen, the reward is found in following one's dreams and inspiring others in the process.<br/><br/>You don't have to climb a mountain to stand on top of the world. Whether it's starting your own business, writing a novel or becoming a professional athlete, we all have big dreams and should go the distance to make those dreams a reality. Brian Blessed said it best, ""You can't call it an adventure unless it's tinged with danger. The greatest danger in life, though, is not taking the adventure at all. To have the objective of a life of ease is death. I think we've all got to go after our own Everest."""

","This is a retelling of the story of two mountain-climbing teams who climb to the summit of Mount Everest in May 1996, when there is supposed to be ideal weather...and even then, it is dangerous. Why does everybody go? A Japanese woman has already climbed the Earth's other six major peaks, some media people want news stories, one man is sent by the primary school he taught at, another battles depression he only escapes by climbing mountains. The movie describes that in the past, one out of four people who make the climb perished in the attempt, but in 1992 someone decides to set up a system of camps and site employees including Sherpas to make it easier for less-expert climbers to make the attempt. But even installing ladders and ropes to bridge crevices to decrease the danger does not make the climb safe.<br/><br/>Indeed, you don't need to see the movie in IMAX to see how utterly dangerous it is to climb mountains; the visuals and topnotch performances by all the actors do an excellent job in proving this. The staff at the Everest base camp tell everyone who comes just what sorts of hazards climbers can face, but most of the people still choose to go on, with few turning back. The sad part is how some of the people leave wives and families behind.<br/><br/>If the movie does nothing else, hopefully it proves to people just what a crazy stunt climbing such a high mountain really is."

","Having just watched the mountaineering thriller EVEREST, I can report that it's the best-ever film I've seen detailing the subject matter, a mini classic of a movie that blows away memories of the similarly-themed WHITE TOWER (the old '50s effort with Glenn Ford that now seems woefully dated) and the slightly cheesy VERTICAL LIMIT. In addition, EVEREST has the hook of being based on a true story that took place in the 1990s, adding to the realism which is top notch throughout.<br/><br/>The plot ingredients of this film are familiar yet it all works and that's because they gel together very nicely. A huge bunch of characters decide to ascend Mount Everest just when a massive storm is due to hit. There's the usual gamut of back stories, rescue attempts, and back-home characterisation, and it's all thoroughly involving. The characters work well because of the ensemble cast; these are real people with no clear-cut heroes and villains, just people driven for whatever reasons.<br/><br/>The likes of Jason Clarke and Josh Brolin give performances among the best of their careers when they play down-to-earth guys like these. The sentimentalism is kept at bay which I appreciated. The CGI effects are splendid because you don't notice them - the whole thing is authentic from the outset. Icelandic director Baltasar Kormakur uses his old directorial tricks from THE DEEP in really putting you outside in the elements, making you shiver and shake as if you're there in person. It's quite splendid."

","Here is a movie about the most dangerous place on earth, and it shows in the movie. If you've ever had the idea to climb Mount Everest, but don't have the money, watch this movie and your mind will change. Let's see what I thought.<br/><br/>Synopsis: On the morning of May 10, 1996, climbers from two commercial expeditions start their final ascent toward the summit of Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. With little warning, a violent storm strikes the mountain, engulfing the adventurers in one of the fiercest blizzards ever encountered by man. Challenged by the harshest conditions imaginable, the teams must endure blistering winds and freezing temperatures in an epic battle to survive against nearly impossible odds. Starring: Jason Clarke, Josh Brolin, Jake Gyllenhaal Director: Baltasar Kormakur<br/><br/>First and foremost, let's just say that I would have given the movie an 8 if the pacing of the movie wasn't so slow to begin with. It didn't start picking up until they started to climb to the summit of the mountain. Even then, the movie was still considerably boring.<br/><br/>So, right now you're probably wandering why I gave the movie a 7. Well, even if the story was made up it is still a good story. It's a fight for survival against the greatest enemy known to man: Mother Nature. It is the story of human nature vs. Mother Nature. So, yeah, the story is the main reason.<br/><br/>The other reason is because of the acting in the movie. I don't care what anyone says, Jason Clarke is a great actor. Then you add in the likes of Brolin, Gyllenhaal, John Hawkes, Same Worthington, and even Kiera Knightly you have one hell of a cast. There is no doubt about that.<br/><br/>I know I didn't talk much about this movie, but give it a chance. It may surprise you.<br/><br/>Rating: 7 out of 10"
"rajandhanya","6","0","2","24 January 2017"," Perhaps a version of 1996 Everest tragedy. Good movie
","This film is based on 1996 Mount Everest disaster. It doesn't completely cover it, and tells the story of two main expedition teams who got involved in it. It can't be said to be a ""true story"". It can't be said to be a filmed inspired from the tragedy. It is like something that goes in between these two. Perhaps we can say it does not cover the tragedy completely but do give us the feeling – the feeling of grief and you may be engulfed in that grief cloud for a couple of days. In the initial parts, we get to see some parts of Nepal (other than the ice-capped Himalayas) but then we would get too involved in getting to know the characters that we would literally pay no attention to it. Also once we get to see the majestic mountains, new characters again get into picture, as we keep registering in our brains as to who is who, we totally forget the mountains. There aren't many shots showing the natural beauty around or any shot (long enough,) for us to gape at the beauty of the majestic mountains. But once the real mountaineering begins, one can't help but appreciate the way it has been filmed, Simply awesome. Action scenes are good, and there is no exaggeration. There is a scene where Beck Weathers falls off a ladder. This gives a small glance as to how things can go wrong. However, just the walking pace of the climbers is enough to let the audience know what the mountain can do to you. Once the descent starts, the story becomes mostly about Rob Hall (or Adventure Consultants). The other characters could have also been portrayed a bit more like in the beginning of the movie where we get a peek onto why each one is planning to summit and also an introduction to Weathers family. Same could have been done in the end too and also some thing of the Mountain Madness clients. You can't fit everything into 2 hours, I guess. When the disaster strikes, you do get a feeling that you are up there grasping for breath. Some scenes do get us into questioning some of the decisions taken by the characters, but then its all explained in the beginning, ""Its not called the Death Zone for nothing"". If you feel grief stricken and it doesn't go away after a few days, just watch the movie again. The second time you would be drawing your attention towards other things, like South Col, Balcony, Hillary Step and of course, who is who under their masks (it's a tough job. I guess they removed their masks at summit just to show us who is who!!). Again, if you are interested you can google on 1996 Everest Disaster and find out that the whole thing hasn't gotten into the movie. Also, reading Jon Krakauer's Into Thin Air. But if you are reading it, then make sure you read Anatoli Boukreev's The Climb and you get to see the whole thing from another angle. Whatever we research on, we will never be able to know for sure what all happened on that fateful day. So its best to think of it as a version of the 1996 Everest tragedy and try to enjoy it as just another movie."

","I have read Into Thin Air, by John Krakauer, which details this entire fateful ascent of Mt Everest, the tallest mountain on earth. When I saw the Krakauer character in this movie, I realized this was a movie that would be tough to watch. <br/><br/>Lots of stars, beautiful cinematography, and realistic characters all combine to make this a worthwhile film. I agree with others that sometimes things moved slowly. But a lot of the time is spent acclimatizing to high altitudes. Plus climbing at that altitude is a struggle. Living at that altitude is a struggle. I think you get the general gist of the characters. Rob Hall as owner is responsible for everyone's life. Scott from the other team is a big time risk taker, but not as organized as Hall. And the climbers, well, they are all serious, knowing they entrust their lives to this team.<br/><br/>Things eventually go sideways, and even though you've prepared for everything, when you go against the rules on this mountain, you pay a price. Their are some heroic and some very tragic moments, all played gracefully and courageously by this troupe.<br/><br/>See this movie, and you will appreciate your comforts much more. I also suggest you read Into Thin Air. Enjoy."

","More and more commercial expeditions are climbing Mount Everest. In the summer of 1996, Adventure Consultants is one of the many teams making the attempt. Rob Hall (Jason Clarke) is the veteran leader leaving behind his pregnant wife Jan (Keira Knightley) in New Zealand. Beck Weathers (Josh Brolin) and Doug Hansen (John Hawkes) are two of the client climbers. Guy Cotter (Sam Worthington) is an assistant and Helen Wilton (Emily Watson) coordinates from base camp. The group arrives at the summit late. Veteran climber Scott Fischer (Jake Gyllenhaal) had been climbing back and forth between camps. Doug convinces Rob to stay even later and then a storm hits the peak. They can't find any extra oxygen tanks. The group gets scattered and struggles to find safety.<br/><br/>The story leading up to the summit lacks narrative drive. The first half simply has no tension and the characters don't have depth. It's a series of elevation points and uncompelling events. It might be better to concentrate solely on Jason Clarke and start later on the climb. It should lay out the map and the climb better. There are some compelling scenes. It may look best as IMAX 3D. The chaos during the storm has good tension. It is able to lay out the situation despite the chaos."

","I'm not a (mountain) climber myself, but the way this movie is shot really takes you right into the heart of it all. Even if I didn't see it in IMAX 3D, I did see it on the (smaller) big screen nonetheless and it did add to the whole watching experience. It's also nice to have strong actors in this, who convincingly portray their characters (haven't seen any background or behind the scenes stuff yet, so can't talk about the amount of ""fake""/greenscreen used).<br/><br/>Having said that, this is not for the fainthearted. It takes a lot out of people to climb a mountain, even more so if it's a really big one like Everest. And the (weather) conditions are beyond what anyone can imagine, even just talking about them. So from the safety of your home or theater or wherever you're watching this, you can go on a trip that while still will is able to drain you, it will leave you satisfied and suspenseful until the end"

","I have just seen the film Everest and I will say that this is a pretty decent film. The premise is based on a true story and sees a group of expeditioners attempt to climb mount Everest when a dangerous snowstorm hits. Jason Clarke plays the main guy in this film and he does a really good job. His character was the most interesting in this film and you care about him the most because of his life at home. Josh brolin is also in this film and does a good job, you also care about his character because of his good performance. Jake Gyllenhaal was also really good in this film as a carefree climber that developed as the film progresses and you care about him. Sam Worthington is surprisingly pretty good in this role as he tries to help Clarke in the situation. The story has a pretty good man vs nature theme as you see these people try to survive the conditions. However, the film lacks any real interesting narrative and the story seems to be forgotten. The script has some great dramatic dialogue that will make you care about the characters. However, I do slightly wish there had been a little more humour in the film to sometimes alleviate the tension. The style has fantastic cinematography that really makes you feel like your on the adventure with the group. However, the pacing of the film is all over the place and it feels really slow too much of the time. Overall this is a pretty decent film that is worth a watch."

","Bored out of my mind best describes my feelings towards this film.<br/><br/>O.E. Rolvaag, who wrote ""Giants in the Earth,"" would have had a field day with this film when he spoke about the vicissitudes of nature. What these climbers of Mt. Everest had to endure, but of course we may always say, who told them to go climb the mountain to begin with?<br/><br/>The movie seems to come down to the old Irwin Allen disaster films of the 1970s. We get sympathy when we hear the pregnant wife speaking to her dying husband on the phone. Sure this evokes many a tear, but it's too late for this ultimate flop of any disaster film made. The performances are satisfactory; one such climber can't stop coughing and pulmonary edema is discussed. If you cough like that, don't go climbing. Adequate oxygen was given to the climbers but the film lacked it. I was ready to start singing from The Sound of Music-climb every mountain,etc."
"gradyharp","7","0","1","13 June 2016"," A docudrama made human
","The true story of a group of people who climb Mount Everest during a perfect storm is converted into a successful screenplay by writers William Nicholson and Simon Beaufoy, directed by Baltasar Kormákur. One of the reasons it works it the background information supplied before the film begins: 1953: Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay became the first climbers to summit Everest. Over the next 40 years, only top professional climbers attempted the same feat. One in four died. 1992: New Zealander Rob Hall pioneered the concept of commercial guiding on Everest for amateur climbers. Over the next four years his team, Adventure Consultants, successfully led 19 clients to summit without a single fatality. 1996: Other commercial operators follow Rob Hall's lead, including Scott Fischer's Mountain Madness. More than 20 expeditions compete to summit Everest in the same two week window.'<br/><br/>It is difficult to outmatch nature, and in many ways that is why this film does not completely captivate the audience: Mount Everest and the tangles of nature are clearly the star. But the story is a true one and well enacted: 'On the morning of May 10, 1996, climbers from two commercial expeditions start their final ascent toward the summit of Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. With little warning, a violent storm strikes the mountain, engulfing the adventurers in one of the fiercest blizzards ever encountered by man. Challenged by the harshest conditions imaginable, the teams must endure blistering winds and freezing temperatures in an epic battle to survive against nearly impossible odds.'<br/><br/>The casting director went overboard in this film – Jason Clarke is the titular star and on screen more than the others, but the supporting cast includes Kiera Knightly, Emily Watson, Jake Gyllenhaal, Marti Henderson, John Hawkes, Sam Worthington, Josh Brolin, Robin Wright, etc – all of whom climbing the mountain look the same – covered with snow, climbing dear, goggles, oxygen tanks – so that most anyone could have been placed on this treacherous climb.<br/><br/>But where the film succeeds is the human element: man/woman against the elements and the mutual love and concern they share. A good nature epic if a bit relentlessly slow."

","This movie was good, but it could have been better. Yes, it is based on a true story; however, that does not mean everything in the movie is true.

Those scenes gave the impression that something dramatic was about to happen, but it turned out fine.<br/><br/>On the other hand, after reaching the top of Mount Everest, the climb down s when some suspense began to build up. But it still was not anything that really draws a person in to keep guessing what was to come.

","Everest is a very enjoyable Action/Thriller but I'm not going to sit here and write as if I have in-depth knowledge about Rob Hall or the true events of what really happened in 1996. I will write about what I thought of a movie that was inspired by those true events, though.<br/><br/>Now, like I said a moment ago, Everest is a very enjoyable film, but just be aware that it's a wee bit slow for about the first 45 minutes or so as it sets a foundation for story & character development. Notice how I say it's a ""wee bit slow"" though and not boring. I personally never found any part of this film boring, even during it's slowest moments. It definitely picks up as it goes on however, and it ends up being an exciting & suspenseful true story adaptation. The tension is built very nicely and it creates an excellent sense of anticipation of what's to come as the climb continues, and because of the well made character development you feel a sense of attachment to the individual characters making you feel more saddened for each one's fate.<br/><br/>The whole look of the film was superb, especially the later moments of the movie to make it seem as if everyone was scaling Everest. It probably wasn't hard to set the initial tone & feel of the movie with the cast & crew actually being in Nepal, but all the scenes that show everyone higher up the mountain were filmed really well and it did make you feel as if you going through their journey with them.<br/><br/>Of course the cast definitely helped sell this too with their individual performances, which were all good. I thought he was wrongly cast as John Connor for Terminator Genisys, but Jason Clarke was excellent as Rob Hall, as was John Hawkes, Jake Gyllenhall, and Josh Brolin for their respective roles as Doug Hansen, Scott Fischer, and Beck Weathers respectively.<br/><br/>Everest is wonderfully directed with some amazing cinematography of Everest and surrounding areas of Nepal and it is most definitely well worth watching."

A lot of big name actors. <br/><br/>The one complaint I'd have about the movie was there was a little more build up that could have been removed to tell more of the disaster part of the story where 12 people ended up dying.

It is in such moments, like a true believer in the confessional, you are cleansed from the filth.<br/><br/>I thought by us, top right, bottom left whizzed across the ice stone. A moment later, I heard a terrible bottom, tearing the silence, the gnashing of metal on the ice. Not knowing yet what this means, without turning around, I looked down.

The fact that it's a true story, makes it even more thrilling to watch and when the huge blizzard threatens the climbers life's, it truly is ""on the edge of your seat"" excitement. Jason Clarke (Rob Hall) and Jake Gyllenhaal (Scott Fischer), lead a expedition to the top of Mount Everest but when nature takes a turn for the worse, all of the climbers end up fighting for there life's. Its definitely an emotional journey, especially when some of the climbers are stuck in the middle of nowhere with nowhere to turn and when you see there real faces at the end, you can't imagine how it must have been to be in that impossible situation. I found the film very entertaining throughout, and when I saw the bonus material, which proves that they actually filmed a lot of the film were the actually expedition took place, I have to give respect to the director and the actors who stayed true to the original story. The director could have easily used green screen to make the movie but he really wanted to respect the real climbers who sadly lost there lives during the horrific storm. Personally, I did enjoy this epic movie and I was amazed with it's authenticity and amazing cinematography but you do have to be in the right frame of mind to watch it. Enjoyable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: I'm glad that this movie made a healthy profit at the box office, because it really did deserve it. Director, Baltasar Kormakur, 49, who also brought you A Little Trip To Heaven, Inhale, Contraband and 2 Guns, picked the perfect cast for this project and it's a great story to bring to light. You really do feel like your there with the climbers, while they are on there epic expedition and the emotional scenes from Emma Watson, Sam Worthington, Keira Knightley and all of the distraught climbers, all contributed to this movie being a great watch.<br/><br/>Budget: $55million Worldwide Gross: $204million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their adventure/biography/dramas starring Jason Clarke, Josh Brolin, Jake Gyllenhaal, Martin Henderson, John Hawkes, Emily Watson, Sam Worthington, Keira Knightley and Robin Wright. 7/10"

It always bothers me when films set in these harsh conditions have actors removing their protection to show their faces, but once again it's a movie. These are the best actors and a crew that truly suffered to bring this true story to the big screen. There is no faking dealing with those conditions in order to make a film like this. The writing is top notch. This is so much more than just about the tragedy, but what actually caused it. Introducing commerce into a world it has no business in has changed the landscape of that region and created a false sense of security for fools with more money then brains. Rob Hall was a victim of Karma. He saw an opportunity to make money over the fact that those who have no business on the mountain should not be there. I think the movie really showed all aspects in what eventually created this disaster, if you wanna call it that. All of these people were there of their own volition, a disaster would be something more like the tsunami in 2004. When I see the haters of movies like this along with so many more on the IMDb, I don't get upset I just know those people have never done anything substantial in their lives and have no idea what it takes to make something like this. This is a great, very even handed telling of an amazing story in the history of this world."

","This is based upon a true story<br/><br/>Rob Hall (Jason Clarke) started the concept of guiding amateurs to the top of Mt Everest. His idea spawned other enterprises. In 1996, many such teams contemplated the climb and they have a 2-week window in which to do it. The start date is 10 May 1996. Hall and another company run by Scott Fischer (Jake Gyllenhall) agree to team up to lessen the congestion. All seems good until a vicious storm comes around and later comes around again. Oh, oh <br/><br/>This movie was actually shot on Mt Everest. Of course we expected to see CGI play a very big roll in this and it was spectacular to say the least. Some of the photography is overwhelming and sometimes scary too. <br/><br/>We learn that Sherpas are the ones who set the ropes up the mountain for the climbers to hold onto. They also install ladders over crevices. Also the Sherpas are the ones who preposition oxygen tanks at designated locations up the mountain.<br/><br/>I didn't know there were that many base camps at varying elevations. Communications back to the states was set up via a satellite link. All members of all the teams had Walkie-Talkies. I was surprised to see that many partook in alcohol waiting to go up. I would have thought booze was a no-no. Guess not.<br/><br/>Everyone has a reason to climb Mt Everest. It isn't just because ""it's there."" Doug Hansen (John Hawkes) needs to show his kids they can achieve anything in life. Beck Weathers (Josh Brolin) needs to prove to himself that he can do it as he failed to climb Mt Mckinley to the top. <br/><br/>How much does it cost someone to join Rob Hall's company for the climb? At one point Beck mentions that he paid $65,000. Is this true? I have no idea. <br/><br/>When the storms hit, the intensity multiplies and with the winds whipping all over the audio suffered as sometimes it was difficult to hear what the characters were saying. Talk about realism. Ha! It was like we were there. <br/><br/>Notables: Robin Wright as Peaches the wife of Beck Weathers. Keira Knightley as Jan, the wife of Rob Hall. Sam Worthington as Guy Cotter. Emily Watson as Helen the main communicator with Rob's team.<br/><br/>The acting all around was sensational. Jason Clarke as Rob Hall is really coming into his own regardless of any role he plays. Kudos. <br/><br/>This movie will keep you engaged and you do hope all ends well. At the end of the movie you will learn what happened to everyone. (10/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No."

In this expedition two guides Rob Hall from Adventure Consultants and Scott Fischer from Mountain Madness and their crews going to climb Mt.

It reminded an even better version of ""Vertical Limit"" with a touch of ""K2"". I liked also the interpretation of Jake Gyllenhaal who played as Scott Fischer and the interpretation of Jason Clarke who played as Rob Hall. Another interpretation that I liked was John Hawkes who played as Doug Hansen and I believe he was very good. This movie has a lot of suspense with plenty of scenes which can be characterized with the breathtaking. All the credits about this go to Baltasar Kormákur who was responsible for the direction of it and obviously he did a great job on it.<br/><br/>Lastly I have to say that ""Everest"" is a very interesting movie to watch because it shows us the truth about climbing a mountain like Everest and the difficulties that you have to go through. I recommend it to everyone and especially to mountain lovers."

","'Everest' is, if nothing else, a technically impressive film, and like the mountain it's named after, it's a wonder to behold visually. And in this day and age of CGI, I'm sure there are cheats, but they're exceptionally well hidden. The characters were there, knee deep in real snow, and that pays dividends when things go to Hell.<br/><br/>For the most part it eschews adding dramatic spice in an effort to give it some ""flavor"" (There aren't any Celine Dion ballads here), preferring a more nuts and bolts narrative of the real life disaster in the docudrama style. The first hour or so is a little slow going, but the payoff comes in the final hour, when the time spent with these people makes you care when disaster strikes. It's not that we get to know the characters very well, but the very strong cast help to lift the material and make their characters and their dire circumstances seem real.<br/><br/>'Everest' isn't quite the film it aspires to be, but it's an ascent worth taking."
"Reno-Rangan","7","0","1","4 February 2016"," One of the most realistically approached adventure movie based on the real.
","I was completely surprised with the movie. Because I was expecting 'Vertical Limit' kind of movie. Like, you know, there's no heroic adventure with the incredible stunt sequences in it. But it was very real and more real. Usually while adapting the true events for the screen, unnecessary overdose stunts created to commercialise the product. But in this it was too much closer to the real world adventure, like a documentary film.<br/><br/>It was a man versus the mother nature and nothing else. The human villains were not included or the romance and other subplots. It was a multi starrer movie. Lots of big names played only a small role and magnified the expectation for the movie. But like I said expecting awesomeness will lead you to a great disappointment. One must approach this movie with a clear mind for a good result, because I felt the film very honest, and being honest is always a bit boring.<br/><br/>The film was emotionally very strong. No character developments, not individually, but the entire film was focused on one particular expedition taken by a couple of trekking teams that goes wrong after they got hit by a storm. This is Jason Clarke's one of the best films in a lead role, as well as for the director of 'Contraband'. I definitely regret missing it out in digital 3D. It is a good watch, absolutely refreshing from the mainstream commercial films.<br/><br/>7/10"

","In 1997 I came home from work one day and my wife told me she saw an author on TV named Jon Krakauer and maybe we should get his book. It was ""Into Thin Air"" and as soon as we started reading it, we were hooked. It is among my top 10 most compelling books of all time. It is about the tragic ascent of Everest attempted by two climbing teams in May 1996 - and the subsequent deaths of 8 of the climbers including two elite climbers who were also guides.<br/><br/>Right after the book came out a terrible made-for-TV movie with the same name as the book. So, those who did not read the book had little chance to experience the drama, tragedy, and emotions of the event. <br/><br/>Until now. <br/><br/>""Everest"" captures all the drama and wrenching emotions of the disastrous climb. The movie is beautifully shot and the deaths painfully and realistically portrayed. Even though my wife and I had read the book and knew the outcome, we found ourselves rooting so hard for the doomed climbers who were trapped on the descent.<br/><br/>The scenes where Rob Hall is talking to his pregnant wife back in the U.S. while he is stranded and dying on the mountain are very emotional. The moment that those in Base Camp realize that lives had been and were being lost even as they tried vainly to send other climbers to rescue them was torture - for the players and the audience. It is amazing how connected one can get to people in a movie in such as short time.<br/><br/>I believe that our enjoyment of the movie was greatly enhanced by reading Krakauer's book - even though it was 19 years ago. My advise: read the book - then watch the movie. You will not regret it."

","I give films a vote of above 7-8 really seldom and let me begin with explaining how I rate them. At the beginning I consider the film to be perfect with 10 points. But in process of watching film I deduct point by point for some minor aspects. Most common minor aspects are stupid dialogs, stupid acting, weak places of plot, absolutely unrealistic moments. That tally 7-8 point for the greatest films of nowadays. Getting down to our film, I had almost no reason to deduct any of points for the above-mentioned minors. Everything in film is nearly perfect. The film begins with absolutely outstanding shots of the Himalayas. Every technical part of film (sound, picture, editing) is perfect. In such kind of films it is more than important to have a viewer deep in the atmosphere. The plot was written very carefully, due to the multiple sources, such as books of the participants of the notorious climbing, which took place on Everest mount in 1996, documentary film (1998) and true facts. I can't imagine plot to be any better, because it is always hard to adopt true story for a film, especially with a genre like this. But there are still a few shots, I consider shouldn't have taken place in this film. That goes to ""not perfect plot"" and the reason of vote 9 out of 10. At the same time film is not overextended, I would even say it is rather brief, keeping you near the screen all the time.<br/><br/>I will not tell much about acting, it is just very impressive. And there is not unrealistic exaggerations in the film. It also contains some moral about a lot of things, shown in small dozes. The movie is very colorful and simply beautiful, you can enjoy Himalayas all through the film.

","A lot of the reviewers here who have voted low on this movie were expecting an ACTION movie. Well, sorry folks. Go and watch some trashy JJ Abrams or Michael Bay rubbish if you want that. This movie is actually a DRAMA. Why is it a drama? Because it is based on TRUE EVENTS. And that is where it leaves ACTION and gets into DOCUMENTARY. And this is where this movie SUCCEEDS.<br/><br/>It does not go all ""Hollywood"" on the script and add in ""action"" scenes to appease the popcorn eating morons that can't comprehend anything more than flashing lights, bangs and sirens. It does not even have a ""good guy"" and a ""bad guy."" It has to be ACCURATE otherwise it can only claim to be ""based on true events"" instead of being ""a true story."" So shut up idiots who said this movie was ""boring"" or ""had no action"" etc etc etc. YOU people are boring and your attention spans are that of children. <br/><br/>Having said that, the movie is well made. There are big names in it. The only thing that annoyed me slightly is that lead character is played by an Australian and makes absolutely ZERO effort at sounding like a New Zealander which he is supposed to be. It makes me wonder if that was intentional. Imagine this: some ""true-blue"" New Zealander in the main role would lose most of the audience with his unintelligible accent, due to their horrendous treatment of vowels, ""the ear is thoon ... and the weether is bed."" (This is the very reason New Zealanders can't be understood by the rest of the English-speaking world.) SO, I get it. At least Australian vowels are more in keeping with the rest of the world. On the other hand Keira Knightly and Emily Watson's New Zealand accents were almost dead on - as busted as that accent is. Good effort, ladies. I cringed in all the right places. <br/><br/>The story was well executed. The ending was quite touching. Knowing that this is an unembellished telling of true events it makes it even more emotional. <br/><br/>My hat goes off to this great mountaineer and New Zealander (sorry, won't fall into that kitschy, cutesy thing of calling a New Zealander a ""Kiwi."")"

I want to talk about Clarke's performance and how fantastic it is! He really nailed the role, and I would not be surprised if he's nominated for an Oscar! As for his crew, there's Josh Brolin, who does an amazing job at capturing his character, and another possible Oscar nominee. There's Jake Gyllenhaal, who was very good at his part, and John Hawkes did another great job, and maybe he'll get the nomination as well! The visuals were magnificent and absolutely deserve a nomination as well. Considering how realistic it looked and how cold the movie theater was, I thought I was there climbing Mount Everest with them. There's a few side performances that really, REALLY nail it. There's Keira Knightley, who plays the wife of Jason Clarke, and man, she did a good job, especially for how little time she had. But honestly, Emily Watson tears your heart out. She really is maybe my favorite performance in the whole thing, and get this, one of my favorite supporting actress roles, EVER! The cinematography was good, the directing was good, it was ALL GOOD! It even reminds me of Jurassic Park a little bit, the first half is good and sets up what's coming, and the second half is the action packed part that has you on the edge of your seats. Will this be a classic like Jurassic Park? Probably not, but it is very very very good! As for the negatives, there really isn't much. When they had their hoods up and masks and goggles on, it was hard to tell who was who, and it got a little confusing at times. And the group consisted of maybe a dozen people, and it got confusing who was what, and why who was there, and who has different fates than others, and when you see who walks down at the end, you're like 'Oh, there they are! Where were they the past half hour?' But you cant change the true story aspect. Overall, Everest is suspenseful, it's a pure thriller, it's fun, and deserves to be nominated!"

","This movie is well shot and a dire warning to mountaineering freaks that in the end only Everest rules, which is illustrated in the opening scene. Because no man made air propelled flying machine is able to elevate high enough to get a top down shot of the Everest, the highest viewpoint is taken at the balcony level. The Russian guy knows whats coming and refuses to rely on oxygen bottles as aid to battle the height. In the spring of 1996 two truckloads of people are aspiring to reach the Everest summit and a discussion arises how to manage all these climbers within the same two week window to the top. Anatoli Boukreev says ""We don't need competition between people. There is only competition between every person and this mountain. The last word always belongs to the mountain."" The story of Texas American Beck Weathers (Josh Brolin) is very well covered in this movie, who complains to tour-guide Hall that for a $65,000 fee he doesn't expect to queue up to cross a death pass like standing in line at some Wall Mart's. After that Beck is on his own, literally, a very telling experience. The aim for summit is planned on May 10th, by both tour-guides, Rob Hall and Scott Fischer, and leads to heated verbiage and risk taking actions. When first climber reaches summit, Everest has seen enough little hands and feet of this commercial climbing parade and a devastating storm hits all base camps simultaneously which endures for two days. The end checks and balances in loss of life and limbs are devastating. Everest has spoken and has the last word."

I can think of dozens of other films I've seen that were ruined by inserting swear words where they seemed out of place. I applaud the movie Everest for being an intense adventure movie that used virtually no objectionable language--at least that I can remember. The lack of offensive language was incredibly refreshing.<br/><br/>The footage and drama were in this movie were riveting.

It rushes in the earlier scenes where it should have taken A LOT more time to develop the characters because with so many of them in the movie, we hardly get to know them or care for them and hence makes the subsequent events less impactful. The journey to the summit could have also benefited from more development and the release could have been so immense. <br/><br/>Regardless of its short comings, it was a solid film.

I found it difficult to identify the protagonist or simply follow the characters due to its location. The first act is aimed to soften up the characters, well their attempt at creating character development, the 2nd act was a slow paced, tedious journey to the top of the mountain, which felt like an eternity to reach its climax, until the last act where I was blinded by a snow storm and deafened by the howling wind. I see that's the point but at least I want to experience the characters rather than the environment. Despite its slow and distracting pace there were infrequent intense moments but very few and very far apart. The 3D wasn't utilized very well, it focused more on the depth, but my eyes easily adjusted to their norm. Again this could have been a character driven, emotional drama thriller, with intense disastrous sequences, I am aware there are a few snow storm survival thrillers but with a great cast and a capable director they could have done it right, loss of potential in my eyes anyhow."

","Everest is a drama film about the 1996 Mount Everest disaster which resulted in the deaths of several mountain climbers. Even though I know absolutely nothing about mountain climbing, nor do I have any interest in ever doing so myself, I really liked the film for the most part. It shows how this dangerous sport can easily become a life or death situation for all those involved.<br/><br/>Since Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay first successfully reached the summit of Mount Everest in 1953, many other mountaineers have tried, and often failed to do so as well. One such mountaineer, a New Zealand man named Rob Hall (Jason Clarke), had managed to ascend to the top of Everest a record 4 times. This movie chronicles what would have been his fifth successful ascent to the top. Upon reaching the peak of the world's tallest mountain, Rob, along with the rest of his fellow mountaineers, are caught in a deadly snowstorm, which hinders the groups' progress in descending back to the bottom. Several members of Rob's group end up separated in the freezing cold snow with no other way to reach one another. Many frantic attempts at communicating with them via radio by the crew at the base camp offer them limited reassurance that most of the mountaineers will make it out of this expedition alive.<br/><br/>I feel that this film's true story transitioned very well onto the big screen. The cinematography of Mount Everest was excellent and really made you feel as if you were right there with the mountaineers on top of the world's tallest mountain. Jason Clarke, in a role originally intended for Christian Bale, was great as Rob Hall and Keira Knightley was very good as well playing Rob's pregnant wife Jan. Josh Brolin shines too, playing an American doctor named Beck Weathers who wanted to climb to the top of the mountain with Rob's group. Even though this film solidified my determination that I will never go mountain climbing, I still very much enjoyed it.<br/><br/>I rate it 8/10."

Those that were lucky enough to make it off that mountain are lucky to be alive.<br/><br/>Beck Weathers was an amateur climber with an extremely worthy resume but lost his hands and nose in this climb due to the story and the number of people in that mountain that year.<br/><br/>Jon Krakauer's story of a journalist making it to the top of the world and back and the journey of others who risked it all and more but this movie shows the missing information from his book Into Thin Air by adding in accounts from Beck Weathers, Anatoli Boukreev and another survivor who have since written about the disaster and this is to Krakauer's benefit. Krakauer leaves much to be desired in his account by taking potshots at other climbers and this account clears things and shows that disasters happen even when you plan.<br/><br/>Congrats to an amazing cast and crew on putting together a brilliant story of a tragedy that needed to be told.<br/><br/>I hope the families of those left behind are proud of this film as no one is made to be the villain. They are all hero's and fighters.<br/><br/>Beautifully made. See it as soon as possible."

","After climbing a simple mountain, it's easy to imagine that your suddenly qualified to be a mountaineer and scale the tallest peaks. It's easy to think that you can buy a good backpack and take the next plane to Nepal to take on the beast that is Mount Everest. But nobody knows what their in for until they take on another mountain. Maybe not Everest, but something smaller that would still be hard.<br/><br/>While one could imagine themselves scaling Everest, once they look at the money and the health risks involved, they then look for a new hobby. It's not that taking on the mountain is impossible, but only the most experienced should be even trying. Tour groups know though that if people have money, then they are willing to go anywhere whether or not they even have experience. Even with the money, there's no guarantee that you would even make the summit; the physical strain is enough to make anyone cry for their mommy, but the window to scale the peak is so narrow that there have been years in which there were no successful summits to the top. Everest is an enduring story on why better planning is needed when issuing the right to climb the mountain. <br/><br/>In 1996, Rob Hall (played by Jason Clarke) is the leader of Adventure Consultants, a tour group that promises that they will try to get you to the summit of Everest, with little experience needed (though he highly recommends experience). In his tour this year is Texan Beck Weathers (played by Josh Brolin), mailman Doug Hansen (played by John Hawkes) and experienced mountaineer Yasuko Namba who has climbed the six highest mountains of the world. They fly into Nepal, make friends and get the expedition spiel from Rob who warms about the mountain and certainty of death.<br/><br/>The group makes the long hikes to base camp where the meet up with the base camp manager Helen (played by Emily Watson) and competing leader of another group, Scott Fischer (played by Jake Gyllenhaal). The two groups agree to team up to avoid delay so that they can make their planned May tenth ascension. The majority of the group makes it to the top against altitude sickness in the death zone, but hit an unexpected blizzard that strands most of the climbers in the whiteout and frostbite. The goal is no longer for everyone to get down, but for anyone.<br/><br/>Everest is based of the real life 1996 tragedy and the films does not light foot around that. I'd say that this is a two part story; the first being about the climb and the other about the blizzard and the sadness around those that died. I'd say that I really enjoyed the first half more then the second. <br/><br/>The cast here is perfect. They manage to make themselves distinct in a surprise large group of people. I give extra points for Jason Clarke and Josh Brolin who carry a lot of the climb in this story. It's clear the most the climbing was real as the conditions I've witness only make me want to stay away from the mountain. I wouldn't last more then three days on Everest.<br/><br/>The first half makes for a thrilling adventure, so what happened with the blizzard scenes? It's not that their thrilling, but the pacing is strange; thirty minutes of wondering through the cold, and then everything is all about the sadness of the tragedy. While it is important to acknowledge the sadness, Everest practically steps into soap opera territory. They really should have cut it down and toned that out better.<br/><br/>I'll give this five Everest summit flags out of five. The last half is so uneven and long that it could have ruined the picture, but the first half was just so enjoyable that it wasn't a total loss. Everest is not an easy watch, but if you're at least curious about the climb, I'd recommend it. Just be ready for a hard second act."

","I agree with LemonLadyR from United States. ''Claustrophobic'' photography & characters. To the question ''Why do you climb the Everest'' some answer by 'because I've climb many big pics before (which is not an answer), some may answer with 'because it's there', well, It could be the same answer to 'Why do you play Russian roulette? Because there's a gun loaded on the table... the real answer: Vanity... bragging for the feat. Accomplishment is an uplifting quest. Everest symbolizes it. But it's a counterproductive sport, the training is interesting but the real job brings you only physical and brain damage, as the guide says ''You will be literally dying''. They say they died climbing the Everest, in fact, about 70% died in the ''descent''. Some stats about the death rate of...'descending' the big mountains: ANAPURNA = 41%, K2 = 32% and EVEREST = 25% (they say 1 out of 4 in the film, but the stats in Matador Network are more around 20%). Alternative: Russian roulette, only 8%. Do you realize it's 500% safer than trying Anapurna. OK I know, 1 out of 6 is only 16% but only 50% +- of the 'players' died. The 'survivors' are in fact in a cripple condition worse than death, same for many of the mountaineers who survived the 'adventure' (injuries of 1996 are a lot worse than reported in the film). They've banish Corridas almost completely, if conjuncture don't change, maybe someday it'll be applied to stop the bumper-to-bumper line to the big mountain."
"AkelaLoneWolf","8","0","1","12 October 2015"," Worth watching - in spite of the heavy heart.
","I wasn't too keen for disaster movies but went on insistence by my dining companion. Whether one chose 3D viewing or not depended on one's tolerance of wearing the uncomfortable glasses for hours looking at images of glaciers, cliffs and precipices; we chose to brave it. Here we have a movie depicting the helplessness and the futility of mankind against the raw savagery of nature at its harshest - a most sobering and humbling experience. This was not an exact documentary of the events that occurred over that fateful period in May 1996, but it did faithfully describe the interactions, the emotions and the blunders of the major teams on Mount Everest at the time (except for the Taiwanese team, as one of their climbers was actually doing a Lazarus together with the Texan - as I learnt later). The portrayal was intense but not over-dramatic, as this would have degraded this movie into sob stuff. The inevitability of the chief protagonist's demise was handled with dignity and one could not but admire and honour the memories of him and other climbers (especially the postman - his reasons for climbing made that night's gathering the single most touching scene). Some would have pointed out that the tragedy resulted from multiple mistakes and oversights (the feud between teams and Sherpas, the mysteriously empty oxygen bottles, the refusal to accept one's physical condition, the competing and discordant summit attempts, the lack of preparation work, the under- or over-estimation, etc.), which was certainly true in hindsight. The good things that came out of this were the review of teams' summiting attempts and the fact that this tragedy did not extinguish the passion of humans to pursue their dreams. Therefore it was not a surprise to also find a full description of the events on the current website of the Adventuring Consultants. A meaningful movie and worth the time in spite of the heavy heart."

","Ever since I found out that there is going to be a movie about 1996 disaster, I was thrilled. I had just read ""Into thin air"" by J. Krakauer, one of the survivors, and I was so moved by it, that I wanted to learn something more. And when I read that this movie won't be entirely based on this book, I was even happier because it meant new perspective. <br/><br/>I have to say - Jason Clarke was the perfect choice. I didn't know him before, I had seen only ""Zero Dark Thirty"", but that was it. At first I actually hoped, that Jake Gyllenhaal will have a bigger role, just because I knew what to expect from him. But Jason really shined as Rob and his and Keira's conversations touched me. <br/><br/>It was beautifully filmed, the sound effects were fantastic, and, since I had read the book, I had almost no problem to identify the characters. The only thing that I wanted to change was that I wanted to know more about others as well. Rob was the only one I actually cared about, and I don't think that was only my problem - it's just that the others didn't capture my attention.<br/><br/>Overall it was a beautiful movie, but I don't think that 3D is necessary."

","This is one movie that you should really try and see on the largest screen possible. Really wanted to see the movie on an Imax in 3d, but had to settle for 3d. Probably the first film that's been worth watching in 3d this year.<br/><br/>The movie tells the true story of the 1996 season where commercialisation made the mountain extremely busy. The movie follows a number of groups as they plan their assault on the peak of the world.<br/><br/>It is probably fair to say that the movie compromises the plot in favour of the spectacle, but the underlying story is still interesting. The scenery is truly spectacular and having been to the top of Kilimanjaro I could certainly relate to the efforts that were required by the climbers. If you can see this on the Imax screen in 3d.

","Back in 1996, two ""package tour"" groups of climbers on Everest hit problems due to inadequate preparation, lack of fitness, and unanticipated bad weather.<br/><br/>This film's high-powered cast plays second fiddle to the spectacle on display. We learn just enough about key figures for us to identify with them when things go wrong, and to care about whether they make it back safely or not. The actors all do well, although Emily Watson as the base camp co-ordinator probably comes off best – I also like Keira Knightley's small but emotional performance, and Josh Brolin's character arc.<br/><br/>But above everything, this film is utterly spectacular, especially in 3D. Much of it must have been greenscreened, but the greenscreen is, for the most part, flawlessly integrated into background plates and CGI, and it is clear that the cast must have been exposed to at least some physicality above and beyond straightforward studio/location work.<br/><br/>Frankly, a lower profile cast would probably have been effective, because the strength of this film lies in its visuals and suspense. It is worth seeing, and preferably in 3D."

","I recently watched this film to witness the tallest summit in the world. Everest stands 29,029 feet above sea level. This film is based on true events that took place on the May 1996 expedition. This has been a well know story that was depicted in the best- selling account of the expedition by Jon Krakauer's Into Thin Air. <br/><br/>As the movie begins we see a few men traveling to Nepal that we learn to know as Beck, Doug, and Jon Krakauer. Soon after we are introduced to Rob Hall the guide for the team. <br/><br/>I enjoy watching a movie that is based on true events first before reading about the films fact base. The reason being it adds to the natural emotions intended by the director. Since this story was not only published, but had taken place over 19years ago, it would be unwise to assume this story was already known. In my anticipation to watch this movie I read a review that explains the story line. Moreover, I came to find out this review had spoilers of the true events and read of 8 people dying on this mountain. <br/><br/>Although, I had known 8 people died this day I was unaware of the popularity surrounding this day. May 10th has been the day Rob Hall had summited 4 years before. The film focuses on the clients of Rob Hall and their personal stories leading up the reason why they are all here to climb Everest. Rob was a well-known and respected guide to the summit due to his fame of summiting the most number of times. Others provided the nickname ""Mountain Goat"" or ""Show"" for Rob Hall. His date of climbing had also been known amongst the other guides as the day to summit. This is depicted in the movie and in each of the climbing books as one of the busiest days in each of the preceding years. <br/><br/>This amount of traffic is one concern that is consistently discussed and highlighted on. There is a one-lane path to the summit known as the Hillary Step. This has been another bottleneck for climbers trying to summit since only a fixed number of climbers can be on the narrow pathway. <br/><br/>Within the movie Rob Hall calls a meeting for the guides to discuss summiting on alternative days. These other guides were insulted to be told what day they can climb with their clients and the meeting was thereby ended. <br/><br/>The film highlighted many facts about the mountain and the sickness that can come with the accent. Hall lays out the dangers of summiting Everest in his briefing to his team before they even set foot on the mountain. He explains, ""Human beings are not designed to function at the cruising altitude of a 747. Your bodies will be literally dying."" It is later found out that they individually paid a lot of money ($65,000 each) to get them to the top of Everest. Rob further discusses that the point is not to get to the top, but safely back down. The experience in my opinion made Everest seem as if you were told to wear a lead- suit and climb 200 steps in freezing temperatures. This is an annoyed, but understanding point of the events that took place. The movie focuses on the preparation of acclimatizing for a majority of the movie. Then some of the various teams are seen summiting after the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th camps cites. Unfortunately, this made the movie seem anticlimactic while at the summit. I was hopeful for more of an awe-inspiring scene or two leading up to the team's summit. <br/><br/>Although, I felt that we were suddenly at the top of Everest there was more to this film. And if you knew the turn of events, you knew that the climax had only just begun. This film still managed to inspire me and teach a few ethical dilemmas we may face at some point in our lives. <br/><br/>Works Cited:<br/><br/>Everest. Dir. Baltasar Kormákur. Perf.

"burlesonjesse5","8","0","1","6 October 2015"," VIEWS ON FILM review of Everest
","Most movies associated with historical significance, are four star affairs or Academy Award darlings. The one I'm writing about doesn't quite reach that plateau (it has an episodic, pilot feel during the first half). Darn it though if the proceedings don't come incredibly close (with cigar firmly in reach).<br/><br/>So OK, let's meet the antagonist of 2015's Everest (my latest review): The mountain itself, all 29,029 feet of it. There's plenty of ice, plenty of ""detachments"", and a lack of oxygen. With it comes man versus nature, ""David and Goliath"", reach the summit or reach quietus. Now let's encounter this film's protagonist: Every freaking climber who tries to conquer Earth's highest point and gets their butt kicked. ""It's not the altitude, it's the attitude"" quips co-star Jake Gyllenhaal (he plays real-life, expedition group leader Scott Fischer). Well attitude can only get you so far when low atmospheric pressure and frostbite take hold. Just a walk in the park boys! Yeah right.<br/><br/>Echoing 1993's Alive (I don't know, I guess it's the particulars of red cheeks and sleeping in frigid, blustery weather that reminded me) and based on a true story circa 1996, Everest chronicles a dozen or so climbers bent on arriving at its grand, pointy peak. At a running time of two hours, it starts out as a slow burn. There's fascinating stuff here, a lot of educational fodder (this thing is a playbook on how to climb any apex-enhanced structure), some TV movie interludes, some film strip pauses, and plenty of brief character introductions. Yeah a few climbers make it to the top, flags are planted, hands are raised, and heavy breathing commences. It all happens relatively fast. Then they try to climb back down while a brutal snow storm approaches (in the month of May no less). That's when the film kicks into high gear. You think the journey to get up to Chomolungma was your baby. Well, you'd be dead wrong.<br/><br/>Now with Everest, there are muscular portrayals by all the actors. Well-known stars (Jason Clarke, Sam Worthington, Robin Wright), Oscar nominees (Gyllenhaal as mentioned earlier, Josh Brolin, Keira Knightley, Emily Watson, John Hawkes), and relative unknowns (Michael Kelly, Tom Wright) contribute to its realism, its accuracy. Granted, this is the type of fluff that mountaineers will pay attention to, be glued to, really feel in their blood. I know nothing of their sideline but alas, my stomach was in my throat, I forgot to breathe, and panic set in. Oy vey!<br/><br/>Overall, beautiful cinematography, a considerable cast, and accurate locales (certain scenes were actually shot in Nepal's South Base Camp) make Everest a candidate for one of the year's best. A powerful, powerful movie-going experience. Rating: 3 and a half stars."
"Lejink","7","0","1","3 October 2015"," Trouble at the top
","Watching this film was almost as gruelling as the work the actors put in themselves in this latest movie to recreate a true-life tragedy and yet I found its two hour duration passed by very quickly, so involving is it for the viewer.<br/><br/>I myself wasn't aware of the real story behind the film although with the recent avalanche tragedy on the mountain still fresh in the memory, it had a topicality about it even if it wasn't an avalanche that caused the tragedy here. Instead the causes appeared to be a lack of cooperation amongst competing teams aiming for the summit, poor timing at key stages of the climb, poor communications with the back-up team but of course the main reason was just sheer bad luck as a freak storm blew up and critically held up the descent and left the mountaineers exposed to the elements at their must severe.<br/><br/>There's no question that the almost documentary-style realistic approach was effective, with the weather effects and make-up work in particular putting the viewer right into the action. There were also some marvellous panning shots from on high lending an appropriate scale fitting to the monumentality of the physical task required to conquer the highest peak in the world. Of course the irony is that rather like Scott at the South Pole, the climbers here achieved their aim but couldn't complete the actual task which is to afterwards get back safely to base.<br/><br/>This isn't really an actors' film in my opinion given the set up of the film plus with their heavy out-wear clothing, profusion of beard-wearers and with their faces often covered up with snow and ice, it was heard for any of the lead actors to be really prominent but I actually felt this benefited the realism of the story anyway.<br/><br/>In the end the viewer must decide whether the attempt on the summit was brave or foolhardy. The sad answer of course is that it was both but while I'm a bit of a white- knuckle fiend myself, this film convinced me very effectively that climbing Everest will certainly never make it onto my own bucket list"

First off, I will never, ever understand the people who willingly put themselves into, not only harm's way, but a terrifying, frigid, unforgiving harm's way such as this. The entire cast was more than up to the standards a movie like this demands. Harsh, heart-rending, and either exhilarating if you are into such self-inflicted misery, or puzzling and perplexing if you are like me, not seeing the need or necessity to scale a huge, unwelcoming, unpredictable piece of the planet such as Mount Everest. Make no mistake, this is not a happy, uplifting picture, but it is gripping and intense."

","If human beings aren't meant to survive at 29,000 feet, then what gives scores of climbers the reason to scale a peak every year while risking their lives in nature's most formidable playground? Either there is a more emotional reason as one tries to prove his worth to himself or to others or an urge to drown out all the noise and experience existence at impossible elevations. But for most indefatigable adventurers, it is the mountain's sheer majestic presence and its unpredictability that lures them to accomplish what only a few can. While they celebrate success after ascending the summit, the real challenge is that of surviving the descent. Director Baltasar Kormakur's ('2 Guns', 'Contraband') 'Everest' is a gripping re-telling of the 1996 expedition's tragic descent through a devastating storm. There are no heroes or villains in this tale. In fact, it isn't even about those who tried to conquer the tallest mountain but about the mountain itself that decided the fate of humans. Character building, emotions, motivations and achievements have no sentimental value here when it all comes down to one objective: survival. Absolutely justifying the IMAX premium, Everest is an immersive experience that is visceral at its core with the dizzying climbs, astounding landscapes and realistic depictions of mountaineering's challenges.<br/><br/>A diverse group of climbers, led by Rob Hall (Jason Clarke) under the outfit Adventure Consultants, prepare for their expedition at the base camp with short daily routines that aid their acclimatization. The wealthiest of the lot, Beck Weathers (Josh Brolin) has an inexplicable motivation that falls under the shadow of his strained relationship with his wife played by Robin Wright. Doug Hansen (John Hawkes) is an aged Postman whose second attempt to scale the peak has exhausted his life's savings and this achievement will be the most meaningful thing he has ever done. Yasuko Namba (Naoko Mori) is perhaps the worthiest among them since Everest will be the last of the 7 continental peaks that she conquers. Scott Fischer (Jake Gyllenhaal) leads a rival firm on the expedition whose expertise is well respected but his risk-taking ability, not so much. At base camp, Helen (Emily Watson) plays the Mommy for the group, keeping a watchful eye and ear to their progress while maintaining composure when heavenly skies split open. Everest is both a physical and psychological peak for the mountaineers and the film shows that the human spirit simply cannot suffice when attempting to overpower extreme elements. <br/><br/>On the fateful day of the team's successful summit, events start to unfold in a frenetic manner as they realize how crucial the short time window to return was. The storm and the mountain are both ruthless and the piercing winds do have a daunting effect on the big screen. Despair, helplessness and anxiety are the prevalent emotions at camp and home as they keenly await word of progress from the top. Without dramatizing much of the outcomes, the film maintains sincerity to the real events to a great extent. It is but a cruel reminder of both Everest's brutality and its attraction at the same time. <br/><br/>Salvatore Totino's cinematography and the visual effects team provide a breathtaking and absorbing experience. Every effort has been made to make it look like they were really on the mountain while the weather elements were captured to an intimidating degree. Jason Clarke brilliantly depicts his character's unshakable sincerity in his work along with the pressure of his team's safety. To whatever extent he may commit himself to the expedition, he has the longing to return home to his wife and their child. Josh Brolin portrays the quintessential tourist climber who isn't exactly fussy but does not fancy the commercialization of Everest nor its extreme challenges. Jake Gyllenhaal plays the more audacious climber who chooses his own methods that may not convince the rest. However, he understands the conditions of the mountain and what is at stake for all those involved in the climb. Emily Watson's alert and caring Helen at the base camp brings the tenderness during intense scenes while Robin Wright plays the concerned wife competently as she has done on the smaller screen as well. Yet, the most moving performance among the supporting cast has to be that of Keira Knightley's as her anxiety, sleepless nights, joy and tears strike the perfect cords each time. When she calls Rob over the satellite phone, encouraging him to continue moving down the mountain, the effect is deeply real. That desperate attempt to overcome the odds, knowing that it stands no chance against the adverse elements, is perhaps as triumphant as the film gets in terms of its human connect.<br/><br/>Kormakur's ambitious project to portray the challenges atop the world's highest mountain looks and feels epic. He traverses through the fine line between docu-drama and mainstream cinema with exemplary results. While depicting the tragic events of the 1996 expedition, he still showcases the beauty and majesty of the mountain along with the technical preparation behind such a climb. 'Everest' isn't just a big IMAX movie that is a must watch for its effects. It deeply resonates with the adventurous spirit and makes us realize the perils involved in the pursuit of something so non-materialistic. One cannot ever understand why the climbers push themselves to such extreme levels of physical and psychological stress nor can one determine the feelings of those who made it back from the fateful expedition. But the mountain will keep enticing the adventurous, the daring, the ambitious and the crazies. Some may not even make it to the top, some may perish in their attempt but those who do reach its summit, witness a view of the world that is unparalleled. The movie, simply shows us this reality.<br/><br/>9.001 on a scale of 1-10."

","This movie definitely lived up to the trailers and gave us one heck of an intense and heart-wrenching film. I wasn't expecting to like this one as much as I did even though the trailers looked great. It's easy to mess up with this kind of movie and give us something boring and way too bogged down in trivial details. Not this movie though. The character interactions are great and the climbing scenes are realistic but suspenseful. The excellent cast combined with great directing by Baltasar Kormakur make this film a bit of a nice surprise for me. I honestly didn't even realize that this was based off of a true story going into it. That just makes it even more heartbreaking. Let's talk about the story a little bit.<br/><br/>Rob Hall (Jason Clarke) is an experienced climber that runs a business getting people up to the top of Mount Everest. Obviously this is no easy feat so it takes many weeks of hard work and training to prepare everyone's bodies for the climb up there. Hall leaves his wife Jan (Keira Knightley) to help the newest group of not quite amateurs but not exactly professional climbers to tackle Everest. Everything seems to be going well at first but a series of seemingly unrelated events snowball into a tragedy as Hall's group as well as another are stuck on Everest during a particularly brutal snowstorm. This causes many other people to try and rescue whoever they can from the group. Unfortunately, not everyone's making it home from this one.<br/><br/>I'm a little surprised that a movie like this was able to accumulate such an amazing cast of talent. Jason Clarke is great as the compassionate Rob Hall. This guy is fairly new to me but I'm liking what I'm seeing from him. Hall truly cares about helping his people and he wants to protect them as much as he can. He has seen first hand what the brutal conditions of the mountain can do to people and he obviously wants to help them avoid that. I was happy to see John Hawkes play the likable Doug Hansen, a man that is obviously out of his depth but you can't help but root for him. I haven't seen this guy much after Deadwood but he always shines in whatever I see him in. Josh Brolin plays Beck Weathers and I have to say that I'm always a fan of this guy. He's likable, but not too likable. He's obviously flawed but he's another character that you can't help but cheer for. There are so many other actors and actresses that make this film what it is but I don't have room to talk about all of them. Keira Knightley, Emily Watson, Jake Gyllenhaal, and many more mean this movie isn't exactly lacking in the talent department.<br/><br/>This movie is straight up gorgeous to look at. There are many great sweeping shots of the mountain and the surrounding areas that really make you realize just how large this entire mountain range is. Everything is just shot really well and I felt like I wanted to get up and go there. I don't know how much of the film is cgi but I know that a lot of this had to be filmed on actual real locations and I love them for it. I want to visit but then I remember that I've never climbed a mountain in my life and Everest probably isn't the best one to get my feet wet.<br/><br/>There's not really much more to say here. The movie is fantastic. The visuals are great, the acting is top notch, and the story is interesting and leaves you wondering what's going to happen next. I was a bit depressed by the end though because of the large number of people that died. The majority of the people that I was cheering for didn't make it. That right there tells you it's based off of a true story. I have to admit that I choked up a bit at the end. Anyway, the movie is great and go watch it in the theater, IMAX if you have one around you. This is the kind of movie IMAX was made for."

""Everest"" is based on the real events of the 1996 Mount Everest disaster, and focuses on the survival attempts of two expedition groups- one led by Scott Fischer, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, and the other by Rob Hall, played by Jason Clarke. <br/><br/>Since I have a little thing called ""acrophobia"", no way in F**KING H**L I was going to see this movie in 3-D! It was still stunning visually in the 2-D. This is one of those movies that even though it's set in this vast wide open landscape, it still manages to be a little claustrophobic. You feel as if you are stuck right there with the characters. <br/><br/>And I have never been a big fan of Gyllenhaal's up until now- with this movie and last year's ""Nightcrawler"", I think he is really coming into his own. The rest of the all-star cast includes Josh Brolin, John Hawkes, Robin Wright, Michael Kelly, Sam Worthington, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson."
"chandanshivaramu","10","0","2","2 October 2015"," 2015's most gripping action thriller.
","This movie took my breath away as the director takes the most challenging role of showcasing Mt. Everest with mortal men and women at the mercy of it. If you for one second forget about the CGI's used, you actually get immersed into the Realness of the movie. None of the actors have been glorified to an extent of irritation of the viewer. Actors are believable and so are their emotions. Some reviewers have unfairly compared this mountain thriller to Gravity which is sickening. I would say filming this movie is more challenging than filming the Gravity as the latter involves handful of lead actors and here a dozen or more folks stranded in an icy mountain with realistic surroundings. some of the scenes taken aerial like the climbers passing through wooden bridge or the edge of everest are truly breathtaking !!. i wish the movie would have ended in a positive note but as this movie is based on 1996 true events, we have to take in the sad climax.. it looks like Americans love to watch their beloved American super-flicks involving comics and their history and obviously ignore these little gems..(proof is the box office collections of US). I wish this movie grossed 500 m and above.. Coming to acting department Jason Clarke, Emily Watson, Keira Knightley and Robin shine. Jake Gyllenhaal has been weirdly casted with some curious clothes and peculiar grin..doesn't create an impact like Jason. Josh Brolin gives another exaggerated irritating acting but believable to the role. The only suggestion to the director is to shoot some twisting and thrilling climactic scenes to make the movie standout as some of the more famous directors do."
"pmillican","7","0","1","1 October 2015"," A film full of drama, which for the first time touches on the true cause of the tragedy, which up until recently had been kept from the public.
","A dramatic film shot in difficult conditions with a large number of characters to do justice to in a two hour film. The story is complex on many levels, a tall order for Baltasar to cover such colorful and larger than life individuals from an audience view point. The story line is not what many expected as he touches on the real cause behind what was an avoidable loss of life, the facts he subtly invites the audience to consider, which have been unknown by the public until recently, appear to have come from two books, 'A Day to Die For' and 'Left for Dead'. The absence of 'Into Thin Air' from the credits has surprised many, but this was a conscious decision by the Director and Producers. The dramatic scenery does not disappoint, although the film would have benefited from more lingering shots of Everest both at distance and zooming in."

","Everest is a film about various climbers from different backgrounds, who each has their own motives to reach the top. Many of those climbers are amateurs facing the inhuman environment of Everest with the help of professional guides. The guides help them reach the top but their primary job is to get them home safe. That proves very difficult when a ravaging storm hits the mountain when most of the climbers are taking their final steps towards the summit.<br/><br/>What do people do in situations of life and death? Do you risk your life to safe others or will you safe your own skin? Everest is a magnificent story about real humans battling forces of nature, more than 8 km above sea level. What you get is a breathtaking experience where you follow each character so closely, you merge into their lives for 2 hours.<br/><br/>Baltasar Kormákur is starting to make a name for himself as a director. This is the first film he really gets to show what he is made of. Everest is the kind of film where every aspect needs to be carefully thought of in order for the film to be enjoyable. Baltasar Kormákur did an excellent job by creating this masterpiece.<br/><br/>Baltasar is the first great Icelandic director. Being Icelandic myself I was really looking forward to see this film. I knew it had received good criticism and I had therefore very high expectations. I can safely say that this film exceeded those expectations.<br/><br/>All in all, I think this film delivered the story perfectly. You feel as if you are a part of the expedition. You not only feel the characters' struggle, you take part in it with them. A great film I would recommend to everyone."

","This is a great film. It's action-packed, based on a true story, and has surprisingly good performances, even from Keira Knightly, who is starting to grow on me. <br/><br/>The cinematography is absolutely stunning, and for someone who is deeply afraid of heights, this gave me some idea of the glory of scaling the world's highest peak. <br/><br/>The story is simple, but well told. But after so much critique off-screen of the historical failure to recognise the help and leadership that sherpas provide on Everest, including the initial failure to recognise Tenzig Norgay, it seems very difficult to understand why this film focuses solely on its white, largely male, characters (with one Japanese woman given a few lines, but not really a storyline). One character is introduced as the 'head sherpa', and it's clear in the film that when the foreigners can't achieve something they send in the sherpas to do the work. So why don't the sherpas have characters and subjectivity? <br/><br/>While every tense moment for the white men (and women) is tracked, a potential part of the plot, in which a sherpa has to turn back while trying to rescue the main character, is given no attention whatsoever other than to show the turnback. What went through that character's mind? Was the decision a difficult decision to make? How did the sherpas cope not only scaling the mountain, but carrying the main characters' items and helping them up the mountain. <br/><br/>These seem like especially important issues given that even today, people pay small fortunes to climb Everest, while sherpas die and are paid very little for their work in Nepal. This film had the opportunity to at least provide them with some subjectivity but utterly failed to do so. For many this won't hinder the plot or the film, but this is how we keep perpetuating an exclusively white, and largely male history."

","There is a scene before the fateful climb up Everest in which the climbers huddled togOne can view this as a disaster flick but kudos to Kormakur for not making it feel like a retread. An outstanding cast headlines the movie. However the star of the movie is definitely the humongous mountain and the treacherous storm that accompanied it. By intentionally going down a not overly dramatic path and with icy deaths portrayed matter-of-factly, the movie has a ring of authenticity around it. The triumphant feeling when the team hits the peak is never underscored in bold, but their extreme effort to reach the pinnacle is. The characters are not quite the stereotypes of typical disaster flicks - there is no one singled out as the hero and even though there is a scaredy cat he is no coward. Perhaps that is why the characters feel a little hollow and some of the back stories feel perfunctory. <br/><br/>The moment the film goes into survival mode, it becomes a different beast. The devastation of the Himalayan storm is ferocious and the loss of human lives is gut- wrenching. The photography and focused storytelling is exceptional. Even though at times I couldn't see who is who because of the massive gear the mountaineers are wearing, the danger is very real and nerve wrecking. The sense of cinema is huge and the whole screen is used amazingly well. I particularly love the immersive sound design which really shows you what a devastating storm up in the mountain feels like. I swear I felt the temperature dropped in the cinema and I can't wait to re-inexperience the movie in my home theatre. This is what cinema is about - the magnification of the human endeavor against the unstoppable force of nature. ether to discuss the 'why'. One said it is only when he is climbing he feels the clearest in his mind. Another said he is doing it to inspire his kids. A 47-year-old Japanese woman said she has climbed 6 peaks and this will be her 7th, her perfect 7. Finally all agreed unanimously that they were doing it ""because it's there"". The moment is quietly poignant because we all know most of them won't make it back alive. Icelandic filmmaker Baltasar Kormakur has captured the thrill and spill of an ill-fated climbing party with gut-wrenching verve."

","We watched this in the local IMAX in 3D. I am not normally a fan of 3D, but have to say that this movie made you realize just how effective 3D cinema can be if it is done well. I've read several of the books relating to this disaster on Everest, and was surprised how accurately the movie followed the books, which is a massive challenge as everyone's account of exactly what happens differs to some extent, and often markedly.<br/><br/>As many other people have commented, the cinematography is nothing short of genius. There are some jaw-dropping shots that really demonstrate how huge Everest is, and what a ridiculous task it is to climb it. I don't think I've ever seen a film that managed to communicate perspective in such a way.<br/><br/>Some of the reviewers have said that they were disappointed that the characters were not fleshed out more. I don't quite understand this as I felt the movie did an excellent job of introducing you to the key characters and providing enough back story to make concerned about whether they lived or died. To have fleshed out every character would have necessitated a mini series rather than a one-off movie as there were dozens of people involved.<br/><br/>One huge testament to this film is that we were in a pretty full cinema and I don't recall one person getting up to go to the toilet or get refreshments. I can't ever recall any movie achieving that kind of effect.<br/><br/>I'm struggling to try and think of any weaknesses in the film, but I honestly can't think of any. It is quite simply a cinematic triumph and deserves all the awards that are surely come its way."

","OK, I didn't see the IMAX version, but now I think I would like to. I was a nervous wreck from the moment the movie started, being familiar with the story (Into Thin Air), but this was so more about the MOUNTAIN.<br/><br/>The acting is excellent and although the film does not delve much into the characters' personal lives, it is clear from the start that ""Everest"" is in charge--no one ""coquers Everest. There is compromise, sacrifice, and sometimes the ultimate sacrifice. I will never understand the need to climb this peak, but I respect those who try and those who make it possible.<br/><br/>I would have liked to see a little more about the Sherpas, and maybe even the politics and environmental impact the hundreds of climbers have had on the mountain. But all in all, this is an epic movie. It was fascinating to read (on another site) about the filming.<br/><br/>I will never make it to Everest, so this film is as close as I will come--and it is spectacular and deserving of all the respect it deserves--the movie and the MOUNTAIN."

","This film is certainly gripping in parts but the pace at times does slow down and I think sometimes it suffers for it. Being a true story and seeing the trailer for this film I was keen to see it. Visually this film is great and you get a real feel of the hardship that people go through that choose to climb Everest. The film has some big names in the cast Jason Clarke, Josh Brolin, Keira Knightley, Jake Gyllenhaal etc. They all do a good job of portraying going from optimistic and adventurous to mortified and forced to fight for their lives. <br/><br/>Overall, Everest gave me exactly what I wanted. It was intense, emotionally powerful, and the visuals were beautiful. It's not perfectly structured, but it sure is engaging. This offers a brutal look into how much time and energy is put into a trip to Everest, and how quickly things can go wrong. Definitely worth a trip to the cinema and I recommend seeing it."

Such and unfriendly mountain with so many obstacles. Weather, cold, snow, storms, wind, avalanche, ice, lack of oxygen, to name but a few. A 1 acting by all. My favorite character is Jake. He fit the role well. Most scary part was the helicopter trying to land and then when it took off I thought it was going to crash.

Some are totally ignored. I was much more emotional reading the accounts. Feeling the gut-wrenching nature of the life and death decision made when an ascent or descent goes wrong. I didn't get that feeling with this movie.<br/><br/>But if you don't want to get into a debate over who made the most mistakes (Boukreev vs. Hall. vs. Fischer vs. Ang Dorje, etc.), it's a very good accounting of the events from the perspective of the Adventure Consultants' camp."

","""Based on a true story"" - five words that usually signal an emotionally powerful tale of triumph over adversity. Attaching them to Everest, the latest in a veritable avalanche of biopics heading our way this autumn (with Legend, The Walk, Steve Jobs all joining the melee), all but guaranteed a tale of Man conquering a treacherous Mother Nature.<br/><br/>Not quite.<br/><br/>Relating the events of a 1996 expedition, Everest the movie makes the occasional, perfunctory attempt to understand why otherwise sane human beings feel compelled to spend tens of thousands of dollars risking their lives on the slopes of Everest the mountain, but never really succeeds in answering this question. Elsewhere there are rudimentary pokes at the dangerous and polluting commercialisation of extreme mountaineering not to mention an inadvertent swipe at an industry that so easily expends the costly resources of a developing country (not to mention the lives of its countrymen) plucking wealthy Westerners off the side of a mountain they shouldn't have been on in the first place. <br/><br/>Certainly, Everest is one of vanishingly rare handful of movies that uses 3D to stomach churningly good effect. Swooping and gliding through the resplendent Nepalese landscape, Aerial DP John Marzano's vertiginous shots are the perfect showcase for Everest's imposing Himalayan vistas, a glorious virtual tour to be enjoyed from the warm, oxygenated safety of one's seat. <br/><br/>Icelandic director Baltasar Kormákur spends the first hour setting up his man vs. mountain movie, introducing us to a handful of protagonists (including Jason Clarke's dad-to-be Rob, John Hawke's improbable mountaineering mailman Doug and Josh Brolin's brash Texan, Beck), presumably in the hopes that we will come to root for them as they take on one of the most fearsome peaks on the planet. <br/><br/>Instead, it is the mountain itself that dominates both the narrative and the visuals, whether beguilingly calm in the background or unleashing its formidable fury upon the trespassers scattered across its slopes. Once our 'heroes' embark on the final ascent, it's difficult to distinguish one day-glo, puffa clad individual from the next. Not only does this dampen the emotional impact for most of the second, catastrophic half of the movie, it also underlines the film's frankly depressing marginalisation of female and ethnic characters. The most visible are Keira Knightley, Robin Wright and Emily Watson, relegated to the role of worried wives (surrogate wife in Watson's case) waiting back at their respective homesteads, characters with less depth than the resplendent scenery. Most galling is the treatment of Naoko Mori's Yasuko, a diminutive Japanese mountaineer attempting to summit the last of the Seven Peaks, who is insultingly sidelined in favour of virtually every male in the film. <br/><br/>Having spent two hours relating the cataclysmic events of May 1996, Kormákur inexplicably shifts into overdrive, wrapping up its devastating finale in mere minutes. For anyone (like me) unfamiliar with the details of the '96 expedition, the result is unsatisfying, lacking an emotional pay off that no number of over-the-credits photos of the real-life people featured in the movie can replace. <br/><br/>Still. Notwithstanding these flaws, Everest is at the very least a thing of flawed beauty that best hits home when lingering over the majestic Himalayan landscape. Ironically, the film's success in conveying the sheer doggedness of its protagonists' inexplicable pursuit of the peak is what eventually undermines it. Kormákur may get you to root for his headstrong mountaineers but while he had no control over the events he had to portray, a badly mishandled ending sours the entire endeavour."

"samgiannn","7","0","1","26 September 2015"," ""Everest"" is surprisingly emotional and intense
","I might not have been ready for the kind of movie I just watched because this was a deeply emotional and visceral disaster film. I was expecting a little more of a mindless action thriller than the amount thematic depth that I actually got, and it was a very memorable and intense ride. Everest dramatizes the 1996 Everest disaster that lead to the deaths of eight people, and the movie involves two groups that get caught in a violent storm while climbing Mount Everest. It actually takes a while to get to the real meat of the story. Maybe 40 minutes pass before the storm is even referenced, but the movie gets so intense and emotional during the last half that it makes up for the slow pacing of the first half. Luckily, the slower first half allows us to get to know each character, their motives to climbing the mountain and each of their back stories. The second half is so much more effective because of this. One thing that bothered me about the film were these random lapses in time that were distracting at times. One moment it would maybe be 2:30 PM, and thirty seconds later, it'll be 5:00 PM. Some of the transitions just felt choppy, but it's not such a big deal that it takes away from the film. Everest is a movie that grabs you and takes your breath away for 2 hours, and it's one that you need to see in the theater."
"captainmike-michael","8","0","1","24 September 2015"," It's Like a Real Experience of Climbing Everest
","Glorious at its name, the film is not a blockbuster with intense actions or CGIs, thanks to its original source from a true story in 1996, it works well as an adventurous hiking drama. The beginning is pretty surprising as it does not drag much and straight progressing to Nepal, followed by preparation for the climb and then most of the second half turns into a terrifying experience struggling to survive. At certain parts, there's some flaws of jumping scenes due to editing and it's quite confusing to track who is who due to too many characters but the cast has delivered promising performances and the stunning cinematography has brought audiences the great scenery of the peaks. The journey ends in an inspiring way that even though hiking is challenging, the psychology to deal with death and to face the reality are the hardest in life."

","A simple and well told story of an actual event. My favorite thing about Everest is that the film makers simply tell the story. They relay to us what most likely transpired with the various mountain climbers on this death-defying excursion to the best of their abilities. This is a true story, and some climbers didn't make it down, so there were obviously some liberties taken as to why certain decisions were made and guesswork as to possible conversations between the climbers. There is sentiment but it's not overdone, there are incredible scenes of the challenges faced on the mountain without the over-the-top visuals so often created by Hollywood movie makers. The movie is like a documentary that's been turned into a movie without any unnecessary story lines added in."

With his mostly 2 well known Hollywood directing such as ""2 Guns"" and ""A Little Trip to Heaven"" ""Baltasar Kormákur"" can reach at the peak of Hollywood with his third movie Everest. Except some long and emotionally fulfilled saving process scenes, the empathetic side of the suffocating, freezing and exhausting feeling has been experienced by me even I was watching it lying on my bed. The mainstream disaster movies' plots were full of thrilling sudden actions and scary accidents mostly causing the death of the supporting actors. The effect supported dying scenes, brutal events and stereotype leave the dying behind, like nothing happened and continue, because you are Sylvester Stallone and you are the strongest man in the world plots, wasn't as effective as these claustrophobic ones have been shot in past few years. And as the leading example, I could possibly say that 127 hours has blazed a trail and we are Glad, It did.<br/><br/>The film bases on gathered people from all around the world, nothing left for them to get excited in their life and paying a big amount of money to climb Everest and eager to take place in the history books. These activists are assisted with the professional climbers in addition to the service they bought. <br/><br/>The movie begins with a classic beginning. The depiction of the collective excitement of the first timers, experienced amateur climbers, and the professionals, gathering in Nepal having fun and training. With this Classic dialogues and scenes, we see the climbers' families reaching them with satellite phones, and emotional depiction of the climber's fear implies when they speak to their families on the phone.<br/><br/>And the climbing part as the second part of the movie begins with a classical and rapid climbing victory scene and joyful celebrations appears as plenty of them reach the peak.The thrilling begins slightly and you feel the peak point's low oxygen level in an exhausting gaze.Then suddenly film turns into a complete thriller and achieves its goal of keeping alive of the audience's nausea, suffocating and exhausting feelings when the climbers die one by one freezing and facing the same circumstances we live hypothetically.<br/><br/>And maybe the process of their survival efforts and in the meantime, the emotional connections with their family and with the rest of the team members who are in a lower altitude, seemed long to me. However, as a challenging film lover myself, I bet the catharsis of the climbers' realistic process of survival struggle would work on the audience who loves hard to watch movies too. And the relief of the sleepy death and joy of surviving blend at the end makes the audience think; It was worth to struggle while watching it. The death is everywhere even you are rich or poor and sometimes you can't even know if you have paid lots of money to prepare your sweet sleepy death."

","Everest wasn't the cinematic feast that I hoped it to be, but it was a gripping, miserable and extremely realistic experience of what that horrible climb in 1996.<br/><br/>After many struggles, a commercial expedition led by Rob (Jason Clarke - extremely effective in the lead role) and Scott (Jake Gyllenhaal, who is excellent but completely underused) reach the top of Everest. It comprises ordinary joes and experienced climbers alike. The film does an excellent job at showing what a titan Everest is - what seems like a minor speed bump is actually the endgame for many climbers because it requires standing around in the debilitating cold. After defeating one such challenge, the team reaches the peak rather abruptly, and as a result the triumph is not particularly effective (maybe because it was shown in the trailer).<br/><br/>The film's defining scene comes when Rob stops for Doug (John Hawkes), a climber who has failed at the threshold of the peak once and is struggling within eyeshot of it now. Rob tries to turn Doug back, but Doug pleads to push on, because he'll never do it again. Rob, in a moment of weakness, agrees. Kormakur's skilled direction and some nifty camera-work lulls the audience into a false sense of security. Go on, its right there! Its what, five hundred metres? Its clear out and he's so close! How long could it possibly take? He paid $65,000 for this! Everest's greatest and most sobering message is that determination is not only insufficient, but sometimes misplaced. <br/><br/>On the descent, we see terrific visuals and great acting as the group of climbers struggle through storms and freeze. In one pivotal moment, a weak climber pleads that they have to leave their fallen companions or die with them. And such is the skill of the storytellers that I completely agreed with him.<br/><br/>Baltasar Kormakur definitely knew what he's doing with the direction of Everest. The pacing was faultless, the movie never dragged on a single moment. The climb and the descent, the hope and the helplessness, are given equal weight, and the visual depiction of Everest is so realistic that it almost feels like we are there ourselves. Of a stellar cast, none have enough time to make an impact, but I'll make a special mention to Emily Watson, very emotional and likable as the Base Camp contact, and Sam Worthington, who proves he's actually a good actor, just not a lead actor.<br/><br/>Everest is a sobering experience. I went in wanting to climb mountains one day. Now I just want to lie in bed with my electric blanket turned up to eleven and never leave electricity or gas heating again."

","First of all, if you don't see the film in IMAX 3D, you will not get the same feeling you get when watching this film that I did. The main issue with the movie lies in the first act because the problem is the entire first act. The movie is in rapid fire for the first 30-45 minutes. There is limited time for character introduction and the film seems rushed. By the 15 minute mark, they are practically already climbing the mountain and this is something that shouldn't have happened until the second act. There are times where a character's name is said and you really can't remember which one they are due to the lack of introduction. However, come time for the second act and things start to come back to the light. The intensity rises and you start to care for the characters more than you did before. It becomes an emotional thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat. It creates a realistic environment (complimented by the IMAX 3D) that immerses you in the film. The acting is fantastic and if I were a part of the Academy I would attempt to give Josh Brolin a supporting actor nomination, but of course, that won't happen. <br/><br/>In conclusion, once the first act is in the past, the film regains its footing and becomes a great film that leaves you scratching you head wondering, ""how did they film that?"" To be honest, going on I was unaware that this was actually a true story. It makes the movie more emotional and all the more thrilling,<br/><br/>I highly recommend the film."

Mountaineers have faced obstacles to impossible , and their passion and obsession of a lifetime - to conquer that peak - has become a battle against time for survival"". An extended version of what appears in the film. I mean, what I get from the people I love , obviously , is a response very visceral , powerful movie and so I felt when I read his version of John Krakauer of this story and then I read more afterwards. But I remember that I reacted very visceral to this story , and then, when I was asked to do, I called a friend of mine , Dean Poulter , who died a few months ago and It was a pillar of the community climbing , and I said "" Hey , what do you think that 'll make this movie ? 'and he said something like , "" Absolutely , do it ! And then cleans Everest when you do it ... "" He then began to make plans for me , how to do the movie . But the experience became very visceral for us. It was a collective experience . I hated them and I loved these guys and I would not give up any hour of experience .. I recommend this film Everest,it is my favorite."

","Everest, a film by Baltasar Kormakur, showcases the tragedy of 1996 Mount Everest Disaster. It was on 10-11th May, 1996, when eight people (including a guide and two expedition leaders) were caught in a blizzard (severe snowstorm with heavy winds) and died on Mount Everest during their summit attempts. The data says that over the entire season, 12 people died trying to reach the summit, making this the deadliest day / year on Mount Everest until the 16 fatalities of the 2014 Mount Everest Avalanche and 18 deaths resulting from avalanches caused by the April 2015 Nepal Earthquake. One will be heartbroken to see the mountaineers dying.<br/><br/>This film is the story of people who are very passionate about adventure and especially mountaineering. Two expedition groups led by Rob Hall (Jason Clarke) and Scott Fischer (Jake Gyllenhaal) had set their target to ascent the mountain and reach the summit on 10th May, 1996. Climbers' desire was to conquer the unconquered. Climbers, when enquired on why they want to climb, somebody expressed – ""Because, It is there"". Someone else said, she had conquered six summits, this would be her 7th Summit. They had all the reasons behind their passion and drive to climb the highest point on the earth. During their chit chats, one of the climber expressed it very beautifully : ""It is not the altitude, but the attitude matters"". <br/><br/>Rob and Scott, two expert climbers, though leading two different expedition groups, decided to join hands together, pool in resources, in case, crisis happened. They lead their groups for the ascent, but fiery blizzards engulfed their adventurous journey, posed a big challenge in front of them. It was very difficult for the mountaineers to endure these harsh conditions, blistering winds, freezing temperature, lack of sufficient oxygen cylinders etc. Lot of heartbreaking scenes are there. It is so sad to see the passionate mountaineers with strong drive for results fighting with the odd snow storm conditions till the end to survive. Ultimately a few of them could not conquer the storm and gave up. It is even more sad to understand that even the dead bodies could not be brought to the base camp.<br/><br/>Frames move from the climbers' struggle in the mountain to fight the snow-storm to the base camp where people handling the base camp are trying to contact the climbers through radio, encouraging them to keep their hopes alive and courage to survive. The scene, where Rob is made to talk to his pregnant wife is absolutely heartwrenching.<br/><br/>Who all survive the storm and who all give up? Watch the movie.<br/><br/>I certainly believe that such movies are not meant for review, since, somebody has actually lived these moments of grief, sadness, death, survival, triumphs etc. I just felt that I had lot of confusion to understand each character on screen and recognize their face, due to darkness or faces covered (which was indeed an integral part of the film). Probably, a little background of each character in the beginning could have helped me to understand the characters and their journey in a better manner.<br/><br/>Cinematography is awesome, jaw-dropping with the different angles of the mountains, capturing of the snow-storm, snow covering the bodies of the climbers etc. These scenes will leave you awe-struck and at the same time sad. Minute details are covered with great finesse.<br/><br/>Watch Everest and experience the film. It is not the altitude, but the attitude matters. Dedicated to great mountaineers who ascent the mountains with great passion and drive."

","Now I am no climber, but I have taken an interest in the pioneers of Mt Everest, (George Mallory, Howard Somervell, and of course Sir Edmund Hillary) since elementary school.<br/><br/>In my opinion this was the first movie that does arguably the most dangerous mountain in the world justice. Whilst the movie is beautiful (especially in 3D), this is no 'Hollywood' flick where the emphasis is on special effects to cover up a weak plot. <br/><br/>As you might expect the movie focuses on the climbers, their individual reasons for climbing Everest and their relationships with their families back home. The effect is powerful and the audience really starts to build a rapport with the mountaineers as the enter the brutal environment that is Everest's death zone (27,000 feet.)<br/><br/>I have never cried in a cinema before and I'll try not to leave spoilers but I came damn close in a scene between Clarke and Knightly which was expertly done. It prompted my girlfriend to fiercely tell me 'that I am not allowed to climb Everest' as she fought back tears. Others in the audience were also reaching for the tissues (not in that way, you have a sick, sick mind and you should feel bad) <br/><br/>8.5/10"
"scottshak_111","7","0","1","18 September 2015"," A true story of the fallen....So we never forget!
","The first thing that hits you when the movie commences is its music. There is melancholy inscribed, and you at once know there is tragedy in the tale. Well, of course, if you have been following the movie, the book, the unfortunate event and been watching the trailers, you already know what you in for. And so the placard in the beginning tells you. <br/><br/>Everest is a true story that laps around the 1996 disaster on the mountain. The story brings Rob Hall and Scott Fischer, the leaders of two different groups, into the limelight and unwinds every minute detail related to the expedition. What it also does is open the gates for a little dread for those who think trekking it is a piece of cake. <br/><br/>Baltasar Kormakur's direction is good but not great. His frames are silent and endearing and connect you at once. You suddenly find yourself amongst the characters. But sometimes you feel something is missing. Fleeting frames of the progressive kind don't actually let you take profundity in. They rarely let you focus and you keep moving on. Another problem with the movie is that you have a script that you cannot play around with. These events happened. You cannot toy with its reality. To make it into a feature film, you have to ensure that your direction is out of the world. To connect to the audience you have to make the gloom shattering. <br/><br/>Personally, what I felt missing was a heartbreaking emotional touch that would break you into a million pieces. Death didn't seem to tingle you. Because there was little time spent on the aftermath and more time on the 'what'. You couldn't feel the warmth in the characters so losing them didn't exactly connect. This again was a ball in the director's court. Also, the screenplay being average fails to blow your mind. But there are at times brilliant lines in the movie that can be cherished as is.<br/><br/>There is one bad-ass scene when the storm cloud gradually moves towards a stranded Rob that was one of the most memorable ones. Also, Doug and Harold's fate was terrorizing to watch. The scenic beauty that the bad-ass mountain offers is simply out of the world and is well captured. Though Baltasar often used the same frame again and again for emphasis. There are little things in the movie that are really thought provoking. Clouds of thoughts engulf the team when they are asked ""Why?"" Why are they trying to reach its peak? Also, when the protagonist looks at a returning team with an injured member, fallen and vanquished, it closes in doubts in him. The scene is metaphorical of defeat. <br/><br/>If you wish to relive the disaster, this movie sets a brilliant backdrop and entertains one helluva cast into a commiserating melodrama. A definite watch!"

","Everest tells the story of Kiwi mountaineer and guide Rob Hall and the terrible events that happened in 1996 while a large group was attempting to reach the summit of Mt. Everest. Being a true story you can usual expect bad things to happen and this is true, this film is brutal to watch at times, it's also very good. Director Baltasar Kormákur is probably best known lately for the 2013 film 2 Guns, staring Mark Wahlberg and Denzel Washington and while I quite enjoyed that film this is much better. I went into this film not knowing the details of the actual event it was based on and if you are the same I advise you to not look it up before you see the film.<br/><br/>Before I knew this was based on a true story I had seen some trailers and thought that this was gonna be your typical stuck on a mountain disaster movie, it's really not at all. The film takes plenty of time to set up both the characters and the situation. It's actually quite educational, goes into great detail about how one goes about climbing the highest mountain in the world but it's never boring as it does this, it also does a solid job of making you never want to attempt this yourself.<br/><br/>For really the first hour of the film we get to know all the main characters and we are with them as the go through their training. That training involved going up Everest and acclimatizing at a camp and then back down, the next time you go to the next camp up and so on until you have worked your way up to the summit. Some really bad weather happens and it hits the fan, that's all I'll say on that.<br/><br/>This film really has a great cast, Jason Clarke plays Rob Hall and unfortunately he was one of my primary issues with the film, I like him fine but I really don't like him as a leading man, he did alright but I think someone else could have been better in the role. I found myself latching on to Josh Brolin the most, I felt that he gave the best performance in the film, really liked him. Sam Worthington was really good even though his role was fairly limited, Jake Gyllenhaal was fantastic as always and Keira Knightly gave a really strong performance even if her accent was a bit dodgy in places.<br/><br/>The film looked fantastic, the cinematography was beautiful and there were a lot of moments where you will feel very cold just watching it. Unfortunately there were some moments that had some pretty obvious green screen and some bits that really looked like they were on a set, these were minor annoyances but they pulled me out of the film a little.<br/><br/>Really well done telling of Rob Hall's story, great performances over all except for Jason Clarke and some minor visual issues, still highly recommend checking this out, preferably on IMAX."
"LloydBayer","7","0","1","17 September 2015"," Everest is a spectacular audiovisual experience despite a somewhat underwhelming narration.
","Filmed for the biggest screens out there, Everest is the result of an expertly crafted production design that boasts unparalleled vistas of the world's tallest mountain. Even during its most harrowing moments there is an unrefined sense of grandeur that will appeal to most viewers. That alone should be worth the price of admittance, but also worth mentioning is that expectations should be kept in check.<br/><br/>Majestic in scale, both literally and visually, Everest runs at 120 minutes while actively seeking to answer a very important question – why do people do it? More shocking than some of the most brutal moments in the film is the intricacy of the answer that most viewers won't get until after the film. Based on the ill-fated 1996 expedition to the titular summit, William Nicholson and Simon Beaufoy's screenplay is set in a world where reaching the summit has more commercial value than anything else. Even more shocking is the fact that some of these climbers are everyday-people who pay top dollar for bragging rights to the summit. One of them is a mailman (John Hawkes) and another is an influential doctor from Texas (Josh Brolin). Oddly, the going rate is $65,000 for three months preparation that comes with Sherpa guides and a seasoned team leader. All this might sound like a dodgy deal for anyone confined to the bunny slope of a ski resort. Unsurprisingly, and as based on the events of 10 May 1996, the expedition was destined for disaster and this is where the film does what it does best.<br/><br/>For what could have been the motion picture event of the year, Everest is narratively a mess, and for the sake of a pun I'd even say it's a disaster in some ways. While it's always great to have an ensemble cast playing out the story, the main problem arises from bit sized characters in what should have been important roles for these characters. There are so many of these characters spread across the narration, that at any given time, you can't tell who the central character is even if some of these characters are primed with a background sob-story. Real life mountaineer - Rob Hall - is given some importance as the expedition leader and Australian actor Jason Clarke anchors this role with finesse. On the other hand, the second team led by Jake Gyllenhaal's Scott Fischer loses significance although there's a good 45 minutes used up for character introduction and background story. Amongst others, Sam Worthington, Robin Wright and Keira Knightley join Gyllenhaal in bit roles that barely nurture, if not tilt-shift the narrative towards characters destined to survive or perish.<br/><br/>Despite some unnecessary background melodrama and the aforementioned zigzagging of the story, Icelandic director Baltasar Kormákur brings out an overwhelming amount of dread as the minutes pile up along with the body count. It's one of the few moments in the film where you get a little premonition on what is about to happen. This is largely due to the way Emily Watson executes her role as the Base Camp coordinator and a person with remarkable insight. If there's one person who outperforms the rest of this star studded lineup, it's definitely Watson and does so with just her eyes. Just as captivating are the technical aspects of this film with heart-stopping panoramas from the foothills of Nepal right up to the pinnacle of Mt. Everest. Just don't go in expecting a white-knuckle action-thriller and you won't feel robbed. At its best, Everest is an audiovisual 'experience' that places the viewer right in the middle of one of the harshest terrains on the planet. On an IMAX screen, that's a fair deal for the 99 percent of us who haven't climbed anything more than a ladder."
"iyergokul_9","Null","0","5","17 September 2015"," A visual treat for adventure fans but that's all there is to it.
","Just came back after watching Everest in 3d and don't quite know what to say about it. This was one of the eagerly awaited film of the month and it turns out be just another exploitative survival-type film. Apart from the excellent visual effects, there wasn't anything much to quote about the film. Sub-par acting and a lack of a main star/actor make Everest a pretty average movie. The fact that it's 2 hours long make it a kind of a stretch which is exactly what the movie tends to do after the interval.<br/><br/>Some positives about Everest is though that the achievement in visual effects makes it an excellent adventure given the 3d experience. The locations the movie is shot as well make it a satisfying watch. It also plays a part in the scenes of catastrophe, in which it completely delivers the horror of what the actors are going through.<br/><br/>Overall a pretty good watch but won't encourage you on spending your money on this one. Final rating: 7.1/10"
