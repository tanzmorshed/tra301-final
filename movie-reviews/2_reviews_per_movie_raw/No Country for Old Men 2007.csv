","The message of this film is that there is no symmetry to life. What goes around does not come around. The fall of the coin has no bearing on the way the cookie crumbles. There is no right or wrong to the fates of men. No justice. Opportunities seized may lead on to fortune, but they could just as well lead on to dusty death. Only children expect things to be fair. As things once were they need no longer be. Now that IMDb has decided to list reviews by date there is a slightly increased possibility that this effort will be read by someone. Performance reviews are absolutely not read by me for helpfulness, but for interest and entertainment."

","I expect a film like 'No Country for Old Men' to be polarizing for some, especially if they're expecting a big finale with the good guy and the bad guy drawing their guns in the end to settle the score. 'No Country for Old Men' is a film that dabbles more in existentialism, despite all the crime that occurs. Basically, what I'm saying is that the film adapted from the novel is very unconventional not only for its genre, but also in its approach to storytelling. What the Coen brothers do best is combining altogether different elements and creating something with its own unique character. While there are subtle throwbacks to the old wild west, the story takes place in modern society where technology has advanced, society has advanced and unfortunately crime has too.<br/><br/>What are Anton Chigurh's true motives? Does he have a philosophical doctrine that we the audience are unaware of or are just unable to comprehend? What Anton does is create a lot of questions that arise from his actions and his interactions with the other characters. To watch a character as odd as him is fascinating and I cannot give enough credit to Javier Bardem in portraying such a character that is so enigmatic and just his presence alone is able to evoke so much mystery. Even though Anton is very incomprehensive, it is all made up for by being able to be somehow captivated by him.<br/><br/>How every character deals with Anton is interesting, to say the least and as the film progresses, the feeling of despondency increases gradually. The lack of heroes is what gives this film its sense of hopelessness and that feeling of hopelessness is basically set in stone from the first few shots coupled with Tommy Lee Jone's epic voice-over narration in introducing the story. It is the perfect introduction to what we will witness in the story and what it all means for a sheriff like him in comprehending these events. As the events occur, we the audience reflect on these situations just as much as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell. Tommy Lee Jones' performance in this role is impressive and is injected with a great sense of humanity. I commend his portrayal as Bell, in that he is the character who carries the weight of the story.<br/><br/>The acting is a huge fragment in bringing this film to life, but what also does that is how the visuals are executed and it is definitely utilized to a great effect. From its majestic shots to its beautiful lighting and color tones, the Coen brothers set a mood that permeates the whole film. Its barren settings really add a feeling of desolation that is at the same time hypnotic and surreal. While the film can be suspenseful and its suspense is definitely executed perfectly, the film still somehow manages to maintain an air of mystique. The non-existence of a soundtrack really gives the film a feeling of loneliness, all the while adding an even greater sense of sterility to its already barren wasteland.<br/><br/>I can go on and on about the great acting, its memorable shots and its great script, but what makes 'No Country' a great film is that it manages to be truly idiosyncratic in its execution just like how the Coen Brothers' other great films are. Even if a film like this leaves me more questions than answers, if it still manages to captivate me to a point that I'm willing to return to it, then that shows that it doesn't matter if I don't have any answers to my questions. There are only a few films that are able to pull this off naturally and 'No Country for Old Men' is definitely one of those special films that can do just that."

","If this doesn't end my year in the top two films of the year then we are in for one hell of an awesome year of movies.<br/><br/>The new film from two of the best filmmakers working today No Country For Old Men shows the talents of the Coen Brothers on top form. After a couple of disappointments (Intolerable Cruelty had flashes of Coen genius but felt more of a Coen imitation than the real thing; Ladykillers had the odd funny moment but was the blandest film the brothers ever made, and there's just no excusing Marlon Wayans!) they knock this violent western drama out of the park.<br/><br/>More in the vein of their superb early mostly-serious efforts Blood Simple and Miller's Crossing (my personal favourite of the Coen back catalogue) No Country For Old Men is a slow-moving, character-driven masterpiece about uncompromising and uncompromised characters. It is very violent and bloody and not always for the squeamish.<br/><br/>Shot through with moments of humour these come, as in life, from real situations and observations so don't be fooled into thinking this will be the serious film with goofy-characters Coens of Fargo. No Country For Old Men is a tough, gritty story.<br/><br/>The unrelenting pace may take its time but you are gripped every moment. This is a thriller that genuinely thrills.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem gives the best performance of his career. And, yes, I have seen The Sea Inside and he in superb in that but here he is simply extraordinary. It is a portrayal of unrelenting evil, of true derangement, of a human being with no shreds of humanity that ranks at the very top of studied film psychopaths. And I say film not movie because this is not a clichéd character. This is not a character whose lunacy you enjoy over popcorn. This is one of the most frightening performances ever committed to celluloid. I felt truly nervous of what was going to happen every time he walked on screen.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin essentially carries the bulk of the movie and he is excellent in a role that challenges him. I have never seen him perform to this level and if Bardem didn't steal the film you'd be talking about Brolin all the way home. As it is this gives him a showcase for his talents that should see him get a lot more attention.<br/><br/>Tommy Lee Jones is used sparingly but to great effect. Sounding more like Michael Parks than ever before his scenes pepper the movie with a wearied view on a world he doesn't really like or understand to great effect.<br/><br/>I did find Stephen Root a little distracting as i have never seen him in a serious role before and he just looks amusing but he is in very little.<br/><br/>Roger Deakins' cinematography is breathtaking as usual and the Coens' script is superbly crafted. There are moments, almost asides from the main plot, that would be superfluous in most scripts and excised in most studio films but which work perfectly in the overall context of the movie as only the Coens can achieve. One scene featuring Bardem in a gas station is up there with the best scenes i have ever seen on film.<br/><br/>I have not gone into the plot here because I saw this film having not read Cormac McCarthy novel and knowing little other than the basic log-line - a man out hunting comes upon a scene of dead bodies, guns, drugs and money on the Mexican border and comes to the attention of both those behind the scene and a local world-wearied sheriff - and i think that's the way to see this film.<br/><br/>Go in knowing as little as you can but knowing at least this: this is a serious, violent, slow-paced character piece from the Coens. This is not a Fargo. If you are squeamish don't see it. If you have a short-attention span don't see it. If you only love the Coens for their fantastic comedies like O Brother and Big Lebowski and the comedy/thriller Fargo don't see it. But if you want to see an intelligent, superbly acted, powerful, beautiful cinematic treat that will remind you of the true power of cinema see it, see it, see it. It's a masterpiece. Bravo Ethan and Joel."

","While on a hunting trip, a sportsman (Josh Brolin) finds dead men and a stash of cash in the remote back country of West Texas, the result of a drug deal gone wrong. The greedy hunter takes the cash, but soon discovers that the resourceful criminal responsible for the drug deal, an outlaw named Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), has a way of tracking the loot. The hunter thus finds that he is the hunted. Meanwhile, an aging Texas sheriff named Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is after both the sportsman and Chigurh. The story is set in the early 1980s.<br/><br/>To some extent, this film is a character study of Sheriff Bell, an honest lawman who is wise, observant, grounded in reality, and has a long memory. ""No Country For Old Men"" is really his story. He doesn't know quite what to make of the drug war that has crossed over from Mexico into Texas; it's something new (for the 1980s); and it makes a land that has always been hostile to settlers even more hostile and dangerous.<br/><br/>The film's premise is quite simple, and the story is straightforward with minimal twists. A lot of time and care are taken with procedural actions: loading a gun, dressing a bloody wound, constructing a pole to retrieve a package from an air vent, for example. Dialogue is minimal; there's lots of silence.<br/><br/>Overall casting and acting are impressive. I especially liked the performance of Tommy Lee Jones who seemed a natural choice for the role of Sheriff. Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin are also well cast. Several minor roles are extremely well performed, like the store owner who is asked to call a coin toss, and the rotund lady who, with a dour face, defies Chigurh's requests in a characteristic Texas twang.<br/><br/>The film's color cinematography is quite good; there are lots of sweeping, wide-angle outdoor shots. I really enjoyed the geographic setting, with that whistling West Texas wind, the silence, and the stunning vistas. It's a landscape that is starkly beautiful. Yet, despite its beauty and wilderness traits, it can quickly turn hostile and unforgiving for anyone unprepared for its hidden risks.<br/><br/>""No Country For Old Men"" is a fine film. I'd describe it as a chase story -- character study combo, with elements of noir, especially in the visuals. Violence may be a tad much for some viewers. But given the subject matter, it is entirely appropriate."
"jcbutthead86","10","6","6","15 January 2013"," A Brilliant,Flawless Masterpiece From The Coen Brothers And One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made.
","No Country For Old Men is a flawless masterpiece of cinema that combines amazing acting,great direction,a wonderful screenplay and memorable characters. This is one of the Coen Brothers best films,one of my all-time favorite films and one of the greatest films ever made.<br/><br/>Based on Cormac McCarthy novel of the same name and set in West Texas in 1980,No Country For Old Men tells the story of a hunter named Lleweyln Moss(Josh Brolin)who comes across a drug deal gone bad and finds two million dollars in a briefcase. Even though he has the money,Lleweyln knows he's not safe and has to find a way out while being tracked by a dangerous hit-man named Anton Chigurh(Jarvier Bardem),local county sheriff Ed Tom Bell(Tommy Lee Jones)and Mexican drug dealers all leading up to a violent and bloody chase and cat and mouse game.<br/><br/>NCFOM is a masterpiece that works not just as Crime Thriller,but,also works as a Coen Brothers film,character study,the study on the themes of life,death and fate and as a Contemporary Western. What I love about NCFOM is that while it is a Coen Brothers film,at times it doesn't feel like one because of the way the Coens approach the story. Unlike most of the Coens films,where violence and chaos are done with loud sounds and a music score,this film has a very quiet and somber demeanor,giving us a world of the Texas landscape where violence and chaos is almost silent and unheard and where no character is safe. The Action and Violence in the film are well-done with suspense and intensity and the fact that there is no music during the Action scenes adds to the film's greatness and puts you on the edge of your seat. The Action and violence in the film is bloody and dark and will disturb you to the core. The screenplay by The Coens is excellent,adapting McCarthy's dialog word for word right out of the book,with The Coens still bringing some of their signature style and sense of humor and wit to the script. The movie is a great character study as well,with the three main character Ed Tom,Anton and Llewelyn in the forefront. The three main characters are well-developed and memorable,each of them having great scenes on their own and as the film goes on you understand their motivations,who they are and who they're about,whether it's Llewelyn and the money,Anton Chigurh and his pursuit of the money and Ed Tom reactions to the things he sees all around him. What sets NCFOM from other crime Thrillers is the film's study of Life,death and fate. Life,death and fate seem to either effect or goes with the characters,with Anton Chigurh who is basically a physical representation of death and fate. Chigurh strongly believes in fate and uses a coin to find out whether you die or not,if you guess heads or tails,one or the other right,you live,if you don't you will die at the hands of Chigurh. The gas station scene in the film will show you. Where Llewelyn is trying to defend himself from violence and death,Sheriff Ed Tom just doesn't understand why there's violence all around and why the times are changing all around him,with drugs,guns and death in the air. Ed Tom represents the past where old time sheriff's didn't have to use a gun or deal with violence,the future in this film is drugs,guns,death and the real danger and Horror of violence,something that Ed Tom Bell doesn't understand and can't figure out why it's happening and there is a sadness and dread that hangs over the film with Ed Tom and the title No Country For Old Men refers to him. NCFOM is also a modern Western in many respects and while we don't see any stagecoaches and six-shooters,you will see characters riding horses and wearing cowboy hats and Roger Deakins beautiful photography shows viewers the dust and dirt of West Texas making look beautiful and nice during the day while making the film dark and eerie at night. The ending of the film will divide viewers and will fall into two categories people who love the ending or who will hate the ending,I fall into the former category because the Coens while staying true to their vision,also stay true to the vision of McCarthy's novel offering viewers a powerful and unforgettable conclusion that doesn't end with a bang,but with a whimper and one of the reasons NCFOM is a Masterpiece.<br/><br/>The whole cast is excellent in their roles. Josh Brolin is does a great job as Llewelyn Moss bringing a grit and toughness to the role. Jarvier Bardem is brilliant as Anton Chigurh,one of the best villains in movie history. Bardem is frightening,scary and menacing and doesn't try to be scary,he just is. Tommy Lee Jones is wonderful as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell,bringing a quiet,somber and sometimes dry humor to the performance. Woody Harrelson does good job as Carson Wells,an associate of Anton Chigurh. Kelly Macdonald does a fine job as Llewelyn's wife Carla Jean Moss and considering Macdonald's Scottish in real life does a good job with the Texas accent. Garret Dillahunt(Wendell),Tess Harper(Loretta Bell),Barry Corbin(Ellis),Stephen Root(Man who hires Wells)and Beth Grant(Carla Jean's Mother)give fine performances as well.<br/><br/>The Coen Brothers(Joel and Ethan)direction in the film is excellent and the Coens give the film great pace and timing,while giving film a great since of atmosphere and tone,always moving the camera. Brilliant direction Joel and Ethan.<br/><br/>The score by Carter Burwell is rarely heard in the film,but when in use is effective and fits with the mood of the film. Fine score.<br/><br/>In final word,if you love Crime Thrillers,Drama,character study's,Western,The Coen Brothers,Cormac McCarthy or cinema,I suggest you see No Country For Old Men,an absolute Masterpiece of cinema that you can watch again and again and is one of The Coen Brothers Best. Highly Recommended. 10/10.<br/><br/>j"

Im not saying its horrible but I will say I don't think it deserves the ratings it is getting.

","""No Country for Old Men"" is for the kind of film fan who remarks, ""Gee, wasn't that murder a clever mise-en-scene?"" and who asks, ""What kind of lens do you think they used in that strangulation shot?"" The skeleton of ""No Country for Old Men"" is a cheap, 78-minute, gun-monster-chase B movie. Javier Bardem plays Anton Chigurh, the monster. He is Frankenstein; he is Max Cady from ""Cape Fear;"" he is from your childhood nightmares. He may be death personified.<br/><br/>One of many completely implausible scenes: an arresting officer, defying any logic, turns his back on Chigurh. Chigurh, displaying the supple sinuosity of a Cirque du Soleil contortionist, or an orangutan, slips out of his handcuffs. This is done out of camera view, because for Bardem it would be impossible; thus the scene's implausibility. Chigurh then, in real time, strangles the young police officer to death on camera. This is an extended sequence. This is the payoff for ""No Country for Old Men"": watching one human being kill other human beings, in scene after scene after scene, using various weapons, including a captive bolt pistol usually used on livestock. Guess Chigurh couldn't get hold of a Texas chainsaw. This is a slasher flick for the pretentious.<br/><br/>Early on, there are well-done, if standard, chase scenes. A man outruns a car: not believable, but fun to watch. A pit bull chases this fleeing man down a whitewater river. The man reloads his gun at the very last moment (of course) and shoots the pit bull dead just as it is about to sink its teeth into the man. Later, in a hotel, a beeping transponder informs the killer where his prey hides. Your pulse may race and you may think that this is all leading up to something interesting. You will be disappointed.<br/><br/>Tommy Lee Jones, whose ear lobes appear to be metastasizing as he ages, wanders aimlessly through the film as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell, delivering cornpone, homespun, cowboy poet ruminations that are more or less opaque in meaning. No doubt the film's fans are even now feverishly compiling a companion volume that decodes Bell's dreams and conveys their depth.<br/><br/>Woody Harrelson, late the bartender of the TV sitcom ""Cheers,"" shows up for a completely pointless half-hour role that yanks the viewer right out of the movie. ""What is Woody Harrelson doing here?"" Some years back, some bored English majors decided that conventional narrative structure was not intellectual enuf, and decided to play games with narrative. ""No Country for Old Men"" plays these sorts of games. The viewer is invited to invest time getting to know characters who are eliminated from the plot in ways that convey no meaning and are not moving. The narrative flow is truncated and yet the movie keeps going; viewers ask themselves why the movie is continuing -- sometimes out loud, even in a movie theater -- this is supposed to be a deep, intellectual experience. It is not. It is merely annoying.<br/><br/>Other than bratty English major head games, pretty much the entire substance of ""No Country for Old Men"" is a series of murders and tortures committed by Chigurh, who may symbolize your high school's worst bully  a bully so terrifying exactly because he targeted English majors. His victims are often courteous; their likability makes watching them be humiliated and then murdered an uncomfortable, and, given the film's structure, ultimately pointless exercise. Not only are the Coen Brothers torturing their characters, they also torment their ticket-buying audiences.<br/><br/>Chigurh's nice victims are often poor, rural, Southern, whites, the kind of people often not featured as positive, lead characters in Hollywood entertainments. They are often villains  witness films like ""Deliverance."" Here they are murder victims. Chigurh is associated with Mexicans, part of a rising ""dismal tide,"" as one Anglo character puts it. No matter how you feel about immigration, you may find this association of Mexicans with a rising tide of evil to be offensive.<br/><br/>The film's boosters insist that the movie offers three deep and shocking lessons: life doesn't always follow a neat narrative structure; evil often triumphs; and the old days were more peaceful and, nowadays, things are getting really bad. In truth, everyone walking in to the theater already knows the first two ""lessons."" No one needs the Coen brothers to inform him that life doesn't always follow a neat narrative structure, or that evil often triumphs. We expect filmmakers, and all artists, to offer us a more substantial thesis. As for the third ""lesson,"" that the old days were more peaceful and things are getting really bad today -- have the Coens, or Cormac McCarthy, heard of Attila the Hun, or any number of other less-than-peaceful and courteous personages from our common human past? One might well be dubious about ""No Country""'s ""lessons."" Visit internet discussion boards devoted to this movie, and you will find fans asking, not ""What is fate?"" or ""What is the role of a good man in a bad world?"" but questions like, ""If Hannibal Lector and Anton Chigurh were locked in a room, who would come out alive?"" Given such reflections, one is safe in concluding that the appeal of this film is its emphasis on graphic violence, rather than on any more advanced intellectual or artistic merit."
"littlemartinarocena","10","242","388","4 March 2008"," Tangible Fear As Art
","I don't remember being so scared in a movie theater since ""Don't Look Now"" Here the Coen Brothers take everything a step further with exhilarating ease. The terror was genuine and not because we were rooting for Josh Brolin or anybody in particular. The terror was personal, Joel and Ethan Coen made that terror visceral and tangible. It has to do with our own nightmares. Josh Brolin was a perfect piece of casting because in a way he doesn't have many personal colors. He's one of the bunch, one of us and we could put ourselves in his shoes. That is the art of film narrative expressed in a way that we've never experienced before. I heard people old enough to have seen Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" in the theaters and what glued them to the screen was their own fear. Well, that's what I've experienced here. Javier Bardem is superb, considering that he's the reason for the fear. He carries a human/inhuman kind of strength and we know he'll get us, sooner or later and if we consider the ending of the film, he might still do. Worthy Oscar winners, all of it and all of them."
"Quinoa1984","10","761","1265","9 November 2007"," You need to call it. I can't call it for you. It wouldn't be fair.
","No Country for Old Men is as exceptional a mix of two creative talents- the Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan Coen, and author Cormac McCarthy (recent winner of the Pulitzer for The Road, his own masterpiece) as one could imagine, as they converge on a story that in lessor hands would be just a B movie. The story concerns an average Joe out hunting one day in Texas who comes across a bunch of dead bodies, heroin, and a satchel with 2 million in cash. He takes it, but without knowing that a true embodiment of a psychopath (Javier Bardem) is on his trail, and as he evades him it becomes more and more clear the fatalism that lies in store, as a weathered sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) is also on the trail with perpetulally sad eyes looking on from his stolid demeanor. <br/><br/>More than this, it's also about as good a morality play as one could ask for, because it plays and tools and makes very serious questions about what is moral, or what isn't, or what is so ambiguous that it's all up to the toss of a coin or a chance ride out of town. There are a few interpretations to Bardem's character Anton that could be taken, but one thing is certain- he's less a symbol than a real presence, a ""ghost"" as Jones's sheriff calls him that can come around at the drop of a pin, usually in the dark, and strike the utmost fear (or confusion if you're a clerk) in the hearts of men and women. You'll never look at a coin toss the same way again. Or an air-gun. Or fixing a bullet wound in a leg. Or a hunt at a motel. Or even the aftermath of a car crash.<br/><br/>But at the same time it's the purest time of cinema, recalling Hitchcock and Leone and Welles's Touch of Evil and the best of noir and westerns. There are so many exceptional shots and lighting, so much depth to the perception of the characters through the mis-en-scene, so much tension, that through this it's all up to the actors to make or break the near-perfection that is the McCarthy source. Bardem embodies Anton like no other could- you can't look at his eyes, often steel-cold and horrifically professional (to what professional who can say), which occasional tear- and it's obviously worthy of an Oscar. And Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones are also fantastic; we see Brolin often in the midst of an action scene, a moment of 'save-your-life' going on, and one can finally see an actor of his caliber completely breaking out in a role that doesn't require him to ever totally ""emote"". Jones, on the other hand, gives a compassionate turn in a film that's about the struggles of desperate men in a land without law and order. He's gone through so much that it comes out completely in his voice and eyes, sorrowful but holding back, and he reaches a level of connection with the character that makes the Fugitive look like simpleton TV. Kelly McDonald, who plays Lleland's wife, is also excellent when called upon, especially in a crucial scene later in the film.<br/><br/>It's gut-wrenching, bleak, violent, super-tense (I clenched many a knuckle during some scenes), surprisingly funny in a darkly comic manner not seen by the Coens in many years, and artistically fashioned to a beat that is meditative (watch the opening moments with Jones's voice-over), simple, and doomed. It's beautiful and terribly tragic, for McCarthy fans it finally strikes at what is truest to his material- even if you haven't read the book itself the Road will give an indication of the mood and atmosphere at hand- and at the moment I can't think of any other film that would be the best pick of the year- maybe one of the best films I've ever seen."
"Chilangojoe","5","266","430","12 November 2007"," Beneath the eye-catching photography and violence, and the good acting, there lies an empty plot
","Beneath the eye-catching photography and violence, and the good acting, there lies an empty plot<br/><br/>To call this ""film of the year"" is to ignore that the world is a big place, and full of films that are a lot better. <br/><br/>This film simply didn't live up to the critical acclaim it garnered prior to release. Yes, Tommy Lee Jones does a good turn, as does Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem is somewhat unusual. The bleak countryside is well filmed and one of the reasons I cannot forswear multiplexes, and the violence also grabs the viewer's attention, but even that artifice wears off as the violence simply becomes monotonous.<br/><br/>The critics have uncovered nuances that separate this film from the classic Hollywood blood-and-guts formula, the most notable of which is that the lawman doesn't get the bad guy in the end. The trouble is that beyond critics counting angels on heads of pins, the Coens have retained hackneyed Hollywood clichés aplenty, the most egregious of which is the psycho who comes from nowhere, a plot device that dates back to the devil featuring in mediaeval morality plays and was debunked by the time Shakespeare was a lad. Hitchcock famously explained why Norman Bates became a psycho, and his suspense was all the more masterful as Anthony Perkins didn't look like a killer, just the Mummy's boy he really was.<br/><br/>With Hitchcock, you know something very bad is going to happen; but the suspense lies in not knowing what, by whom or when. After the first few minutes with Bardem's character, however, you know he will do the killing, you know how and you know it will be sooner rather than later. The only time the evil Chigurgh acquires more than one dimension is when people tell him he has a screw loose, but he just doesn't get it. Otherwise, he's as predictable as Terminator. We also have no idea where he learned his Rambo or Jason Bourne tricks, or how he gets to be better informed than the cops, and that is just one of many plot holes. <br/><br/>Bardem has acted much better before, as when he diversified from tongue-in-cheek macho roles years ago in films like ""Carne Trémula"" or ""Segunda Piel"". He successfully masks his native accent, but ends up sounding a bit too machine-like.<br/><br/>We can see Chigurh is after a pot of drug money, but just who the hell is he? Who are the ""managerial"" guys who put him in the picture? We are left to guess that Woody Harrelson is a hired man, but told nothing about his background, who does the hiring, or why. And why is Woody's character stunningly efficient one minute, in tracking down Moss, while allowing Chigurh to sneak up on him the next? <br/><br/>We are also meant to believe that a full-blown drug war can break out with just a lone sheriff on the case, without the feds getting involved. Yes, there is a lot of disbelief to be suspended in seeing this picture.<br/><br/>And then there is the foray across the border, which is corny and stereotypical to any one who has ever lived for a while in Mexico. Since when do norteño bands dress like mariachis? Since when do they serenade blood-stained gringo vagrants, for nothing, and in the morning? Since when do foreigners with bullet wounds get admitted to hospital, no questions asked? This has as much to do with the real Mexico as nachos and chile con carne. Could the Coens find not one Mexican adviser?<br/><br/>OK, so maybe this is beside the point, that the film is really all about a man getting too old for his job, as the very title suggests, but even here the plot is full of holes. It is all very well for the sheriff's uncle to wistfully say that a lot of nasty stuff has always happened on the border, but that ignores the fact that drug trafficking entails a dangerous mix of grinding poverty and instant fortunes which has made things nastier, all along the supply and distribution routes; Mexican towns once known for little more than growing avocadoes now have severed heads rolled across dance floors, and the country's equivalent of David Letterman was wasted in broad daylight.<br/><br/>Even that hollow and superficial take on drugs violence fails to grasp the nettle of centuries of brutality, of slavery and killing Indians, in making the U.S. what it is. And yes, it is possible to cover all these bases in a two-hour film. I will certainly look for them, and for answers to all the plot holes, should I ever read Cormac McCarthy's original novel.<br/><br/>For a sense of just how disturbingly omnipresent drug-fuelled violence is, and how it ends up breeding more violence, ""La Vírgen de los Sicarios"" did the job far better, but with Spanish dialogue and being made in Colombia, it never came to the attention of the critics who heap undeserving praise on the Coen brothers."
"DonFishies","8","601","1002","26 November 2007"," A hauntingly flawed unconventional masterpiece
","Days after seeing it, I am still haunted by No Country for Old Men. There is just something so effectual and uncompromising about it, that mere words will only begin to skim the surface of the cinematic excellence on display.<br/><br/>At its most simplistic, the film is a game of cat and mouse. The mouse here is Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), a hunter who stumbles upon two million in cash after a drug deal gone wrong, and takes it thinking nothing of it. He tries to cover his tracks, but ends up letting the group looking for the money, figure out his identity. The cat is Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a hit-man hired to find Moss and the money. But Chigurh is unconventional at best; he also happens to be bordering on mentally insane. And another man, a law man this time, Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), is on the trail of both men as they criss-cross around Texas.<br/><br/>Right up until its dénouement, the film is simply brilliant. Taut and thrilling, it blows right through the majority of its two hour runtime with ease. Even during moments of slowing down, the film stays right on track and never feels like it has run its course. It engages even when it appears that nothing is happening. The Coen Brothers truly crafted what appears at first glance to be a masterpiece, even if it is their first real shot at something that is not indelibly and inarguably their own. Even without reading Cormac McCarthy's novel, I know that the Coens have done it justice, even with their bitterly twisted and dark sense of humour scattered throughout the film.<br/><br/>But all of that comes to a standstill as the film concludes. The last twenty or so minutes feel like hours as the film wraps itself up, and it almost feels like these scenes belong to another movie entirely (one that borders on being pretentious and monotonous). I realize now that McCarthy's novel probably ends the same way, but it does not help provide closure to the fact that the movie is so break-neck paced right up until this happens. Its brilliance is shattered by what looks to be a series of tattered events thrown together to provide closure for all of the characters, alive or dead, and for its audience. It speaks volumes to the film's title, but it just does not feel satisfying compared to the rest of what we saw. Even with its enigmatic devices at play, I still cannot come to terms with how the film closes. It does haunt, and in a way, it may prove to be a significantly stronger ending as time rolls on. But as it stands now, it just feels weak.<br/><br/>What is also a bit of a surprise, and only seems to appear as the film concludes, is the music. It is not so obvious at first, but the majority of the film is audibly shown with just the sounds the characters make and no background music to speak of. This element is brilliantly used, as it helps intensify every situation and makes the film downright terrifying in some cases. It just helps truly make the film come together, and only helps establish the quick pacing even more so. It was definitely a surprise, and one that will probably help the lasting impact of the film become even stronger.<br/><br/>The lush and bloodsoaked visuals also help to define the film. Despite the film taking place mainly in deserted areas, or the desert itself, the camera manages to capture just the right essence of what the writing and acting is conveying. The isolation and the terror almost become characters themselves through these visuals, and are sure to be recognized as the award season rolls in.<br/><br/>The film's acting is also very well done. Brolin anchors the film and even when it is just the audience reacting to his attempts at saving his life, he manages to deliver the best performance of his career. He breathes life into Moss, and truly brings a sense of pathos to the character. We feel for him and his greedy mistake, and as he develops into a man unwilling to go down without a fight, he only manages to up the ante for himself countlessly. Jones, as the law man stuck on the fringe of every event, also does very well for himself. Most of his work is simply delivering dialogue, but it is delivered in such a fashionable sense that you feel like he is speaking to the bigger picture of things, and not just himself. I would have liked a bit more development in his character, but what little there is helps his performance greatly.<br/><br/>Supporting turns from Woody Harrelson and Kelly Macdonald are also done well, but are overshadowed by the main cast by both Brolin and Jones.<br/><br/>And even more of an overcast is Bardem as the ruthless Chigurh. He absolutely nails this character down to his very bones. If anyone is merely toying with the idea of seeing the film, it should be specifically for Bardem. His performance is calculating and plagued with petrifying silence. When he chooses to talk, his words sound like they are being given by the essence of evil. This is a man with a plan, but it is one that only belongs to him. His enigmatic presence is developed throughout the film, and never once does it feel particularly appropriate to understand where this menace comes from. Watching him on screen is a jolt to the heart, and will go down as one of the best performances of the decade. His terrible hair only helps to make his character that more scary and formidable.<br/><br/>No Country for Old Men is one of the best pictures of the year, even if it is flawed. Its brilliance and lasting impact with leave you haunted.<br/><br/>8.5/10."
"billreynolds","1","780","1314","6 December 2007"," Possibly the most overrated movie ever made . . .
",". . . by the most overrated filmmakers ever.<br/><br/>""No Country for Old Men"" shares with other wildly overrated movies, like ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""Collateral,"" a ludicrous setting in which criminals engage in wild shootouts and murder sprees lasting for days and days without any noticeable effort on the part of law enforcement to put a stop to it. NCFOM takes place in an alternate universe where an insane madman can travel across Texas murdering several people a day without the slightest hint of the FBI, DEA, U.S. Marshals, Texas Rangers, or any other authorities lifting a finger to stop him. The only cop who seems to be on his trail is an aging small town sheriff played by Tommy Lee Jones who doesn't actually try to catch him but just passing amiably through life making philosophical reflections on evil.<br/><br/>This movie has no interesting or sympathetic characters. Our supposed ""hero"" only gets in trouble because he commits an unbelievably stupid and selfish act -- stealing $2 million in cash from a drug deal gone wrong in which several people have already been murdered. Does he think no one will come after him? Then he compounds his idiocy by returning to the scene of the crime. Why should we care what happens to him after this beginning? He has what appears to be a very nice, likable girlfriend, whose life (along with his own) he endangers -- for what? Some blood/drug money that if the drug dealers don't kill him for taking, the cops will bust him for spending. Stupid. Besides which, the character has no backstory, no interesting qualities. He is a cipher.<br/><br/>The character of ""Chigurh,"" over which all the critics are having such orgasms, might as well be an extraterrestrial, he bears so little relationship to actual human life. He appears to be in his late thirties -- killing people at a rate of two or three a day, as he does in this film, he must have murdered close to 10,000 in his adult life, without ever being apprehended. This man is almost on a par with Stalin, Hitler, Mao, and Pol Pot, except instead of killing people en masse as they did (using subordinates, secret police, and soldiers to do the dirty work), he appears to do every killing himself, many of them with some kind of oxygen tank (how clever, and how convenient it must be to lug around an oxygen tank to kill people with instead of, say, a handgun). And there is no FBI team on his tail, no worldwide manhunt to catch the biggest serial killer of all time. It's funny how many ""professional assassins"" there are in movies like this (and ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Collateral"") and how few there seem to be in real life.<br/><br/>The plot of this movie is so unbelievably trite, clichéd, and hackneyed that it is simply boring. Of course, a trite story can still make a great movie if it is well done. But the Coen brothers are far above actually putting in the effort to make their story work effectively on a nuts and bolts level. For instance, why bother to show the ultimate confrontation between the hero and villain? Why would the audience care about that? On some level, the Coen brothers must be laughing at all the sycophantic critics falling all over themselves to heap orgasmic praise on this joke of a movie. This film, and its ecstatic critical reception, represents the ultimate elevation of style over substance -- the appearance of meaning over actual meaning, quirkiness and moodiness for its own sake rather than in the service of a genuinely engaging story and characters."
"buckethead66","3","266","434","25 November 2007"," Horrible Finish
","No Country for Old Men had a great storyline, character development, acting, and cinematography, and still managed to disappoint me greatly with its crappy anticlimactic ending.<br/><br/>What is the purpose of suspense? I couldn't wait to see how the three main characters would interact when they inevitably met. But the Coens yank the rug out from under the audience by suddenly wiping out the protagonist 75% of the way through the movie. Why waste so much time building Llewelyn Moss'(Brolin's) character and emphasizing his resourcefulness if you're going to kill him off so abruptly with no explanation? There's easily an entire scene missing. Fine, I get it: the Mexicans found him. I don't need a rosy ending, but at least reveal how his demise went down. I'm not even asking for a gory shootout sequence; just elaborate on what led up to it. Yes, there is an underlying commentary on fate and humanity, but this movie is also an action/crime thriller where multiple peripheral characters are strangled or blown away by a sociopathic killer. It seems disingenuous to skim over the main character's death. Moss never had a chance, and neither does the viewer."
"jung-8","1","596","1000","28 December 2007"," Genius? Hell no, simply misguided directors...
","Well, I say spoilers but with no plot, a loose story line, random characters, no resolution to story line, saying this review contains spoilers is a compliment I don't want to give this movie. <br/><br/>When I went to see this movie I did not know, believe it or not, it was a Coen Brothers film. However after the first scene and the visual of the boot marks all over the floor and I guessed that it was. It left me with the same feeling of the blood stains from the wood chipper in the snow from Fargo.<br/><br/>Not the same imagery, mind you, but the same sense of feeling. A sense of something violent and chaotic happened looked at from an obtuse albeit familiar image with contrasting colors of something that shouldn't be there.<br/><br/>Next the dialog came about and I knew for sure. <br/><br/>This movie is just plain misguided. When directors start to be identified by their techniques they are losing the plot and forgetting what film making is all about. To tell a story and to express ideas, not to showcase their quirks and be identified by them. <br/><br/>They should be in the background and not center stage.<br/><br/>The Coens, granted in my opinion only, took a step towards the over indulgent David Lynch and a giant leap away from becoming great directors based on their earlier works. The genius of Raising Arizona or Joel's The Hudsucker Proxy is a distant rock of film work casting a giant shadow on this current piece.<br/><br/>So many are saying that Javier Bardem's morbid and ""deep"" character is the real gem of the movie and brings originality to a type of role never seen before. Hell, take a look at another Tommy lee film, Batman where he played Two Face. The quirky and annoying Anton Chigurh is simply Two Face in an adult movie and like any bad guy, should not have gotten away.<br/><br/>Then there are the random characters being introduced in the movie for no apparent reason. I mean, just what was Woody Harrelson's character in the movie for? Seriously, without dipping into film school hogwash about stereotypes and archetypes of moral choices and bit characters to drive a moral choice. Or the old guy in the wheel chair towards the end? <br/><br/>By that time I was just rolling my eyes and getting more confused and upset that I was actually trying to make sense of this non-sequitur story line.<br/><br/>Then it hit me. <br/><br/>There was no point. There was no reason for this movie at all. It is just one long Coen self back patting cinematic journey and a movie to praise their own, self recognized, film making skills. What Blazing Saddles was to westerns this movie is to their previous works. It is quite ironic, and knowing the Coens deliberate, that it ends with Tommy Lee speaking of dreams. You know that feeling, the sense when you first wake up from a weird dream but in your half asleep mind set the fact that a pink dog was playing Tchaikovsky on the piano while sipping a martini and explaining why hot dogs come in 10 packs while buns come in 8 somehow can relate to your entire life plan and future goals. <br/><br/>As you regain your senses and become fully awake you realize that it was only a dream and sometimes a cake is just a cake.<br/><br/>Directors should not take center stage and simply let their films speak for them. This movie only speaks about the directors. Those that say this film is genius are still half asleep. When they wake up they also will admit they were stupefied by the Coens and didn't dare to question their ""talent"". <br/><br/>Well, I am begging you to indeed question it and see this movie for what it really is: Self indulgent nonsense.<br/><br/>Bottom line is that No country for Old Men (even the title is ridiculous and misleading) is a film one can easily skip. When someone comes out and tells you about this film and how great it is, watch them start talking about the Coens and their amazing talent. For if any other director made this heap of trash you would be renting this directly off the shelves as it would never have made the big screen."
"sirdjb-1","9","8","9","18 June 2016"," Everyone is entitled to an opinion. As long as it's justified.
","Now I've seen some harsh reviews, but I'll always stand by the notion that everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Plus that's not to say that this film hasn't been received well critically. However, when people make assertions like 'this films overrated' without being able to substatantiate that opinion it frustrates me because it gives this film a bad rep without good cause.<br/><br/>Now the reason I love this film is because it puts into practise that all too rare technique of showing, not telling. These days so much exposition and plot is just spoon fed to us in really haphazard and unnatural dialogue. In the first 10 minutes of this film you learn all you need to know about the two main characters with maybe two sentences? Not even dialogue. And more than that this film doesn't treat you like an ignoramus.<br/><br/>The film uses a lot of metaphors and analogies - so a lot of people will call it artsy or pretentious but they brings me back to my disclaimer. It's just one of those subjective things.<br/><br/>Another thing I like about this film is that it's very brooding or moody which for a thriller is great, you're constantly on edge. Javier Bardem as the antagonist is iconic. He's not your standard relentless murdering psychopath, he is a character with a code and morales. <br/><br/>It is a complicated film, it tells a linear story but follows multiple story archs and the film is very quiet which many people don't like surprisingly. Some people might find the ending alienating. But ultimately the film ends on an important social comment about humanity, modern society, age and so much more. It's a very interpretive film hence why it has such a dichotomous reception. Anyway, I'm rambling now, it's late and I'm tired.<br/><br/>Good day."
"modline","1","270","446","15 December 2007"," A frustrating film that goes nowhere
","The Coen Brothers have succeeded in making what is possibly the most nihilistic film in the history of cinema, and in doing so they have divided the audience like Moses parting the Red Sea. A lot of people love this film and feel it is one of the greatest ever made, while I'm on the opposite side, thinking the film is too frustrating to be enjoyed.<br/><br/>The story, as you may know, revolves around Lleweleyn Moss (Josh Brolin) and, upon his discovery of a crime scene (a drug sale gone horribly wrong), the theft of two million dollars. From the moment he steals the money, Moss is followed by Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a menacing figure who kills anyone who gets in his way. Along the way, we meet Sheriff Ed Thom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), who really does nothing to advance the story any, since his character does little to stop the events which unload on screen. In his soliloquies, we learn that he has seen better times than the horror unraveling around him, and that this is no country for old men (thus the title).<br/><br/>And that's basically the story in a nutshell. There is virtually no development of characters, no backdrop to show us why Chigurh is involved and so evil, and no involvement of Bell's character. There is a brief appearance of Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson), who is hired to track down Moss and Chigurh by someone who obviously was behind the whole drug deal, yet we know nothing about who hired him (even the credits list the character as ""Man who hires Wells""). After Wells fails, the ""Man who hires Wells"" then involves a band of Mexicans to track down Moss, and the story goes off the rails from there.<br/><br/>What is even more frustrating is the final quarter of the film, where not only do we not get any further development of character, we get the lead character killed off camera, a scene involving Chigurh and Moss' wife that is not fully realized, an out-of-the-blue car accident which doesn't do anything of any importance, and, yet, another meaningless soliloquy from Jones.<br/><br/>I truly do not understand the hype and love surrounding this film. When I saw the film, several people walked out, and there was a groan at the end of the movie and multiple apologies to loved ones from people had brought them to see what was to be the ""movie of the year."" Sure, the movie had great cinematography, great sound, and decent acting (it's a Coen Brother's film, would you expect less?) - the problem lies in the script and the lack of character development. There were some great scenes of tension, especially one involving Chigurh and a gas station owner and the toss of a coin, scenes which truly deserved to be in a better movie.<br/><br/>If you're looking for entertainment, the best advice here is to stay far away from this film."
"jp71ph","9","269","446","5 March 2008"," The Coen Brothers' masterful achievement
","It was not very long before I watched 'No Country for Old Men' that I watched the other remarkable film of 2007, 'There Will Be Blood.' Back then I thought that Paul Thomas Anderson has delivered the Best Picture of the year with his oil epic, but after watching the Coen brothers chilling and violent adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's 2005 novel, I knew right away that here was a film destined to be even a greater film than any I've seen this past year.<br/><br/>It's not easy to watch 'No Country for Old Men.' The first time I saw it, I found myself dazed enough to not be able to stand-up immediately even after the whole end credits have finished. And yet, mixed with the feeling of shock is the profound sense of wonder and awe with what I have just witnessed on the screen. It took me another viewing to fully appreciate the meaning and intention of the film, and while the experience from watching the film is not one everybody will enjoy and understand, it certainly is one of the most moving and thought-provoking movies I have ever watched. This is the kind of movie that will make you think, the kind that stays with you even after a long time has passed since you've last watched it. On the literal level, it is a simple cat-and-mouse chase thriller movie, but from within its roots lie a very profound philosophical and penetrating analysis not only of the characters and the situations involved in the story, but also of the kind of world we are living in today and the more monstrous sides of it we often choose to ignore.<br/><br/>The story revolves around the chase between a guy named Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin,) who stumbles upon a stash of money in a drug deal gone wrong in the middle of the desert and a psychopathic but surprisingly ""principled"" assassin named Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem). The third party and the moral center of the story is the guy trying to find both the hunter and the hunted, Ed Tom Bell, the old sheriff of a peaceful, but increasingly becoming violent locality in West Texas. <br/><br/>The movie features the perfect mix thrill and excitement that would be expected out of a movie in this genre. The Coen brothers' direction of the particularly intense chase scenes between Chigurh and Moss are masterful, evoking emotions of suspense to the highest level and pushing the audience to the very edge of their seats. This is achieved by very careful editing and sound direction that perfectly recreates the tense atmosphere whenever a particular scene is being played out. Also remarkable is the photography (done by Roger Deakins) of vast scenes in the desert where even what the ordinary moviegoer would consider as ""empty scenes"", where no action is played out, tells a story in a visual manner, where even when there is no dialogue or action on screen, the sweeping images speak out for themselves.<br/><br/>'No Country for Old Men' is rich in such bravura kind of film-making. The particular camera move, position and choice of background and other trivial details such as time of day, cloud cover or positioning of the props and point-of-view perspective offer the best experience for the audience, and the most effective means of story-telling for the Coen brothers. Just watch the scenes of Tommy Lee Jones as the tormented old sheriff being burdened by the challenge of something that is greater a force than himself, something that he ""does not understand,"" and you will realize what I mean. The environment and tone created by the filmmakers perfectly accentuates the performance of Jones and more importantly, the core messages of the film. This style is present throughout the film and one of the particular points that makes it more than just a chase movie.<br/><br/>I must say that I can't help but agree to most people when they say the Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh is the most disturbing character (and yet mesmerizing) to grace the screen since Anthony Hopkins introduced us to Hannibal Lecter in 'Silence of the Lambs.' Chigurh effectively radiates evil and embodies violence in a very intelligent and forceful manner that touches the fear in all of us. Like Lecter, he personifies evil not in the conventional and simple sense, but in way that somehow presents to us the whole magnitude and complexity of its nature. In the dialogue he speaks, a kind of thinking revealed is one that is calculating and deeply philosophical but essentially ruthless and sinister.<br/><br/>The film's monumental achievement is in its ability to remarkably transport us into a world where the places, emotions, fears, anxieties, choices, morals and realities of life are strikingly brought to life and presented to us in a manner where we, after the whole experience, can reflect upon and look back with careful consideration. In the end, the moviegoer is left to marvel at the beauty (and madness) of it all. Here the theme of innocence lost as it is corrupted by evil and violence is explored in the most cinematic fashion, delivered perfectly with richness of emotion and the greatest impact possible. The violence and bleakness of it all is not there to simply evoke reaction or engage the audience, it is there to tell a story and impart an experience of great magnitude and intention, to which the Coen brothers have brilliantly succeeded. All at the same time the movie is a character study on the effects of evil and innocence lost, an exploration on the themes of fate and chance, an analysis of the freedom to choose and its consequences, a reflection on evil and good as forces of society and the investigation of basic human emotions such as hope, fear, love, violence and aspiration in the face of a variety of situations."
"Craig_McPherson","10","554","941","17 November 2007"," Expect the Unexpected as the Coen's deliver a pneumatic jolt to the head
","There's very little ""good"" in No Country for Old Men beyond the mesmerizing acting and viciously dark screenplay. Instead, the unholy trinity of temptation, cynicism and pure, dark, evil take center stage in this modern western directed by brothers Joel and Ethan Coen.<br/><br/>Based on the 2003 novel by Cormac McCarthy, the movie unfolds in the dusty Texas borderlands as hunter Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) stumbles upon the remnants of a desert drug deal gone bad, complete with a case containing two million dollars. Succumbing to temptation, Moss makes off with the money setting in motion a chain of events that leaves a trail of blood spattered carnage across the State as he is pursued by the ruthless, coin tossing hit man Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) among whose killing weapons of choice is a pneumatic air gun.<br/><br/>Bearing little in common with pretty much any previous Coen film with the possible exception of Blood Simple, No Country for Old Men is a dark, bleak, ode to the baser elements of the human soul, and a spit in the eye to the noble ones as well.<br/><br/>With a structural trademark hinging upon breaking the conventional norms of predictability, No Country is a movie that will unsettle you at successive turns - in the way deaths are dealt out; by its palpable tension that can almost be cut with a knife, and its periodic deviations from the narrative norm  the latter likely the only Coen brothers ""quirk"" for which their movies are renown.<br/><br/>Switching back and forth between the game of cat and mouse being played out by Moss and Chigurh and the investigation of unfolding events by cynical aging Texas Sheriff Ed Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), the Coens weave a web of dangled threads that one can't help but expect will be neatly tied together at story's end, only to tie them up in ways that buck the storytelling norm and manage to be both unsatisfying and true to their nature at the same time.<br/><br/>Unforgettable among this tableau is Bardem's Chigurh. The Spanish actor who has also appeared in Love in the Time of Cholera and Goya's Ghosts evokes the most amazing presence of a ruthless killer with his own twisted adherence to a bizarre code of ethics that nothing short of witnessing his performance can do it justice.<br/><br/>Sadly, however, justice is one of the few items in abundance in this movie. And yet, as unhappy as I am that the Coen's screenplay defiantly refuses to cater to the audience's inherent desire for satisfaction, I grudgingly have to admire them for opting for the unpredictable.<br/><br/>Consider the movie akin to one big coin toss  will it be heads or tales? Call it - you've been calling it your entire life."

I honestly as I watched, did not understand why he went back, it was only after we left that my wife explained that he went to take that water to that poor drug dealer.<br/><br/>Next we meet our bad guy, a man who has been arrested, escapes and can continue to kill literally dozens of people, even having shoot outs in hotels and main streets, without anyone either caring or phoning the police. This sort of thing must be perfectly normal in Texas, because at one point you have one guy firing a shotgun on the street and no one could care less, let alone phone the police.<br/><br/>There's the Sheriff, who's ""trying"" to help the ""good guy"", but couldn't really care. I mean wtf was he doing all day apart from lazing about reading the paper. Apart from anything else he's got a psycho running lose and like 10 dead Mexicans as well as two dead police officers.

Honestly even after he was shot I thought he was faking it and would come back and help our ""hero"", I honestly couldn't believe it. Then they have both hero and wife murdered off camera, and again you honestly cannot believe that it happened.<br/><br/>The worst thing of all though is the ending, you keep thinking that the bad guy will get caught, but no he gets away, after killing like 1 million people, and the film closes with our Sheriff who's done jack anyway talking about some dreams he had.

","You can believe all the negative things being said about this movie. What's remarkable is that it's such a bad experience that it turns out to be the ultimate pallet cleanser. What I mean, all other movies you see after having to endure this awful film will seem less bad by comparison. I realized this while walking out of the ""Aliens Vs Predator: Requiem"" showing. It's a terrible movie in its own right but I found myself saying, ""At least it wasn't as awful as NCFOM."" That's not a joke or an over-exaggeration in any way. Walking out of NCFOM, you feel cheated, disappointed and even a bit angry. How is any film going to make you feel worse then that? I wasn't expecting anything coherent from AVP and that's what I got. Judging by the ratings here and a few critics that I read, I was expecting at least a decent film from NCFOM. For those that think this movie offers a deep theme or a hidden, complex agenda, you need to grow up.<br/><br/>The movie offers poor dialogue from the first scene on out. It's clichéd, needlessly cruel and the story itself is a trite disaster. The film exists only to jar the viewer and to attempt to be edgy and different. It offers nothing substantial, even in it's veiled attempts at allegory and a thematic message. It agitates the viewer at every level by callously killing any character they even half develop. What was the point of Woody's character? Why have the killer survive with no ramifications? Killing a main character (and his innocent wife) away from the camera is as poor as it gets. Let's not even discuss the ending, there are enough people that have mentioned that irritating lack of conclusion. I could go on but why bother? I'm not even going to remember the specifics of this film for very long. All I'll remember is the general unpleasant flavor it left and I'll remember that not many movies will leave such a poor taste. I'm not bitter. I'm grateful that going to the movies now has a bottom to the barrel in which to judge future films.<br/><br/>I want to thank the creators of this film.

","No Country for Old Men is a very bad movie that is chockful of basic structural errors of storytelling & film-making, and common sense. But, hold on a minute. What I just said might be all wrong! An outmoded way of thinking. A viewpoint that simply does not have enough ""intelligence"" to appreciate the deep brilliant art that *is* ""No Country"".<br/><br/>It seems that these days if you make a movie that has no story, no point, and no ending --- that that is automatically a *masterpiece* that is worthy of universal critical and consumer acclaim, and a Best Picture Oscar. That in a nutshell, is *exactly* what No Country for Old Men is.<br/><br/>Now that ""No Country"" has paved the way for such ""brilliant innovations"", I can't wait to see what other ""innovations"" await films to come in the future. Maybe next in addition to masterpiece movies requiring there to be no story, no point, and no ending, they will also eventually further innovate by doing away with other things like actors and dialogue. Maybe mankind will eventually *evolve* to such a point of perfect enlightenment that films consisting entirely of slideshows of some kindergarten students' fingerpainting artwork will eventually be the recipient of Best Picture Oscar awards and universal acclaim.<br/><br/>""No Country"" has taken a lot of flack for having a ""controversial ending"" --- but that is inaccurate phrasing. ""No Country "" has *no ending* at all. For it to have a ""controversial ending"" carries the prerequisite that it first *has* an ending. It doesn't! ""No Country"" is just a bunch of random scenes of a repressed homosexual, turned psychopath, who goes around shooting people with a weapon powered by a giant tank of compressed air. This random formula is even further randomized by not *bothering* to show many of his kills on-screen. Including the death of the main character, who is suddenly, inexplicably, shown as a corpse in the middle of the movie. Even though the movie had previously spent gratuitous amounts of screen-time showing him prepare for, evade, and engage in firefights with the psychopath. Yet no *zero* time is devoted to showing how he died. The randomness of showing trivial moments like the main character staring thoughtfully at a wall, and buying tent-poles from a camping store, are crafted with meticulous detail and given tons of screen-time. But the film's utter genius shines through *most of all* by not spending one second showing him die or struggle to survive in his final moments before he died. Just a random fade-in, and he's suddenly a corpse! The sheer *brilliance* of such artistic unconventional storytelling has never been seen in any film or book *ever* made before in the *history* of mankind. I wonder why? Why did it take until the year 2007 for man to finally reach this high watermark of storytelling utopia? Ah heck, I need to stop wondering, and be content to wallow in the fact that since I ""don't get it"", I'm simply an idiot.<br/><br/>The main character is an extremely banal hick so I had no emotional reaction whatsoever to him at any point in the movie, or to him magically fading-in as a corpse, but I'm sure the lack of any reason to care one iota about the main character is yet another of this film's amazing innovations. Layers upon layers, my friend! In several other cases, the movie makes it totally unclear if the psychopath killed his victim or not, because after trapping the victim, the scenes simply fades to black and then he is shown again outside the building later and the victims' fates are never revealed; they are never seen or mentioned in the movie again, as corpses or otherwise. One cannot assume he killed them, because in an early scene he spares a gas station attendant.<br/><br/>""No Country"" also innovates the art of film-making by making it's psychopath killer, ""the deepest film villain since Hannibal Lecter"" (or, the universal acclaimists allege...and who wants to argue with *them*!). No Country's killer shows his compelling deepness by repeatedly shouting things like ""CALL IT!"" after he flips a coin. In another scene, he further shows his deepness by making such deeply thought-provoking statements as: ""I won't tell you you can save yourself. You can't."" *Clearly*, this is Pulitzer Prize-worthy dialogue and one of the great cinematic villains of all-time. Thanks, universal acclaimists, for being honest about this and giving this character all the credit he so richly deserves! Maybe in the sequel he can play Blackjack or Poker to determine if he will shoot someone with his airgun or not? There I go again with my bad ideas, he's *already* *soooooooo freakin' unbelievably complex!!!* that to add a further level of complexity to him, like Blackjack-playing on top of coin-flipping, would be too much to even *try *to comprehend without bursting a gasket in one's brain wiring.<br/><br/>Tommy Lee Jones plays a hick sheriff in this movie. He is a great actor, but he seems very bored in this role and it's like he's phoning in his performance. Perhaps he was disappointed when he read the script and realized the movie has no ending, and this made him not wanna put any energy or effort into the role. The other actors in No Country are all third-rate unknowns (other than Woody Harrelson who has a nonsensical, pointless cameo); maybe Tommy Lee was simply trying to dumb-down his acting down to their level. Whatever the case may be, it's definitely Tommy Lee Jones' worst performance ever. On second thought, I am probably wrong with everything I've just said in this paragraph. Really, Tommy Lee Jones' seemingly uninspired performance is probably just him tapping into the higher plane of existence upon which this whole enigmatic masterpiece of a movie so-good that normal human beings are barely fit to watch it, much less understand it, occupies."

","""You don't have to do this,"" repeated words in this lingering film, which really does not feel like a typical Coen Brothers film to me. Fargo, had its quirky character and its grotesque moments, but this film is all about a subdued natured intermixed with quick action. For what I expected, I got some of it, but also a bit more of a subdued air and timing than I expected. It would do things in spurts, action at the beginning then a lull and more thunder. It worked great for keeping one on edge, which Brolin did, excellently in the lead role lying awake thinking too hard. Jones too was good in a strong supporting role as a close to retirement sheriff who is on the outside shaking his head at the carnage and mayhem unleashed by the simple finding and taking of a satchel full of money.<br/><br/>The real gem and glue of the film though is Javier Bardem's menacing character who has his own brand of justice, which is extremely harsh and well insane. Even the one who claims to know him cannot even begin to stop or even slow him down. Bardem whom I have not had the pleasure of seeing in anything before is gold and like no other before looks to have the supporting actor award locked up in this performance. His presence is felt, even when he does not show up. That is something I have not seen in film well since probably The Third Man and Orson Welles' character Harry Lime.<br/><br/>I cannot really describe the film that well so I will suffice to say that is best modern western tale I have seen since The Three Burials of Melquiades, which also happened to have Tommy Lee Jones and was directed by him to boot. Another thing I noted was the lack of strong score. The filmmakers just seemed to let the sounds of the creaking boots and the desert landscape speak for the film. It felt natural and a bit menacing."

The style of the film was also a nice change from the norm, I liked the silences.<br/><br/>Now the bad news, it was still predictable (I knew that the movie would end after Tommy Lee Jones last monologue- don't ask me how, I just knew it).<br/><br/>About halfway through the film I realized that evil would win out since it played like a Steven Seagal movie in reverse (with an infallible anti-hero). Not impressive in the least.<br/><br/>Who was Woody Harrelson supposed to be? The Greek Chorus? His character was a waste of time.<br/><br/>Cliché after cliché characters (writers fault). Drug dealing Mexicans, bumbling deputies, smart sheriffs, clueless wives, nasty mother-in-laws. Yawn, when have I not seen all this before.<br/><br/>Did I just flat out disagree with the concepts behind it. Sure I did, cause I'm not addicted to TV news the way some folks are. In my experience the law enforcement actually works together and a person like the anti-hero would be called a mass murderer and hunted down. Suspension of disbelief only goes so far. It all points to bad writing. I'm sorry that someone was grappling so hard with the whole good vs. evil issue that they took the time to make something that is really a horror film into something it isn't.<br/><br/>Is it art? No way. Does it contribute anything lasting to society or it's genre? Not really, perhaps some technical movie-making stuff but generally no.<br/><br/>Don't waste your time on this one."

The movie does take the tedious time to try to emotionally involve you with the characters and the story. What I can't understand is how anyone can think that frustrating an audience is good cinema. Callously killing multiple characters with no consequences, killing the lead off screen, killing his wife, having the insane psychopath villain walk away scott free (hurt by a random car wreck no less) and having Tommy Lee Jones' character quit and babble to the camera before a cut to black is as bad of a theatre experience as anyone could imagine.

"fwomp","10","196","334","3 January 2008"," You Don't Get Perfection Like This Very Often
","If you're a Coen brothers fan, you're gonna be extremely delighted with NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN. This is Ethan and Joel at the pinnacle of their directing careers, something that should not be missed by anyone interested in film or entertainment. Forget FARGO. Push aside THE BIG LEBOWSKI. Move over O' BROTHER WHERE ART THOU. No Country is leaps and bounds beyond those. In fact, it reigns supreme as 2007's best film.<br/><br/>I don't always agree with movie critics but this time they got it right. It is the first time that Associated Press reviewers David Germain and Christy Lemire have both selected the same film as their #1 pick. With more award nominations than you could shake a stick at (including four Golden Globes, three Screen Actors Guilds, probably a gaggle of Oscars and many, many, many others), No Country will undeniably have directors, actors and screenwriters jumping up on stage come awards ceremony time.<br/><br/>Equal parts thriller, western, crime-drama, and action, No Country weaves a tapestry of excellence throughout its length.<br/><br/>The first note of excellence must be directed at Spanish actor Javier Bardem. Probably not very well known to most American audiences, Javier has cemented himself as the leader in portraying a psychopathic killer and (dare I say it!) has surpassed that of Anthony Hopkins in his SILENCE OF THE LAMBS Hannibal Lecter role (something that I thought would never happen). Ruthless, unforgiving, sociopathic, and in desperate need of a new hair style, Anton Chigurh (Bardem) is flawless. Every time he showed up on-screen I felt a chill run through my bones (""Call it""). Absolutely perfect.<br/><br/>The next note of excellence must go to Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones. Llewelyn Moss (Brolin, PLANET TERROR) is the lucky/unlucky soft-spoken Texas cowpoke/hunter who stumbles across a veritable fortune in drug money only to be relentlessly pursued by killer Anton. Mr. Moss' gradual decline in health (mainly due to wounds inflicted on him by Anton) is painful to watch up until the very end. Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is the opposite of Anton Chigurh. He doesn't understand all of the death and destruction laid at his feet. He longs for a time when murders were easy to track and solve, not these new-fangled deaths where bullets aren't used (air-guns do just fine) and there seems to be no rhyme or reason to their patterns.<br/><br/>The fourth (perhaps this should've been first) note of excellence goes to the Coen brothers for their perfect adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel by the same name. Many lines of dialogue were lifted verbatim from the novel itself, including the ending monologue by Tommy Lee. It's noteworthy to mention here that the Coen brothers not only directed but wrote the screenplay, too.<br/><br/>The final note has to go Cinematographer Roger Deakins (he's worked with the Coen brothers on many occasions and also did the exemplary JARHEAD work). Every scene was so well thought-out and so convincingly filmed that viewers are carried freakishly easy through this incredible story.<br/><br/>It's difficult to do justice to this film with one short review, simply because there are so many great elements to it. The casting was spectacular  with Woody Harrelson (NORTH COUNTRY) and Kelly Macdonald (THE GIRL IN THE CAFÉ) pulling in exceptional supporting roles  as was Carter Burwell's haunting original musical score and Mary Zophres impeccable costume designs.<br/><br/>If you missed this film at your local cineplex, you may have gypped yourself from experiencing this amazing cinematic event. Now you've gotta wait for the DVD to be released and then ...it's your call."

The man exuded controlled evil, and I found myself not breathing when he came onto screen, yet couldn't take my eyes from him - a truly mesmerising presence.<br/><br/>Tommy Lee Jones turns in a belter of a performance, and mention should also be made of Kelly MacDonald who nails a faultless Texan accent alongside a multi-layered performance (despite the paucity of her screen time).<br/><br/>Beautifully shot, as you would expect, and with some (welcome) moments of humour amongst the gore, this is a very very fine film. Miss it at your peril, because when those little golden men are being handed out next year in LA, I predict a lot of them will be going to this film. A belter."
"delmarterblanche","10","7","8","9 June 2013"," Among the greatest ever made
","I imagine it must have been quite a shock when No Country For Old Men was first released, not just for the incredibly graphically violent content, but also for the fact that the Coen brothers had here crafted a masterwork even greater than Fargo.<br/><br/>The plot is similar on the surface to that ""homespun murder mystery"", but No Country is, on the whole, a very different film. Rather than holding an identifiable, lovable protagonist as the moral and cinematic center of the tale, it focuses with detached awe on its villain - a creature of purest evil, Anton Chigurh. The film sets up the ultimate in sadistic villainy, refuses ardently to glamorize or glorify him in any way (as other great films like The Silence of the Lambs and The Dark Knight were wont to do with their charismatic antagonists) and then simply allows him to get away with it. Why? To what purpose? Is it condoning his gut-wrenchingly horrifying actions? Is it suggesting that Chigurh is worth admiration for his fierce commitment to his so-called principles?<br/><br/>No. The film does not glorify, condone or celebrate evil, but it shows us a society which does, even if it does so unwittingly or begrudgingly. Chigurh commits unspeakable acts of evil. He may well have been a serial killer if he'd lived twenty years before the film took place. Instead, he's become a valuable tool of an industry which thrives on violence. A criminal empire which is slowly degrading and destroying modern society as we know it (or knew it back in the 80s). And, ultimately, old fashioned morality and principles of justice and fair play are powerless to stop it.<br/><br/>Consider this scene (which left me very confused upon first viewing). Ed Tom Bell, the wizened Texas Sheriff played brilliantly by Tommy Lee Jones returns to the scene of Llewellyn Moss' murder, searching for Chigurh. For the first time, he has his gun out and up. He waits, the nerves clear on his face. We see Chigurh, masked by shadow, but unmistakable, hidden within the room. Waiting. Ed Tom bursts open the door. Gun lowered, his shadow spreads out across the room. There is no- one there. <br/><br/>Upon my third viewing, I decided that the nature of Chigurh's ghostly and inexplicable disappearance between shots is of less importance than the anticipation it creates. Whether he was ever really there or (as I'm inclined to think) it was the Sheriff's imagination preparing him for what was about to unfold, the point is that the viewer expects a battle. A gunfight between good and evil - recompense for the murder of Llewellyn and for dozens of other innocents. Satisfaction for Carla Jean. They do not get it. The good vs evil archetypes have been played out, and we can no longer be certain of evil's defeat. Perhaps that is our fault for nurturing it as long as we have, as a counterpoint to the morality we hold dear - as a distinguishing feature, to reassure our notions of rightness. Whatever the reason, evil has evolved, almost to the point where we can no longer comprehend it.<br/><br/>No Country is a fundamentally pessimistic work. It laments a world where evil is not punished and is allowed to escape even the interference of fate itself (see the decidedly non-fatal car crash at the end, from which Chigurh escapes with no more than a broken arm.). The violence and the villain are despicable, because they are part of a world which is seen as such by the Coens and by Cormac McCarthy. But this pessimism does not reduce my enjoyment of it one jot - much like similarly pessimistic and violent works such as Taxi Driver or Psycho, which are philosophically despondent but visually electrifying.<br/><br/>This is one of the greatest films ever made. It is a sickening portrait of a sickening world, told with such deft skill and visual genius by the Coen brothers that it is impossible to look away. I count it among the likes of Citizen Kane, Vertigo, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Apocalypse Now and Raging Bull as one of cinema's greatest artworks. I have seen it four times now. I can guarantee at least another four viewings lie in the near future."

","I saw this film at a private preview screening in Pittsburg on 5/16/07. I went with five other friends. The entire group was male, 20 yrs old, and mostly college athletes. I explain the demographic of myself and my companions to reason why I was the only one that came away from the film completely satisfied. The story was fresh and different and I don't think my friends had the capacity to fully enjoy what was going on on-screen. I did. And I am still trying to fully understand what an accomplishment it is. Let me try to explain.<br/><br/>The Coens begin the movie with a voice-over against a barren Texas landscape, much the way Blood Simple began. In fact, there are several similarities between the two films, like the auspicious lack of music. A reviewer whose name escapes me once said that all Coen Bro. films look great and sound better. I'll get to sound later but to talk about the look... Other than some CGI animals, which really shocked me in such an otherwise perfect film, each frame is filled with such interesting material that the tone is set perfectly so that as you view a scene, you know whether to wait on a laugh or brace for...<br/><br/>A large part of what fills those frames is great performances. Perfectly cast is Tommy Lee Jones. He nails it, the crowd goes wild etc... That's expected though. Josh Brolin, on a very recent hot streak, has given us two tremendous performances this year and both would have been a Cannes if the superbly talented Tarantino was loyal to his material and friend and kept the masterpiece that was Grindhouse untouched. Brolin's performance in that film was spot on with the perfect amount of ham and cheese to set the tone for the whole movie. In this one, he shows he can do just as well playing strait and absorbing into character as he does at crowd-pleasing cheesballing it. Kelly Macdonald will have to do something else to prove to me she really isn't the Clara Jean character she portrayed even though I know she is a Scot. Woody Harrelson, who I think gets too much praise sometimes, is at his best here and actually manages not to get blown off the screen (well sorta) by Javier Bordem. Mr. Bordem's performance is a force, much like the character he portrays. His Chigurh is a representation of the lunacy of violence that exists in society. There is no negotiations with it, it has always been here and it will always be here. It/he leaves us in shock and terror and all we can do is... ??? The first thing that needs to be said about the sound is that if another film wins an award all year for sound or sound editing, investigations should be held and the judges' bank accounts monitored. The sound in this movie is so shockingly good. There is no music (save some comically placed source music)and the movie is all the better for it. People talk about the way the music in Jaws enhanced the tension of what was happening on screen. People should, from here on say that the lack of music and the placement of source sound in No Country for Old Men thrilled more.<br/><br/>I am certainly rooting for No Country for Old Men to come away with the hardware from Cannes."

","Not to mention bloated dead bodies of dogs and humans and a ""man who wouldn't die"".<br/><br/>""No Country for Old Men"" has Javier Bardem playing Anton Chigurh, a monstrous motive-less killer (unless you count the money, but how does he know about it?) He slides in and out of scenes, you are always chilled but like the clichéd train-wreck victims you see reeling on the side of the road, he never engages you, you never speculate on what made him this way, he is simply a nerveless, passionless cypher.<br/><br/>Actually the clichés were too many to count in this truly, truly disappointing effort from the Coen brothers. A police officer turns his back on the monster and is promptly dispatched and of course the monster manages to squeeze bloodily out of his own handcuffs. H'mm. The instrument used to kill by Chigurh is some kind of stun gun with an oxygen tank. Surely to God he could get hands on a gun with a silencer and not have to lug this tank around like some deranged Fred Munster? There is so much blood, the only conclusion I could make was that this was the whole point, raise the barf meter with everyone, show acres of gratuitous violence to draw in the desirable adbash demographic and forget any kind of plot. A slasher film for the pseudo-sophisticated.<br/><br/>The movie grabs you early and you think, as you survey a field full of fallen felons (they were involved in a drug heist) discovered by an officer played by Josh Brolin, that this movie is going to unwind a great mystery. You settle in for the denouement.<br/><br/>Poor you. You are sidetracked by an absolutely meaningless sub-plot involving Woody Harrelson (another grisly ending) and by Tommy Lee Jones who was left without any relevant script and wanders cynically in and out of scenes, delivering tired old witticisms as a sheriff. We can count the ways and days of tired old cynical sheriffs. I was waiting for ""life is just a box of chocolates and Chigurh the hardboiled candy"". It would have improved things.<br/><br/>I was baffled as to the narrative. Was there one? Why didn't I get it? Was this movie, in spite of the barrels of blood, too deep for me? I was asking myself these questions long before it was over.<br/><br/>Was this movie reaching for pretension or was it truly in the stratum of the intellectual elite? Coin toss answer.<br/><br/>For me, it seemed fitting that there was no ending to this. No plot should equal a no ending. The beast didn't die and went on his stumbling way. All the good guys died, apart from aforementioned slow-drawl sheriff, who is now retired.<br/><br/>Zero artistic merit, zero plot. I gave it a 1 to bring down the over-rating. I still like Tommy, Josh gave a great perforance but I'm going to be really leery of future Coen efforts."

","Llewelyn Moss: Can't help but compare yourself to the ol' timers. Can't help but wonder how'd they do in these times.<br/><br/>The Coen brothers have been making movies for over 20 years now. NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is their twelfth feature together. While they were once considered princely collaborators held at the highest esteem by film enthusiasts the world over, they have recently been the victims of their own identity crisis. Caught between their signature exploration of all things quirky and abnormal found in the parts of America thought to be forgotten and the demanding pressures of delivering bankable Hollywood fare, the Coen's finished by delivering sub-par work that tarnished their lustrous reputation. The film enthusiasts thought they might have lost great talents to Hollywood while Hollywood wasn't even sure they wanted them. What were these ""aging"" filmmakers to do? They could have polished off another Tom Hanks picture and crossed their fingers. They could have appealed to their fans and told another tale of the idiosyncrasies of those living in the middle of nowhere. They could have tried appeasing both parties by attempting THE BIG LEBOWSKI 2. Instead, they did none of these things. No, instead, the Coen brothers crafted a film that is unlike any film they have ever made and is also perhaps the best film they've ever made.<br/><br/>Translating Cormac McCarthy's novel about the relationship between the hunter and the hunted to the screen may be smoothest decision these boys have made for years. Not only does it allow for the brothers to explore the grim sides of characters consumed by money and an unnerving peace derived from killing, but NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN also leaves the door open for an interpretive commentary on the Coen's career itself. Allow me to explain by painting a picture from the film. Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin) aims his rifle at an unsuspecting animal grazing alongside the herd. He is right now in charge, in control, the hunter. He fires and misses, thus beginning his steady descent into ruin. He moves toward the spot where his prey once stood only to find the site of a drug deal massacre. Here, he innocently stumbles upon an enormous amount of money. He picks it up and goes without realizing the hell that is about to be brought upon him. He inadvertently becomes the hunted. He spends the remainder of the film calculating and executing different attempts to regain the superior position he once held. The comparisons are subtle and come about naturally rather than existing as the initial basis for the film to grow out of, reinforcing their genuine nature. I could explain my logic behind this analogy but that would be very un-Coen like.<br/><br/>Another consistency throughout the Coen Brothers' careers is the elevated caliber of talent they attract to their diverse projects. With their writing at top of its game, performances by Brolin, Javier Bardem and Tommy Lee Jones are pushed to the heights of their potential. Moss is a quiet man, focused and constantly thinking about what his next play will be. He has no time for ego, only function, and though most of his motivation is to avoid drawing attention to himself, Brolin's interpretation cannot help but capture our notice. For the second time this year (in conjunction with his slimy crooked cop turn in American GANGSTER), Brolin reinvigorates his skills by inhabiting Moss fully as an instinctual and reactionary being. While Jones is also impressive as a police officer resigned to following the action without any possibility of curbing the outcome, it is Bardem's performance as Anton Chigurh that will leave audiences with a haunting chill after experiencing it. His portrayal of a psychopathic hunter is both disturbing and riveting. This is a man who enjoys torturing his victims mentally by asking them questions meant to expose the inconsistencies in the way they live their lives before ushering them out of this world. He abides by some form of ethical code that only makes sense in his own mind and fully justifies his killings. His adherence to this code is what sends him to an internal state of ecstasy as he chokes a man and stares intently at the ceiling. The hunter is always frightening but Bardem is worse; he's unsettling.<br/><br/>NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is entirely disconcerting but is somehow still a tranquil experience. There is a normality amidst the unrest that thrives in the plain, natural manner in which the story unfolds. The chase is constantly surprising without ever seeming forced. Each move made makes perfect sense but is not seen coming. On this level, even their formal execution of this film speaks to the trajectory of their career. Who knew that leaving quirk behind for harrowing humour and a story that serves itself instead of as a platform for character would invigorate the Coen's method and assert their place as two of the greatest American filmmakers operating in a country thought not to have any place for the them? I like to think they did. In doing so, they have also made a movie for a sharp adult audience in a country bent on catering to all things youthful and disposable.<br/><br/>GRADE: A"

","This review may contain a spoilers, I'm not giving a summation of the movie plot here, but be forewarned, for your own information, that I might make references and/or hints to the storyline in this review.<br/><br/>This movie isn't so much as a movie as it is an anecdote. It's like watching some dismal abyss of a film, with no plot, no real ending, and just a depressing story that basically comes down to no discernible resolve.<br/><br/>The actor's are spot on, Tommy Lee Jones is as good an actor as anyone, he's always suited as the strong, masculine, and wise individual salted with the experience of ten men's lives. It is a role that he is very suited for, and in the last 15 years or so, from the role he plays in the various US Marshals series to the beyond his expectations of years in Rules of Engagement, etc; he is very much the tired old veteran who feels he has lived beyond the expectation of his life, and much of the movie you feel that reflection in his acting. Javier Bardem is clearly the self absorbed evil character that so many movies have, and yet he never has any closure. We never get a sense that justice has reacted to his narrow misses with death.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin plays a convincing role at times, but I take issue with certain points in the movie. !!SPOILER!!WARNING!!SPOILER!! For example, at one point Brolin appears in the wild to be a successful and talented tracker. He portrays someone who is not so much intelligent as he is wise to his surroundings and the fragile nature of life. And yet he misses a deer he's hunting (why is he in the desert in the first place is beyond me). Then when he revisits the scene of the various trucks scattered upon a drug deal gone awry, he doesn't bring his rifle nor his binoculars? Why would you approach a situation where Drug money is clearly involved without a long range rifle, and more importantly no ability to defend yourself? How smart do you have to be to dump a bag full of money for a new bag? Have none of these people considered that there might be some kind of tracking device? Brolin saw the locater earlier. What did he think it was for, Radio Control Cars??? I kind of feel like this is one of those movies that got cut too many times before the film reached the studios, and as a result we're left with a story that doesn't have a plot line. We're left with no explanation really of who orchestrated the Heroin deal, why it went bad, more so at first it appears that Woody Harelson is some photographic memory genius and then gets ambushed by Bardem. How did Javier track him? Spidey sense? Sixth Sense? Did he invoke the Great Spirit from beyond? Come on.... at least give some kind of detail on how and why Woody is even involved? Why would Woody even leave the money untouched? Six out of ten is gracious, only because the acting is so good, but next time, if the movie needs to be thirty minutes longer to get a story across, do it. Because this movie is a mess. I think this must be how everyone at the season ending of Entourage felt when they screened Vinnie's cluster-you-know-what of a movie....<br/><br/>Great acting, Great actors, but a story that is about like watching Happy Gilmore take a swing at the puck...."
"hbdrums-1","1","98","171","25 February 2008"," This film is ludicrous
","Brilliantly shot? Yes. Brilliantly acted? Yes. A masterpiece? Emphatically not. <br/><br/>As an accurate cinematic realisation of a book the Cohen brothers' version of Cormack McCarthy's novel is hard to fault. But the novel is ludicrous, and, ultimately, so is the film.<br/><br/>Why? Because:<br/><br/>1) The self-consciously post-modern comic book plot: a briefcase of drugs money, temporarily unguarded after a desert drug-deal shoot-out in which everyone died, is found by 'Nam vet (Llewellyn Moss - Josh Brolin) while hunting deer. Living gang members are quickly on his trail. Moss goes on the run with the cash. Terminator-style hit-man (Anton Chigurh - Javier Bardem) embarks on killing spree to recover the loot. He starts by brutally throttling a policeman. Ordinarily this would trigger a massive police response. But this never happens. Instead, two local lawmen trail lamely in Chigurh's wake as the killings multiply, casually and repeatedly messing up abundant forensic evidence as they go. Eventually Chigurh recovers the cash, kills Moss and probably Moss's girlfriend too (just to keep a promise). Ageing sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) laments tide of violent crime lapping at his feet. The End. 2) Apart from the burnt-out Bell, the characters are about as realistic as the puppets in an episode of Thunderbirds. They move through the plot in the same jerky way with strings glinting in the unrelenting Texan sunlight. The hit-man is the most clunky puppet of the lot: a relentessly banal robot. <br/><br/>The adulation heaped on this silly film is a classic example of the emperor's new clothes."

","There are just too many ideas that were not properly explained or developed, and occurrences that don't make sense. My feeling is that the Coens and other writers/directors/producers/assistants just didn't care.<br/><br/>Spoilers occur hereafter.<br/><br/>Why was Chigurh arrested at the beginning?<br/><br/>The mechanics of the drug deal are not explained. Are we to assume one side decided to rip off the other or was a third party involved? In the former case, why does there seem to be evidence that the shooters came back (further damage to the pickup)? If the latter, why didn't they take the money?<br/><br/>Why ON EARTH did Moss go back with the water bottle? It was totally out of character. If he had not done so, the whole story would have been different. (The existence of the transmitter would still allow it to work, provided Moss was really stupid, and there's a lot of evidence for that.) From this point on, I had totally lost my belief in the movie. It seemed likely that other occurrences would also be dictated by plot needs, not by common sense.<br/><br/>How did Chigurh and co find out about the botched deal? The obvious answer is that they were in the pay of the unnamed crooked businessman and that the whole deal was a setup from beginning to end. But in that case we are back to a scenario where they would have been on hand to take the money before Moss showed up (whether the shootout involved a third party or not).<br/><br/>Okay, the transmitter. What kind of moron would keep the money in the bag it came in? Surely you would realize that people would be looking for it, and a different-looking piece of luggage would be a good idea. And you would find the transmitter when you unpacked the money.<br/><br/>So where was Moss going? Why did he run off? Why this hopping in and out of motels? And why leave his wife looking like a target? He and his wife should have left the country. And not to Mexico.<br/><br/>It wasn't that easy to get back and forth across the border to Mexico, even in 1980. (Of course, if it wasn't so easy, the plot wouldn't have worked.)<br/><br/>Coin tossing: this might have made sense if there were ANY other evidence that Chigurh's character had principles (no matter how insane), other than Wells' (Harrelson's character) one-liner. (And what was that character doing in the movie anyway? Pointless unless you give him more time.)<br/><br/>This is about 10% of the flaws.<br/><br/>All in all, a shoddy piece of film-making so that we can see lots of gore. Coupled with excellent directing and cinematography, so that the gullible will not notice the lack of substance."

Did they seriously just end the movie like that? I do not understand how a writer could go through an entire movie about one plot of a guy chasing another guy...and then just end it with the cop who did nothing throughout the whole movie talking about his dream. Now I was trying to think about the symbolism behind the last scene and the only thing I could think of was that the dream signified that Tommy Lee Jones knew that the killer was coming for him next. He retired because he knew there was no use looking for the killer anymore because he was going to come after him. But in a movie like this, I don't think that is an effective ending. This wasn't some crappy multi-themed no plot movie. It had lots of action and a distinct chain of events plot and then it was ruined by the ending.<br/><br/>Therefore, just wait til it comes to video because it is a solid movie but you are just disappointed by the ending."

","The ""Incoherent Brothers"" can go straight to hell for foisting this pretentious, boring mess on us! And maybe they'll take the scores of fawning critics, some otherwise respectable (et tu, Peter Travers?), along with them.<br/><br/>While I swore off All Things Coen many years ago (Fargo being their one, though naturally overrated, saving grace), I thought I'd give them another chance when I witnessed the flood of critical praise that followed the release of ""No Country for Old Men"", especially when this one was purported to be unlike anything the filmmakers had released to date. That's not entirely true, by the way. Style-wise, this film is really just a remake of Fargo, only more annoyingly executed.<br/><br/>So what's the problem? For one thing, all the damnable Coen trademarks are here: cloyingly hip dialog unlike any you'll ever hear in real life; subtle, and not so, deeper meanings permeating the script, just daring you to ""not get it"" along with the unwashed masses of simple film-goers who appreciate movies with a beginning, a middle and an end (What, you don't get the in-jokes? What an A-hole you are!); a camera that lingers on characters for interminable lengths of time while they drone on and on; a smattering of pointless ancillary characters that advance the plot not one single bit, etc.<br/><br/>Added to the mix is Tommy Lee Jones, as the stereotypical small town sheriff (How original!), playing the same Texas character he's tackled in any number of other movies, who does absolutely nothing but talk (and talk, and talk) his way through the film, spewing countless homespun aphorisms and stories about whogivesacrapall to his hapless deputy and anyone else who'll listen. Done to death years ago were the requisite interludes in films like these where a southern-fried character waxes poetic for several minutes at a time, offering the audience some symbolic words of wisdom designed to illuminate some plot point or other. But, as usual, nothing comes of it here, and the Coens do it to a fare thee well. (If I never hear another gratuitous redneck soliloquy in a movie, it will be too soon: ""My daddy once said..."" Oh, screw you!).<br/><br/>Saved from sucking completely, the film can boast of a creepy villain, played with subtlety and style by Javier Bardem, who reminds me of an understated Raul Julia. His performance is guaranteed to stay with you long after the closing credits. One wishes more screen time had been devoted to his unsettling assassin.<br/><br/>The greatest sin a filmmaker can commit is leaving the audience bored. The Coen brothers do that more than a few times throughout the course of this picture. Unnecessary attention is devoted to such details as an injured man dressing his wounds after a gun battle, and the aforementioned pointless monologues among characters, while the fate of the film's central character is decided off-camera, with a puzzling, and highly unsatisfying result for the audience.<br/><br/>Then, to make matters worse, and perhaps showing that the director doesn't watch TV, anyone familiar with the obnoxious and controversial ending of a certain popular cable show last summer will recognize the unceremonious way in which this film ends, leaving the theater's audience scratching their heads at the screening I attended. Pissing off your audience: Always a bad idea! What a shame. This movie had some true potential. Despite the few gripping scenes, the film lets it all slip away and squanders whatever promise it might have had. No real entertainment value here.<br/><br/>Maybe the Coens should join forces with the other siblings who have no business making movies--the Farrrelys and Wachowskis. Between the lot of them, perhaps a coherent script might emerge. They may need to start making movies separately, or pairing up with other people to see what fresh ideas might result from such a partnership.<br/><br/>I do know this: I've sat through my last time-waster from these guys, and I'd consider returning only when they've created something other than the same tired retread of their past efforts. Vaya Con Dios, Joel and Ethan!"

This film reminds me of an 'I Love Lucy' episode wherein she is selected (much to Ricky, Ethel & Fred's dismay) to be featured in a book about first-time authors ... heading the chapter, 'Don't let this happen to you.'

In this movie, ... the Josh Brolin character equates to the Janet Leigh character in 'Psycho' except the faithful audience is inexplicably robbed, by the evil Coen brothers (who couldn't manipulate mayo out of an empty jar if their ham sandwich depended on it), of a comparable scene w/ which to mourn the shocking loss of Mr. Brolin. It's as if the screenwriter hadn't a clue how to write such a scene so why bother! 'No Country for Old Men' should be included in every graduate film school program's textbook heading the chapter 'Don't let this movie happen to you.'"

","The Coen Brothers, one of America's most talented directors, with a string of terrific films behind them have changed Cormac McCarthy's controversial novel into the front runner at this year's Oscar ceremonies.<br/><br/>Unforuantely, as in year's past, this film, is going to purely divide moviegoers. Critics and Academy members are going to reward the Coen brothers for their adaptation of McCarthy's novel. Moviegoers, on the other hand, seem to have a divided opinion of this film.<br/><br/>I saw this film with a completely divided audience. The storyline, concerns a drug deal gone badly in the Texas outback. A retired welder and Vietnam veteran, played by Josh Brolin comes across a case full of thousands of dollars in the pick up truck of a Mexican drug dealer. Unforuantely he doesn't realize the case has a homing device, which hired killer, Anton Chigurh, played to complete chilling effect, by Javier Bardem who easily steals the movie from the rest of the cast, uses to track him down.<br/><br/>Chigurh, has deadly ways of killing off those who stand in his way, including a contraption used to kill off livestock, which he uses to blow open door locks and people's heads off with ease. Chigurh, pursues Llewelyn Moss, played by Brolin and his wife, who he sent off to Odessa, in hopes of outrunning the cunning Chigurh, with only local sheriff, Bell, (Tommy Lee Jones) who has a chance of protecting them.<br/><br/>I won't give much more details except to say that this film felt like half a movie, the two main characters' and their stories felt completely unfinished, and that was the key problem with McCarthy's novel. I am a huge fan of the Coen Brothers and their films, Fargo, one of the best films of the 1990s, The Big Lebowski, one of the funniest films I have ever seen, and a film that I watch on a regular basis, heck, I even enjoyed The Hucksucker Proxy, but, like last year, with the overrated, Martin Scorsese film The Departed, I think that critics and academy members are looking to reward the Coen Brother's work, rather than their film. <br/><br/>I'm not going to say it's overrated, just that the ending felt completely unfinished. The film doesn't state what happens to either Chigurh, or Moss. The audience and many people who I have spoken with felt the film was completely unfinished, and felt like half a movie. I agree with them. Unfortunately, I think the academy will reward the Coen brothers for this film, rather than they did with their far superior Fargo in 1996 which covered similar territory as No Country For Old Men."
"dazend1","1","25","39","13 September 2008"," What Were The Coen's Thinking?
","I think the Coen's need to go back to film school and learn the basic rules of film making. One of which is that you never leave the audience hanging like they did with this production. All the actors delivered a great performance, but it is hard to do any great acting job when the Directors keep killing off the characters just as they start to get interesting. I set through this movie and just when it started to really get interesting the whole thing ends without even leaving it up to the audience to decide what would happen next as their was nothing to decide on. That was what the story was supposed to accomplish and failed to do. It just goes to show that what Hollywood is really lacking these days is ""Talent"". The new generation of film makers is either to lazy to come up with an interesting story line and decide that it is easier to make a re-make of an old classic just because the screen play is already done or in this case they are trying to be funny by just leaving out an ending to the whole movie. I would hope that they would have some excuse like they were over budget and just ran out of film, but to end a movie as they did without a conclusion to the story is not only very disappointing to the theater goer, but very stupid as well. Just my opinion, but this was one movie that I did demand my money back as it seems they were just missing the last reel. Go see it though and you be the judge for yourself. Enjoy! Yours in the movies."

","Rural Texas can be hard on anyone, even a rugged and tough Sheriff with a lifetime of exposure to it.

Tommy Lee Jones as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell balances his dangerous chase for a monster assassin with the equally dangerous chase for a good ole' cowboy that comes down hard on the bad side of some very bad people.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin as Llewelyn Moss finds himself in a dangerous dilemma when he brushes up against a bloodbath of a drug deal gone terribly bad and a satchel with 2 million dollars inside. The man looking for that money is a dispassionate and inexpressive villain, Anton Chigurh played by Javier Bardem. The rest ensues as a thrilling triple narrative, from a determined man with 2 million dollars on the run, only hoping to escape the mess that he stumbled upon, an old man sheriff facing an evil like none he's ever seen, and a psychopathic killer, an unstoppable evil with no remorse and a extraordinary determination to find what is his.<br/><br/>With its blood-soaked scenes, grimy West Texas setting and haunting terror filled moments between characters, No Country for Old Men is both riveting and beautiful. The dialogue is flawlessly delivered and the performances are award worthy. With almost no music in the entire film you're left immersed and focused on how the Coens utilize sounds and silence to score the film.

Along for the ride, the critics' glowing praise of the movie and especially the glow from Oscar winning performance of Javier Bardem sold me. I had missed the movie in the theatre, but seeing it on the big screen at home would make up for it. The anticipation began high, as the storyline was laid out. Heck, Josh Brolin was doing an excellent job with his little mentioned role. Tommy Lee Jones was giving another workmanlike laid-back performance as well. An there was, of course, Javier, plodding along. Okay, stick with this, it will grow and develop. Hour number two starts, and the foundation is well laid. Javier is playing a less than remorseful toad. Everyone else is playing their roles in a deadpan manner. Lord, is this what the people in Texas are really like? Don't worry, though. The critics have assured that Javier's performance is well worth it. Then the second hour ends. And so does the movie. Wait, is that the credits? You're kidding. Right? I just watch two hours of everyone playing like they were under Karloff's make-up from Frankenstein? Folks, Boris made that character believable and sympathetic. This drivel made me hate everyone associated with the movie. We didn't get a decent bad guy. We didn't get a story with a morality play. We didn't get decent ending or hope for the future. We got a stinking pile of manure and Oscar noted efforts. Well if this is what the Academy Awards have come to, then I'll make sure I never see another Award winning movie again.

","As hard as I try, I cannot figure why this film is getting so much praise and critical acclaim.

When the film ended and the credits started to roll, I sat there scratching my head not about confusion over the film, but about how it got an 8.8 rating. Generally speaking, I find that I tend to agree with the ratings that various movies receive here on IMDb, but NCFOM is an exception to this track record. With that said, here are the problems I had with the film. For starters, there is nothing new or novel here, it's all been done before. Innocent bystander finds loot, bad guys want loot back, innocent bystander wants to keep money and runs for his life, innocent bystander gets killed. Next, Sheriff Bell seems to wander aimlessly through the movie always a day behind the protagonist and antagonist(s). Next, how is it that no one sees Chigurh walking around with the oxygen tank as a weapon. Or for that matter, the shotgun with the huge silencer on it. Actually, there were a lot of little things like that which stretched believability. How is it that the guy walking by on the street (immediately after Chigurh lights the gas-soaked rag on the car on the street) doesn't see this flaming rag sticking out of the car. And what's with killing off Moss so unceremoniously? For that matter, why kill off the wife? Finally, the whole dream story by Bell at the end, what a bunch of tripe. Obviously, there are people out there who got much more (real or imagined) out of NCFOM than I did and I guess I'm happy for them.

When I first saw Fargo in the theater, one viewer laughed for almost the entire movie, and laughed especially hard during the most brutal scenes. As though he got it, and we apparently did not. Well, that is the apparent charm of the Coen brothers for many -- you either get it or you don't -- and this one, I didn't get.<br/><br/>Especially the ending. Give me a break."

","It is not often you see a movie so blatant about the ascendancy of evil over good. But this is one. In a way it is very well done, and in a way it is very hollow. If you think that people's deeper humanity is a weakness against evil and see this as a profound comment on life as we live it in the 21st century, then so be it.<br/><br/>You can rate each character in the movie's chance of survival by how evil they are. Gradually the less evil are killed off by the greater evil and good sees itself as ""outmanned"". One by one they are done in until only the one greatest and most evil is left. The good sheriff survives by more or less giving up and retiring.<br/><br/>After seeing this, I will boycott the Coen Brothers in the future. Extremely talented they are, but how can I condone such a profoundly evil movie--an immorality play."
"phenomynouss","1","63","110","2 March 2008"," Wasn't that good
","I was not biased against the film when I saw it. I loved ""The Big Lebowski"", and was even amused by the similar theme in the two: both involve a suitcase full of money which the main character carts around, for events to get the suitcase lost, and inevitably leave the audience in the dark as to the eventual fate of the money.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, as great as the movie started out, it devolved into pretentious art-film-like movie-making and a muddled ending with no clear ending. Not defined ending or happy ending, but CLEAR ending. The whole thing came to an abrupt end like a train that hits an invisible wall at low speed.<br/><br/>The cinematography was something worth an Oscar in itself, and I especially loved the way it was shot when Llewellyn discovered the botched drug deal and eventually the money. It was so realistic, you could almost feel the mucky grime of blood drying in the sand or the greasiness of an overused dump-truck, the plainness of the brand-less milk, all the homey settings of a western border-city.<br/><br/>The character Llewellyn isn't very likable. He reminds me something of The Dude in that he's very much aloof to the horrors of seeing the shot-up drug dealers, and casually takes their money and goes home, suddenly remembering one of the dying men asked him for water, and deciding to go back with a gallon of tap water for him, until Anton Shigurh comes after him and he panics, and is forced to become resolute.<br/><br/>In the beginning, Anton Shigurh, played by Javier Bardem, seemed the ideal villain; quiet, utterly irredeemable, seeming the kind of person who would kill someone at any moment without any sort of honor. Even the scene where he makes a shopkeep gamble on his life with the flip of his coin, you fully expect Anton to kill him at any moment, even when he lets the man live.<br/><br/>At about the mid-way point of the movie, it starts to unravel. Perhaps I need to see the movie again, but for the life of me, I cannot begin to wonder what Tommy Lee Jones's character's purpose in the movie is. He promises Llewellyn's wife that he'll make sure Llewellyn lives, and goes about doing nothing but reading the newspaper and lounging about in the office or at a diner. Only once does he visit the crime scene, and towards the end does he come close to the killer.<br/><br/>Next come the nameless character played by Woody Harrelson, and the oh-so-elegantly named ""Man in the Office"" played by Stephen Root. Woody Harrelson's character describes Anton for us, and then wanders off to meet with Llewellyn, and then get killed by Anton for some reason. Anton then randomly appears in the Office man's office and kills him in the middle of interviewing some guy for a job. Anton doesn't say anything of worth to the other man, and is then back to the western area chasing Llewellyn. I have no idea what that was supposed to be about.<br/><br/>The thing is a mess, as the movie skips ahead slightly with Llewellyn dead, and Anton flustered that he lost the money. In a moment that completely changes my opinion of Anton from cold, calculating, assassin of pure evil, to a pitiful, pathetic, stubborn childish creature that kills Llewellyn's wife just because Llewellyn didn't let Anton kill him.<br/><br/>For some random reason, as Anton is driving off from her house, he gets hit by a car, staggers out with a broken arm, and walks away.<br/><br/>For another random reason, Tommy Lee Jones's character has some retrospect, then gives a long, rambling soliloquy about a dream he had. I have heard many accents, and I have very sharp hearing. I can understand some of the most rambling of mumblings and mutterings, but for the life of me, I could not understand more than a few words of Tommy Lee Jones's heavily accented, mumbling, rambling speech about dreaming about his father.<br/><br/>And it suddenly ended with ""And then I woke up."""

","During the first half to two-thirds of the film, the characters were building, which left one to think this was really going someplace, albeit slowly. Other characters were then added in completely unnecessarily. What was the purpose of the complete waste of time Woody Harrelson!? There were ends left flopping in the breeze that you thought surely would tie down as some point, but never did. The storyline was all over the place. Although you know who kills the main character, the creators of this film didn't see fit to show or explain how that came about, which was an important part of the story. It felt strongly like that scene just wasn't included because it would have been too much trouble and/or expense which was cheesy and lame. Tommy Lee Jones, who you expect to be significant was rarely seen or heard from and was downgraded to some form of powerless hick dreamer. Josh Brolin is very nice to look at but didn't have much of a story to act. His character exhibited some semblance of intelligence but never looked for an electronic tracking device in the loot! The Spaniard, Javier Bardem (Anton) did a decent job of pulling off creepy and I'm sure we'll be seeing much more of him in America. The last scene made me scream - ""This had better not be the end!"" But alas, it was! I have passed the DVD on to friends, but felt the need to be apologetic when I did so. It is astounding that this film got the awards & recognition it did. This rates right up there with Lost in Translation, Eyes Wide Shut, and Monsters Ball. The voters must be pod people."

","I kind of feel like I've been taken out on a date by some chick way out of my league who leads me on through the night then dumps me at the end for someone else. A part of me still wants to like her (this movie) because it showed such great potential. Both the main character, the Nam vet Moss, and the villain were impressive in their resourcefulness without being typical, over-the-top, Hollywood-style heroes and anti-heroes. I wasn't too impressed with either Woody Harrelson's or Tommy Lee Jone's characters, but they were secondary to the main contest. I was looking forward to the actual showdown though. Instead, Moss is killed by banditos, a scene which we are deprived of for some reason. The villain later kills Moss's wife and then, after an unrelated car crash, stumbles away and we never find out his ultimate fate. After the death of Moss and his wife (I still wasn't even sure at that point if Moss was really even dead), I thought, 'Ok, now it'll come down to a showdown between Tommy Lee Jones and the villain. Surely, he won't let him get away with killing the sweet, innocent wife."" Guess again! Instead, what we are treated to is this drawn out exploration of Tommy Lee Jone's internal and external relationships as he decides to call it quits! WTF is up with Hollywood?! Last weekend, I made the mistake of watching King's crapfest, defeatist ""Horror"" flick, The Mist, where all the main heroes have a suicide pact at the end rather than take their chances and fight to survive against the monster bugs. This weekend, I was treated to another defeatist ending where the aging sheriff calls it quits and decides to enjoy his pension rather than put his life on the line to kill this psychopath. Wow, there's some inspiration for the next generation... What's next? Harry Potter kills all his friends at Hogwart then himself?! 3 stars for the first 3/4 of the movie P.S.

","Before I decided to watch this movie I checked out its rating and expected all the best out of an 8.4 rating and a 44 rank. Half an hour into the movie I realized that it was not worth watching at all. There is no beginning, middle or end in the story. No events. No sharp turn. NOTHING. A very cold movie which made me skip half an hour of the movie to get to the point of the movie. I will tell you this now, there was no point at all. The only reason this movie runs for two hours is because of an hour wasted of scenes which held no meaning or use to the viewer. The cops seem to do nothing but drink coffee while a serial killer is on the run killing a number of people a day. When people were killed in the motel, no cops seemed to show up as if this meant nothing to them. A very unrealistic, unentertaining movie with left men shocked with its boring ending."
"majikstl","3","34","56","29 February 2008"," No answers to key questions
","When some movies are over, everything is tied up in a neat little package; for better or worse, someone worked really hard to make sure there were no unanswered questions. Other movies aren't so considerate. Others may be messy, but the good ones leave you asking key questions about the philosophy of the story. They may make you wonder ""What would I do in that situation?"" ""Was the hero really a hero?"" ""Do I agree with the film's moral?"" etc. These films draw you into the story, to the point where the ending is really the beginning of the film's lasting power. Sometimes messy is good.<br/><br/>Bad ones, however, leave you questioning the story itself: ""Why did he do that?"" ""What happened to so-and-so?"" ""Did that make any sense?"" ""What did I miss?"" Such films make you see the holes in the plot, not the story that surrounds them. When the film is a huge critical or commercial success, the pertinent question may well be ""So, what's the big deal?"" NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is a ""so-what's-the-big-deal"" type of movie. It is undoubtedly THE film of 2007, an Oscar-winning, critic's choice, top ten darling. Yet, for the most part, it is an utterly conventional modern day western; so predictable that Charles Bronson could be resurrected from the grave and plopped down into the middle of it without missing a beat. It is adequately directed and decently acted, but otherwise -- for the first two-thirds -- it is largely without distinction. Perhaps, because the filmmakers work so hard to seem unconventional in the last third, the defenders think they see something unique in the whole.<br/><br/>The set up is routinely plotted: A poor, but relatively honest young man, while hunting in the west Texas desert, stumbles on a drug deal gone bad. While callously rooting around amidst the dead bodies, he helps himself to over two million dollars in illicit cash. He takes off and is soon pursued by a relentless, but relatively insane mob assassin -- and they are both -- sorta -- pursued by an honest, but relatively ineffectual local marshal. Leaving a predictable trail of dead bodies along the way, the film seems to be promising a confrontation where any two or more of the protagonists should face each other in a traditional showdown.<br/><br/>At least, that is how the writing/directing team of Joel and Ethan Coen set things up. It could be argued that Coen brothers are playing around with the audience, mischievously creating expectations that they have no intentions of meeting. But in side-stepping the obvious tried and true plot twists and dramatic confrontations that such a climax normally would offer, the Coens don't really replace them with anything better. The last third of NO COUNTRY is shocking and challenging only because it is so vapid and devoid of drama. Characters die off-camera with only the vaguest explanation, while other characters' fates are left an obtuse mystery. The finale peters out into three separate and pointless conclusions: the thief dies, the killer apparently gets away and the policeman quits, never to cross each other's paths. And the audience isn't given much reason to care about any of them.<br/><br/>The anemic narrative wouldn't matter so much, I suppose, if the film were instead a incisive or compelling study of one or more of the characters. Though the actors give decent enough performances, they can't flesh out the characters beyond ciphers. Josh Brolin as Llewelyn Moss, the hunter turned thief, is a solid presence, a modern day twist on the iconic figure of the strong, silent and resourceful cowboy. But beyond the good-boy-gone-bad tradition of the western, the film gives Llewelyn little backstory and no particular depth beyond being both foolish and yet smarter than one would expect. Ed Tom Bell, the gruff, world-weary, retirement-bound, small-town sheriff, is played by Tommy Lee Jones as a safe and comfortable stereotype; only denied by the uninspired script either the traditional age-cultivated wisdom or the opportunity to be even vaguely heroic. He spends most of the film wistfully longing for the good old days.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem's much praised work as the tiresomely inscrutable and indestructible hit-man Anton Chigurh is largely a one-note performance -- Oscar win notwithstanding. His persistence, in lieu of any personality, has been inexplicable interpreted as having mythic dimensions as the embodiment of cruel fate or death incarnate. Only desperation to find meaning in the slight story justifies such heavy-handed symbolism. Lumbering through the film with all the emotional complexity of a slasher movie serial killer, Chigurh is little more than a lazy gimmick; with his over-sized weapons (one requires he lug around a 30-pound tank of compressed air!) and arbitrary flip-a-coin sadism, he is a ludicrous character who survives only due to the manipulations of a generously contrived script.<br/><br/>But, it is no wonder the film focuses on Chigurh, who like Coens' films, embodies a cold, dispassionate emptiness. It is not that they don't do compassion (let alone passion) well, they don't even try. In their best effort, BLOOD SIMPLE, the chill of their drama is counteracted with a coy air of satire. Even FARGO is unpleasantly empty as far as emotional depth. You can tell a lot about filmmakers by how they treat even their minor and incidental characters; most characters in Coen films are disposable plot devices. It is no wonder a key character is killed off screen; the Coens don't care about his fate and assume we shouldn't either.<br/><br/>NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN builds to one of the least satisfying conclusions of all time. The film is ultimately riddled with gaps in logic and figure-it-out-for-yourself ambiguities; things that the audience may not need to see, but have a right to expect to experience as part of the drama. NO COUNTRY isn't just weak film-making, it is an act of bad faith. The final question facing the viewer might well be ""Is that it?"""

It was confusing with gaping holes in the story and plot that leave the viewer wondering who people are, how they got to where they are, what really happened, and why. It feels like the Coen bros. ran out of ideas, footage, and money, so they slapped together whatever they had on-hand for an ending.<br/><br/>You have to give the Coens credit for artistic style and for building a gripping, gritty experience for the first hour. The film was thoroughly engrossing from the beginning. The acting was excellent. They created a masterful concoction of brutal killer hunting the ""little-guy trying to making it big"". They get us emotionally invested in the underdog and put us on the edge of your seats routing for the little-guy just to survive. Unfortunately that's about the time things implode. The Coens drop the viewer into a spiral of confusion and reward our emotional investment with nothing. It left me wondering why they released such an unfinished film.<br/><br/>Tommy Lee Jones was sadly under utilized. He is an immense talent and screen presence relegated to an impotent, pseudo-supporting roll. His character is irrelevant to the plot and only leaves us wishing he had a bigger part. His closing scene only serves to further the confusion.<br/><br/>The true offenders in this debacle are the ""Film Critics"" and Academy brass who have hyped this mess.

Even with the transponder it seemed like Anton had a stroke of luck to pass close enough to the bag for the transponder to start beeping. How the heck was Anton right on his heels at the next hotel - Llewelyn should have been out of range. And how was anyone able to find him after he got rid of the transponder and got into Mexico, not only did Anton find him but so did Woody Harrelson (or maybe Anton was following Woody, but I don't see how that could happen either). Anyhow seeing as this movie was something like #40 on the IMDb all time best and a Coen brothers movie I expected to be in for a real treat, instead I got a movie that doesn't make much sense and has no payoff at the end.

They just made decisions pretty arbitrarily without too much thought. In real world everyone has to make equally serious decisions everyday! Were they special in any sense? The impossible carelessness of the hunter was annoying. Bringing the money using the original suitcase without a check. Sitting upright in front of the door to wait for the enemy's attack. Bold? Illogical? I was also hoping that the movie would tell more about the virtual and the reality related to the cop. Got much less than I expected."

","NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is an ALLEGORY.<br/><br/>The title is from the first line of Sailing to Byzantium by William Butler Yeats, a poet classically trained and considered by many to be the greatest 20th Century poet.<br/><br/>Death is Anton Chigurh. His hair style (hood-ish, shroud-ish) and black clothing suggest Death. Death kills the innocent as well as the guilty and has his own set of rules. When the witness to the high-rise killing asks, ""Are you going to kill me?"" Death answers, ""It depends. Do you see me?"" When the kids on the bicycles help him after the car accident he tells them, ""You didn't see me."" If you see Death, you die; if not, you may live. Chigurh seems to come and go at will and seems to know where Moss is without trying very hard. His rules are his rules and they seem arbitrary and random. He is referred to by the sheriff as a ""ghost"" and he seems to be able to go wherever he pleases.<br/><br/>Death kills with a cattle stun gun, almost like a member of the clergy administering a cross to the forehead of a parishoner. Death is often portrayed as a hooded figure with a scythe; in this case he's a ""hooded"" figure with a cattle stun gun.<br/><br/>Man is Llewellen Moss, part sinner, part saint. He is offered a deal with Death when Death offers to ignore his wife but take him. Instead, Llewellen challenges Death and chooses declines the offer. This is straight Faustian bargaining. By declining Death's ""This is the best deal you're gonna get"" Moss signs not only his own death warrant but his wife's, too.<br/><br/>Llewellen challenges Death to a showdown and when his wife tells the sheriff, ""He won't quit, neither. Never has."" the audience expects a later showdown because we've been trained to see the protagonist take on the antagonist at the climax of a story  but before that can happen life's randomness gets in the way and the Mexicans kill him. This is the major turn in the movie and the one that takes the sail out of the audience, which has been cheering for Man in his struggle against Death without realizing it.<br/><br/>Free Will is Carla Jean. She chooses at the end of the film not to allow Death to be random. She has a 50% chance of saving herself but chooses not to avail herself of the opportunity. She is the bravest of the lot, choosing to die by her own decision and not the randomness of Death.<br/><br/>The sheriff is the philosopher trying to understand the universe. He cannot and is defeated by Death in his attempt. At the movie's end the Sheriff bemoans the fact that God never entered his life. One of God's creatures, Death, was in the Sheriff's life but he didn't realize it (see ""Scene with Sheriff"" below). The story is the Sheriff's, his quest to understand Life, and the dream he tells at the end of the movie explains that his own father, long dead, has gone before him into the darkness of death and awaits him.<br/><br/>Interesting parallel  Moss pays money for a coat as he crosses into Mexico; Chigurh pays the kids money for a shirt after his accident. What is meant by that? Cannot be a coincidence.<br/><br/>Chigurh walking away from the accident at the end shows that Death cannot be stopped. It will always walk the streets. It is a part of our existence forever.<br/><br/>Scene with the Sheriff and Death at the same hotel room at the same time but the Sheriff does not see Death. This scene is vital  it solidifies the allegory. The Sheriff enters the room but does not see Death and so he does not die. Death sees the sheriff but chooses not to kill him because he's not seen in return. This scene is the ""supernatural"" scene which signals that we've watching an allegory, that what we've been watching is more than it appears.<br/><br/>Why 1980 for the book/film when it was written in 2005? Could it be it was begun then and the author simply chose not to update it? What is the reason? Must be one. Might be nothing more than the author started this 25 years ago and didn't feel like updating it to present times.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful movie!"
"conor_a_nixon","3","16","24","17 May 2008"," The Emperor Has No Clothes
","Yes, three stars. This film is a miserable waste of time, and don't let the other 'fooled' reviewers, the swooning Academy who wasted three (of the four) Oscars on it, or anyone else tell you otherwise. Just because a movie is confusing, unexpected, amoral, cynical and bleak, and yes, hell, doesn't have a happy ending - just because it's DIFFERENT from 99% of the other junk that Hollywood spews out - just because you maybe don't understand it, doesn't mean it's a great movie. Go with your gut instinct (if you've seen it). The movie DOESN'T HAVE AN ENDING, happy or otherwise. Imagine if Blade Runner Director's Cut, never mind restoring the controversial Unicorn Dream Sequence, actually ended on that? If Arnie in T1 had killed Sarah Connor and walked away, while the Police Captain had decided he was just too old to be bothered? I mean, who watches a movie for that? A waste of $5.99 for FIOS HD. <br/><br/>I want to clear the air here a little by saying that the Coens directed (and more importantly perhaps, wrote) one of my all-time favorite movies, Miller's Crossing. I don't have a problem with extreme violence - Starship Troopers, Hard Boiled, Platoon, Natural Born Killers, Rollerball - all excellent, but they had a point to make, a beginning, middle and end. Unlike this bag of old shite. Let's be clear, there's no mysterious insight into human nature here, just a profoundly depressing lack of ideas, dressed up as Texas-noir art-house nihilism. <br/><br/>You want to hear about real senseless violence? Read your local newspaper. Read about the psycho guy in Louisiana who threw his three kids off a bridge to drown. Read about the millions slaughtered in Rwanda or Congo or pretty much everywhere in sub-Saharan Africa in the last ten years for no particular reason. That's emptiness. Real-life, meaningless, depressing death-into-nothingness. I don't need Hollywood to give me the fake deal. <br/><br/>So which Oscar did it deserve, IMHO? Bardem, for being a great edge-of-your-seat psychopath. The problem is the plot, the point, or lack thereof. I'm sorry to have to be the little boy who stands up in the crowd and contradicts everyone else on the planet who just doesn't want to be the one to look stupid, by not understanding some work of genius. But the Emperor really does have no clothes."
"Anyanwu","9","36","61","1 January 2008"," Disappointing and over-hyped.
","I enjoyed ""Fargo"" which I feel is their best work, but ""No Country"" was boring. The acting was fine, but the story just didn't inspire me. Usually a really good movie makes me want to go out a write ( I am a screenwriter myself). It gives me hope that there are some good stories out there being made into film. But this one...I dunno, it was like someone put a lump of cookie dough onto a baking sheet, and the cookie didn't bake. So you're left with a lump of..cookie dough. I got up in the middle of the movie to buy popcorn and a soda, used the restroom just to entertain myself. I NEVER do that at a good movie. I stay planted and aware. But I had to get away from it for a few minutes. Thank God we didn't pay a lot to see it.<br/><br/>I'm not going to go all out intellectual on this puppy, because frankly, I don't have th energy to nitpick every detail, so I'll skim over a few things that bugged me. I've read some of the other postings by fans of the movie. It seems that the few folks who dislike the film are accused of not ""understanding"" the greatness of the Coen brothers themes on violence in America..blah,blah,blah. I love movies, seen a lot (foreign and American made) so the reality is, this movie didn't work FOR ME. It bored me, left me uninspired and I regret that I didn't wait until DVD. Potential ""spoiler area"" ahead. You were warned.<br/><br/>1. They did try something interesting, which is kill off a lead character by the third act. But Tommy Lee Jones's character was not that interesting to sustain the last section of the film. As a writer, I applaud the bait and switch technique of taking out a character that we've followed from the beginning. However, having Tommy's monologue at the beginning, and showing him later in the film does not help sustain his presence once his character takes over in the third act. Plus, his being an old gunslinger weary from the battle is old. I kept wondering if the dynamic would've shifted dramatically had this been a younger sheriff. Every time Tommy Lee came on screen, I just got tired because who looked so drained. I understand this was probably an attempt to be the ""message"" of the film, (How do old folks deal with changes they can't fathom?), but I've seen that too many times.<br/><br/>2.""Quirky"" dialogue by the killer and potential victims was not enough to pull this clunker together. As stand alone vignettes at a short film festival, it would've been entertaining. But to string them throughout two hours kills me, and smacks of pretentious dribble. Perhaps if they had opened up the film with that scene in the gas station, prior to us knowing who Bardem's character is, it would've set a tone of unease, given us the rules of the killer's world.Prepared us with the sense of dread whenever he appears then cut to his short capture, and then onto the idiot Moss and his discovery. For this project, I didn't buy it. It smells like a writing technique/device to razzle dazzle us so we don't notice that nothing is really happening.<br/><br/>3. Stupid people do stupid things and kill any chance of me rooting for them. Moss was plain stupid. Although this is set in 1980, don't make the person who we follow in the story stupid. You find money. You take it. You do NOT go back in the middle of the night to bring a man water, A man who you left in the hot desert sun all day. If your conscience bothers you that much, make a call to the police, and you leave town with your wife outside of Texas. What a bonehead. Once you've made the decision to steal the goods, you check the goods and make sure you can't be traced. (the fact that Moss said "" I know what a transmittor is"" but doesn't check for one, or even dye pellets inside the money, dude you are a screw up and deserve your fate).<br/><br/>4. It just sucked for me. I can't even put my finger on why this flick sucked for me. The cinematography was okay but not that impressive to make up for the story. The acting was okay, but no one in it made me jump up and proclaim ""Dagnabit! That boy deserves an Oscar!"". The best I could say is that this honestly could've been a made-for-TV movie. The violence was minimal. The cattle prod-gun was cool the first time you see it, but then I started thinking ""You're lugging that thing around, and no one notices? You pull a man over in a cop car, but you have no uniform and you have a cattle prod air tank with you, and the yahoos in town just look at you?"" More than anything, this movie made Texans look like dumb hicks. (maybe this explains Bush's background) So those are my main reasons for disliking the film. I've heard loving reviews of the theme of the hunter and the hunted, a killer with no conscience and the sheriff with morality leaking out of his a$$. It's all lies I tell you! It is hyped ""blah"", just like ""The Departed"" was last year. Any talk of Oscar Buzz is undeserved in my opinion. In it's place I would recommend ""Eastern Promises""."

"kikoydaba3","9","3","3","23 August 2019"," an instant western classic about drugs, greed, death and hopelessness
","No Country for Old Men is an instant western classic about drugs, greed, death and hopelessness. Led by an all-time great performance from Javier Bardem playing a macabre character in Anton Chigurh, the film is a heart pounding non-stop manhunt packing enough emotional wallop while successfully exploring its themes.<br/><br/>Set near the US-Mexico Border, the film can be considered as a cautionary tale about the War on Drugs which has raged for decades. Motivated by greed Llewelyn Moss, played by Josh Brolin, takes off after finding a bag of cash on a site of failed transaction resulting to massacre. Unbeknown to him, placed inside is a tracker. Anton Chigurh hunts down Llewelyn Moss for the money. As the hunt progresses, snippets of dialogue and character interactions show that Chigurh is not evil, but merely a servant of death or death itself. Guided by a twisted philosophy, Chigurh kills because of fate and destiny. Moss sends away his wife and mother-in-law as the hunt becomes not merely about the money but also personal. Other characters appear to further provide insight and growth such as Woody Harrelson, who warns Moss that facing Chigurh is a death sentence. No character is as important to carry the film on an emotional level as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell, played Tommy Lee Jones. Embodying the hopelessness pervasive throughout the film, Sheriff Ed is an active participant in the manhunt aiming to prevent it. Despite his efforts, people die. Anyone who faces Chigurh dies. His scenes throughout the manhunt are beautiful, sad and introspective. Already an old man near retirement during the course of the film, the ending where he is retired perfectly captures the essence of his arc losing all hope living in world where death is unstoppable.<br/><br/>While No Country is an excellent play about its themes, it lacks a true emotional anchor that carries the movie. Llewelyn Moss and Sheriff Tom aren't particularly engaging characters that captures the viewer's empathy.<br/><br/>The Coen Brothers also bring technical qualities that complement the story. Wide and barren shots to portray a sense of epic scope, an almost non-existent score to build tension naturally and violence fitting for the antagonist.<br/><br/>No Country for Old Men is a must see not only for its antagonist but as a whole.<br/><br/>9/10"
"Screen_Blitz","10","3","3","25 June 2017"," The Coen Brothers' nihilistic western thriller inspired on Cormac McCarthy's novel is pure cinematic beauty
","Life in west is violent, at least that is what many cinematic entries in the western genre lead you to believe. Hollywood moguls Joel and Ethan Coen take on the audacious of taking the pages of Cormac McCarthy's novel of the same name and spinning it into cinematic proportions. It is significantly difficult feat to pull as McCarthy's sophisticated style of writing have lead many to believe translating his works into films are far too easier said than done. In spite of this, it appears that no one's directing methodology is a suitable match of McCarthy's writing other than the Coen Brothers. In a splendid effort, the masterminds behind such projects as 'Fargo', 'The Big Lebowski', and their debut 'Blood Simple' bring McCarthy's western tale to life in an pure enthralling fashion. It is violent, gory, and unquestionably dark in tone. But beneath the surface is immersive talent of the Coen Brothers who more than effectively uproot a tale of fate, conscious, and perplexing morality. Set in 1980, this film follows Southern Texas native Llewelyn Moss (played by Josh Brolin), a retired Vietnam veteran who goes on a hunting trip only to come across a string of dead bodies in what appears to have been a drug deal gone awry. Upon investigating the gruesome scene, he gets a hold of a suitcase containing a few million dollars. While Llewelyn manages to run away with it in attempt to make it to the Texas border, a sadistic sociopath Anton Chigurh (played by Javier Bardem) sets out to retrieve it, leading to a series of grisly murders. Meanwhile, Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (played by Tommy Lee Jones) goes the run to investigate the increasing body count.<br/><br/>If the violence and bloodshed don't serve as a detriment to sitting through this two-hour work of art, then you are in for beautiful ride. After all, it is the Coen Brothers behind the wheel of this cinematic endeavor. Continuing on their signature methodology of mixing violence with darky, wry humor and eccentric characters, the Coens bring a masterful sleight of hand in operating the story of a bloody cat-and-mouse game where the fate of each character is unpredictable. The biggest show stealer here is Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh, a nihilistic, violence-hungry mastermind who becomes the driving force behind the briskly paced plot. He is a man with a complex sense of morality and shows little to no mercy on anyone who crosses his path. Each second he shows up on screen, things get very suspenseful within the blink of an eye. Coming face-to-face with each individual, Chigurh has a questionable of determining their fate, and that is flipping a corn and ordering them to guess it. If the Coens prove anything, one of them is that sometimes silence can be more nerve-racking than the presence of suspenseful music. And the best part is that the film does not need an eerie music score to portray its suspense. The dialogue and Bardem's unforgettable delivery firmly gets the job done. If you find yourself laughing, the chances are it is an uncomfortable one. (And let's not forget Roger Deakins's admirable camera-work put into the mix) As for Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones, both manage to give some decent performances, the latter of whom adds a sense of dark humor to the atmosphere with his sharp dialogue. Woody Harrellson plays a small role and does a fine job, but his time on screen is rather short. Kelly MacDonald, a Scottish actress showing off with her nifty Southern accent, gives a nice portrayal as the lead character's wife. Again not too much screen time. <br/><br/>No Country for Old Men is violent, yet masterfully crafted western thriller uprooted by the directorial talent of the Coen Brothers. It is an astounding cinematic gem that proves why the Coens are such a respected filmmaking duo. At best, it stands in the front ranks of cinematic entries of the modern western genre. As for Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, and Tommy Lee Jones; these three deserve a round of applause."

","No Country for Old Men won four Academy Awards in 2007, including Best Picture and Best Director(s). Despite the critical acclaim, the Coen Brother's adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel was probably a bit of a head-scratcher to many people.<br/><br/>The film's narrative begins in familiar fashion, introducing you to the main characters and setting up the plot using recognized, established filmic devices. Llewelyn Moss stumbles upon a suitcase filled with cash and wants to keep it for himself. Anton Chigurh is the sociopath who will stop at nothing to get the cash back. Ed Bell is the Sheriff tasked with bringing Chigurh to justice and, it is presumed, keeping Moss and his wife, Carla Jean, from danger. In addition, there's a corporate backer, a hired gun, and a Mexican gang who are also after the cash (i.e., the McGuffin). So much for the usual narrative elements.<br/><br/>When the film continues far beyond the point that the expected narrative structure breaks down, viewers are left to grasp at what the film is actually about. What, if anything, is this film trying to say?<br/><br/>I propose that the film is, among other things, a meditation on the impotence of human and divine systems of justice in light of unflinching, unrelenting, random, radical evil. There are a number of elements in the film that indicate such a meditation, but one need not look much further than the meditations of Sheriff Bell, whose words begin and end the film. Consider:<br/><br/>""There was this boy I sent to the 'lectric chair at Huntsville Hill here a while back. My arrest and my testimony. He killt a fourteen-year-old girl. Papers said it was a crime of passion but he told me there wasn't any passion to it. Told me that he'd been planning to kill somebody for about as long as he could remember. Said that if they turned him out he'd do it again. Said he knew he was going to hell. 'Be there in about fifteen minutes'. I don't know what to make of that. I sure don't. The crime you see now, it's hard to even take its measure."" <br/><br/>With these words, the film's ""story line"" unfolds, with Sheriff Bell trying, and failing, to be effective.<br/><br/>At the end of the film, the retired Sheriff Bell describes a dream to his wife:<br/><br/>""It was like {my father and I} was both back in older times and I was on horseback going' through the mountains of a night. Going' through this pass in the mountains. It was cold and there was snow on the ground and he rode past me and kept on going'. Never said nothing' going' by. He just rode on past... and he had his blanket wrapped around him and his head down and when he rode past I seen he was carryin' fire in a horn the way people used to do and I could see the horn from the light inside of it. 'Bout the color of the moon. And in the dream I knew that he was going' on ahead and he was fixin' to make a fire somewhere out there in all that dark and all that cold, and I knew that whenever I got there he would be there. And then I woke up."" <br/><br/>The film is nihilistic in both structure and content. If you would like to force a less despairing ending, Bell's dream could be interpreted as a ray of hope: a light shines in the darkness! On the other hand, it is a dream that he wakes up from.<br/><br/>I don't know what to make of that. I sure don't. But that doesn't mean I can't try."
"royalewcheese11","10","3","3","18 February 2016"," An instant classic for the history books.
","In the year 2007, two of modern cinema's most unique and creative filmmakers united once again to adapt a rich piece of storytelling into a miraculous landmark in the history of art – a film we can easily call an instant classic. It is not difficult to attach that label when something so clearly merits it, but defining with words the perfection it achieves does present a challenge. Here goes nothing. Joel & Ethan Coens' masterpiece, No Country for Old Men, more than deservedly won the Oscar for Best Picture in a year stacked with great films. It was simply a triumph that could not be ignored, regardless of its complete lack of common traits the academy tends to reward. The film not only explores a much darker genre than past recipients of the trophy, but it also never succumbs to a single mechanical cliché or convention known to said genre's endless amount of previous subjects. Among many other trademarks, the Coen brothers are notorious for throwing curve-balls at their audience at the turn of every corner, and the material supplied in this case uncannily complements their inimitably transcendent flair. We're treated to a thrilling crime plot wherein Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) discovers a drug exchange's fatal aftermath and makes off with the satchel of money left behind, being sought after as a result by a psychopathic killer, Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem). Interwoven with this familiar-sounding setup is an interesting observation of the sheriff investigating the situation, Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), during a late period in his life in which he ponders and recollects about the state of humanity and his place in it.<br/><br/>Slowly built and steadily attained is a bleak, grimly intense mood as we follow the violent pursuit, and one of the key elements to maintaining this piercingly cold atmosphere is the ingenious utilization of sound (for which the film garnered Oscar nominations in each category), absent of accompanied musical score. The quietness of the Texas desert location itself is more effective in maintaining adrenaline than any action-packed extravaganza could ever aspire toward. Witnessing murderous events under such a realized ambiance sticks the viewer right there in the mayhem, sparking a breathtaking captivation that few other works have accomplished in a single scene let alone throughout their duration. The sense of danger is also heightened by the stimulating contribution of legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins (who received one of many Oscar nods yet again without the victory), capturing wonderful imagery that evokes reactions ranging from dread to exhilaration to pure awe. Editing the film themselves (and receiving Oscar nominations for it), the Coens also take full control of every moment, oozing impact out of each frame with expertly timed cuts throughout, and allowing it to breathe when necessary. They never miss a beat, causing our hearts to do so instead.<br/><br/>But all of that means nothing without thoroughly convincing performances from the cast, which they do provide – and then some. Brolin conveys fear and determination simultaneously in an otherwise emotionally concealed character. Bardem, earning the Best Supporting Actor Oscar, mesmerizes with every second of his presence, flawlessly mumbling his lines in a creepily threatening manner and using subtle facial expression to exude menace unlike any villain before him. Topped off with his visual appearance, Bardem and company have turned Anton Chigurh into a cinematic icon. Jones also impresses as a man who has seen it all, and finally comes to terms with the fact that putting an end to the unjust ways of humankind is completely out of his hands. The film's quietness assists in catching a softer vibe during the scenes in which Jones takes over with narration or dialogue expressing Bell's feelings about his role in the cruel world surrounding him, and we begin to see the interconnected cat-and-mouse story as a reflection of his perspective, adding an integral profundity to the overall product.<br/><br/>There is endless additional praise to be given here. Joel & Ethan Coen nail it on the head in every regard, and rightfully took home the Academy Award for both their exquisite direction and brilliant screenplay. With thanks to Cormac McCarthy for writing the novel on which the film is based, they enchant us once again with precise attention to detail in each and every element. All of the characters are given dimension, signature comic relief is present without force, the dialogue is consistently spellbinding and the unfolding of events surprises and enthralls, even on subsequent re-watches. The shocking unpredictability paired with the masterful execution makes for a gloriously enamoring experience, and still manages a dramatic backdrop of poetic commentary on fate that keeps the viewer in deep thought after it ends. No Country for Old Men is a feat that will be treasured for many years to come."

","When a Vietnam veteran discovers two million dollars while wandering through the aftermath of a Texas drug deal gone horribly awry, his decision to abscond with the cash sets off a violent chain reaction in a stripped-down crime drama from Joel and Ethan Coen entitled,No Country for Old Men.The film was based on the Cormac McCarthy novel of the same title.It features Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin. Themes of fate, conscience and circumstance re-emerge that the Coen brothers have previously explored in Blood Simple and Fargo.<br/><br/>Llewelyn Moss has just stumbled into the find of a lifetime. Upon discovering a bullet-strewn pickup truck surrounded by the corpses of dead bodyguards, Moss uncovers two million dollars in cash and a substantial load of heroin stashed in the back of the vehicle.

","Will try to write about the one, but significant miscalculation, at the movie's end - without making this a ""spoiler."" Here goes: when you get to the final pages in McCarthy's novel, you can see it's winding down, so you begin to read slowly, being sure to take everything in - you can, of course, see that the typing stops in a few paragraphs and you know it's about to end. But when you get to this final scene in the movie version, the viewer has no such advance warning, so as the lead character reaches the end of his speech about a dream he's had, and the screen goes dark, the movie's end seems abrupt and un-satisfying. The Coens could have easily solved this problem by visualizing the dream, showing it with the speaker's voice on the soundtrack. Would have made for a much more cinematic finish. Still, that being said, this is a masterpiece - and one of those rare instances when the Oscar actually did go to the best picture of the year."

","""You can't help but wonder how the old timers would operate in these times,"" narrates Sheriff Ed in thick and alluring southwestern drawl. We soon find out exactly what he means by ""these times."" Llewelyn is hunting in a remote and arid grassland, stumbles across a drug deal gone wrong and manages to get away with a bundle of cash. While Llewelyn covers his tracks, keeps his mouth shut and is smart, tough and resourceful, he may not be prepared for what is coming for him in the form of tracker Anton Chigurh. A person without empathy is more dangerous than a coward, and Chigurh is cold, cruel, relentless and methodical. He figures out not just where people are, but where they will be. As Chigurh pursues Llewelyn, others are close behind including Sheriff Ed, a drug cartel, other trackers and Llewelyn's girlfriend, only a few of whom are cut out for this game of cat and mouse.<br/><br/>Ten years after the release of the film and it is well understood how it made or sealed the careers of Javier Bardem (Chigurh), Josh Brolin (Llewelyn), Tommy Lee Jones (Ed) and not least of all the Coens who are some of the best directors in the business. Here the Coens are firing on all cylinders. The film is complex, thrilling and multi-layered. It is full of great lines. Its occasional extreme brutality is offset with wit, charm and humor. Adding to the compelling characters are amazing performances by Jones, Bardem and Brolin. They are perfectly cast. The voice of Jones alone is authentic and enthralling. Bardem is truly chilling. He speaks, moves and acts like a ghost. There are beautiful shots of the southwestern landscape in the morning light and intriguing close-ups of the characters. There is delight even in little details; a coin flip, a drink of milk, a cat and the banter of minor characters. Such attention to detail is a mark of the brilliance of the Coens. The film is set in the 1970s and is based on a story by Cormac McCarthy. This is one of my favorite films (top 20) of all time."
"zkonedog","7","5","6","6 March 2017"," A Very Unique Experience
","I have watched quite a few movies in my lifetime so far, but after viewing ""No Country For Old Men"" I can honestly say that I haven't really seen too many like this before.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, this film begins by introducing ruthless killer Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a man the likes of which Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) cannot even comprehend. When Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) finds a briefcase full of money meant for Chigurh, it kicks off a tense chase between all three parties.<br/><br/>The reason ""No Country For Old Men"" is such a solid film is because it is so deep on a number of different yellows. All three main characters are interesting and make you truly care (one way or another) about their actions, especially the viciousness of Anton (that is probably the one aspect of the movie I will always remember).<br/><br/>Despite the fact that this is a very deep, thought-provoking movie, it is also quite sparse and terse (perhaps more sparse than any movie I've ever seen). There is no dramatic music (no contrived drama whatsoever, to be honest), no montage sequences, no character flashbacks, or any bells-and-whistles. It is completely ""straight down the line"", so to speak. If you are a fan of that type of stark filmmaking, this will be one of your all-time favorite.<br/><br/>All told, I enjoyed watching this movie for the amount of themes it threw at me and particularly the way it portrayed the ""new type of killer"" in the modern world (even in the more traditional Texas). I prefer a movie with a little more obvious drama, so no five stars from me, but other than that I would recommend this to any fan of interesting cinema that does not conform to any other standard but its own."
"williampsamuel","10","5","6","7 January 2015"," A Masterpiece of the Modern West
","A drug deal gone wrong, a pile of bodies, and two million dollars of missing cash; such are the things that many a gangster film, gritty cop movie, and shoot-em-up have been made from. And in the hands of Joel and Ethan Coen, it provides the perfect material for one hell of a modern day western.<br/><br/>By the time hunter Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin) finds the money, he's already seen the bodies and the drugs. He knows the stakes, and he knows that certain people will not rest until they recover that money. But how could he know that he'd be pursued by a man like Anton Chigurh. Chigurh (Javier Barden) is one of the deadliest, most merciless, and downright craziest men you could ever. If you present even the slightest inconvenience to him, he will look you in the eye, talk to you as calmly as if you were talking about the weather, and gun you down without a second thought. Sometimes he doesn't even need an excuse. He's the kind of person that bodies just seem to materialize wherever he goes, and if he's looking for you, you might as well already be in the ground.<br/><br/>Of course with all these people dying, it won't be long before the law get's involved. Enter Sheriff Ed Tom (Tommy Lee Jones). He's seen just about everything in his long years as county sheriff, and it doesn't take him long to figure out that Llewellyn is in way over his head. Now he's in a race to see if he can catch up with Llewellyn and the money before Chigurh can.<br/><br/>As you would expect from the Coen Brothers, No Country for old men is an intricate, compelling, and somewhat strange tale. Under their direction, what might be merely a simple chase movie takes on a higher level of complexity, as the characters try to outwit and stay one step ahead of each other. This movie also knows how to play its cards close to its chest. It withholds enough information to keep you guessing, but never so much that you become frustrated. It should be noted that the Coens really have a way with dialog. I haven't seen a script with this much restraint since The Magnificent Seven. There's not a single unnecessary word in the entire film. When the characters do speak, their words are full of wit and personality. For instance, when Ed Tom here's about the three men gunned down in a cheap motel room, he refers to it as 'natural causes.' ""Natural for their line of work."" <br/><br/>Or take Chigurh's exchange with the convenience store clerk. On the surface, it doesn't seem to have any connection to the rest of the movie, or even to make sense, but looking deeper you realize there's a sinister subtext to every word, one that gives strong indication of just how screwed up it is inside Chigurh's head. And the final scene, which I will not reveal, is pure Coen. It's deep, inscrutable, and completely unexpected. It reminded me very much of Copula's The Conversation.<br/><br/>No Country for Old Men is a dark and violent film, with no interest in imparting morals or providing happy endings. It's not the kind of movie you want to pull off the shelf when you need an escape. But it is also a powerful and engaging film that you will not soon forget. Here the Coens have given audiences one of the most chilling pictures of evil in many years, along with their best movie since Fargo."
"lrishJoe78","9","5","6","9 December 2012"," Wonderful!
","I decided to read Cormac McCarthys book before watching this movie adaptation, having been a big fan of his more recent novel The Road. I loved the book and ended up uncertain if I wanted to watch the movie as I it was hard to imagine the Coen brothers being able to do it justice. Overall though, I was impressed with their treatment of the story, both in following the text closely and in terms of playing out the author's intentions rather than undermining or erasing them.<br/><br/>Having said that, there are some real differences between the two which to me meant the film didn't quite deliver on the story in the way the book did. Most of these differences probably came from a need to keep the running time down, but personally I would have been happy for the movie to be an hour longer and to follow more of the subplots of the book. The most important of those differences for me:<br/><br/>â¢ In the book Carla Jean calls the coin toss incorrectly and Chigurh shoots her. They have pretty much the same conversation in both versions, but in the Coens version she refuses to call the toss forcing Chigurh to see it is he, not the coin, deciding her fate.<br/><br/>â¢ The book explains why we meet Chigurh in jail, saying he permitted himself to be captured ""to see if I could extricate myself by an act of will"". Later Chigurh describes this as a vain, foolish act. These facts are not in the movie.<br/><br/>â¢ The first hotel confrontation between Moss and Chigurh is altered in the movie; rather than punching out the lock and wounding Moss, Chigurh takes a key from the murdered receptionist and enters Moss' room, where a hiding Moss takes him captive at gunpoint, so they have a chance to see and know each other. Then Moss runs and the shootout begins.<br/><br/>â¢ In the book Chigurh delivers the recovered cash to a man he's never met before, and a conversation ensues. In the film it is fairly unclear who Chigurh works for, which makes his character hard to understand.<br/><br/>â¢ Where the film last sees Moss alive heading off to have a beer with a lady who calls to him from poolside at her hotel, the book has a whole subplot between him and a young female hitchhiker, to whom he gives money and advice. He actually dies because he puts down his gun when the Mexicans following him take her hostage. This was a big part of the development of the Moss character in the book, with it being clear that Moss was loyal to his wife and would not take advantage of the teenager even when propositioned, and afterwards the hanging question of what his wife would think when he was found dead in a motel with a teenage runaway.<br/><br/>Anyway, book versus film aside, this movie features some truly brilliant performances, and is an astounding achievement in storytelling and filmmaking. Wonderful!"

","If you want a movie about a likable but menacing hero (or perhaps antihero), then this is a movie for you. An effective agent of fate, Javier Bardem's character does not care what you think about his haircut or his ways. What he cares about are rules. But not your rules, he has a set of his own, just like in his world, he has the coolest haircut there is. And he wears it with confidence. The same confidence he executes his tagets, who have it coming. One way or the other, on the flip of a coin. And his ways are memorable, you have to give him that. This angel of death plays some sort of cat and mouse game, but this is not a man, this is a sublime being, and he is magnificent, inspiring awe. Cant say awesome since this word is ruined in the English language, but in 1940s, it would have been the most appropriate way to describe what the actor Bardem delivers. This is a must see movie..."

","The Coen brothers have given us many great movies, but 'No Country for Old Men' has to be my favourite of theirs. This film is 10 years old now but you'd be hard-pressed to find a better piece of entertainment released since. It's an enthralling watch from start to finish and one of the most memorable and unique movies of its time. Maybe it's a bold claim, but I think this is one of the best films of the 2000s.<br/><br/>'No Country for Old Men' scores top marks in all areas, but the best part of the film for me is the characters and dialogue exchanges between them. Anton Chigurh in particular is a fascinating character and is brilliantly portrayed by Javier Bardem.<br/><br/>The ending has proved divisive among fans, but I'm in the 'liked it' camp. Finishing with the 'old man' of the movie retiring is fitting with the title and was also suitably low-key. A brilliant film all round."
"ccycritic","4","24","41","26 November 2007"," Utterly Disappointing!
","This movie was one of the most disappointing movies I have ever seen.<br/><br/>I fully expected an outstanding story given the reviews, both from critics and from viewers. And, up until the final reel I was not let down. Then we get to the final reel...<br/><br/>The protagonist is killed off screen - did the woman in the pool set him up? And was that her floating in the pool? Did his wife get off with her life? We never heard a gun shot, nor would we expect to I suppose, with the silencer - but we just don't know. The equivalent of Frances McDormand's character from Fargo (Tommy Lee Jones' character here) just quits at the end with some lame conversation concerning a dream he had. And the killer is hit by a car in some contrived deus ex machina, but still manages to walk away, albeit with wounds that are a bit more tricky to self-treat than shotgun pellets in the backside. Whatever happened to the Mexicans? Was the money in the vent at the end? Was that how the killer eluded Tommy Lee Jones? And did the killer end up delivering the money to the gas station owner (the one who correctly called ""Heads"" in the first reel)? All these questions, and no explanation. I'm sure someone will say that this is a sign of a good movie with artistic twists. But to them I say, this is too much! Even Short Cuts had an overall sense of conclusion, even if no single story line really ended. There's just too many unanswered questions and too many loose ends to have ended the way the Coen brothers wrote this! Again, I expected much, and got much for about 90% of the movie. However, the ending was so bad that I went home severely, ultimately, terribly, disappointed."

","This has to be one of the most over-hyped movies I've seen to date. It just made no sense at all. Go watch it and tell me I'm wrong.<br/><br/>A lot of claims are made by 'movie experts' that say its a masterpiece. Its quite clearly only intended for people with clockwork orange on their list of their best movies of all time. The media tends to inflate the movie well past its delivered content and almost every movie critic has rated it highly, while not one member of the public I have spoken to thinks it was worth watching. I personally witnessed 15 people walk out of the cinema while watching. Put simply don't bother. As a cinematic story the film is terrible, I felt as though I walked in on something half way through and walked out before it was over. You were left trying to ponder on who the players were and how they actually came to be in the positions they were in.<br/><br/>On the positives individually each actor does a fantastic job, Javier Bordem in particular plays one of the most chilling killers of any movie I've seen although I would have preferred he kept his mouth closed to keep that stone cold stigma that somehow tapered off during the Mexico scenes. The story is quite intriguing and the characters are very deep, this essentially is what kept me in the cinema waiting for the prestige. Needless to say it didn't happen.<br/><br/>Overall the movie left me walking out the exit door with a feeling a gritty dry discomfort."

","Something strange is happening in the town of Marfa. This movie is just as bad as There Will Be Blood. What is going on? <br/><br/>The above line has more story, more interest, more movement, than either of these two movies.<br/><br/>To be fair to No Country For Old Men, the ghost-like assassin character is well drawn, well clothed, and well played. This actor has a monumental face that is a delight to the camera. His voicing is dead-perfect. There are some good shots of bare, open, sun-shot highway, too, that just hit the right note. Also, 70's cars are cool.<br/><br/>What's wrong: Well... No story. After a nice tease of a set up. It started like a story, but nobody really did anything that made sense.<br/><br/>You have a man on the run; good stuff so far. He's got a girl, that's good too. You see their home, you believe his character, great. I'm on his side. Then comes a remorseless, unstoppable, killer, not of this world, who seeps over everything like a black cloud of death. Cool.<br/><br/>Then you realize you're following the wrong character- this movie isn't about the prey, or the predator either.. it's about the superfluous sheriff, remorselessly pursued by his own black cloud of getting too old and not giving a damn. He struggles weakly against the approaching cloud and then philosophically gives in to it.<br/><br/>In the mean-time we watch other people offer themselves up to the black cloud of the assassin. Eventually, at no particular point, the silent black credits slam in.<br/><br/>The above makes this movie sound like it might be entertaining, or at least about something. It isn't.<br/><br/>The sheriff has exactly one great, topical, line. While dismounting his horse at a scene of great carnage - the desolate big-time drug and money exchange gone bad - he adds a fillip to his deputy's half-successful attempt at manly-lawman-understatement of the grisly scene: In response to the deputy's comment the sheriff says ""well there does appear to have been something of a glitch.."" - or something like that. <br/><br/>It's so good, that it is almost enough to save the sheriff, but , sadly, it is not enough.<br/><br/>Also, while the movie looks like Texas, many of the characters seem a Texan parody of the flatest, thinest sort.<br/><br/>I thought the woman motel clerk was wonderful. And have no quarrel with the Scottish girl's accent or portrayal as the young texan wife. The husband played well enough, too. But for what.<br/><br/>This movie has a very bad spirit, and nothing to justify it. May it's own black cloud hasten to catch up to it soon."
"Jacques98","1","14","22","2 September 2008"," I know old men who thought this was pointless.
","Let me start out by giving the number one flaw of this film. It gives boring movies a whole new definition. In reviews, I've said the phrase: ""Nothing happens in this movie, and I was so bored I fell asleep"" a lot of times, but this time I mean it literally. The only people with the attention span for this movie are either old people or people who have no more liveliness than old people. If there is a more boring movie ever made, I've yet to see it. And I've seen a lot of boring movies. It sacrifices entertainment value for moral, and as far as moral goes . . .<br/><br/>The other huge flaw is the fact that it also gives pretentious a new meaning. It's easy to see the people who made this movie expected it to be praised for accomplishing nothing, a lot like something a little boy does before puberty. And if there is anything to criticize this film on other than the boring factor it's the fact at how ridiculously immature it is. The directors think it is something so deep and intellectual, but in reality it is simply one of the most basic and clichéd ""meanings"" or ""morals"" a film could have: people grow old and die. That's it. That's the huge physiological moral this film thinks it's so intelligent for making. Really, guys, can you name how many times you've heard that one? In case you're having a hard time remembering, I've heard it in everything from Disney movies like Pocahontas to pre-teen movies like Holes to teen movies like movies for everyone like Star Wars to action movies like Death Sentence . . . (four hundred movies later) . . . and you'd think people would realize how cliché that ""moral"" is. We get it. We die. Can't the directors think of anything, anything at all that is a little more original to bank on? But even worse than the fact it banks on such a cliché, the movie expects to be praised for it. It expects to put you in deep thought. It's no different than that 12-year-old boy thinking he can write a book on every bit of philosophy he knows and floor you with how genius he is.<br/><br/>Okay, the other big thing the critics are raving about is the cinematography. Let me say this: it's okay. It's run of the mill. It's decent. It may be a tad above average, but you've seen better. Off the top of my head I can think of several movies with better cinematography that the critics hated, like Wolf Creek, for example. The acting, on the same hand, is pretty average. It was solid. It worked. But it is nothing to get all excited about! Javier Bardem, for example, did okay as your typical cliché 2-demnsional bad guy, but he certainly didn't deserve an Oscar. I can name several scenes where he looked incredibly corny. So, as you can see, where this movie doesn't go bad it just goes typical.<br/><br/>As far as the plot goes . . . well, that's about as far as it goes. It's a plot. It's the basic plot they taught you back in middle school: guy wants something very badly, bad guy tries to stop him, and then in the end there is a confrontation. That's it. And I'm not simplifying itthat is literally the plot.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is just as typical as the critic-hated Disturbia. But here is something I've come to learn about the critics: they like things safe. They like plots that have been done more frequently than a slutty girl in high school with big boobs. They like typical, safe ideas and cliché morals that they've heard since they were kids. Anything that breaks that mold they trash because it's ""punk"" and ""punk"" is bad. As long as it's old, safe, and familiar it's good. If it's new, fresh, or original it's bad.<br/><br/>I'm so glad I have more intelligence than critics like that. Hopefully you do too.<br/><br/>0/10"
"ccthemovieman-1","10","42","78","13 March 2008"," Enjoy It Every Time
","I really enjoyed this film on the first viewing and every one since.It reminded me of the Coen Brothers' first film, ""Blood Simple"" (1984). with its understated but quirky and violent characters, odd dialog and sudden brutality. It's an odd crime film, but that what's the Coen Brothers usually deliver us: odd and entertaining movies. Whether it's the ""Best Picture Of The Year,"" I question, but I did find it fascinating. <br/><br/>Many times the villain is the most interesting character in a movie, and I'd have to say that's the case here, too. Javier Bardem, a Spanish actor, plays ""Anton Chigurh"" and this guy is one strange dude, with an even-stranger weapon. Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones are almost as intriguing. Brolin is ""Llewelyn Moss,"" a guy out hunting one day and finds dirty money at a bloody crime scene, takes it, and is on the run from the crooks who own it. Jones is the local sheriff, ""Ed Tom Bell,"" who actually tries to help Moss by grabbing him before the killers do. Ed Tom admits times sure have changed and deranged killers like ""Anton"" are totally unexplainable. To me, Jones is always a great actor to watch.<br/><br/>The supporting actors in here are all good, too, and also quirky....just like the Coens like them (see ""Fargo"" for a good example).<br/><br/>Another star of this film is cinematographer Roger Deakins, one of the best - if not the best - in the business. Deakins was up for two Academy Awards this year: this movie and ""The Assassination of Jesee James By The Coward Robert Ford."" That's how good a photographer Deakins is, nominated for two films.<br/><br/>To me, though, the highlight of this film was the dialog. Man, there were some strange sentences uttered in here with some odd grammar and expressions thrown in. Early on, I put on the English subtitles so I wouldn't miss any of it, or misinterpret what everyone said. In other words, this was not only a fun movie to watch, but to hear. It was very suspenseful most of the way as this turns out to be a long cat-and-mouse chase story. That's usually entertaining to watch, and this is no exception.<br/><br/>Are there flaws in here? Sure, a couple beauties, too, but nothing unusual for Hollywood. Shootouts in the street and a major car crash - all in city and residential areas - and nobody comes out to see what happened? Also, what happened to ""Moss"" is a big issue. Maybe I missed that. Finally, the abrupt anti-climactic ending is a biggest issue, one I know displeased a lot of viewers.....but I don't find any movie or story as perfect. I'm willing to forgive the Coens for these transgressions, because, overall, this is so entertaining.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, it's nice to finally see a ""Best Picture"" movie that wasn't totally disappointing."

Supposedly interested in a suitcase full of $100 bills, he really prefers killing people -- like PacMan likes eating them. It reminds me of Richard Pryor's sick joke about killing people ""because they were home."" <br/><br/>Tommy Lee Jones has starred in about 40 better pictures, and my only insight as to the multiple 10 ratings is that pseudo-intellectualism feeds on itself and can serve as a substitute for forming one's own opinion.

","The following is a semi-spoiler...A hunter named Moss (Josh Brolin) in the Texas desert discovers a drug deal gone bad and decides to try and keep the $2Million cash he finds, which as expected, entangles him in the mess of those who want to recover the money. Seems like a promising story, except that, while suspenseful, it veers sideways into meaningless subplots/characters and gratuitous murder scenes--the point was amply made that Chigurh (Javier Bardem) was a psychopathic killer, so I suppose the Coen brothers were using additional killings as filler material. The anti-climactic conclusion of the story amounts to nothing other than the retiring sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) reflecting that this is no country for old men like himself (i.e., times have changed, and he needs to pass the torch, but to no one revealed--he's beaten and is giving up--The End). Some say this is an artsy ""realism"". Umm, no. Reality would have involved more police/SWAT, etc. and not have happened in apparent isolation, would not be so stylized, and it would have been more conclusive (i.e., things would not end well for Chigurh). As for the movie's artistry, I'll just say that anything passes for ""art"" these days, with enough hype behind it. Those audience members titillated by Chigurh's cold-blooded murders of innocent bystanders have their own issues. This is not a philosophical film about fate (but I'll address fan boys' assertions below), so please don't try to elevate it beyond bloodsport and greed and those caught in their path. The overall tone of the film suggests terror, gloom, and helplessness and falls off with a lack of resolution, which simply becomes tiresome. There is no real point to this story. Apparently, while very dark, the novel was much better and less disjointed and incomplete--bad editing on the directors' part. Jung and Danusha make good criticisms of this pretentious drivel. Don't waste your money or your time on this film, which belongs in the trash heap. Laughably bad comic-book antics.<br/><br/>To understand why Coen brothers films, such as Fargo, O Brother Where Art Thou?, and No Country for Old Men, resonate with many members of the Academy and some audience members, start by browsing Wikipedia for nihilism, post-modernism and deconstruction-ism, which all begin with elitism and moral relativism and employ sophistry to further muddy the water. Methods used by these self-crowned elitists include undermining common values by attacking the words used in their reasoning, by dissecting words, in isolation, like the implied ""fate"" or ""free will"" in this story, and not in their proper context--check definitions of a word in the Oxford English Dictionary, and you'll see that language is necessarily contextual. In essence, the ""common man"" (or average American, in this case) and his morality is regarded as no better than cattle (see Chigurh's heartless execution of innocents with a slaughterhouse piston, and the stylized attention given by the movie's directors to the executions) (also see how they similarly dehumanize normal people by using caricatures in Fargo and O Brother--the directors apparently sneer down upon average Americans, given their movie choices and screen writing, direction and editing). In No Country, Chigurh is challenged at the end by Moss' wife, who insists that the coin toss is not a matter of fate, but rather that it is Chigurh's decision to use the coin toss that determines whether he shoots her or not. He understands this perfectly well, but rejects this because it spoils his executioner's game, using sophism (a diversion/non s e q u i t o r) to explain that the coin arrived there the same way he did--sorry, but he had the choice to come there, and the coin did not. Dumb argument (illogical, but convenient for the executioner). O Brother, Where Art Thy Brain? People may not control every outcome (there are external factors, of course), but an individual's outcomes are largely determined by an individual's choices. <br/><br/>A quick Google search for articles on how violence is used in films and Hollywood's and elitists' double-standard for the appropriateness of violence yielded this: http://stkarnick.com/blog2/2008/02/ (add the following to the web address) the_violent_hypocrisy_of_mains.html<br/><br/>Raise your standards for entertainment.

"Chris Knipp","10","66","130","7 October 2007"," Grim reaper in a Dutchboy bob
","Cormac McCarthy's characteristically dry, laconic, and sometimes hilarious dialogue brightens the scenes of this superb and chilling thriller the Coen brothers have ably transferred to the screen with excellent help from Javier Bardem, Tommy Lee Tones, Josh Brolin, Woody Harrelson, Kelly Macdonald, and others, including a salty second layer of minor characters who look like they sprang straight out of the sandy soil of West Texas.<br/><br/>McCarthy, unmistakably one of America's greatest living writers of fiction, lives vividly in this, the Coens' first literary adaptation. Some of his best novels, notably Blood Meridian (called by Yale critic Harold Bloom one of the 20th century's greatest novels), are so apocalyptic, so embedded in their glorious poetic prose, as to be virtually unfilmable. All the Pretty Horses, from his Border Trilogy, has been filmed with some success (Matt Damon works in his role; Penelope Cruz doesn't). No Country for Old Men is late McCarthy. Post-apocalyptic, maybe. Jones's disenchanted, aging sheriff says, ""When you don't hear sir and ma'am any more pretty much everything else goes."" Llewelyn Moss (Brolin), a fairly innocent but opportunistic man, is deer hunting (he's not a good shot; he can't catch one out of a whole herd of them) when he finds a sprawl of wrecked vehicles and corpses, including Mexicans and a dog. There's a truckload of heroin in plastic packages and a briefcase containing two million plus in $100 bills. Moss takes the money and hightails it in his truck.<br/><br/>Naturally there are people who want the money back. Not nice people.<br/><br/>The man they hire to go after it is called Anton Chigurh. Expertly played by Javier Bardem, he's a villain--but with a clear-cut morality all his own--who's invincible and probably unforgettable. Chigurh is like the Grim Reaper: he can decide your fate with the flip of a coin; he reflects the biblical side of Cormac McCarthy, but in a terrible modern corruption. The crooks also hire another hit man, Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson)--a mistake, because Chigurh resents the duplication. He is the last word, the anti-Christ. No man may come after him.<br/><br/>Out in these open spaces of West Texas--El Paso, the Mexican border--where Cormac McCarthy's innocent, pure-hearted cowboys used to roam in earlier decades, things have changed beyond recognition. This is 1977. It's a decade and a half since Vietnam. Lots of drugs and lots of money floating around; you don't hear sir and ma'am any more.<br/><br/>The story turns into a chase, Chgurh after Llewelyn Moss, the sheriff coming after them. And then Carson Wells, bright-eyed, bushy-tailed, and doomed, pops in to follow.<br/><br/>People have been talking about Bardem's pageboy haircut. Yes, it's creepy. Bardem makes Chigurh both threatening and inscrutable. It seems he'd as soon kill you as look at you. He has a long rifle with a silencer and a high-pressure cattle-killer device with a tank that looks like something a person with emphysema would carry around. It kills instantly with a pop in the head. He also uses it to shoot out door locks.<br/><br/>The film is more tense and suspenseful in the first half or so than in the grimly determined finale (all true to the book, if with a few details cut). By that time a lot of people have been killed and some wounded. This has some elements of the Coen's 'Fargo' and 'Blood Simple' (the latter introduced in an earlier NYFF) and thus with their most powerful work. But 'No Country' is an economical and faithful literary adaptation. Some Coen movies have been thin and frivolous lately. This is emphatically not, sure and riveting from the first few shots. Richard Deakins' photography, making much appropriate use of wide-angle lenses, is superb. Their distinguished source seems to have kept the Coens honest and serious (except for the dry humor built into McCarthy's talk). Unquestionably this will wind up being one of the best American films of the year. It's tight and vivid and suspenseful. It's great stuff. The images sing and stun. There's no distracting music, only the beauty and terror of real sounds.<br/><br/>Present for the NYFF press screening Q&A (moderator Lisa Schwartzbaum): Brolin, Jones, Macdonald, Bardem, and the brothers Coen, Ethan and Joel."

","I like good guys killing bad guys (in the end). That's why I see movies. That's why I pay money to see movies. Movies that kill the hero 20 minutes before the movie ends (thereby making the rest of the movie pretty pointless) bore me and waste my time. I know that life is bad. I read newspapers. I watch the news. I know people are evil, self-serving and absolutely corrupt. For two hours, I like to pretend that it can be otherwise. I don't need this crap in my life. I'm going to rent Anne of Green Gables and get drunk. I love Megan Follows.<br/><br/>What I mean is that Bardem's character is almost supernatural in his potency (toward the end of the movie he is referred to by Jones' character as a ghost). This is fine. This follows a long line of movies with villains who are unstoppable to the point of non-realism, of fantasy. As the movie progresses it seems that Brolin's character is to become equal to Bardem's character. Which is also fine. The movie, then, is turned into a kind of who's going to get who. Until the last minute when Brolin's character is killed by thugs other than Bardem. Now the movie no longer has point. <br/><br/>You see, don't you, that it spent the majority of its duration leading up to a Bardem/Brolin confrontation that never materializes. The film simply sputters onward with nowhere to go but more nihilism ending in an old man's confusion and impotence.<br/><br/>It's no good arguing that this is what the movie is really about, because the movie betrays itself and the viewer by pretending to follow the black hat vs. white hat formula, until almost the last moment when the Cohen brothers get to go, ""I fooled you like the fascists you are!""<br/><br/>It's no good arguing that this movie's realism excludes the possibility of a pat ending, because the hero and villain are not realistic. They get to act as if possessed with a superhuman ability to withstand the kind of bodily damage that would drop an elephant. I mean, how many times can either guy get shot? So you see, the movie is not realism. It's not even close.<br/><br/>And then we get served a large cup of defeatism, the triumph of irrationality, of evil, of violence. The sort of violent schlock that makes Tarantino and the Cohen brothers so popular in today's America. The sort of violent schlock McCarthy sinks into from time to time--although my friend Turner will say I'm full of sh#t.<br/><br/>But I know about nihilism, and there was nothing for me to do except walk away from the film feeling as if I had been had, taken to the cleaners, egg running down my red and fuming face. <br/><br/>Ah well, perhaps Anne Shirley can lick it off."

","This was a movie I was initially going to avoid because I had seen the trailers so many times and was less than thrilled. However, after hearing a great review from one of my best film friends, who's opinion I respect highly, I thought what the hell I'll give this a shot.<br/><br/>I'll admit I really enjoyed the the first half of the film up until the confrontation between Anton and Llewelyn where they first set eyes on each other. I loved the fact that no music is used, and I love that we know so little about the main characters as we go into the film, yet the acting and dialouge is done so well, although dialouge is sparce in this first half, that the characters all seem like very real people. Some of the tension in this first half is almost unbearable (in a good way). When we are at the second hotel and the tracking device starts going off and Anton walks right by the room as we hear the beeping. My god, I could barely sit still. And then the way the rest of this scene plays out as Llewelyn runs to the passing car, and the driver get's shot in the throat. Wonderful.<br/><br/>However, after this confrontation, what happened to the tension? I was no longer gripped to my seat as we go and clear up subplots with Woody's character, that I could care less about. Does this tension compare to that of our protagonist's? Not even close. Yet you think that all this is building up to a final confrontation between Llewelyn and Anton, especially when the two talk on the phone. But no, this never comes. The next time we see Llewelyn, he is dead on a hotel floor. Along with his death goes the energy that kept this film rolling. I'm not saying that seeing this confrontation between Llewelyn and Anton is necessary, but there still needs to be away to keep the conflict rising, which the Coen brothers I guess forgot to do here.<br/><br/>Instead we're left with a confrontation between Llewelyn's wife and Anton and some old food for thought from Tommy Lee Jones. Yeah, I liked the confrontation between Llewelyn's wife and Anton. But was it as good as the confrontation between her husband and Anton. Nope. I feel the Coen brothers were trying to emphasize the point of there story in this second half. Having to do with both fate and pure evil. Anton embodies both these things seeming to be a soulless monster who is on a mission that he has no control of. I've heard many praise his character saying that this is a great character study of a person who embodies pure evil. Well I have seen plenty of horror films where this character is represented as well, only Anton talks and gives a voice to this evil. And it's almost as if we know what he is going to say, that is exactly what any character of pure evil would say. And after all this we're left with Tommy Lee Jones little speech at the end. I had almost completely checked out at this point. Not because I wanted to (I guess it was fate) but because THE MOVIE no longer gripped me. I only caught bits and pieces of Lee's speech once again talking about fate, and then I was happy to leave the theatre.<br/><br/>Sure this movie has themes of how money can make you cold and dead to life, fate, and pure evil. But is this done in a new refreshing way. No. Does it stir my mind in a different way. Nope.<br/><br/>I have seen most of the Coen Brothers film, and I'm left disappointed almost every time. I think they are two of the most overrated directors that are alive today. I'm not saying they make bad movies, because they don't. It's only that I feel too many of their movies are heralded as genius when they are only in the category of good. This happens to be another one of them in the good."
"CineCritic2517","5","71","144","10 January 2008"," In the world of Coen
","Half way into this movie I was still positively upset that this was probably going to be the first time I would ever actually enjoy a Coen movie. We all like what we like but none of their prior movies (And I did see them all) did anything other for me than bore or annoy.<br/><br/>Of course I should have known better because the very reason the Coen productions annoy me is that none of their movies take place on earth. No-Country-for-old-Men turned out to be no exception. Far from it even.<br/><br/>Somewhere in a paralleled universe there is a little blue ball of mud and water that looks very much like our own planet. The difference between our world and this one is a difference in certain laws of logic.<br/><br/>On planet Earth as I know it, if a dude in scene 1 would tell a dying Mexican to go fork himself when he's asking for water, walking away with 2 million dollars with no expression on his face, he would probably not have problems with his conscience a couple of hours later only to fill up a cannister of water and go back in remorse. On my world, if a cop would be killed, there would probably be a thorough investigation (even in Texas). But not in the world of the Coens. If a man with a funny hairdo would walk around a town or a motel with a 90 inch hand-cannon with a strange aluminum front, people on earth would call the police. But not on planet Coen. The list goes on filling up a roll of toiletpaper if one would take the time.<br/><br/>And there you have it. Where in normal films one is required to suspend some disbelief, in this movie you'd have to let it slide altogether. And that is exactly where the movies for me quit to entertain. They annoy more than they amuse even though set-designs, acting and cinematography are almost always on par with any quality movie or even above.<br/><br/>And like this wasn't enough to cast serious doubt on this production, they put in a terrible anticlimax of an ending...dared but ultimately flawed and annoying. -SPOILER-START- How they expected to get away with showing a movie for 1.5 hours, closely following the protagonist, and having him being killed off-screen in a 12 second scene, is beyond me.-SPOILER-END- And since when is mumbling some cod-philosophical verbal diarrhea a good replacement for closure in a movie which desperately needed some sensible conclusion? I know that the entire theater I watched this movie with felt exactly the same about this. Everyone was going 'huh?', 'This is it?' or started apologizing for picking the movie to the people they were with or even started arguments with employees of the theater. Everyone felt unanimously cheated. And this set against the incredible high praise this movie has received, makes absolutely no sense.<br/><br/>If I had to judge the movie based on the first half of it, it would have scored a 7,5 in my book because it was all delivered convincingly and graciously although a bit meandering at times. But such a lousy and unsatisfying ending should not go unpunished, especially in the reviews of the movie-critics who write their reviews for the moviegoers and not for themselves nor their peers nor the Coen Brothers.<br/><br/>5/10"
"Mustang92","2","12","19","15 November 2008"," Coen Brothers strike again -- with a dog!!
","In brief, the Coen Brothers are among the most overrated filmmakers alive today. Nearly every single movie they make, contains no real ending or payoff for the audience. (Exception: ""Fargo"") No, I'm not talking about a happy ending or one that is typical Hollywood. I'm talking about no ending.<br/><br/>Their stories usually start out well, but their strengths as filmmakers are not in the actual storytelling, or script. It's in their style and the ""look"" of their movies. But all style and no substance is not great film-making. Which was obvious from their first highly overrated movie, ""Blood Simple."" This movie typifies that. As another reviewer here wrote, this is a glorified B movie, with self-indulgent pretentiousness. I've said this since at least ""Barton Fink"" but probably even before then: The Coen Brothers are masturbatory filmmakers. They make movies for themselves, what pleases them, and don't give a crap about their audiences. It's clear they don't care whether we have ""cartharsis,"" or closure at the end of their movies. And there frequently are no arcs in their characters, or the story itself.<br/><br/>In this movie, the killer remains the killer... he never changes. The Josh Brolin character never changes... he just runs till he's killed. The Sheriff never changes... he's a philosophically ""sad"" guy who decides to retire after seeing all the blood and mayhem during the story. No arc for this guy.<br/><br/>I never read the book, so I don't know if the story is ""flawed"" in the first place. But this movie is very flawed, and it's a total joke that it won an Oscar for Best Picture. This is ludicrous. (Probably what happened was the other nominated films split votes, so this one squeaked to the win.)<br/><br/>Besides no arcs, here are some more flaws: We never learn or understand who the Mexicans are, or why they're chasing the money. Presumably there are 2 factions of Mexicans, one buying and one selling the drugs, when the deal went down. We learn that an Anglo businessman is behind something here (either the buyer or seller, probably the buyer), but he hires Woody Harrelson to track down the money. So why is there a contingent of Mexicans after the money too? Makes no sense.<br/><br/>The drugs also disappear from the flatbed truck at some point, so where do they go? Who got them? If the Mexicans, then why would they still be after the money? And if the Anglo businessman got them (via his 2 business guys that Javier Bardem kills), then why is HE after the money?<br/><br/>Ludicrous, totally ludicrous. The story makes no real sense. Furthermore, who is Javier Bardem? And why is he after the money? How does he even know about the money? Who hired him, if anyone? You want story logic, don't expect it from this movie!<br/><br/>Speaking of no story logic, gotta mention this last one, the scene between Bardem and Harrelson in the hotel. So Bardem is after the money, yet he shows up to speak to Harrelson (and eventually kill him). Why? He says he knows where Brolin is, so why doesn't he just go to where Brolin is? By not doing so, Brolin then gets away. Sure, Bardem is a psychopathic killer -- after all, everyone says so -- but only in his pursuit of the money. He doesn't go out of his way to kill people... only in pursuing the money. Yet he does go out of his way here, with the Harrelson character. Lame lame lame. What a horrible story this was.<br/><br/>You want to see a good thriller? Rent something else. You want to see a ""cool"" style with good cinematography, but don't care about story AT ALL? Then this will do."
"mim-8","4","12","19","26 February 2008"," One of the weakest among brilliant Coen films
","I'm an absolute fan of the Coen brothers, and think that they represent one of the most imaginative and artistically different movie-making partnerships in the recent decades. The true brilliance of ""The big Lebowski"", ""Barton Fink"", ""Fargo"", ""Miller's crossing"" or their debut ""Blood simple"", shows the way to creativity without compromise. On their latest effort ""No country for old man"" I think they lost that path, the same way as with the misfired ""Raising Arizona"", and compromises with the film industry, which brought them Oscar nominations and subsequent Best picture award, are sadly evident in this film. The Coen seal is there but it's broken in several places and that ruined the originality of their trade mark approach.<br/><br/>To begin with everything that is wrong with this film, I have to point out, first and foremost, the gaping plot holes that brought the entire story down. Forget the convenient randomness of Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), entering the town of all places, just by the motel where Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) is hiding the money, so his transponder can start beeping, the movie holds pretty well up to the point where Moss figures why he is being pinpointed each time by Chigurh, and from that point spirals straight down.<br/><br/>First we can't figure why Moss doesn't destroy the transmitter once he realized that this is the reason why he is always found by Chigurh, and especially when he realizes that Chigurh is in the hotel, and that he can pin point the room where Moss is hiding, by following the signal. OK, maybe Moss wants to be found, and have a show down with his pursuer, but than why does he sit right in front of the door, the killer is going to enter, especially knowing that Chigurh turned the hallway lights off. Maybe to have a better shot at him - not likely, and even than, as Moss shoots through the door Chigurh is supposedly standing in front of, just as he blew away the lock with his cattle gun, Chigurh escapes unharmed and is wounded later on in the street. Also, the Woody Harrelson character Carson Wells, is totally undeveloped and surplus in the film. Earlier in the movie we see that he is supposed to be some kind of a specialist in handling extremely dangerous nut jobs like Chigurh, and is paid accordingly, but Chigurgh killed him just as easily as the old man driving the car, at the beginning of the movie!? Than it's never explained how does Wells, find Moss in the Mexican hospital? What tricks and abilities did he use for such intelligence work, being later on, came up behind and shoot as an unsuspecting bozo by Chigurh? Also, back at the high-rise building of the businessman who hired Wells, Chigurh bursts in to find the businessman talking to someone from ""accounting"" and shoots the businessman in the face. How in the world did he, pass through the entire building with cattle gun along with the gas tank and a shotgun? Nobody bothered to show us.<br/><br/>But the film really falls apart at the denouement point where we expect a show down between Moss and Chigurh, at the end, where Moss is supposed to send away his wife with the money so he'll be able to freely track Chigurh down. After the scene where Moss is talking to a girl by the pool, it appears like a significant part is cut away from the movie with several key scenes missing! Next, we see sheriff Bell driving along and seeing Mexicans getting out of the motel, Moss being shot,and we don't have a first clue what happened and how? Mexicans supposedly found Moss through his mother in law, but than again, how did they know where to wait for Moss's wife and her mother? How does Chigurh appear in a motel room where Moss have been shoot, and why doesn't he kill sheriff Bell, he's killing everybody else, so why not him? And at the last point where the film might have been partially redeemed, the point where Chigurh gets hit by another car, passing through the intersection, and where he should have been killed by an act of strange, absurd chance, that would bring a twist to the end of this film, he walks away to emptiness from which he came in at the beginning. So that summons it up, lots of empty spaces, (including a pointless Tommy Lee Jones monologue at the very end), in a movie that might have been great if the Coens didn't look for industry seal of approval, and the lack of the same gave their previous films so much charm. 4/10"
"gandalf_theWise14","8","6","8","11 August 2019"," Definitely overrated, but a solid film despite the issues I have with it
","I wanted to love No Country for Old Men. After seeing that it won best picture and best director, I thought it would be amazing. However, I only found it to be good, certainly nowhere near the ""masterpiece"" that some claim it to be.<br/><br/>I found the biggest issue with the movie to be the plot. It doesn't all necessarily make sense, and in the end seems incredibly pointless. Josh Brolin's character, Llewelyn Moss, stumbles across a drug deal that had gone terribly wrong, and he appeared to be the only one alive on the scene to take the now unsupervised two million dollars. He takes the money for himself, which leads to an incredibly bloody hunt Javier Bardem's character Anton Chigurh leads in an attempt to get the money from Moss for the people who had hired him. This is the basic plot of the film. Chigurh, however, is a complete psychopath who essentially kills for fun. So, the longer the chase goes on, the larger the body count. The plot, however, seems to wander quite a bit, and seems more focused on how sadistic and twisted Chigurh is, rather than the actual story that was set up. It seems to me that the plot is just there to get us from one bloody scene to the next, and is just an excuse for all of the extreme and excessive violence. If the film was more focused on the plot, it could have made for a much more interesting film, though it still dod end up having many intriguing moments.<br/><br/>We also have so, so many things going on at once in this movie. Outside of the main plot, we have Tommy Lee Jones as Sheriff Bell, who is tracking this case as well as questioning his purpose at this point in his career. This, of course, leads to many sentimental moments as he thinks about the amount of violence going on that he is unable to stop (he is just a little late on the crime scene several times in this film, and unable to prevent the violence). It felt like this part of the movie was slightly disconnected from the rest, and though it provides some thought-provoking messages, it doesn't really justify its inclusion in the film. We also get Woody Harrelson's character showing up later in the movie, who seems to be against both Chigurh and Moss. We don't spend much time with him before he is just another one of Chigurh's victims, though. He really only showed up to give both Moss and the audience an idea of just how bad Chigurh is. Other than that, there isn't much of a purpose for his character in the film. As you can see, the movie gets sidetracked from it's actual plot in so many ways and is just overloaded with plot points and characters that don't necessarily add anything of value to the film.<br/><br/>I have to say, the film's ending was the biggest disappointment and made me question the point of the movie in the first place. It takes a wild turn in the final half hour when Moss is suddenly killed. This is for some reason off-screen, and just doesn't make sense for the movie at all. With that, the movie is basically over, but then there's more, because of course it's not good enough to just kill Moss, his wife must die as well. Oh, and her mom. A depressed Bell retires after realizing there's simply nothing he can do against the violence that he tried so hard to prevent. And then, for no particular reason, Chigurh gets in a brutal car crash, and then just... walks away? At this point I'd given up on any kind of closing for this movie, but then we get the strangest ending ever: Bell talking to his wife about his odd dreams. So many people have talked about the ""deep meanings"" behind all these moments, but that's not what I got out of it at all. Instead, I just sat there confused. Nothing about the end of the movie made sense, and I just sat there wondering what the previous hour and 40 minutes or so was for in the first place, as it didn't seem to matter at the end.<br/><br/>The directing style of the film is slow, gritty, and intense, from the dialogue to the way it's shot. This sometimes works well enough, but the movie can often feel a bit lifeless. This feeling is further enhanced by the lack of music in the film, which doesn't seem to have the same effect they intended it to have, and just ends up making it feel dull. Still, I mostly enjoyed the directing of this movie, and there was some great cinematography through it all, but I just couldn't help but feel that it was lacking something that might give it more life.<br/><br/>I have to say, the suspense scenes is this movie were excellent. The camera angles and lack of sound except for tiny noises were perfectly executed and have you on the edge of your seat the entire scene. There are many sequences just like this that work really well.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is nothing short of outstanding. Josh Brolin gives a very strong performance in what I would say is the leading role (though it's hard to really say). He is perfectly believable as his character, who is selfish and not entirely likable, but just enough so that we want him to survive the terrible situation he's in. Javier Bardem is incredible and gives an unsettling sense of realism to his psychopathic character. He is a genuinely menacing villain that strikes fear into the audience. Tommy Lee Jones is also very believable in his role as the aging sheriff questioning the future of his career. Woody Harrelson gives a great performance as well, albeit with much less screen time than those mentioned above. Overall, the all-star cast does not disappoint.<br/><br/>No Country for Old Men is overall a solid film, though slightly overrated. It is far from the spectacular film I have heard many claim it to be, thanks to an overall lifeless feel to the movie, an unfocused plot, and a largely disappointing ending. However, the direction, suspense, and acting were all spectacular, and the villain was incredibly menacing and well-written. Through all this, the film ends up being good despite the several problems it has."
"TheLittleSongbird","9","6","8","27 September 2011"," A masterpiece, albeit a flawed one
","No Country for Old Men is not necessarily the Coen Brothers' best movie, I consider Barton Fink, Fargo, Miller's Crossing and The Big Lebowski better. However it is a great movie, I'd go as far to say it is my definition of a flawed masterpiece(the only other movie I've given that definition to is The Magnificent Ambersons). So why do I call it a flawed masterpiece rather than a masterpiece full stop? Well actually right up to the last twenty minutes, the film was the latter rather than the former. If the last twenty minutes had not felt like a completely different movie, it would've stayed like that. As is the case with all the Coen Brothers' movies, No Country for Old Men is very well made with impressive cinematography, editing and settings. The story is compelling, the direction superb and the script most of the time taut, funny, thrilling and exciting. Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones are excellent in this film, but if I have to give an award to best performance of the film, it would be Javier Bardem in a villainous role that is menacing and chillingly effective. Overall, a great movie but due to the final twenty minutes it just loses out to that extra something. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

","I feel totally duped by The NY Times. Not that critics' reviews are the only reason we see movies, but usually when they're overwhelmingly positive, the film won't be a waste of time. The Times, which is usually pretty good, gave this a great review.<br/><br/>What were they watching? I wonder if Miramax test marketed movies with different endings in different markets, and we got this asinine crap-for-ending down in NC? (not really, but that would explain a lot).<br/><br/>This movie deserves less than a 5, but the first two thirds of the film were so good, and Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem so riveting, well, it wouldn't be fair. Woody Harrelson is unnecessary and miscast in this movie. But the real thumbed nose is Carla Jean's mother, played by an actress in an old lady wig and terrible southern accent. What an insult. And what a waste of what could have been a fantastic movie."

","What was the point of this movie? I am so tired of pointless violence. Yet another movie that offs the main character, and does it without any build up. Oh I know, lets give him this idiotic gas operated weapon to make him ""different"" and walk around with a ridiculous silencer. This whole movie is full of flaws. 100% unbelievable scenarios. And did I mention more pointless killings? Life is already full of pointless killings and morons who attempt to glorify the killers. This is just another one of those movies. Only in this one, it has no real end. The cop is not a bumbling fool, but a coward that really does not want to get involved. Not to mention that all of these killings would rain down FBI, ATF, DEA, and a list of other agencies to put a stop to it. Yet somehow this retarded killer walks around as if he is inhuman. He even kills his own boss in a retarded way. By the way, the Mexicans get the money. The killer does NOT kill the main character. The Mexicans do. So instead he kills the main character's wife. If this is the type of crap that can pull in Oscars... then the movie ""Idiocracy"" is not far off with its assumptions on how the world will be in the not to distant future.<br/><br/>To make this a short and sweeter review: This movie sucked."
"renato_relboy","1","15","25","10 March 2008"," Just a Bad Movie
","I'll Summarize the Movie for Everybody...<br/><br/>The main idea of the film: ""The world isn't a nice place, things often don't go the way you wish they did."" <br/><br/>The Characters: <br/><br/>Ed Tom (Tommy Lee): He is the ""Old man"" from the title. Just a small town sheriff that realizes he is getting too old for the job and can't take it anymore.<br/><br/>Llewelyn (Brolin): Just a Redneck that comes across 2 million dollars from drug dealers and decides to keep the money for himself.<br/><br/>Chigurh (Bardem): A Flesh-and-bone Terminator with a Cute Channel hair-do and a silenced Shotgun.<br/><br/>Carson Wells (Harrelson): Just a Guy in a Texan suit.<br/><br/>The Story: A drug deal go wrong. Llewelyn finds and keeps the money from this deal. Chigurh is hired to retrieve the money. Chigurh is bad, so bad that he kills (for no reason) the middle men who gave him his assignment. Llewelyn runs from Chigurh, Chigurh chases him. The (assumed) kingpin, that hired Chigurh, after knowing he is a nut-case and killed his middle-men, hires Carson to go after the money and after Chigurh. Carson is a second-hand Vietnam veteran in a Texan suit. His role in the film is to be one of Chigurh's victims. Carson dies, The Kingpin dies, Llewelyn dies (by the hands of uncredited Mexicans) and Chigurh is left on the loose. Ed Tom's role in the movie is to talk in a Texan accent, to complain about how violent the world is nowadays and to show he is too old for the job. The End.<br/><br/>This Movie doesn't make you think. It only hides from the viewers information that he can deduce for himself. There is no deeper questions or anything like that. There is no point at all. The only two things you can expect from this movie are: Nice images from Texas (to be fair I have to say that the movie has some really nice screen shots and the Photography is great) and Violence."
"st-shot","6","43","84","22 November 2007"," Old Men is Old Coen
","The Coen brothers are on firmer and more familiar territory with this Texas noir based on the Cormac Mc Carthy novel. Trailer park resident Llewellyn Moss stumbles upon the aftermath of a drug deal gone bad in the Texas desert and makes off with the fortune in cash. A machine like but philosophical psychopathic killer is soon in pursuit. An aging sheriff takes up pursuit of both with little success as bodies begin to litter the territory.<br/><br/>The film is filled with some highly suspenseful moments and for the most part remains that way for much of the film. The pace maintains itself by shifting back and forth between three characters with a detour here and there to introduce other players and plot twists. The diversions and turns eventually become wearisome though and Country starts to slow down.<br/><br/>No Country is vintage Coen. After the Big Lebowski (a worthy follow-up to their masterpiece Fargo) the brothers seemed to have lost their edge with four lackluster efforts. Country recalls their superb earlier works such as Raising Arizona, Blood Simple and Fargo and therein lies part of the problem. A lot of Country has scenes and characters directly lifted from these works. <br/><br/>The Coen's are masters at oblique dialogue that gets to the heart of the matter and many scenes resonate with these elements giving them both tension and humor. Their originality and unpredictability of action and character can raise suspense in the most benign of settings. Their heroes and villains are complex. They are not 24-7 people of virtue or mindless cruelty. Their quirks flesh out and bring depth to their character thus increasing the possible directions of the plot.<br/><br/>Tommy Lee Jones as the Sheriff is a burned out Andy of Mayberry moving from middle age crisis to old age and the uncertainty of retirement, always a step behind the bad guys. Jones conveys his fatigue and dogged determination in a fine measured way. Josh Brolin is even better as Moss who goes to great lengths to hold onto the money. Brolin, who stole acting honors in American Gangster as a corrupt jersey cop does so here as well as a stoic Texan. Based on these two roles alone he could be Americas best working actor. Woody Harrelson is badly miscast as a contract killer in a throw away role.<br/><br/>What ultimately makes No Country for Old Men a disappointment is the handling of the villain, Anton Chigurh played by Javier Bardem. The film, grounded in a dusty realism slowly starts to fall apart as Chigurh moves across the landscape like Boris Karloff offing locals with an unconcealed customized weapon. Even after a dozen people have been eliminated by Chigurh you get the impression that only Sheriff Bell is looking for him since Chigurh has no problem moving freely about spreading mayhem. The fascinating character that Chigurh is (he seems to be searching for the meaning of life as well as the stolen money) at the film's beginning degenerates into a Schwarzenegian Terminator manqué by the final reel and this strains the credulity of the movie beyond its breaking point.<br/><br/>With Country the brothers Coen may be out of the rut that plagued there last few works but their wheels are still spinning."
"NightOwl0","10","40","79","11 October 2007"," A sad and resigned meditation on criminal violence in the American southwest
","I was privileged to see this gem at the New York Film Festival and I am still reeling from the experience. The first word that comes to mind when thinking about this film is haunting. This film is absolutely haunting and you will think about it a lot after seeing it. There are long arias of silence in this movie that are thrilling to experience. You do not notice the lack of dialog in this picture because the images the Coen Brothers create are so entrancing. This is a film of quiet and meditative power. The Coen Brothers confidence in their visual finesse is completely in evidence from the first frame to the last. The last time I saw a crime picture this good I was watching the Coen Brothers masterpiece Blood Simple. This time they have created a sort of tone poem of the American southwest. This film is drenched in blood and chaos but it is filmed so artfully that the work eventually trumps the crime genre itself. This movie is all the more amazing in that the Coen Brothers manage to combine the archetypal and the firm establishment of an everyday reality so successfully. The characters have a specificity to them, but are also able to be embody larger themes.<br/><br/>This will not be a film for everyone. This will be a film for people who appreciate the work of Terrence Malick. If you have seen the terrific true crime drama The Onion Field you will have some idea of the power of this film. This is a film that Truman Capote would have appreciated. The plainness and starkness of the sudden violence in this movie reminded me of the bracing wind-blown prose of Capote's masterpiece In Cold Blood. This is not just hyperbole, this film is that good. I have never seen such a melancholy movie that was so alive with the wonder of cinema. There are cat and mouse sequences in this film that would have made Hitchcock or even DePalma, for that matter, weep. The cinematography is breath-taking without being showy. Every shot is perfectly framed and the editing evokes a slow creeping dread. There is almost no music in the piece which is a great choice and really forces you to pay attention to the dark proceedings at hand.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem gives an amazing performance. His performance is all the more impressive when you know that he has admitted to struggling with his command of the English language. His character has several monologues that are well-timed and full of implicit menace. He gives a terrifying portrayal of a complete psychopath who seems to live in a shadow world of duplicity and violence. This character kills most everyone he comes into contact with sometimes prolonging the moment of sadism by flipping a coin and asking his potential victims to call it. His odd prince valiant hair-cut is a great touch and makes him seem even weirder. Bardem has a fantastic scene in which he taunts Woody Harrelson with the grisly fate he has in store for him. He is so intense in the scene he seems to almost up Woody's game a bit. Tommy Lee Jones gives his usual solid performance. His character is a sort of bewildered older cop who cannot really comprehend the violence he has to contend with anymore. It is strange to see Jones play a character who is wise, but whose wisdom was so hard won that it has worn him down to the nub. He has some good lines, but the overall comportment of the character is one of sad confusion. His morality is so offended by his reality that he retreats into the honorable refuge of retirement. Although, in the last scene we get the feeling that he will be haunted the rest of his days by the horrors his eyes have witnessed again and again. Jones seems to be giving his usual clever/sly performance which subverts your expectations when he becomes sad and meek toward the second half of the film. Josh Brolin is becoming a more interesting actor with age. It is hard to believe that he is the same kid from The Goonies. His character Moss is not a coward or a complete fool. He has a soldier's tactical cunning and is able to think his way out of dangerous situations. However, he makes many bad decisions as well. This will be a frustrating character for the general audience because they will want him to become a hero when instead he proves himself to be all too fallible and human. <br/><br/>I have not been very pleased with the commercial direction that the Coen Brothers had been going in of late. I am overjoyed that they have again found some great material with which they could craft this true work of art. To be fair they had a great book by Cormac McCarthy to work with, but they still found a way to make it their own. This movie makes Fargo look very light-hearted by comparison. It will not be a film that everyone can immediately embrace. I do think it will be a film that people will appreciate the more they think about it. The surface of the film is deceptively simple. This is much more than a clever genre film, like the Usual Suspects. There is no Tarantinoesque snarky irony to leaven the brutish and horrible realities of the violence for profit perpetrated in this fictional criminal underground. The maelstrom of violence depicted in the film is larger than the work itself. The film activates the issue, but does not seek to contain it. The enigmatic and open-ended narrative provides no reassurances that everything will be all right."

","No Country for Old Men is the movie that has everyone talking; this morning, I was reading how this is going to be the Oscar winning movie, I just had to find out where it was playing. I just saw this with my friend this afternoon and I was blown away. It's a little odd because this did not seem like a typical movie that I would love, but the performances were absolutely flawless and the writing was brilliant. My friend just kept saying how horrible it was, but I don't think some people are going to understand how great this movie really is or need to see it again to understand it. I was never really a fan of the Coen Brothers and their work, but the reason why I loved this movie is due to the fact that it points out the violence in the world and how far people will go to get money or drugs. No Country for Old Men is blunt and shows the ultimate evil of the world, but also the good as well.<br/><br/>Llewelyn Moss is a cowboy who has just encountered quite a find, he stumbles across the desert to find several dead bodies and a truck load of heroin. When he walks a little farther, he finds another dead body, but there's something in a suit case that's a little bit more of what he could use, 2 million dollars! He's got everything in the clear, but he remembers one of the bodies that survived and needed water, so he goes back to help him out, big mistake. Now the serial killer who owned that money and drug load is after him. This serial killer, Anton Chigurh, is possibly the most cold blooded murderer and will not stop until he has his money and Llewelyn is dead. But also Sheriff Ed Tom Bell is trying to find Anton and find Llewelyn before it gets more deadly.<br/><br/>No Country for Old Men is the most brilliantly written movie of the year. Javier Bardem, who plays Anton, will hopefully get an Oscar nomination for his performance. Javier pulled such a chilling performance, he was terrific and so frightening, I never really took a look at his talent until No Country for Old Men. Josh Brolin, it's truly amazing how far this man has come, from The Goonies to a gut-wrenching performance, he's great. Tommy Lee Jones also held his own very well and made the sheriff the most likable character and was the light in this dark movie. No Country for Old Men is a great movie, believe me, it's worth the watch, just take some time after the movie to think about it and what you have just seen, because for the first time, I can say that the Coen Brothers are really amazing.<br/><br/>10/10"
"MovieAlien","5","26","49","17 November 2007"," No Country For Incompetent Rural Law Enforcement
","Faithful or not to the novel which the film is based on, the one thing the Coen Bros. recent work lacks is a solid narrative. Sure, the movie is seen from 3 characters' POV, but the central focus is supposed to be on Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) an underused and uninvolved character, and extremely awkward to the indisputably gripping premise.<br/><br/>Yes, I understood the film. I got the ""evil triumphing over good"" symbolism, the Biblical undertones and social commentary on modern society ... how someone on the street - bloodied from shotgun wounds - would only get blank stares from pedestrians, and even a half-finished bottle of beer (for comfort) would come with a price.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this bleakness is the tip of the iceberg when you factor in cold-as-ice psychopath Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), who massacres almost everyone in his path while in pursuit of $2.4 million from a drug deal gone bad. Because the film is supposed to be ""symbolic"", little is known about Anton and his connection to the money other than a shady guy in a high rise (played by Stephen Root), but even his motives are never clear. In addition, Anton's modus operandi makes it hard to believe he would associate with anyone. The violent lone wolf prevails at the end, and after the naive man who salvaged the money (Josh Brolin) is killed at a motel, Anton fulfills a perverted deal he made by visiting the man's newly widowed wife (Kelly MacDonald) and informing her of impending doom. <br/><br/>There is no problem with villains who succeed at the end. It has been done before. Whilst not the best example, Aaron Stampler from the novel/movie ""Primal Fear"". There's a sense of disgust and dread, but at the same time awe at how someone so evil (and yet so smart and clever) could override justice. But so little is known about Anton Chigurh that he comes off as nearly what Bell calls him - a ""ghost"". He's cunning and skillful, but no indication whether he's a survivalist, ex-Navy SEAL, renegade intelligence operative, etc. Credibility is totally thrown out the door for the viewer. <br/><br/>As for the themes: It has been done before. The vicious cycle of greed was portrayed perfectly in ""Fargo"", even in movies not from the Cohen brothers; Times have been changing in the criminal world for a long time, longer than Bell admits. Bell disregards the outlaws of the Old West, he disregards serial killers and bank robbers active around his early years, and most of all the national formation of the mob ... <br/><br/>The movie's performances are first rate, as is the sound editing and misleading appearance as a ""suspense thriller"". While not a bad film, the abruptness, clichés and lack of cinematic cohesion prevent a positive review."

","Saw it twice in one week and am happy I did as I not only appreciated it more the second time around, but also was able to clear up two confusing points.<br/><br/>First the film, it's great! Starts with a bang and never let's up, very linear story that continues to drive straight ahead against the backdrop of the older law enforcement officers who are left behind by a world and it's morality, changing too fast for them.<br/><br/>The narration, conversations between the older characters and Sheriff Bell's near monologue at the end, go a long way to explaining the backdrop against which this story is laid out.<br/><br/>All the leads are at their best, especially TLJ. Javier B. and Josh B. are also outstanding, as are most of the supporting cast.<br/><br/>For fans of the Coens, you will get the appropriate camera work ***minor spoiler alert***(when Anton sneaks up on the deputy hanging up the phone, ***end spoiler***as well as those moments when you laugh, but uneasily.<br/><br/>I do want to comment on some confusion touched on in a few other comments made in this forum<br/><br/>*********major spoiler alert********major spoiler alert********* <br/><br/>Anton is NOT in the motel room when Bell returns to the scene of the crime (this after the conversation with the old local Sheriff and his comment on how bold Anton was to return to the Hotel, a crime scene, to make the second kill)it is Sheriff Bell in his own mind picturing the worst case scenario of Anton waiting for him, watch it again and you will get it (I only got it the second time)and yes Anton did get the money, this is clearly shown to us by the air duct grill lying on the floor along with the screws and the DIME which is what Anton was shown to use as a screwdriver through the whole movie.<br/><br/>******end spoiler alert*********** <br/><br/>The ending is quite fitting as after all there is ""No country for old men"", Bell's description of his second dream the night before go a long way to explaining that and setting up the ending.<br/><br/>Hope you enjoy it as much as I did, for those expecting a Bruce Willis or other Hollywood type action/murder movie DO NOT go to see this film, you will find it long, boring, unsatisfying and with a stupid ending.<br/><br/>Can't wait for ""Burn after reading"""

","Here is some of my immediate problems (that comes to mind) with the film besides the overdrawn out length.<br/><br/>1. The storyline(s) wander all over the place. 2. A huge man goes around a street carrying a gas tank and an animal gun and not one cop (where are they?) stops him! 3. A huge man goes around a street carrying a large gun and a huge silencer and again no one reaches for a phone to say ""O' look, we better ring the cops to check this out!"" He shoots people in hotels, motels, offices, streets, cars, and what happens... nothing! 4. Its an insult to law enforcement in the 1980's if that when its meant to be in. They were an effective force then - it wasn't the dark ages! 5. Tommy Lee's acting alone was moan-filled and terrible. 6. Characters were introduced to us to varying degrees and then cut short completely without any explanation or reason! 7. The moral (I've discovered, there was one!) was so hidden, everyone I have talked to, couldn't see it, didn't know there was one and I have asked around. 8. The ending! O jeeze where do I start! I can't - it would be too long. Terrible, just terrible and that isn't my own view. EVERYONE in the cinema with me had the same immediate facial expression and words in their mouths ""what the f**k"" and outside the cinema doors were asking ""did anyone understand it and who slaughtered the ending?"" 9. The acting of a good deal of the cast was either over acted or they had adopted the attitude like Tommy Lee Jones, that they couldn't be bothered trying.<br/><br/>There is more but those are just the first few that spring to mind.<br/><br/>You know, people can set out to make an art film for art films sake. But sometimes, just sometimes a desert dusty film is what is visually it is and clearly is NOT a work of art for categorizing it into a juncture. The writer of the above review needs to take stock of the people that actually attend the cinema. 99% go to be entertained - not to be left scratching their heads! If this is an artistic film - it belongs more-so in an art house theater where it might get the respect it might deserve.<br/><br/>As a film to the masses, it fails clearly in many, many areas! So as for winning an Oscar, if the Oscars are supposed to be by their nature awards representing views of the majority who actually understands the films, this film fails in many categories. Its one thing to make it cryptic, its another thing to hide the whole theme, moral and story like a dead body - never to see the light of day.<br/><br/>If this film gets an Oscar, the awards yet again are a joke of epic proportions. All glitz, glamor but no substance. No wonder the public are being turned off the Oscars a lot more at this rate."

","Like others have said, I was swayed by the ultra-high rating this garnered. It stars about 300 actors that I respect, and the Coen Bros - well, say no more!! But when it was all over, my wife and I were asking ourselves if our time might have been better spent re-grouting the bathroom tile.<br/><br/>The four stars I gave it were primarily due to Tommy Lee Jones, who does a better job on his worst day (i.e., this film) than on most actors' best. He's done this role several times before, and simply added a ""burnt-out and tired"" twist to it. Some of the down-home good ol' boy banter was fun.<br/><br/>But aside from that...<br/><br/>I don't mind letting reality slide if I'm watching movies like Star Trek, or Dracula, but I got the impression that this wasn't intended to be based on the supernatural. What was this gas tank that the murderer was carrying around? It managed to blow holes through deadbolts without his hand twitching. I'm no physicist, but most people should have a vague grasp of the ""equal and opposite reaction"" principle.<br/><br/>And while I understand that he had that nifty Radio Shack transponder, it did nothing but beep. But somehow it managed to bring him right to the correct hotel. And even without the transponder, he magically divined that Llewelyn Moss went to Mexico.<br/><br/>Woody Harrelson shared the same clairvoyance, as he was able to walk to where Moss tossed the money and figure out where he threw it. Agent Fox Mulder would have been impressed.<br/><br/>And as clever as Llewelyn Moss was, you'd think that once he found the transponder in the money, he might - you know - toss it out the window? Maybe on top of a moving truck? Nah - that would be cheating. And when the killer is standing on the other side of the door, he cleverly remains directly in the obvious line of fire. The only thing he didn't do was to yell, ""I'm right here!"" <br/><br/>I can only explain all of the high ratings on the fact that the Coen Brothers did the film, and they obviously can't do any wrong. If I didn't like the movie, it must be that I didn't understand it, and I'll be damned if I'll let the world know that I don't have the necessary depth to appreciate this obvious masterpiece."
"cangaroo_s","1","38","76","12 December 2007"," Sadistic, ultra-violent, very few redeeming features, like a finely-painted portrait of fecal matter
","I disliked this immensely and I think it will appeal to people who've given up all sense of right and wrong. I'm an Aussie bloke, quite open to influences in movies and broadminded (I like Reservoir Dogs, even Pulp Fiction, Leon/Professional, Bourne movies) but I found this sick. It made me feel like I'd been abused. IMHO its a splatter movie, with sadistic touches done with callous fetishistic relish by the Coens, and IMHO illustrates a debased cinematic sense. Tommy Lee Jones is misused and is cast IMHO to pull in suckers like us who enjoy movies and remember other better roles he's done. It's a schizoid movie with story line of Tommy Lee Jones as an old fogy speaking Texas patois with other Texans in accents so thick that you need a chainsaw to cut to the meaning. That stream is worthwhile; I thought of Last Picture show, Paris Texas, Fargo etc. and a hundred other movies - derivative but OK. The other stream is some loathsome splatter movie, with surgically graphic blood, killing, sewing up of wounds, violence done by a psycho killer - like a mail order catalog of death, blood and viscera. And then it ends on a downer. If you're into splatter movies, if you like walking through and watching excrement and think of it as art or exciting then this is for you. If you think Columbine is exciting or an allegory for modern times and enjoy mass murder movies then this is for you. It reminded me of that loathsome 5 minutes in Pulp Fiction where the bondage perverts tie up Ving Rhames in their basement, but extended for more than 3/4 hour of screen time. If you're into movies that have a story and some art and allow you to leave the cinema not wanting to erase your memories of the garbage you've seen, then avoid this film. I see why Medved and others have given up on much American cinema."

","Sometimes I'll work an overnight graveyard shift (like last night), and then stay up the next day making it about twenty hours straight without sleep. I'll usually catch a second wind around two o'clock in the afternoon, so figured that would be perfect to see this film with a 2:20 start time. Now I know I was fully awake for the entire movie, but when it ended, I had to question myself as to what I'd missed. With this movie's shooting star flight path to #23 on the IMDb as I write this, I thought for sure that something must have eluded me or gone completely over my head. And then I heard the comment from another theater viewer as the screen went dark - ""Is it over?"" At least I had company.<br/><br/>But here's the thing. I can't really disagree with a lot of the reviewers on this board gushing the praises of this picture. The performances were riveting, the tension was unnerving, and there were scenes that come out of nowhere to knock you clear out of your seat. The character of Anton Chigurh is so unrelentingly evil that he comes off like an Earth based version of the Terminator. However when all is said and done, the randomness of the final act that brings the story to a close (other than Tommy Lee Jones' dream narration), leaves the fate of Chigurh entirely unresolved. OK, so maybe real life is like that sometimes, but something MUST have happened to Chigurh after he walked away with the bone sticking out of his arm. But in this case, it's just not interesting to consider the possible alternate endings when the REAL film doesn't even give you just one.<br/><br/>It's too bad too, because I'm a Coen Brothers fan from ""Fargo"", ""The Big Lebowski"", ""O Brother Where Art Thou"", and the brilliant ""Miller's Crossing"". They've shown themselves to be competent writers and story tellers and each of their films grab you and they don't let go until the end. This one let's you go, and you wind up saying 'I'm not ready yet'. <br/><br/>For what it's worth, I like to think that Llewelyn's wife won the coin toss."

If you want a good in-depth analysis of the nihilistic message of this film, read this review: http://tinyurl.com/33eer8 <br/><br/>The time for this movie (and the recent book it was based on) was 30 years ago. Then, it would have been an insightful social commentary. Anyone paying attention to the world since that time has received the director's message loud and clear, over and over, just by watching or reading the news. It's clear that the world has become a more savage place, that individual efforts to resist the downward spiral are futile. To shoot at, stomp on, and rip up the bloody corpse of a civilized society is completely unnecessary and adds nothing to the conversation.<br/><br/>As entertainment, the film fails, too. There are no real people in this film, only stock types: the naive, greedy, sap, the overmatched lawman, the unstoppable bad guy, the sensible western wife, the scummy Mexican jackals. There is no one to engage with, sympathize with, or be terrified of, because everyone in the movie is just a caricature. The CG character of Gollum in the Lord of the Rings had more substance than the hyperviolent hit man in this flick.<br/><br/>As a result, crackerbarrel philosophy is passed off as sage insight, and cruel violence is passed off as a good time.

The bullet ricochets off the bridge, and the crow gets away. Just when you think the crow scene is pointless, Woody Harrelson is introduced. He manages to get to Llewellyn's bedside in a Mexican hospital, and to spot the suitcase full of money. When he spots the money, does he climb down a path and get it? No. He goes back to the hotel for some unexplained reason. Looking back, I think I liked the crow better.<br/><br/>A completely inconsequential character, the arresting deputy in the beginning of the film somehow manages to get Anton in cuffs and back to the station. He is killed in more detail, over a longer period of time than anyone in movie history. The two characters we are supposed to care most about, Llewellyn and his wife, are killed off screen as if there wasn't enough time in 122 minutes to show their deaths.<br/><br/>The film is rife with unneeded characters. Woody Harrelson, some old fart in a wheelchair with the worst scalp ever captured on film, three tourists who after a painfully long negotiating session provide our hero with the jacket and beer he needs to get past a sleeping Mexican border guard, the sheriff's secretary who's purpose is to remember a line from a poem, a lazy, fat sheriff who laments seeing kids with green hair on the streets of Texas, and finally, two kids on bicycles with playing cards in their spokes who provide a shirt-sling vital to the film in some inconceivable way.<br/><br/>The high point of the film, maybe the idea the entire film is based on, is Llewellyn's review of the original shootout scene, and his subsequent tracking of the guy with the money. This scene got my hopes up for a great story. When he gets in trouble for returning to give some dope runner with a fatal gut wound a gallon of tap water, I feared the movie might be going in a stupid direction. It was. A pickup shows up in the total darkness and chases Llewellyn 200 yards to a place where the sun is up, and there's plenty of light so we can see him being chased down a river by a relentless pit bull. That's not the low point, though.<br/><br/>The low point was the scene where the sheriff is standing in a morgue looking at Llewellyn's dead body. There is no reason for the Sheriff to be there, since he discovered the body in the first place, and we are for some reason, finally spared seeing the results of the numbingly constant shooting in this film. Given the gory detail of the rest of the movie, it seems this scene is made for prime-time TV. I thought to myself ""Of course! Llewellyn isn't dead. This is a good twist. The sheriff has reported Llewellyn's death so he can go save his wife."" Well, it turns out the Coen Brothers, in their twisted sense of humor, were actually teasing. The film was over without an ending, and drug on through a funeral, another killing, an accidental car wreck with a non-character, two kids who see how many times they can say ""your bone is sticking out of your arm"", the painful wheelchair guy story that has absolutely no bearing on anything else, and the sheriff telling a dream story about how his dead dad is building a fire for him in heaven."

"tedg","Null","22","42","10 December 2007"," The Clean Dirty
","How can I be disappointed by a good movie?<br/><br/>I suppose I should say at the outset that this IS a good movie. You should see it. Its all about the writing, though.<br/><br/>McCarthy's writing style comes after the Clancy/Ludlum model where things are diced into parallel episodes but unified in a grand arc driven by the cosmic principle that good triumphs and the bad guys get punished. This has become the cinematic norm, so whenever we pass through a scene-story, we know how it fits in a universe powered by a machine of justice.<br/><br/>McCarthy has the intelligence to open the world, introducing into his novels the notion of apparently unraveled justice. We do have episodes. We do cling to some of the traditional formula: drugs, mob boss, the hunted, the west, the champion of justice. Each of these is used conventionally. Its no accident that Tommy Lee was selected to play the part, because we assume he will be the hunter from Fugitive, the agent who adjusts things to their proper order. Its no accident that all the ordinary pieces of this are made from the same stuff we'd find in airport books and their coincident movies.<br/><br/>But its also no accident that McCarthy's books draw on the cinematic revolution. His images assume that you can see, not imagine. That way he can do two novel things. One is that he can show by not showing, for instance Moss's actual death. This separation between the imagined and the shown also allows him to elevate the imagined into substance. This film, for instance, starts and ends with annotative stories. They aren't directly linked to the action we see, but they have agency, power and they come close enough to being parallel episodes that we accept them as relevant.<br/><br/>The other cinematic notion that McCarthy uses is noir, and I am certain that it is what attracted the Coens. They've spent their entire careers surrounding this notion, probing it from all directions. In absolute terms, what defines noir is the notion that the machinery of the universe is arbitrary and linked to the act of viewing. That ""viewing"" piece has stickiness, because it involves us in what happens to the characters in the world we witness. McCarthy makes us explicitly complicit in the unraveling of ordinary, even expected justice. <br/><br/>Its all wonderful. Its all perfectly comprehended and presented by the Coens. Its clean. It works. Its poetic and deserves to be near the top of anyone's list. If nothing else, the Coens know how to end a movie, probably the most elusive element of narrative skillcraft.<br/><br/>So why am I unhappy?<br/><br/>Because the Coens play a special role in my film life. They are the folks who play games, who explore, who tease and question. They are the Bob Dylans of film. When they create something it has all sorts of extra annotative froth in it, usually cinematic in nature. Its baroque introspection where they pile twisted ironies on top of dishonest self-reference. They are the master of woven layers, of meandering narrative stance. They break where breaks are needed and not expected. They write their own vision, and clearly have that vision first.<br/><br/>Here, they start with someone else's vision already written. Here they stick to the clean, the bones not the coral. Here they deliver directness. Their ambiguity is direct, not tangled. <br/><br/>Yes, I can celebrate what they've done here. And sure I can say that they did well. But isn't that what we have Ang Lee for? PT Andersen? Sean Penn? When the Coens simply rely on their competence, they steal from us the things that they uniquely can do: confabulate and confuse reality. Now that Woody is all but retired, we need them more than ever, Dude.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

But for those who understand that every story does not have a resolute ending, it truly is a masterful work of art. Watch it for it is, a suspenseful thriller that shows us why this country is not for old men. There is no resolute ending, therefore, it is open to the viewer to interpret it however they desire to.

"Nog","3","28","56","27 December 2007"," Major disappointment from masterful filmmakers
","I am really surprised by the critics' admiration for this film. I am not so surprised at the reaction of the Tarantino fan types that have rated this film so highly on the IMDb. A film with this much graphic violence (I counted Anton's tally at 14, but maybe I missed some) better have some good points to make -- and any more, they should be NEW points -- or else it's just a horror film. I am afraid that the Coens have come up with a horror film. Okay, but then I don't understand how the critics can get so worked up (of course, I thought they were way too kind to Little Children also).<br/><br/>Essentially, as some other readers have so rightly pointed out, this film is pointless. The insults of other readers --- that those of us who believe this are dumb --- doesn't hold water. I have discussed the film with a number of friends who are great fans of cinema (and I mean they have an appreciation of the classics of world cinema), and they also had to agree. And we are fans of the Coens, and feel that they make interesting films with great dialog, settings, acting, and photography. In fact, I cannot fault the film technically. The problem is with the story itself, which means that either Cormac McCarthy failed, or the Coens did in adapting it.<br/><br/>So I invite other readers to explain what points are made here that we haven't already seen a zillion times in other films. The relentless evil of man? The ultimate meaninglessness of existence? Do we really need this much blood to do so?<br/><br/>Sigh. Okay. How about this? The Coens have attempted to adapt what I suppose is a serious American novel to the screen. However, if that is the case, I shouldn't have to accept the usual suspension of disbelief. Thus, how is it that this ultimate killing machine was apprehended by the not-so-bright deputy in the first place? We first see Anton in custody - - handcuffed as it were. From then on, this psycho has essentially killed everyone he has chatted with. That was a major loose end for me.<br/><br/>Another friend considered the film a rip-off of The Terminator, which he says in turn was a stolen idea. Even down to the scene where Anton has to repair himself.<br/><br/>Other critics have called the film ""funnier than Fargo"", which if true, is pretty distressing. In the theater I was in, there were indeed chuckles in the appropriate spots, but when I saw Fargo, people were laughing loud and hard throughout. To imagine a theater audience doing so with this film is downright chilling."

","A Vietnam vet (Josh Brolin) stumbles upon a drug deal gone wrong and casually takes off with two million dollars that a psychopathic bounty hunter (Javier Bardem) will do anything to get back. Meanwhile, a Sheriff nearing retirement (Tommy Lee Jones) strolls behind the mayhem always a few steps behind. Set in Texas in 1980, ""No Country for Old Men"" is a meticulously crafted misfire from the Coen Brothers and adapted for the screen from the Cormac McCarthy novel.<br/><br/>Roger Deakin's stark cinematography matches perfectly the brilliant mise-en-scene and signature Coen Brothers' pacing. The audience is also treated to a revolving door of quirky side characters and dark deadpan humor in the dialog that have become the trademarks of a Coen Brothers' dramatic production. It would seem to be a return to form, but there's a wandering coldness to the film that leads to grave dissatisfaction.<br/><br/>The most disappointing aspect is that there's a near perfect forty-five minute ""mini film"" riddled with white knuckle suspense involving the cat-and-mouse shoot-em-up between Bardem and Brolin that is lost inside yet another dour opus where Tommy Lee Jones plays a grizzled but good-hearted authority figure philosophizing about the sad state of the world for the umpteenth time. While Bardem and Brolin are sensational, Tommy Lee Jones seems to be playing an on-screen persona that has trumped his ability to show any type of range. He's typecast, and his character is made moot. Meanwhile Bardem gives a career-defining performance as the psychopath working with his own warped sense of morals. In what may prove to be ironic in the future, it's exactly the type of portrayal that risks making Bardem typecast in the same vein Anthony Hopkins was after his Hannibal Lecter character was born.<br/><br/>The brooding tension built around Bardem's unforgettable villain and the inevitable showdown with Brolin's wayward cowboy is completely wasted in anti-climactic fashion with no resolution that leaves the film to meander in philosophies that ultimately signify nothing. Coming off three straight comedies (the last two of which, ""Intolerable Cruelty"" and ""The Ladykillers"", were abysmal) the Coen Brothers have clearly lost their footing in trying to get back to their roots. ""No Country for Old Men"" boasts many of their popular hallmarks and an instantly classic turn from Javier Bardem, but it lacks the moral fiber of ""Fargo"" and the dramatic climax of ""Blood Simple"". Coming home, it seems, isn't as easy as it looks when the roads are dusty and lead you nowhere."

"dr_foreman","7","26","52","10 November 2007"," Beautiful but barren...
","I'm maybe not the best person to review No Country for Old Men. I long ago became tired of movies about assassins, drugs, shootings, and suitcases full of money. I feel as though Hollywood has been recycling the same seedy crime material for years - and so have the Coen brothers. Movies like this one, Fargo, Blood Simple, Sin City, Pulp Fiction, and Smokin' Aces all seem to come from the same mold, and that mold is getting mighty overused, in my opinion.<br/><br/>On the plus side, I think the Coen brothers are uniquely gifted at presenting this kind of material. Indeed, No Country for Old Men is, in many ways, one of the most beautiful and suspenseful films that I've seen in a long time. It's full of striking images of the desert, interesting point-of-view shots, and incredibly intimate close-ups of actors with fascinating faces. Even the sound effects are great; they're loud, vivid and realistic, and they genuinely enhance the action.<br/><br/>But beyond all that surface glitz, what is the movie about? I never really understood or cared for any of the characters. The protagonist is unsympathetic from the beginning, for instance. Tommy Lee Jones, meanwhile, gives a good performance but seems to be virtually trapped in a subplot. Furthermore, his ""deep"" dialog did very little for me - ""mock profundity"" is perhaps an apt description. The villain is great, I suppose, but once you've seen him kill twelve people, there's not much point in seeing him kill a thirteenth, is there? <br/><br/>I don't want to bury this movie, because it's very well done. But I'm annoyed that, at usual, film critics and students are heaping an avalanche of praise on a movie that's really violent, really strange, and really alienating. Yeah, sure, it plays with narrative conventions in interesting ways. But it doesn't take true genius to frustrate an audience's expectations, and storytelling gimmicks alone can't save a story that's so barren. I suppose you could hunt for deeper meaning - as people tend to do on message boards - but I don't think there's much to find. The movie is a beautiful toy, and not too much more."

"Robert_duder","7","12","21","10 February 2008"," Over-analyzed and over appreciated, it starts out being one thing and then goes off into another world
","People who watch these critical darlings really amuse me. They use words like ""hauntingly flawed"" or ""beautiful and haunting"" or ""stayed with me for days."" No Country For Old Men, at least the first hour and a half is main stream, well done, captivating, gory drama, thriller, action western and then the last half hour takes the film into this queer, nonsensical, blathering of artistic garbage that only someone who pretends to understand would care about. I do understand where they are trying to go with the film...the moral is...times have changed. Was that so hard to say? Instead they create an entire character, use a first class actor to portray him who does little to nothing in the entire film because artistically he's ""washed up and tired of the world."" It doesn't come across like that at all. The infamous Coen Brothers drop this interesting thriller/drama on you with this in depth creation of a serial killer who is just completely hell bent and disturbing and then they toss the entire story away on a disgustingly stupid and boring ending never giving closure to anything that they set up prior. I almost wonder if they did it on purpose as some sort of a cruel joke. I mean it feels like they got to a certain point in the film where they should have ended it but decided, 'no let's tack another 45 minutes on it but just ram whatever we come up with on to it.' As one IMDb reviewer pointed out...it feels tacked on and like a completely different movie. <br/><br/>Josh Brolin is really terrific as country man Llewelyn Moss. As we quickly discover Moss is not as country and as stupid as he might come across. In fact he's quick witted, honest, and a fast study. He turns out to be a formidable opponent to a killer who has never had a formidable opponent. Brolin is terrific in the role. A worthy hero whose character is demeaned by its ending. Javier Bardem...well if anyone actually deserves Oscar nomination for this film it might be him. Bardem plays steely cold, brutal and ruthless killer for hire and for fun Anton Chigurh. He is a strange and interesting character who we learn and know little to nothing about. He seems to like games, and he seems to be brilliant and subversive. His straight expressions and monotoned voice make him downright disturbing. The wasted actor on the pointless character I mentioned is the amazing Tommy Lee Jones who doesn't get to be very amazing as the tired, worn out old Sheriff Ed Tom Bell. Jones is a phenomenal actor but he's almost useless in this role. He stumbles around a crime scene or two intelligently pointing out facts and then spewing wisdom about how things have changed and then doing nothing else. Very unfortunate.<br/><br/>When it comes down to the very clever cat and mouse game between Brolin and Bardem, the film is brilliant. Bloody, and riveting and the story is starting to unfold but everything goes by the wayside. The key here is that so much of the story is unknown to us. An entire bloody battle over drugs has transpired and we know little to nothing about it. We only know this insane serial killer enters the picture and wants the money found and kept by Brolin's character.<br/><br/>*******SPOILERALERT**********<br/><br/>This is one time I can't help but spoil the film because I need to rant about it. The film goes down hill when, outside of the viewers sight, they cheaply kill off the main character of Llewelyn Moss, by Mexicans who also want the money. We don't see the kill...there is never any show down of any kind between Brolin's Moss and Bardem's Chigurh, and after that death the film literally just goes to pieces. However, outside of the horribly misplaced and mis-made ending, No Country For Old Men will likely impress you. It is shot in such a style that it feels like an old Western...the long, single shots and the gritty sand swept desert. Still fatal flaws make this one a poor choice by the Academy. 7/10"

I really tried to frame out an argument for why this film even deserves the time to watch it. Personally, I'd rent David Lynch's ""Blue Velvet"" if you want a better film on violence. Or better yet, if you want violence AND drugs, see ""Good Fellows.""<br/><br/>But what about the breath taking scenery? Well sure, but few shots aren't better than any IMAX nature clip.<br/><br/>OK. How about the cool chase scenes near the beginning of movie? Alright, for 5 minutes is it interesting. However, the chase scenes aren't anything special we haven't seen before or Oscar worthy for that matter.<br/><br/>Wait! What about the philosophical message on violence? Sorry, lost meanderings postulated by an old Sheriff and a few symbolic references, don't pass this off as intellectual or thought provoking.<br/><br/>Bottom line is this movie is empty without the slasher style murders that tic toc throughout the film to keep you watching, and the acting is sub par on top of it. This is not ""Fargo."" In fact, if you've seen the well made ""Fargo,"" you don't need to waste your time or money on this one (sorry ""Oscar"" winner)."
"cyrus_ken","1","28","58","5 December 2007"," What a waste of time. I'll never get back the 2 hrs I lost.
","I was very much underwhelmed by this movie. The direction was awful, the continuity of the plot was choppy and left me very much unfulfilled. I went to this movie because of Tommy Lee Jones and I can honestly say this is the worst acting job I can remember from him. The villain in the movie was truly evil, but the rest of the cast were B level and worst. I left there scratching my head as to how the movie was coordinated. Things never made any sense. If you have anything else to do with your life, do it. I'd rather have a root canal than see this movie again. And what in the world was that ending all about. I really like movies and I see a bunch of them, and I would have walked out of this one, but I just kept giving it more time to get better. It never did. Watching this movie is like watching grass grow. At times it is exciting but at least half of this movie could have been cut and nothing would have been missing from the half-plot. GO SEE SOMETHING ElSE !!!!!!!!!!!!!"

","My small group watched this movie due to the great hype and attention afforded it by critics. The two of us that remained to the end did so only out of respect for the film makers. Bad call.<br/><br/>The good stuff: the movie is in color.<br/><br/>The bad stuff: the story is weak and unimportant, the characters are not likable, believable or well developed, and the ending is poorly conceived. <br/><br/>The characters, more specifically, took actions that can only be described as stupid - the kind of actions no real person would take. This alienated me from several (actually, ALL) key characters early in the movie. From there I didn't care what happened to them.<br/><br/>I watch way too many movies, American and foreign (with subtitles), but found little value in this movie.<br/><br/>Many people seem to have enjoyed this movie. I found it pointless and dull."

"MartinHafer","8","9","15","18 October 2008"," It's funny how the best Coen Brothers movies never win the Oscars!
","NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is a very good movie, however, like FARGO, it received tons of attention from the Oscars even though I don't think either rank among the Coen Brothers' best films. I know this sounds very radical, but I have seen all of their films and don't think either film is as good or creative as OH BROTHER WHERE ART THOU? or THE HUDSUCKER PROXY or RAISING ARIZONA or THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE. Now OH BROTHER did at least some attention from the Oscars, but not nearly as much as the first two mentioned--even though OH BROTHER is amazing and a very easy film to see multiple times.<br/><br/>As far as acting goes, it was very good all the way around. Josh Brolin was just fine, Javier Bardem was even scarier than the Biker of the Apocalypse in RAISING ARIZONA and Tommy Lee Jones really came off best of the three in a very subdued but likable role.<br/><br/>NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is not a comedy, so people expecting laughs will sure be in for a surprise when they see this film. Instead, it's a very bloody, tense and occasionally difficult to watch suspense film that pays off in most every way except for a very unsatisfying ending. Even though I dislike violent films, I must admit that NO COUNTRY sure handled it amazingly well and kept my attention. It certainly was directed exceptionally well. I just hope its success doesn't encourage the Coen's to abandon comedy--which, I think, is much more their forte.<br/><br/>Well, considering this film has 50000002 reviews so far, I think I'll stop here. Suffice to say it's a very good film but certainly NOT a film to let your kids see due to its very, very graphic violence."
"tieman64","Null","9","15","18 January 2008"," No Country for The Big Lebowski
","""Lebowski"" began with a tumbleweed blowing across a desert. It went where the wind took it, its fate entirely dependent on how the breeze blows. The essence of film noir is in this idea of cosmic (in)determinism, our everyman heroes trapped in a noir plot, buffeted by chance, hopelessly battling against a conspiratorial, wholly indifferent universe.<br/><br/>With ""Lebowski"" the Coens transplanted noir fate to the life of a lazy bum. Whilst someone like Sarah Connor battles fate in ""The Terminator"", or Bogart battles his way out of a cosmically convoluted plot in ""The Big Sleep"", Jeffery Lebowski was content to simply lets it all wash over him. All these variables, they don't bother him. He's a tumbleweed in a noir web, practising inaction, pacifism and happy acceptance. In short, he's just too damn lazy to care about the events revolving all around him. The Dude just abides. <br/><br/>""No Country"" also begins with a barren dessert, and also rehashes themes found in virtually every Coen flick. Here, a guy called Llewelyn Moss stumbles across a bag of money. He takes it, leaving behind a bleeding gang member. Later that night he feels guilty and decides to take a bottle of water out to the wounded man. Ironically, it's this act of kindness which gets Moss in trouble. The rest of the film is one long cat and mouse chase sequence, akin to ""The Terminator"", in which Moss runs from a psychopathic killer called Chigurh. <br/><br/>Like ""The Terminator"", Chigurh symbolises the inevitability of death (or rather, the cold, indifferent weight of the universe). Death being that one fate which we are all resigned to. Observe how Chigurh kills his prey with a cattle gun, urging them to ""be still"" whilst he blows off their heads. This is mirrored to Moss firing at antelope with his hunting rifle, urging them to ""be still"" before he shoots. Both hunter and hunted are killers, but only one is successful. Moss misses his antelope. <br/><br/>The notion of a cattle gun also dehumanises Chigurh's prey. To Chigurh, Man is a mere animal which he has no moral qualms slaughtering.<br/><br/>The film ends with a Sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) no longer wanting to be part of this ugly world of men. To do so, he says, would put his soul at hazard. His answer is to retire. To stop trying, a defeatist stance which runs across the Coen's filmography (Barton Fink mocks socially conscious artists, all their films express the futility of planning and ""A Serious Man"" finds futility even in serious thought etc). A clock ticks away during this scene. The clock is a cinematic symbol long linked with death (it's also present when Chigurh kills the wife). And yet, though the clock is present throughout the scene, a green tree looms over the Sheriff's shoulder. This symbolic Tree of Life appeared earlier in the film as a dead Mexican's other tree of choice. Dual choices appear throughout the film. Two options, two rooms, two trees etc.<br/><br/>The Sheriff's then articulates two dreams. The first dream is ""all about money"". That dream is the film we've just witnessed, and conveys the Sheriff's belief that he's failed as a law enforcer. The second dream is about his father lighting a fire in the night to starve off the cold. This is symbolic of man fending off nature by providing his own light.<br/><br/>""No Country"" is a slick and stylish film, with enough mysticism to make it feel grand, but at it's core it's no different to any other noir essays on determinism. The Coens have their Sheriff do the same thing as every tragic noir hero, embracing defeatism and giving up trying. While ""The Lebowski"" was an original take on noir, ""No Country"" seems content to just wallow in the bleakness. Which is fine. But it makes you frustrated that the Coens don't do or try something more. Thematically the film comes across as no more than Clint Eastwood's ""High Plains Drifter"" or ""PaleRider"", so what we're responding to is, as always, only that Coen brothers style.<br/><br/>Compare this to some modern neo-noirs like ""Femme Fatale"" and the ""Terminator"" movies, both of which actively challenge this idea of noir fate (though both are still mostly formalist games rather than genuine, socially progressive noirs). Yes, man is subject to chance, but De Palma's film argues that art empowers man, imbuing him with godhood, whilst Cameron's argues that the future can be dependent on us, that man can conquer his own mistakes (genetic, technological etc).<br/><br/>So the problem with ""No Country"" is that it isn't sincere as a film dealing with the bleakness. It's a kind of trite existentialism. The Coens are never sincere as artists and only clever as stylists. Here they don't really deal with the darkness, it is merely an excuse to serve up Gothic violence.<br/><br/>Incidentally, ""No Country's"" climax presents the flip-side to ""Fargo's"". Both Jerry Lundegaard and Llewelyn Moss meet their dooms at a motel. At this point the Coens ditch their elegant cameras and go for shaky, pseudo-documentary realism. Afterwards, in both films, a Sheriff comments on the ""darkness"" of the world. In ""Fargo"", Frances McDormand comments on Jerry's doom, whilst here, Tommy Lee Jones comments on Moss' death. Frances ultimately has a very positive, snuggly view of the world, whilst Tommy has a more negative, fatalistic view. Significantly, Frances character, like all successful Coen heroes, is a bit of a short sighted idiot. Throughout the Coen's filmography, it's the Forrest Gumps of the world who escape Chigurh. <br/><br/>8/10 â€“ Slick, stylish, superficial."

","What is wrong with the Coen Brothers? If they are so clever, then why don't they do something pleasant? True, they are brilliant, talented, witty, but then so was Goebbels. This is a totally pointless, meandering tour of a seedy corner of Hell. Yes, there are fine performances. Tommy Lee Jones is a perfect joy to watch, his droll manner, his fabulous accent, his presence, are welcome even in such an evil film as this. Kelly MacDonald, who was spellbinding in the excellent TV series 'State of Play' (2003), is compulsively watchable and effective here. If you like convincing portraits of Satan, then by all means give an Oscar to Javier Bardem. Josh Brolin is earnest and convincing. Woody Harrelson is fascinating as always. Everybody is good, but the film is wicked, disgusting, offensive, and should never have been made except perhaps by Hell Productions Inc. The story does not even get anywhere. What is clear is that the voters for Academy Awards who have become so decadent and morally rotten and corrupt as to give this film Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Script, are prepared to glorify pure unadulterated evil on the screen, evil which has no redeeming qualities other than black humour, evil which does discredit to the film industry, corrupts the public, spreads despair, and corrodes the soul. Someone should take the Coen brothers out back and do the right thing, and as for the Academy voters, they should put their heads down the toilet bowl where their taste is to be found, judging from the way they voted, and drink what they evidently crave. Is this what we have come to? Complete, mindless, aimless, decadence? Violence with no point? Psychopaths for breakfast? Are our tastes so jaded that a series of brutal and bloody murders by a madman is all that is left which can titillate us? I say shame on all who made this film, shame on all who voted for it, shame on all who have praised it and given it awards. Do we really wonder how we have now had the Great Worldwide Economic Collapse, when this film and its enthusiastic welcome prove so conclusively that it was preceded by the Great Moral Collapse? All those rogue traders, short-sellers and hedge fund lunatics who are destroying lives by the millions through their greed and immorality are the very same people who watch films like this and love them. This film's success proves that there are no standards or values left. Pardon me while I vomit on screen in glorious technicolor."
"The_Dead_See","5","18","35","21 March 2008"," No Ending for These Men
","This film has no ending. I mean it. The third act has no resolution, no climax, no tying up of threads, no questions answered, no drama, no action, no character-arc completion, just... nothing. It's made all the more terrible by the fact that the first two acts are very well done and worth watching. For almost two hours we are led on an intelligent, tense cat and mouse chase, then suddenly - POOF, the Coen brothers make all the good stuff go away in a single moment. The viewer is left thinking two things: ""what the F**K?"" and ""I was enjoying that until..."" It's a bit like lighting the fuse on a really big firework, standing back - tense with anticipation - watching it sail up into the air and then... it fizzles into the night sky without so much as a sound. A dud. A complete and utter dud.<br/><br/>You don't need any spoiler alerts here as there is no story resolution. Aside from one character, you actually aren't even told what happens to any of the other people you just invested two hours in. Oh, and by the way, don't follow that bag of money, because you never even find out who gets it. Don't follow that good guy vs. bad guy plot line, because neither of them ever confront the other - oh except on a telephone call about two thirds of the way in. Don't follow that... Oh wait, there aren't any other subplots to follow anyway.<br/><br/>I suppose I can't entirely blame the Coens as I'm aware this came from a novel. I haven't read the novel but if it ends as unsatisfyingly as the movie did then this man has no business calling himself a storyteller."
"brenttraft","2","18","35","25 January 2008"," Boring and Repulsive
","I really hated ""No Country for Old Men."" <br/><br/>I had put off seeing it because it didn't look like it was going to be very good, but I was eventually taken in by all the rave reviews and the high rating on IMDb. Not only was it not very good, it was much worse than my worst expectations.<br/><br/>I had expected a lot of brutal violence and it delivered on that point. What I hadn't expected was that it was going to be so mindlessly boring.<br/><br/>There is only a minimal plot. The characters are all one-dimensional and nobody is likable. There are multiple plot holes, some which defy all logic. And I don't understand how anybody could be happy with the ending, which does not resolve anything that happened before it.<br/><br/>I don't always agree with film critics or popular taste in movies but ""No Country for Old Men"" sets a new standard. If I hadn't seen the horrible Lindsey Lohan movie, ""I Know Who Killed Me,"" this would have been the worst movie I had seen all year."

","Before seeing this movie I don't think I'd heard one bad thing about it. I mean, after all, it just won best picture; obviously it's got to be at least watchable, right? Wrong. I honestly cannot understand why people love this movie so much. For the first half, the movie remains relatively continuous and straightforward. The acting is stellar, cinematography awesome, etc.... and then, very suddenly, the movie completely loses focus and starts spiraling down a confusing path which had myself and my friends sitting and staring blankly in confusion at the TV for the next hour going ""how much longer is the movie?"" I have only once or twice found myself to be in the vast minority of people when it came to my opinion on a movie. But in this case...WOW. Maybe I didn't see the same movie as everyone else, but that aside, I am at a complete loss for why so many people are raving about this film."
"gopads08","2","21","42","19 February 2008"," I Didn't Get It
","I've been walking around with a huge question mark over my head since seeing ""No Country for Old Men"" about a month ago, and I've felt so alone in my immediate circle of friends -- almost afraid to voice my opposition to the overwhelming tsunami of critical praise that has washed over this film.<br/><br/>I consider myself an educated film-goer, I have a college degree, and I'm in my mid-40s. I should also say that ""Fargo"" is my favorite movie EVER, and I love the Coen Brothers. I'm from Wisconsin, so I get their whole Minnesota perspective -- that quirky sensibility plays well with me. So when I walked out of the theater completely disappointed and confused, it rocked me to my Coen-loving core.<br/><br/>All I can say is that I agree with many of the less-than-stellar posts here. I think for me it probably boiled down to two major problem areas: I didn't really get the message/point, and I found myself not caring about any of the characters. I really wanted to like the film, and it just didn't work for me. Endastory."
"poe426","6","8","13","6 January 2008"," The operation was a success...
","One of Hitchcock's tenets of good Cinema was that the filmmaker must never cheat the moviegoer; must never leave the audience wanting. NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN does just that, repeatedly. While the technical aspects are topnotch all around, the telling of the story leaves more than just a little to be desired. Resolution? Yeah, right. Wonky Woody Harrelson's 'baccer-chewin' cowpoke stands out like a sore thumb in such close proximity as it is to so many so much better, and Brolin literally falls by the wayside in one of the lamest twists I do believe I've ever witnessed in a major motion pitcher. (Hitchcockian only in the PSYCHO sense, it's one of the major reasons I rate this one no higher than a six on the scale of one to ten.) Tommy Lee Jones is great, but being sidelined as he is makes his performance little more than incidental."
"shark-43","6","8","13","13 December 2007"," Flip A Coin
","I am a fan of the Coen Brothers(Raising Arizona, Fargo, Barton Fink, Big Lebowski and Blood Simple) and yet I have also sat through films of theirs that just didn't work -- even with entertaining moments -- (Hudsucker Proxy, Miller's Crossing, O' Brother, etc.) - so I went in thinking I was just going to love this new one - especially with all the rave reviews in the press and I was with it - really enjoying it - until the shootout in the El Paso Motel room - from that moment on I felt the movie was off the rails and in the ravine. The acting is excellent - the cinematography is brilliant, but overall - I was disappointed with the final act. I understand the Coens were very faithful to the book (which is to be commended yet there are times one has to realize you are visually telling a story) but maybe they were TOO faithful. I'm not one of these viewers who needs things explained or wants everything tied up in a ribbon - but to invest so much time in Brolin's character and then not even SEE his demise - well that just ticked me off. And I also felt that once Brolin found the money (which is a good plot point for dozens and dozens of crime films) the movie just kind off moved from one bit to another - some of them amazing but some of them bland and one-note. The scene with Bardem messing with the old timer who runs the gas station is one of the best, most tension-filled scenes I have ever watched - brilliantly acted, written and edited. Bardem (who is so damn good in Night Must Fall), Brolin and the rest of the cast are terrific - I loved Tommy Lee Jones' opening narration but I must be in the minority in not liking his little speech about his dreams at the end. I think it's a good film, a flawed film but not a great film."

","Like Martin Scorsese, the Coens used to be real good. I mean all-time great (Raising Arizona, Barton Fink, Fargo) type of good! But just like Scorsese, the brothers are now living off past reputations as more recent epic-like efforts (despite over the top acclaim) have been utterly pointless. This latest is a 3 hour long rambling mess with just enough sporadic violence (extreme violence used for shock rather than adding to a story which really doesn't exist to begin with) to keep viewers from falling asleep.<br/><br/>The title alone sets the tone for the type of long, drawn out, pretenses that intelligent audiences will hafta meander thru.<br/><br/>I hope I'm wrong, but like last year's ""Departed"" I have a feeling this will be an undeserving Oscar winner in 2008.

","I am a huge Coen brothers fan, but have been disappointed in their most recent efforts. While NCFOM is a lot better than THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE, INTOLERABLE CRUELTY and LADYKILLERS (not hard at all), this is not a great film.<br/><br/>**** POSSIBLE SPOILER ****<br/><br/>For 75% of it, you think you're watching a masterpiece. You forgive all the little things because the whole is so satisfying. Knockout performances from Brolin, Bardem, and Woody Harrelson. But, like the book, once Moss dies, the story limps to the end. The Coen's were very true to the book. Maybe too much so in some places and not others. I think Moss's back-story got lost and added to an underdeveloped hero (although, like I said, Brolin is awesome). Bardem gets the role of a lifetime. The best scene in the film might have been with Bardem and the Gas Station Attendant. Genius.<br/><br/>But Once Brolin's character is gone (very unsatisfying death by the way - not seeing your hero die?) The film becomes Tommy Lee Jone's film and it just dies. The life goes out. Jones is his usual self, although you got the sense this wasn't hard for him to do.<br/><br/>The film's cinematography is excellent. The acting is great (except for Kelly McDonald's Mom). The lack of music was genius.<br/><br/>But as far as ""best Film of 2007""... Not even close. EASTERN PROMISES wins that one."

","""No Country for Old Men"" is based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy and made by the Coen Brothers.<br/><br/>Llewelyn Moss, a hunter, discovers the carnage of a drug runner gun fight that went wrong. Instead of calling the cops, he steals a suitcase with two million dollars. Soon a psycho gun for hire named Anton is following him to get back the money.

He tries to get to Moss before anything worse happens. Of course, he's too late. I haven't been this scared by a Coen bros movie since Blood Simple.

The resulting movie is quite good, all while being very off the beaten path while still being highly entertaining. 9/10"
"Kubris","8","6","9","18 September 2011"," A very different film
","IMDb Top 250: 123 If you read the user reviews for this film, the majority are either 1's or 10's. No Country for Old Men is a very love/hate film. You either get it, or it sucks.<br/><br/>Following a man who finds $2 million dollars, the man who wants to find him, and the men who want to find the second man, there are many stories told with different frames of mind. A survivalist, a cold blooded killer, and the level-headed lawman who finds it hard living in that day and age. The plot has issues, like how the killer can always find his man. You have to put pieces together and make assumptions.<br/><br/>No Country for Old Men is beautiful. Gorgeous long shots of the Texan land are a treat. The first act is breathtaking.<br/><br/>I can't lie, it was hard to understand the accents. But the dialogue is clever, with a several laughs, helpful for such a serious film. There's practically no music, and in the odd case it exists you don't even know it.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem is terrifying as the psychotic Anton Chiguarh. His spaced-out face and weird hair make his presence unnerving, as well as his iconic cattle gun. Very deserving of his Oscar.<br/><br/>Then there's the ending, so spoilers from here. I hated the end, and thus the film, when I first saw it. But now I realize that the point is, like the tagline, there are no clean getaways. Sometimes the bad guys do get away, sometimes the hero does die. That differentiates No Country for Old Men from the vast majority. While the very end is anti-climatic, if you can accept something different, you'll come to appreciate the ending.<br/><br/>No Country for Old Men is excellent. A great technical film, beautiful and brutal with great performances and an ending not seen very often awaits. I can't say it's the Best Picture, as I liked There Will Be Blood better, but a very worthy candidate. Have an open mind. 8.3/10"
"gargamel_gargamel","8","7","11","15 April 2008"," You have to pay attention.... it helps.
","I have seen a LOT of the negative reviewers here spouting comments about the movie that are inaccurate. i.e... that Josh Brolin played an officer... he did not. that Bardem's character had no motivation... um, he was hired to track down the money that was involved in the drug transaction. That we are not shown the people behind the drug deal.... um, who cares, that's not what the movie is about. that people in Texas don't talk/act like that... I live in Texas and have spent a lot of time in FAR west Texas and I can tell you, 28 years ago, that is pretty darned close to how it was... that Moss missed the deer at the beginning.... no, he wounded it and was following it's trail when he came across the pit bull that he then followed it's back trail to the ""o.k. corral."" ( and let's see any of you even hit that target from what looked to be at least 150 yards). that there were no police looking for this ""serial killer"".... several times Bell or some other person mentioned the FBI going out to the scene several times...other lawmen he came in contact with obviously knew about all of the killings showing that the news had been circulated and people were looking for this guy.<br/><br/>Bottom line, if you pay attention you will understand a lot more of the movie and enjoy it more as well.<br/><br/>Brolin did a great job with his character. There were a couple of ""why would he do that"" moments that are more the fault of holding true to the book than anything else (like returning to the desert with water for a man who is almost certainly dead already). However, he was very believable... and I liked how he was killed off screen. It was more surprising that way rather than having a build up of anticipation and knowing what is about to happen.<br/><br/>Bardem was brilliant and his character was great. People say why did he do this or why did he do that.... bottom line, he was insane. He was delusional. He has his own rules and he does abide by them. Crazy people don't fit the mold of normal logic and/or morals. In the book he even turns the money over to a third party at the end... A) proving that he did in fact get the money (for you nay-sayers) and B) showing that since he took the job he would finish it.. even though he could have kept the money... he had agreed to bring it to it's owner.<br/><br/>And Tommy Lee was great for the part he needed to play. His ruminations are there to get us into his head as the book did... that is something that never transmits to a screenplay very well. However, it was fun thinking after the movie about what he meant... was he talking about his own death?.... did he feel Bardem would come after him? did the dream about losing money mean that he lost something valuable in not being able to protect the Mosses from death? Nobody knows for sure, maybe not even the author.... these are things that make a movie good people. And sometimes the bad guy wins... in life even more than in the movies. Deal with it.<br/><br/>Overall I gave an 8 because of some of the original plot problems from the book. The acting was great, the cinematography was great, the audio was of course great, and the story is great.<br/><br/>It is a 4 of 5 on the Gargamel Scale. Bringing 1 for acting, 1 for car chases, 1 for explosions/gunfire, and 1 for story. It misses the 1 for nudity which would have been out of place in this movie... and given the great amount of gunfire/explosions and wonderful acting.... I'll boost it to a 4.5... there ya go."

","This movie sucked. The book was so much better its not even funny. They totally screwed it up, they left out several key things and wound up making a terrible movie. It's an insult to Cormac McCarthy and an insult to anyone who has read the book. it's nonsense and I am furious with the Coen brothers. I've liked their movies for a very long time but this, they totally blew it and I can't believe they did because it's such a good story. The stuff they left out would have wound up making the movie about 20 minutes longer, god forbid anythings longer than 2 hours though. Absolutely pitiful. To someone who hasn't read the book the movie might seem OK, but if you've read it like I did and then see it you should be appalled with the omissions that they chose to make.

","I had a bad feeling when this movie won Best Film at the Oscars. I hadn't seen it yet, but there was a sobering article in the L.A. Times alluding to this film as a simple chase movie. And that's about the gist of it. The only humanity in this film comes from Llewelyn's wife and the sheriff. Beyond that, there's just no depth to this film. I was a film student at Maryland. I'm 43, and I have seen some of the greatest films ever made - foreign and domestic. I have also seen everything in between. Some reviewer said this was a 'brilliant examination of fate'. Huh? Really, how much depth is there in a coin toss to determine if the killer slays his victim or not?! The saddest part of the film is Tommy Lee Jones' character. He hovers around basically doing nothing, and just mildly investigates the crimes. He never encounters the 'good guy' or the bad guy until the good guy's dead. He misses the bad guy, BTW. Unfortunately, I didn't see the other candidates - but I figure at least ONE of them has to be better than this slick B movie..."

","Let me say that I'm a Coen Brothers fan. Loved Fargo, Barton Fink, O Brother, Blood Simple. I enjoyed this movie for most of it, although to me it was a less successful film than Blood Simple which has a similar feel.<br/><br/>The big problem is the final act. The main character dies and it isn't even shown and is barely implied. I was confused in the theater when I saw it because I didn't know what happened to the Josh Brolin character. When the movie ended, several people in the audience were mumbling about the movie ending the way it did - inconclusively. The killer also kills the guy's wife at the end, but they don't bother to show that either. The sheriff has the bad guy cornered at one point in a hotel room, and the guy mysteriously disappears through an air vent.<br/><br/>The movie goes along and is setting up a confrontation between the two adversaries and instead of showing it, we get Tommy Lee Jones musing about life and how crazy the world has become. Then the killer wanders off at the end after a random car accident. The real problem is that you apparently need to read the book to know what happens in the film, which makes it an interesting failure in my mind."

I would like to see this thing completed someday, as it started out good, had some decent acting, and the cinematography was bland and washed out like ""The Mist"" and ""Delores Claiborne"". What ever happened to Technicolor? Tommy Lee Jones must be Barnaby Jones' older brother that never used sunscreen, because he looks like he died of old age several decades before they invented enbalming fluid... it is no wonder that his character didn't actually do anything but show up after everything was over.

I'm a fan of most of the Coen brothers work and this was a film I had high hopes for but unfortunately I found it to be one of their worst! Don't be fooled by the reviewers who are proclaiming this movie carries some important philosophical 'message', the so called 'message' contained in this film should be nothing new to anyone who has any interest in books or cinema...or for that matter, life. Real life teaches the lesson far better than any overly contrived film can. If it didn't take itself so seriously (this movie thinks it's way more important than it actually is) and had just stopped trying to be so annoyingly 'profound' and concentrated on the plot then I would have enjoyed it so much more.<br/><br/>There is ¾ of a good movie here but the last ¼ of the film is spent practically preaching to the audience and that is unforgivable in my opinion after what has come prior to that.<br/><br/>NCFOM has left me bewildered at the critical acclaim it has received although there are a few professional reviewers who will at least stand up for themselves and call this movie for what it is, a potentially great movie let down by a poor closing act! If this has stuck as closely to the book as some suggest then I'd say it was a book that should never have been made into a film in the first place...at the very least it needed some tweaks to the narrative progression in the last ¼ and a totally new denouement. If I was to rate this movie without the final quarter I'd probably give it 10 stars but since I felt like I'd spent 2 hours in the cinema without any kind of worthwhile closure to the story I believe watching the movie was almost totally pointless. It's a bit like cruelly dangling a carrot in front a donkey only to get to your destination and not actually give the tired donkey the carrot.<br/><br/>Sadly the movie as a whole just doesn't work for me!"

","No Country For Old Men is based on Cormac McCarthy's 2005 novel of the same name: and having read the novel I can honestly say that the Coen Bros. did a fantastic job adapting the book for the screen. It's ridiculously faithful to the source material and it's visualized in such a gorgeously cinematic way that it's no wonder this movie won the Oscar for Best Picture in 2008 (for the films of 2007). It's a neo-Western, neo-noir thriller that is virtually an extravagant showcase for Javier Bardem's terrifying villain Anton Chigurh (which won Bardem the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor). Bardem's so intimidating as Chigurh that I'd say he's almost as scary as Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter (even though this film isn't a horror-piece).<br/><br/>No Country for Old Men is a masterpiece of 2000s-cinema and rightly so: it's a multi-genre piece that has the same brutal desolation of a classic Western, the tense direction of action-thrillers from directors like Martin Scorsese or Michael Mann, but it has the grounded approach to Western filmmaking of John Ford and Sergio Leone. This film is entertaining yet relentlessly tense in its drama, satisfying yet bittersweet in its many payoffs, and never dull in its 2-hour run-time.<br/><br/>If you want a Western that's got the conventions of the oldie-goodies yet updates it for more modern times (1980 in this case), this film is an absolute must-see.<br/><br/>No Country for Old Men is a new country for cinema; a 5/5 star achievement."

I just rewatched the movie now and still can't believe that scene maybe even more so now. And so I feel compelled to write a review. Even searching now I see that even critics criticize this scene for single-handedly ruining the movie.<br/><br/>Basically the movie is a showdown between a psycho killer and an average but crafty southern ex vet. They do a very good job executing this to the point where you are literally on the edge of your seat for some parts. Javier Bardem helps this by playing his part masterfully. All actors in this film were good but he takes it to a new level. I'm gonna even call his character one of the best villains in any movie. <br/><br/>Now since all of that is perfectly fine just picture when you see a whole movie building up a showdown just to find out that the main character or Good Guy character was gunned down off camera by random Mexicans in a gunfight that they don't even show in the film.<br/><br/>It's honestly the worst thing I've ever seen happen to a movie. Talking over with friends they said it actually comes up often in lists such as biggest Wtf moments in movies and that it's the Coen brothers messing with the audience but I think it's much more than that.

","The worst movie to see while eating popcorn: No Country for Old Men (Coen brothers, 2007). The reason is simple: you hear no music for the two hours that it lasts. This film is made that you should appreciate every single noise you hear in it. Starting truck, shots, wind sounds, door squeaking, etc. So I pity the people who saw this movie in a movie theater, a place that tends to irritate attentive moviegoers due to people sitting in the first row who whisper to the person sitting next, or the guy all alone in the back who plunges his hand into his bag of chips. But it is precisely on this aspect that the film shines: its absence of music, and therefore on what remains of what human hearing can perceive by viewing the film; the sound. The film is absent of music, but it is just as if there was one. One can listen to the single musical piece during the end credits, but the dialogues are so powerful that the film does not need to clutter with music. Sometimes long scenes take place without a note of music or even dialogues, but it is precisely this silence that makes the film so captivating. The trio of actors represented on the cover (Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones) is perfect. Although the character of the sheriff, embodied by Tommy Lee Jones, experienced actor, seemed a bit more shadowed than the others, although he plays a key role in the plot. One wonders why the face of Woody Harrelson is not on the poster of the film. The impeccable Bardem's acting (recipient of the Oscar of the best actor) is of a prodigious originality. Each of the quotes of the character he incarnates (Anton Chigurh) is absolutely awesome. What to say about the scene where he shoots heads or tails with the cashier of the convenience store. It feels like he will shoot him in the head every moment, but he prefers to argue with the old man while eating peanuts. Finally, what to say about the photo montage, if not that every shot is framed to perfection and that a monk's patience had to be necessary to turn in these magnificent external decorations. Visually, this film is a work of art that surpasses any other low-range action thriller, despite an intrigue that would tend to qualify as ""typical"" cat and mouse play, which we have already seen a thousand times in Hollywood cinema. But it is the production of the Coen brothers that ranks No Country... above all the others. The film won the Oscar for the best film and deserves it, because it's too perfect."

","""No Country for Old Men"" was a turn in the Coens' filmography that they hadn't went down since ""Fargo"", a (relatively) serious crime drama.<br/><br/>The Coen brothers have a long-standing reputation for their off beat, sometimes hilarious dialogue and characters, as well as crafting intricate plots that fall into the rear view as the story and all of its zaniness progresses, i.e. ""The Big Lebowski"". However, ""No Country for Old Men"" is quite a reach different than the rest of their discography. A western, set in 1980 and based on a Cormac McCarthy novel, that follows Josh Brolin's character Llewelyn after he happens upon a not-yet-discovered crime scene and a case full of unclaimed money. Once the money's proprietor finds this out, Llewelyn is tailed voraciously by Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh, this plot line is what comprises the majority of the film, in company with Tommy Lee Jones' seemingly slow moving pursuit into the events.<br/><br/>In Chigurh's first moments, we see him escape arrest and commit murder - both in perhaps the coldest ways possible. From this point on, he is on a manhunt without a lot of the urgency. Chigurh follows leads, plans his following actions, even takes steps without making a single sound or uttering a single word. He isn't accompanied with any music, he isn't given any background, and we don't see him answer to anyone. Chigurh almost seems like a man out of a different world, someone just here visiting to do a job, he doesn't look to be held down by earthly restrictions, and it is abundantly clear that no matter where Llewelyn (or anyone else) goes, he is never safe from him. These characteristics are bound together wonderfully and effortlessly by Javier Bardem.<br/><br/>Thankfully enough, Bardem is balanced out by a great protagonist performance by Josh Brolin (one of his best) and the character who acts more as a storyteller and backdrop for the world these characters live in than actual engaged plot-driven character, Tommy Lee Jones. Jones, by far, gets the smallest screen time of the three leads but his moments, his words, are some of the most memorable in the entire film. In his performance we believe we are listening to tales told by a man who has been lucky enough to tell them.<br/><br/>""No Country for Old Men"" is a quiet film, a slow film. It doesn't say too much, try too hard, or hit anyone over the head with anything they don't need. ""No Country"" begs you to feel the created atmosphere, the pauses given by the characters after they're done speaking or while they're listening to perhaps their last moments. There's no soundtrack playing us through scenes, there's no spike in the music when there would be in any other movie, there's just silence. Shots of the surroundings, and there aren't too many, shown by the great Roger Deakins who delivers award caliber work once again by showing western emptiness and making it look beautiful, and our characters and the words that they speak. ""No Country"" is a better movie if you read it between the lines. Much of the dialogue shouldn't be taken on face value, Chigurh makes this obvious by deconstructing everything that anyone ever gets to say to him. The Coen brothers crafted a screenplay that was smart enough, small enough, to let us infer messages just as the characters do instead of filling minutes with exposition, as it would hurt this story to do. While there are oft moments of humor sprinkled throughout and used sparingly, the tone is held consistently and paced brilliantly by the Coens in their lone western.<br/><br/>""No Country for Old Men"" is a unique film, with the Coens that comes to be expected, but it's not their usual brand of unique that they find a way to craft time and again with the zany characters and laughable situations. ""No Country"" breaks rules, it tells us a story and acts as if it were inconsequential, as if it were another of Jones' characters' tales. It grips us in a pursuit and takes us down with a ear to the ground to listen, and in that, it's a success, but that's not really what ""No Country"" is about.<br/><br/>While watching Llewelyn and Chigurh scheme and plot their way around the empty Texan landscape in various hotels and deserted roads accounted for some of the most suspenseful cinema since, perhaps, Hitchcock, ""No Country"" is a bit deeper than a normal cat and mouse movie (like ""Heat""). It's unpredictable, it's subdued, and it's just telling you a story, albeit a bitter one and grounded one - with some Coen brothers touches of humor and superb pacing, acting, editing, and storytelling along the way."

Rather than report the discovery to the sheriff Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), He decides to simply to pocket the 2 million dollars for himself. The result of that decision puts a psychopathic killer, Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), on his trail by the drug cartel. This killer is a dispassionate murderer of nearly every rival, bystander and even his employer in his pursuit of Moss. As Moss desperately attempts to keep one step ahead, the blood from this hunt begins to flow behind him with relentlessly growing intensity as Chigurh closes in. Meanwhile, the laconic Sheriff Ed Tom Bell blithely oversees the investigation even as he struggles to face the sheer enormity of the crimes he is attempting to thwart. This is a Coen brothers' team of direction and production that is beautifully terse and very intense. The film provides ""edge of your seat"" and these quickly paced action scenes are tightly constructed and presented like a Hitchcock film with its almost morbid silence in the showing of the act of murder. Any lesser movie would seemingly dissolve into cat and mouse territory, by the middle of the film, but here there are more shoot outs and standoffs galore and the viewer begs to anticipate what is happening next, but cannot. Nothing is ever quite what it seems in this bleak but mesmerizing country, as Tommy Lee Jones shows up as a soon to be retired sheriff, and commands the screen by pumping the drama with morality and reality versus the mayhem preceding him. It is a very unique film that begs watching again and again."

","The film No Country for Old Men, an adaptation from the novel written by Cormac McCarthy, is a chilling visual representation of the human struggle to define and live by a moral code. With the story taking place in the countryside of Texas in the 1980's, Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), discovers the crime scene of a drug deal gone wrong, and decides to take the two million dollars he finds among the bodies and drugs. Almost immediately, the psychopathic murderer, Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), and the Mexican drug dealers who hired him, begin to hunt Moss and the money. Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) and his fellow officers investigate the drug deal and begin connecting the murders of Chigurh, and it is Bell's mission to bring justice to the criminals and protect the innocent. <br/><br/>As Moss tries to evade Chigurh's deathly cattle air gun using his survival skills and experience from serving in the military, there are several sequences where intensity and suspense entrance the viewer as Moss is chased by the drug dealer's dog, and later when a shootout unfolds, leaving both Moss and Chigurh injured. Moss escapes across the border to a Mexican hospital, and Chigurh kills the person who has been hired to find him, and threatens to kill Moss's wife, Carla Jean, who has been hiding since Moss took the money. While Moss is en route to find his wife, he picks up a hitchhiker; however, the Mexican drug dealers at a motel kill both. Chigurh arrives later, retrieves the money, and returns it to the owner. Chigurh continues to hunt Carla Jean, and finds her at her grandmother's house, still killing her though Moss is already dead. As Chigurh leaves the scene, the gun he used to commit the murders was stolen, and he gets away. The film ends with Sheriff Bell expressing his feelings of failure in solving the crimes and he decides to retire. <br/><br/>The three main characters in the film live their life under very different values and ethical standards. Chigurh operates as a destructive force to any moral code, as we even first see him escaping prison, symbolizing how he cannot be controlled by the system. Later, Chigurh leaves the fate of the store-owner up to chance by flipping a coin, and he continually demonstrates behaviors outside of the typical social norms. For example, Chigurh drinks the milk from Moss's refrigerator after he enters his home, and sleeps in Carla Jean's bed when searching for her. Moss's sense of entitlement and power is evident in way he talks to the landlady, expecting her to release private information about Moss to him. Ultimately, Chigurh follows through in killing Carla Jean, despite Moss being dead, as if it was his internal moral duty. <br/><br/>Sheriff Bell represents the justice system, and has had his moral framework built by law and truth. Bell appears to have a strong sense of what is right versus wrong, and feels obligated to bring justice to his community. In his monologues, Bell reflects on how society has changed and he struggles in processing the ""evils"" that have been increasing in society. This is reinforced in the end when Bell surrenders to the fight for the good, and feels defeated in being able to protect his community and in seeking justice. <br/><br/>Moss's moral code lies somewhere in between Chigurh's and Bell's. A veteran from the war, Moss is independent and appears to believe he is acting under free will for duration of the film. Moss took the money from the crime scene, however, returned to give the surviving man water after experiencing guilt. This sense of right and wrong has been created internally and is shaped by his prior experiences. Moss is a survivor and veteran, but also breaks the law in creating a sawed off shotgun. Moss is a married man, and appears to have a strong moral center in protecting those that he cares about and the innocent. Moss's actions are independent, but the viewer is able to see that Moss has a sense of what is right and wrong for him, but that it is dependent on the situation. <br/><br/>Within the film, various techniques were used to highlight the theme of morality, including camera angles and lighting. For example, there are many high-angle shots throughout the film, especially when Chigurh is killing a victim or cleaning himself afterwards. This high-angle shot is a reflection of how Chigurh operates outside of any typical moral code, and his belief in fate. The lighting also appears to be carefully constructed throughout the film. Throughout the film, there is a repeated use of shadows to both enhance the mood and depict good versus evil. Interestingly, Moss's character is often shown half lit, symbolizing the moral code by which he operates, as it is somewhere between the ""good"" and ""evil"" of both Bell and Chigurh. <br/><br/>Some critics could compare the film to that of Fargo, another Coen brother's film, as both have a plot where a law enforcement figure is challenged with protecting their community from a killer, however, No Country for Old Men uses admirable craftsmanship in the production to tell the story and tie the themes together. Viewers will find themselves holding their breath and be aware of the silence that accompanies a large portion of the film while reflecting on the parallels to society and the moral codes we see or choose to follow."

","In the first few minutes we see a death. This quick start to the film gets the audience engaged right from the off and makes them want to carry on watching it. Despite this, the next 45 mins - 1 hour it slows down a lot and not much happens.<br/><br/>The best aspect of this film was the amount of silences used during the movie. The silence build up suspense and tension and it usually ends in an anticlimax keeping the audience always on their seat and it forces them to always be prepared as they don't know what is going to happen next. Anticlimax or climax? <br/><br/>Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) is a antagonist who is calm but extremely intimidating due to his relaxed tone of voice and actions on everything. Early on in the film he goes to a shop and he puts the shop owners fate in a coin toss. Heads or tails? His unusual nature is one in which the audience cannot predict. We learn to know that he is a savage. <br/><br/>At the conclusion of the film Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) (the man getting hunted down by Anton) is killed by Chigurh and what was very effective about the scene was we didn't see the death occur. All we hear is gunshots and it makes the audience confused as they don't know who is shooting and who is being shot. <br/><br/>Overall, I didn't think the film was outstanding but the lack of non diagetic sound made the film better due to its natural feel."

What motivates me? How surreal is my waking life and how real is my dream life? Is there more going on here than I can perceive? As the audience is steered towards deeper meaning and questions, many will feel confused and uncomfortable. Real art is rare. Real art may produce a surprising array of emotional reactions.

","I never give a movie 10 out of 10 stars when I first see it.  The movie needs to GROW to 10 stars (more than likely from a 8 or 9 star movie) over time.  The Coen Brothers' NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN has grown into a 10 star movie for me.<br/><br/>Based on the fantastic novel by Pulitzer Prize winning author Cormac McCarthy (The Road), NCFOM tells the story of  Texas border town Sheriff Ed Tom Bell in the early 1980's, a man of an ""earlier time"" who feels that it ""doesn't take much to govern good people"".  Into his world come some NOT so good - and increasingly violent - people which makes Sheriff Bell question whether he belongs in this new world.<br/><br/>At first glance, this movie is a crime thriller/action caper with bad guys fighting bad guys over $2 million in drug money.  Caught in the middle of this is hunter Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) who stumbles across - and takes - the money and is hunted by both sides. Violence ensues - and the violence is delivered in increasingly horrific and in a ""manner of fact"" manner.  However, this movie is much, much more than the violence and action which is why this film has elevated in my mind in the 9 years since it was released.<br/><br/>Joel and Ethan Cohen won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay for NCFOM - and they are well deserved.  This is a strongly written and directed film by 2 filmmakers with a firm vision that they successfully translate to the screen.<br/><br/>On top of this, the Coens continue to shine as strong directors of Actors.  Starting with Javier Bardem in his Academy Award winning role as the sinister, scary and intense Anton Chigurh (complete with bad haircut), you can go right down the list to screen stars such as  Josh Brolin (probably his finest work) and Woody Harrelson and character actors Garret Dillahunt, Barry Corbin, Stephen Root and Tess Harper - each one hits  the right notes.  Even Kelly Macdonald,  in what could have been a thankless role as Brolin's wife, shines.<br/><br/>But, for me, this film hinges on the success of Tommy Lee Jones portrayal of Sheriff Bell.  I don't think it is too overblown to state that this performance is the best of his career.  It is a shame he did not get more Academy love.  His Ed Tom Bell is solid, confident, weary, beaten down and bewildered all in the turn of a phrase.  It is a bravura performance, one that has grown stronger over the years - especially in his closing monologue.  You would expect a violent picture like this to end in a blazing shootout, a la Quentin Tarantino, but instead you get a reflective monologue by Jones where he concludes that it really is ""NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN<br/><br/>10 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)"

","Let me start by saying, there are several movies critics eat up, that they shouldn't. This was not one of those. This was near-perfection.<br/><br/>What it seems like is a fairly basic plot: A hunter named Moss finds a suitcase full of dirty money and a psychotic killer is after him to get it back. You have one of the best movie villains ever put to screen played perfectly by Javier Bardem. You have a like-able main character, who the viewer roots for. Then about two thirds of the way through the movie, something happens that most viewers don't like/ understand: The scene cuts and Moss is just dead. Nothing is shown of how Chigurh got him. He's just dead. <br/><br/>To understand the reasoning for this you have to look back to the very first scene. Sheriff Ed Tom Bell is narrating and says that getting up there in age, he just doesn't want to see something ""that he's never seen before"". Thus, the cat and mouse game between Moss and Chigurh is just a narrative of something that Bell, in fact, has never seen. Moss dying off screen is supposed to show the viewer that the real protagonist of the story is Sheriff Ed Tom Bell, and as the movie ends Sheriff Bell is shown telling his dream to his wife, almost signifying that he is ready to move on, and has accepted his place in the world, and that the world of drugs, violence and crime is indeed ""no country"" for an old man.<br/><br/>Taking this movie strictly on a literal basis, you may struggle to enjoy it fully. But when you fully understand the symbolism and underlying ideas, you can't help but love this classic."

","""No Country for Old Men"" is the Coen Bros' adaptation of the Cormac McCarthy novel from almost 10 years ago. This film won 4 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and while I have doubts to say this is my favorite film of the year and not ""There Will Be Blood"", there is no denying that ""No Country for Old Men"" is among the finest the year 2007 had to offer. The movie runs for slightly over 2 hours, with credits, and takes us into the world of Llewelyn Moss who finds a huge amount of money. For almost the entire movie, he is on the run from contract killer Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem, Oscar winner) with Tommy Lee Jones playing Ed Tom Bell, a sheriff who, on the other hand, is trying to help Moss and catch Chigurh. Woody Harrelson and Kelly McDonald play important characters too.<br/><br/>It has always been the Coens' strength to include characters in their movies who may be minor, but are still very memorable. Their recent movie ""Inside Llewyn Davis"", my favorite from the brothers, is a great example of that, but this film here is as well. Garret Dilahunt playing a sheriff's assistant was as fun to watch as Kathy Lamkin's one-minute, one-scene character: ""We can't give out no information."" This scene actually gave out a nice piece of information on Chigurh. I don't think he let her live because there was somebody else when we hear the noise of somebody flushing the toilet. He is not scared of attracting attention in other scenes by killing several people in the same location. I think he was impressed by how much of a professional the woman was, even in the face of such a dangerous man like him, so she did not even have to go through his coin toss procedure. Actually, Chigurh and women is a chapter interesting enough to write a full article about on its own. For example, he offered Carla Jean the chance to live at the end, even if he promised Llewelyn otherwise. And then there is that ""You married into it."" scene of course.<br/><br/>In general, this film is packed with tense, brilliantly atmospheric material from start to finish, be it the dog chase scene, the scene when we see Chigurh turn out the lights in the hallway as he knew Moss would see him, the scene with Chigurh and Bell almost facing each other or the final monologue by Tommy Lee Jones' character. I have heard about interpretations Chigurh and Bell are actually the same person. There are some indicators that it may be true, especially the face-off I just mentioned, but who knows. In general, my personal perception is still that it is not the case. That's entirely subjective though. In any case, the Coen's created one of the most memorable villains in film history here (with the help of McCarthy, of course). The way they used Chigurh's coin as a depiction of luck and fate was simply brilliant and it's very telling that, while Chigurh was always in charge with human enemies following him (he killed most of these), he picked the wrong side of the coin in the end apparently when something completely unexpected happens. But this is what luck and fate is all about. You cannot influence it. Great last scene with Bardem's character for sure. I am truly curious what happens to him next. This scene also makes for a nice parallel with Moss' scene earlier when he pays a lot of money for the jacket (being the somewhat good guy) and Chigurh gets the shirt for free (being the bad guy). Life's not fair. Neither is this movie. But it's very outstanding and a great achievement of filmmaking. Highly recommended."

","No Country for Old Men (2007): Dir: Ethan Coen, Joel Coen / Cast: Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, Kelly McDonald, Woody Harrelson: Another winner from directors Joel and Ethan Coen tackling the change in society. In this case a Sheriff played by Tommy Lee Jones questions the latest string of murders. Josh Brolin plays a hunter who stumbles upon a case full of cash and numerous bodies. His treasure leads to extreme consequences that will cost him. Javier Bardem plays an unusual killer, blasting door locks and asking bizarre questions often contained within a coin toss. Kelly McDonald plays Brolin's wife as fearful yet strong in the face of adversary, which renders a questionable and harsh finale. Woody Harrelson plays a cocky bounty hunter attempting to track down Bardem. The Coen brothers are notorious for bizarre plot ideas, having made such great films as Blood Simple and The Big Lebowski. Jones as the Sheriff transcends a sense of dread and hopelessness as he comes close but not close enough. However, Bardem steals the film as the memorable villain whose methods are odd. The ending can be seen as either symbolic or just a cop out solution in terms of Bardem's placement. It presents a strong view regarding violence and its everlasting presence and the corrupt nature of society. Title represents its strain on weary souls seeking refuge. Score: 8 / 10"

It is NOT unanswered questions that the viewer might have or unexplained scenes. That said, this movie does not have plot holes, it does however require that you think a little, this isn't going to be some mindless action movie like transformers or something. The point of the movie: Death cannot be stopped, and the wild west is dead. As is shown by Tommy Lee Jones' character. He did nothing because that was the point of the movie people!

"Spoiled_Pitbull","8","2","2","12 December 2013"," Impressive but lacking in some small details
","I enjoyed this movie well enough to see it twice in theater and later bought the DVD. It is gritty and nothing about it is boring. Anton Chigurh is the most memorable character in this movie by far. As much as I enjoy this movie there are some annoying details that stand out to me as inaccurate. As impressive and creepy as using a captive bolt gun to kill people was, I really can't see anyone carrying one around for that purpose considering it's bulk and the attention it would attract. When Llewelyn Moss is chased into then back out of the river by the pit bull, he gets back on dry land and realized that he can't outrun the dog. He draws a Colt 1911a1 .45 to shoot the dog but first frantically scrambles to clear the water from the barrel, apparently to avoid bursting the barrel and rendering the handgun useless. This drill is totally unnecessary since whatever little water remains in the barrel will not cause any issues. I know this from experience and I really have to roll my eyes when I see this. The rifle Llewelyn Moss is using for antelope hunting has a laminated stock and the scope has a matte black finish, very rarely would you see a laminated stock on anything but a custom rifle in 1980. Matte black scopes on sporting rifles weren't common until years later. Moss also buys a Chinese copy of a Winchester model 97 shotgun which definitely wasn't available in '80. A Remington 870, Winchester 1200, or Mossberg 500 or some others would have been a better period correct choice. When he discovers the drug deal gone bad shootout scene he liberates a H&K SP89 pistol which was not available until at least 1989. I was an 18 year old gun nut in 1980 so I caught these things right off. Really, this movie has too many goofs and you have to wonder how so many of them went un-noticed or un-corrected. I gave the movie an 8 because of these and other obvious goofs. Destpite this, it is still a very powerful, suspenseful, and violent movie that I still enjoy and will continue to."

","Javier Bardem is wonderfully creepy as Anton Chigurh; the most sinister villain to hit the screen. Tommy Lee Jones portrays a somewhat old-timer cop who, despite his best efforts, discovers he no longer belongs in a time where criminals like Anton Chigurh roam free. Anton is so evil, Tommy Lee Jones has a hard time dealing with it head on. What he first thought to be a normal criminal investigation turned into a frightening, violent game of cat and mouse between Anton Chigurh and Llewelyn Davis. Josh Brolin who played Llewelyn, finds a large quantity of money in the desert while he's out hunting. Unfortunately for him, that pile of cash belonged to a very high profile individual who practically summons the most badass hit-man, Anton Chigurh, to recover the lost goods. This is an almost certain death wish for anyway in the crosshairs of Antoine."

","When hunter Llewelyn Moss comes across the site of a massacre in West Texas he does something that will make life very dangerous for himself and those around him; he picks up a case containing two million dollars. Soon sinister killer Anton Chigurh is looking for him and wherever Llewelyn goes Anton isn't far behind; leaving a trail of bodies as he goes. Also looking for the pair is Sheriff Ed Tom Bell; a law enforcement officer who understandable has difficulty comprehending the violence he encounters.<br/><br/>This is a contender for the best film made by the Cohen Brothers; the tension is maintained throughout and there are quite a few surprises. These surprises aren't clichéd twists but things one doesn't expect in films of course listing these surprises would spoil the film for first time viewers. There is a bleak feeling to the film; both because of the casual extreme violence and the sun-baked Texas countryside. Tommy Lee Jones and Josh Brolin are great as Sheriff Bell and Llewelyn Moss but it is Javier Bardem who is most memorable; his portrayal of the killer is frighteningly impressive; he isn't a musclebound heavy but still feels almost as unstoppable as Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator. It isn't just the three leads who are on top form; Scottish actress Kelly MacDonald loses her native accent and passes as Texan at least to my English ears. As the film reaches its conclusion the viewer will be left wanting to know what happens next for reasons that I won't spoil but left me quite surprised; so much so that I sat through the credits to see if there was a postscript there isn't.<br/><br/>Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody who enjoyed previous films by the Cohens; just don't expect any laughs."

","The Coen brothers are just good at making these slow paced crime/thriller films. They sure proved it with the movie ""Fargo"" and they proved it again in this one. I just really enjoy the Coen brothers distinct trademarks and elements they put into their films and I enjoyed this one for it as well. In a way watching this film sort of reminded me of the film Chan-wook Park film ""Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance"". Not all that much when it comes to the story but the direction and vibe of it while just about entirely having it's own thing going. Maybe it's the cat and mouse aspect of this film. The Coen brothers trademark of adding slightly odd or even awkward characters in their film works this time around as well. And their choice of casting is fantastic. Especially Javier Bardem who puts on his performance of a lifetime and will probably be known for this role for a very long time. He is basically the show stealer in this film and despite the scary nature of his character I was anxious to see what his character would do next. Javier plays this hit-man that goes around killing people with a air gun to track down where the money went from a drug cartel and goes about his business in a very intimidating and menacing manner. While having some messed up sets of principles. In fact he sort of reminded me of the villain Two-Face from the Batman franchise, but that is mainly do to the coin scenes in this film. And because he is the most unrealistic character in this film when it comes to his killing spree while not putting hardly any effort to cover up his tracks. The Coen brothers trademark of adding a bit of dark, uncomfortable or awkward humor is still present in this film. Overall this is another great installment from the Coen brothers and film lovers should most definitely check this one out. The ending however is abrupt, in fact it doesn't seem to really have a ending and seemed to wrap it up after the climax a bit too quickly but that is only a small gripe. And I don't like it when the guy that has a conscious and tries to do the right thing ends up getting screwed over in a film but that maybe to add to the realism.<br/><br/>8.6/10"

","No country for old men is a thriller in which a hunter Llewelyn moss, played by Josh brolin, stumbles upon more than 2 million dollars in cash. He finds this money near a deserted place where some drug deal went wrong. He is then followed by some people speaking Spanish, who are drug dealers as well as by a psychopath Anton Chigurh, played by Javier Bardem. The Spanish people want the money from Llewelyn. Anton chigurh was hired by some other drug dealers to get the cash.<br/><br/>What ensues is a chase between Llewelyn and Chigurh. Chigurh is a psychopath with principles which he abides by strictly. He has really terrified me. I read some other reviews in IMDb in which the users compared him with Hanibal lecter from The silence of the lambs. Well, chigurh has terrified me more than Lecter. At least, Lecter was in a cage. Chigurh is loose. He does not move an inch from his principles and if he had decided upon killing someone, he would definitely do it no matter what happens after that.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes in this movie are really very suspenseful. I was really sitting very still during those scenes. These scenes are not at all loud. There are no car chases or high octane action scenes in which there is kicking and punching. But I am sure these scenes would surely make you hold your breath. Besides, I also found that this movie has very little of background music which makes it all the more beautiful. It really gives a great deal of intensity to the scenes. Some of the scenes just made me jump in my seat.<br/><br/>The story takes place in Texas. There are many scenes which showcase the barren desert. Well, for some strange reason I like those movies in which there are scenes of barren deserts. Also I tend to like films with less background music. I liked this movie for its presentation style.<br/><br/>I think the story is good. What I didn't like is its ending. I hoped that Chigurh would get killed or caught. But, he didn't. Also, I didn't understand why Tommy lee jones quit his job. I think that the story is very good until Llewelyn dies. After that I think it fizzles out. Too much attention was given to Tommy lee jones after Llewelyn dies.<br/><br/>I liked it because of its unique style of film making. If you want to see a great thriller with a realistic story/ending, then do see this one."

","In the Coen brothers' beautifully terse and achingly intense No Country For Old Men, we learn very early on that a drug deal has gone wrong on the eerily flat plains of southern Texas, leaving no surivors and only a briefcase full of money. Through the stolid eyes of Josh Brolin, who delivers an effortless performance as the overconfindent Llewelyn Moss, we see the aftermath of this carnage and we also see a desperate man with a mountain of debt snatch something he does not fully comprehend, as much as he likes to pretend he does. Tightly raut scenes of almost morbid silence such as this one fascinate almost as much as Javier Bardem's nightmare-inducing turn as psychopathic hit-man Anton Chigurgh, who is sent to retrieve the drug money by any means necessary, but all he needs is his trusty cattlegun friend-o. Any lesser movie would seemingly desolve into cat and mouse territory here with shoot outs and standoffs galore, but nothing is ever quite what it seems in this bleak but mesmerizing country, as Tommy Lee Jones shows up as a soon to be retired sheriff, and commands the screen by pumping the drama with morality and reality, not just lead."

","Almost everyone but my wife has seen this movie. I love Josh Brolin in this - he projects an air of invincibility - but, of course is overcome by the ultimate bad ass - Anton. The weapons choice is great - using the bolt gun shows that Anton has no more respect for the poor souls he dispatches than he would for a helpless animal. Anton's sense of morals (amorals) is chilling - ""I promised your husband that I would kill you."" (So naturally I cannot go back on my word.)<br/><br/>and<br/><br/>""You don't have to do this!"" - the words of the desperate about to be victim before every psychopathic killer who is about to do them in. Of course they have to do it - that's what makes them psychopaths. And Anton says ""They all say that."" He's right & it never convinces the killer to do otherwise. I'd like to see one where the killer said ""You know? You are right - go ahead & leave."" Now that would be a surprise.<br/><br/>Needless to say, I loved the movie (Probably 2nd or 3rd time I have seen it.) The Coen Brothers are great - very quirky - amazing. I am surprised that ""No Country"" won as many Academy Awards as it did - it does not espouse the usual far left liberal bull, nor does it glorify the gay life style - those are the prevailing themes in the movies that Hollywood loves. <br/><br/>Finally Tommy Lee Jones is at his best in the role of the Sheriff.

That be Miller's Crossing (1990), possibly their true masterpiece.<br/><br/>This is an always interesting character study where the villain is undoubtedly worthy of clinical deconstruction and is awe inspiring and captivating, but the movie is needlessly confusing and constructed by design to be an unsettling, relentless non linear expose of the despair and disappointment in the devolving descent of the human condition.<br/><br/>However, it may be too layered and too unclear for it to be ultimately satisfying. It delivers some home spun prose about the inner mind of straight and stalwart people caught in this web of modern criminal behavior that pushes the oldsters off the cliff, but not before some sadistic torture.<br/><br/>There are some darkly funny and cynical quotable lines one expects from the Coen's and when this movie works it presents some new and fresh carnage that raises the hackles and chills the spine.

","So it's a well constructed film featuring a central villain who's uncharacteristically laconic and sadistic at the same time which is something original, but the narrative is shallow and the plot sometimes seems aimless. Jones is a retiring lawman who must investigate a spate of murders committed by Bardem, sporting a creepy hairstyle and an unusual choice of weapon in a pneumatic cattle gun. Junior Brolin is the opportunistic rancher who happens on a drug deal gone sour, seeking to profit from the mini massacre, but Bardem has other ideas and tracks his prey across the south-west.<br/><br/>Jones is a tired looking bystander to the carnage created by the man of the moment, Javier Bardem whose star rose to prominence following his Oscar nod for this jolting, unhinged performance. Woody Harrelson has a good scene or two as a professional mercenary and pale imitation of Bardem's commitment to his chosen profession, while Tess Harper has a minor role as Jones' wife, and Barry Corbin and Stephen Root feature in supporting roles.<br/><br/>Characterised by the typical Coen brothers style, it's epic in length and paced like a snail on valium, but thankfully, punctuated by some shocking encounters that make it a memorable experience. Not a bad film at all, but whether it's worthy of being declared the best film of its year either inflates its worth or reflects poorly on the competition."

","This movie is well made....well acted....well scripted. Has an interesting story, and just about everything going for it. It presents us to Anton Chigurh, (Javier Bardem) a man who appears to have no conscience....He is like a simple killing machine. You want someone rubbed out..?? then this is your man. But don't upset him, and don't play ""toss the coin"" with him. He kills like he is robotic. Without feeling. He is Hannibal Lecter ..without the brain. For a movie that is steeped in blood, it has many funny lines. Tommy Lee Jones (the sheriff) is the only one who seems to sense...law and order are fading fast. Its the year 1980 and drugs have become a massive industry, but too many amateurs mean lots of stuff ups. Josh Brolin stumbles apon a ""deal gone wrong"", and helps himself to a satchel containing 2 million dollars. He is a Vietnam Vet., but thats not going to make much difference when Chigurh is hired to get the money. The pace here is good...always interesting always entertaining. For all its good points,No Country for Old Men always leaves me cold. Perhaps its the depressing reality that Chirgurh is free to go on killing who he feels like. And Sherrifs like the Tommy Lee Jones character feel ""overmatched"" (which they most definitely are). In the end, all is bleak and dark. Dealing in drugs and lawlessness appears to have won. Michael Clayton and There will be Blood could have won the best picture Oscar in 2007. They didn't...this movie did...and thats fair enough."
"TOMASBBloodhound","10","2","2","24 June 2012"," Sometimes life is just like flipping a coin.
","The Cohen Brothers have struck gold once again with No Country for Old Men. The writing, acting, photography, and just about anything else you could ask for is all here. Well, maybe except a memorable score. But the fact that this film is so haunting without any music is another aspect of it that makes it such an accomplishment. There is enough going on in the two hour running time that one viewing alone certainly would not do it justice.<br/><br/>The plot seems simple enough on the surface. A man known as Llewelyn Moss out hunting in rural Texas discovers the aftermath of a drug deal gone sour. Several bodies and shot-up vehicles litter the desert floor. There is a large amount of heroin left at the scene. One victim remains alive, but he isn't going anywhere. He just wants a drink of agua before he dies. To Moss, the only question is... where is the last man standing? The guy who no doubt took the money. It isn't long before Moss tracks the man's corpse down and now holds a satchel containing 2 million dollars. If only he weren't so human, he'd almost surely have gotten away with it....<br/><br/>As Moss points out to his wife, someone will be coming after that money. The most prevalent of these people is one of the better recent villains in cinema. Anton Chigurh, as he's known, is a brooding and lethal figure. He has a unique arsenal of weaponry; most notably an air tank that is built for slaughtering cattle. It comes in handy whenever Chigurh encounters a locked door, or sometimes a human in need of slaughtering. Chigurh makes it his mission to hunt Moss down to the ends of the earth to retrieve the money. And apparently to punish Moss for inconveniencing him. Lots of innocent people get caught up in the carnage. Also in the mix is an aging sheriff named Ed Tom Bell. Tommy Lee Jones plays him perfectly. He knows he's out gunned not only in this instance, but in general. He recalls in an early monologue how some sheriffs never used to need to carry guns. Now, all the guns in the world hardly do an honest man any good against the evil that's out there. The film takes plenty of surprising turns and always keeps the viewer guessing. Many would suggest that the film lacks a compelling climax, but this kind of story is more of a morality tale than a standard cops and robbers deal.<br/><br/>The Cohens have just about everything down right. Even using skinny male actors to play men at a time (1980) when Americans were not so obese. The action sequences are meticulous and exciting. The violence is brutal, but not completely over the top. There are so many terrific lines of dialog. When Chigurh asks the proprietor of a filling station, ""What's the most you've ever lost on a coin toss?"", you just know that this will be a line quoted for decades. Just like, ""You talking' to me?"" from Taxi Driver. The acting and casting is so precise that you almost feel like you know these characters as your neighbors or relatives. Even Chigurh, once he's badly wounded in a shootout, begins to seem all too human. Woody Harrelson's character is perhaps just exposition, though. Even so, he's fun to watch.<br/><br/>Brolin, Jones, and Bardem deserved Oscar nods. At least Bardem got his. There weren't too many films on par with this one in 2007. See it now! 10 of 10 stars.<br/><br/>The Hound."
"roger-pettit1","9","2","2","21 June 2012"," An excellent film that bears all the Coen Brothers' hallmarks
","""No Country for Old Men"" is an excellent film. Written and directed by Ethan and Joel Coen, and based on a novel by Cormac McCarthy (which I haven't read), it is a stylish, bleak and brooding movie with undertones of a Western and of film noir and with an almost matchless evocation of time, mood, place and character. It is also surprisingly amusing in places.<br/><br/>Set in Texas in 1980 (the date can be pinpointed by one scene in the film in which a coin minted in 1958 is described as being 22 years old), it tells the story of Llewelyn Moss (played by Josh Brolin). Moss, a young veteran of the Vietnam War, is a welder by trade. He and his wife Carla Jean (Kelly Macdonald) have little money and live in a modest house trailer. While out hunting one day, Moss encounters the detritus of a drugs scam that has evidently misfired. There are several dead bodies and a number of abandoned vehicles strewn around the scene, as well as a dead dog. One of the vehicles contains a huge consignment of drugs. The money deriving from the deal - $2 million - is also there, in a briefcase next to a dead man. Moss thinks quickly and decides to purloin the cash. Unfortunately for him, that money is being sought by Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem). Chigurh is a ruthless, vicious, evil man, with psychopathic tendencies. He will happily and perfunctorily decide whether to kill or to spare someone literally on the toss of a coin. Chigurh carries a canister of compressed air around with him. He uses it, amongst other things, to help to break into premises. He also has a stun gun, with which he kills anyone who attempts to thwart him. It emits a cylinder into his victim's head and thrusts it back afterwards. Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) and his assistant are the law enforcement representatives who attempt to prevent Chigurh's murderous stalking of Moss. <br/><br/>""No Country for Old Men"" is essentially about the complex nature of evil, as personified by Chigurh. He is cold, ruthless and unfeeling but also displays some (admittedly weird) principles in his behaviour. In one scene late in the film, he needlessly goes after Carla Jean precisely because he thinks such action is a matter of principle. Moss had earlier refused to compromise with him and to hand over the money even though Chigurh had said that Moss's failure to do so would result in his having to assassinate Carla Jean. Chigurh therefore feels duty bound to carry out his threat. <br/><br/>The cinematography, the screenplay and the direction are first rate, as is the acting. It would perhaps be invidious to single out any one particular member of the cast, given that everyone is so good. But, for me, Bardem is the star. His performance as Chigurh is astonishingly good. There is one distinctly memorable scene in which he confronts the owner of a gas (petrol) station in the middle of nowhere and chillingly plays mind games with him about whether he will kill him or not. That scene is brilliantly acted by Bardem (and by Gene Jones who plays the gas station owner). <br/><br/>""No Country for Old Men"" is a classy, intelligent and entertaining film. It is a must-see. 9/10."

All we needed was a couple of gallons of antifreeze.<br/><br/>But still, the movie has its merits. The bad guy just keeps coming..like the Yul Brynner robot in West World.

Sometimes, I just don't like working at watching a movie. Just tell me the story.

","No Country for Old Men is a 2007 American crime thriller written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, and is based on the Cormac McCarthy novel of the same name.[1][2] The film stars Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin, and tells the story of an ordinary man to whom chance delivers a fortune that is not his, and the ensuing cat-and-mouse drama, as three men crisscross each others paths in the desert landscape of 1980 West Texas.[3] Themes of fate, conscience and circumstance re-emerge that the Coen brothers have previously explored in Blood Simple and Fargo. This is the best movie I saw so far. Best Acting , Story From my side 10/10 - I thought this movie will be boring but when I see from 1st to last I really enjoyed - Wanna see this movie again. I like Tommy Lee Jones and Josh Borlin performance very much. Seems like classic movie. I downloaded this movie in blue ray. No Country For Old Man is one of my favorite movies."

Annie Proulx (Brokeback Mountain) described it perfectly in her 2002 book, ""That Old Ace in the Hole."" I've been gone from there for five years, but it hadn't changed much from the 1980 setting in the film, an I suspect it hasn't changed much more.<br/><br/>Llewelyn Moss, played brilliantly by Josh Brolin (Grindhouse, Hollow Man) thought he hit the jackpot. But, he didn't account for Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem). Chigurh was methodical, intelligent and psychotic. He is the human equivalent of the terminator robot after John Conner. Those who believe in souls would not say that Chigurg has one.<br/><br/>Tommy Lee Jones (The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, U.S. Marshals) is a tired sheriff that comes from a long line of lawmen. He knows that he is no match for Chigurg. It's not Richard Kimble or Mark Sheridan he's chasing, but a man who has no match.<br/><br/>The dialog is dry and things are not always explained.

","Based on the reviews I've read previous to writing my own review, many people feel this movie has plot holes and makes no sense. Let me help those who are looking to see this great piece of film making.<br/><br/>The story is about a normal guy named Moss who goes hunting and stumbles upon 2 million dollars in cash from a drug deal (we don't witness) that obviously goes bad. By taking the money he is now being hunted by both the Mexican dealers and a psychopathic killer on the hunt for the stolen money. What I believe many people don't understand is that Moss can be considered the central character in this film backed by an incredible story.<br/><br/>I do have to agree that it does tend to slow down towards the end of the film. And I may not like to admit it, but I feel Tommy Lee Jones character tends to slow the movie down a bit. The fact that he is clueless while on the chase in every scene slows down the pace of the film. Other than that, Josh Brolin is great as the lead in this film, and Javier Bardem is simply flawless as Chigurh.<br/><br/>Thrilling, suspenseful, and amazing. I rate this an 9 out of 10."
"fmail6","9","2","2","1 June 2011"," Breathtaking Camera-work in No Country For Old Men
","""No Country For Old Men"" is a brilliant film, proved by its four well-deserved Academy Awards. Though the used camera techniques are not as spectacular or revolutionary as in other films such as ""The Matrix"", it is nonetheless an effective and vital part of the final product. From the discovering of the shoot-out and the money to the never-ending hunt across the deserts and streets of Texas, there are some great nuggets of camera-work, hidden for those who look for them. In this review we will categorize the scenes in three sections, and then analyze the camera techniques applied in that. These techniques are: Desert scenes, focusing on the setting and camera-work, then the use of special camera effects and realistic ones, and lastly; the camera-work in the urban scenes.<br/><br/>As said; first up are the rural desert shots of Texas and New Mexico. The desert scenes are excellently done often filmed from knee or standard body height it gives the feeling you're right there in the idle of it. The perfect example of this is the stumbling of Moss on the Mexican drug deal shoot-out. Filmed from knee height, like many other scenes, it both gives the viewer the feeling he is there walking alongside Moss. In addition this perspective makes it more difficult for the viewer to have an overview of the current situation. By this the directors are creating more tension all along, as none know what happens next and what dangers Moss will face. By contrast the overview 'flying' shots let you see the vastness of the desert, how small and insignificant human settlement is there. This is mostly done when the characters are on their own, alone in the sand covered landscape. This view gives them a sense of loneliness and isolation. Other themes are also conveyed here, albeit less clearly. One example is that in these lone shots the characters seem both hunters and hunted, hunting alone and being watched from above.<br/><br/>In this film there has not been made an extensive use of lenses and or filters. We have not spotted any special color effects. We have only noted one function for each of the techniques: wide-angle lenses for the overview scenes and filters to make certain scenes a little bit darker to add to the tension in that particular scene. But maybe this means that it's very well done. As often the case with backstage work: when you don't notice it is a job well done. Rather unique in ""No Country for Old Men"" is the absence of music throughout the film. For example when characters are walking through the desert the only sounds you hear are those by the boots in the sand. This also adds to the tension, especially in scenes at the place of the drug-battle, and it increases the viewers' focus. This feeling of really living in it is also partially created by the shots in which you look from the viewpoint of the character. For example when the camera is looking down at the hood of the car, r through the windshield, this makes you feel like you are behind the wheel.<br/><br/>There a few chase scenes in urban environments in ""No Country For Old Men"". These environments include motel rooms and small houses. Because of the fact that these places are small the viewer is very close to the protagonist, mostly Moss, so there are lots of close-ups in these scenes. In these chases the viewer follows only one character, so they don't see what the other (Anton Chigurh) is doing. This has the same effect as the knee shots in the deserts; the lack of overview gets the viewer on the edge of their seat. The camera positions are extremely well executed and give an excellent atmosphere to the scenes. Another specific scene is during the night in a Southern Town. There are no people on the street and it almost feels like a horror movie. In the scenes in which the characters speak together in a house or some other type of building, you identify with the characters. These spots are also small spaced, so you feel like you are in the middle of the conversation, looking -like the camera- at the speakers from different angles. The shots in which all the characters are displayed are and the lighting are great throughout the film.<br/><br/>We think ""No Country for Old Men"" with great camera-work and sound effects. The perspective adds very well to how the viewer observes the film. The award-winning directors Joel and Ethan Coen have once again shown where their status has come from. The film has justly received some high-praised awards including the Oscar for the best film and also many positive reviews from well-known newspapers and websites. We can not wait to see the next Coen brothers' film!"

","Lots of deep thoughts here. I put the most stock in the theories of those who've read the book.<br/><br/>Personally, I don't like this trend lately of abrupt endings with lots of loose ends and multiple interpretations. The first major one was The Sopranos finale ending. Now this.<br/><br/>I don't mind being challenged and forced to think a little bit. I don't have to be spoon fed every little detail, but come on...at least finish the story! I'm worried every time someone wants to be considered a genius from now on, they're going to start using this tactic. After that much investment in a story, the audience deserves some type of resolution.<br/><br/>For those who say that's how real life works, with no tidy endings, well these are books, movies and TV series. We pay to be entertained: surprised, scared...but not confused and frustrated.<br/><br/>But now this precedent is being set that if someone can't figure out how to wrap it all up, they can just stop and leave everyone hanging and be hailed for doing so. I don't think that's clever. That's just a cop out."

","As the credits rolled on the screen, the audience sat in disbelief. Everyone was wondering what was the point of sitting for 2 hours in the cinema hall if all the questions that have been put up would remain unanswered. The movie begins on a good note, holds it tensions, suddenly it veers off its track and unexpectedly ends. You stress your brains to find if you had missed something which others didn't. But there is nothing. Things are as they are and you are condemned to be dissatisfied no matter how many questions you ask, how many reviews you read or how many times you watch the movie over and over.<br/><br/>I have seen Coen brother's work previously and liked it too. Blood Simple was an exceptional movie and so was Fargo. But I am sorry to say that this movie is not in the same league and not even close.<br/><br/>The cinematography is brilliant and landscapes have been beautifully captured. The actors do a fine job. But what is missing then??.. A story with so many loose ends. It is just not worth the hype.. So please spare yourself the agony and give it a skip."

","A strong cast can't disguise that the script fails to finish what starts out as a promising setup: a blue-collar worker stumbles on a huge stash of money that belongs to someone else. The owners want it back, creating a great game of cat and mouse with deliciously tense moments. <br/><br/>But about halfway through the film, the plot goes off the rails. The dialog takes bizarre tangents and aspires to be profound. Characters are introduced and developed, only to be forgotten or killed off. The viewer is left scratching his head.<br/><br/>And Tommy Lee Jones, one of the most promising characters, never enters the action. In fact he could have been cut from the film altogether, and it wouldn't have made a whit of difference to the story. Altogether, ""No Country"" is deeply unsatisfying.<br/><br/>It's as if the Coen brothers set out to make a tightly scripted thriller, then handed the reins to David Lynch halfway through, who makes a cryptic mess of the remainder, leaving the final chapter unresolved.<br/><br/>The blame, I feel, must fall on the source material. Author Cormac McCarthy's books are known for introducing fascinating characters and setting up wicked complications, then failing to resolve them. (Try reading ""All the Pretty Horses"") It's a shame, as the Coen brothers are among my favorite directors. I just wish they had chosen a different book to bring to the screen."

","I can't recommend this film, in fact it's hard for me to find a redeeming social value in it. I will grant that the acting and cinematography are very good; however, the story is empty and confusing. The central character Anton Chigurh is a stone-cold killer who asserts that life or death has no more meaning than the flip of a coin. The filmmakers have done a great job portraying this monster, but do not provide a satisfying resolution of the conflict between the 'good' characters and the 'evil' one. For all I can tell, the psychopath Anton Chigurh directed this film because it doesn't seem to care whether any of its characters lives or dies.<br/><br/>For some reason there are several long scenes of cowboy philosophizing by the pursuing sheriff and another old-timer, in a mumbling southern drawl. These seem to be an attempt to add some profound insight and meaning to this collage of pointless violence, but instead come off as sappy and boring. I was falling asleep.<br/><br/>I can understand some of the accolades for this film, because as I said it's technically well done.

","I've seen this film twice now and although I enjoyed and appreciated it the first time around, I was less forgiving about it after a second viewing. I personally think the Coen Brothers are brilliant filmmakers but No Country just doesn't work for me. First thing that bugs me is the folly of the films supposed primary theme; chance. Seriously, all the coin flipping is so blatant and un-subtle that surely it can't be what the film is about, can it? I've always found the Coen's work to be very refined, so to be bashed over the head with something so clichéd as a-man-flipping-a-coin-to-represent-chance just doesn't seem quite right for me.<br/><br/>Obviously, No Country isn't a bad film. Technically it's brilliant, in terms of cinematography; shot selection, lighting and framing everything on screen is impeccably done. Also, the acting is superb; Bardem's Chigurh is instantly iconic. Brolin's LIewelyn (surely a name that should be used more in movies) is strong but vulnerable, unapologetically simple, yet layered. Equally, Tommy Lee Jones's Ed Tom is an interesting and enigmatic character. However therein is one of the main problems I have with this film; the Ed Tom story thread just doesn't fit in this film; thematically and tonally it's at odds with the main story and all it does is succeed in giving the film a bloated feel. For me, it's a case of a good performance that has been added to the detriment of the rest of the film.<br/><br/>So what is No Country For Old Men about? It can't be about chance as that is too obvious. It can't be about getting old because it has so little to say. Is it about the insignificance of man off-set against the indeterminably powerful presence of nature and the relentless passage of time? Perhaps, but the Coen's have never been complex and pretentious just for the sake of being complex and pretentious.<br/><br/>I can appreciate the fact that No Country is a good film, well made with some great composite elements. However I don't feel it has the vibrancy of O Brother, Where Art Thou?, or the humour of Fargo, or the intelligence of Barton Fink. For me, this film is an un-satisfying mix of art house film-making and mainstream marketing, which benefits from great performances and an interesting central story but is damaged by poor choices in terms of muddled themes, sound design and the inclusion of an unnecessary sub-plot in what otherwise would have been a brilliant film."

","Yep -- that's exactly what I said when the film faded to black and started rolling the credits. The rest of the theater sat in shock and disbelief. I think I heard ""Is it over? It can't be over."" a few times. What a complete waste of $4.50 (we went to the matinée) and 2 hours of my time. So, apparently this movie was supposed to be ""deep"" and ""thought-provoking"" and the viewer was supposed to find ""hidden meanings"". There aren't any.....anyone who is giving this praise is just trying to find something good to say about it because they don't want to admit the fact that they wasted their money on a Coen brothers film. (but it's the Coen brothers -- it HAS to be good?!?!) It didn't have hidden meanings, it wasn't deep, and it didn't provoke any thoughts -- except one -- What the heck did I just watch? Loose ends, crazy plot jumps, and completely unnecessary scenes. If you haven't seen it yet, I urge you not to waste your time and money."
"firesights","9","18","37","20 November 2007"," An excruciatingly brilliant movie
","No Country for Old Men is a movie that will most likely flop in theaters. It is not the kind of flick you will hear people raving about (unless you have a lot of movie-addicts as friends) and flocking to the production in large numbers. It is not the kind of movie that most people will want to see over and over again. But this is also perhaps the precise reason why it is such a thrilling, fantastic film that will garner ridiculous adoration from a subset of viewers who don't like their action movies spoon fed to them by Hollywood with Will Smith delivering witty one-liners throughout. No Country for Old Men stands on its own as one of the finest action movies ever produced, though to call it simply an ""action"" movie drastically understates the ambitious reach of author Cormac McCarthy and producers Joel and Ethan Coen.<br/><br/>Set in the Southwestern United States, No Country is a story about Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), a hunter who finds $2 million in cash in a drug deal in the middle of the desert, with no one around to guard it except several decaying bodies. Being a poor man clutching to existence in a remote part of the country, he decides to keep the money and hope for the best. When Anton Chigurh, played unsettlingly by Javier Bardem, comes looking for the money, the entire plot becomes ""a mess,"" as Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) succinctly puts it. This movie is the opposite of a B-rate slaughterhouse of gore and torture. It chooses to seethe, to ooze tension and leave our imaginations to do the worst. Rather than club you over the head with grisly pictures, the machinations of the Coen brothers are carefully sculpted to extract the maximum amount of impact from each confrontation while keeping the gore to an essential minimum.<br/><br/>Part of what makes No Country so brilliant is how focused each scene appears to us, how they delight in the subtle nuances of character, portraying them as common individuals who are mostly clueless to deal with the changing forces around them. The austere humor of each individual echoes this, as they deliver their own guileless assessments of life and love, delivered in a Southwestern slang that many will mistake for a lack of wisdom. Yet each role here is superbly designed to beg for reflection, to ponder the choices they made, and to examine their own flaws and virtues. In short, every character means something to the plot, and the ramifications of what happens to them are always noticed and felt by the viewer. When one dies, it releases a torrent of emotion that will leave us feeling bereft of something substantial.<br/><br/>And that is perhaps the most significant departure from the typical movie of No Country for Old Men. The action scenes here are visceral, they are gripping, and they are well-designed, the same as many other films appearing this year in theaters. What is different here is intuition of the directors, who realize that silence in a gunfight can provide much more tension than a constant rain of bullets. The most unbearable moments in No Country are the seconds before the trigger is pulled, where life and death are temporarily suspended. After each confrontation, an audible gasp is almost necessary. This film is equally as unnerving because the next battle is always around the corner  if not with guns, then with words, and if not with words, with the idea of how to deal with death, life, and our past.<br/><br/>It is in these somber ruminations that No Country is saved from being a nihilistic retelling of fate. Without the distantly observant comments made by Tommy Lee Jones' character (Bell), the earnest method by which Moss (Brolin) moves through the scenes with an uneasy balance between fear and arrogance, or the chilling ideology of Chigurh (Bardem), this movie would have been another two hours of mindless bloodletting, as desolate as the landscape. Instead, No Country is full of choices, consequences, and the motives that drive us, a film that stands tall in a sea of much poorer clones. Even the ending, which may leave some scratching their head, and others angered, is as devastatingly stark and unapologetic as the rest of the production, offering no ""feel better"" pill, only the vague ideas of a desperate situation, and a person who has simply had enough. It is potentially the most unnerving quality in the entire film: The ending is simply too realistic for its own good, departing from underneath our conscience with only a few words to see us home. What is not spoken aloud is what makes No Country for Old Men a classic. Hard to watch, and easy to enjoy."

","I really really hate this film and I'm flabbergasted at the amount of alleged love for it. I still refuse to believe that some of these positive reviews here are legitimate. Still, maybe my expectations were skewed going in to it. I was expecting a ""Walking Tall"" meets ""Fargo"" movie, a quirky and intense tough guy crime drama that would leave me satisfied. This movie and especially its resolution are the least satisfying in recent memory.<br/><br/>I've read the elitist argument about deeper themes and beautiful cinematography but without a story to pull it all together, who cares? To me, a movie is primarily about character and story. Even great performances and direction can't save a bad concept or story. This story is ugly on paper and it's despicable on screen. Some of the spoilers have been disgusted here so, there's no need to rehash them. Needless to say, killing characters may haunt and disturb the viewer but it's cheap emotion that normal movie goers will resent. The piecemeal dialogue is also off putting. Every exchange seems to be a poor parody tribute to Pulp Fiction style of dialog. Tommy Lee Jones' character being the worst ""witty"" offender.<br/><br/>I guarantee you that word of mouth from average movie goers will be quite poor for this trash. The only good thing is that after, people will feel truly betrayed by the critical consensuses and praise for it. This will farther erode trust in opinions of the critics. Making critics even more useless is never a bad thing. When I see the TV commercials for Old Country and the quotes they use, I resent every word and every critic mentioned. After others waste time and effort with this movie, I won't be the only resentful one.<br/><br/>Terrible, terrible movie."
"cuthburt_jones","4","9","16","22 September 2008"," Would you be satisfied with a half cooked burger? No? Read on...
","Before I start i almost feel i should warn you that i am going to give the ending away, but don't worry because there isn't one! It is worth pointing out that this is not a fault of the film makers but 'Cormac McCarthy' the author of the book. But for the sake of this review i will refer to the film.<br/><br/>Bottom line of this film is that it has so much potential in having a profound resolution, but fails due to that fact that the counterintuitive ending just leaves everything un-concluded. There is no real resolutions to any of the problems that are developed throughout the film, except the fact that 'sometimes in life things don't work out'. Which is all very well, and indeed a good message to get across to the world, but you don't need a full feature length film to explain this obvious fact of life! One scene from the film would have been enough to explain this and then it could move on to something bigger and better like a conclusion or a real ending. <br/><br/>I heard this from a friend after i objected to the ending of the film: 'Oh i think its really clever - besides you just expect everything to conclude because you have been socially conditioned that way' Well, what ever he meant by that it, i can see how that may be true to some extent but that doesn't justify a cock-in-the-arse ending. Take this for an example if i go to MacDonalds i go there to buy a burger, and i expect it to be in a certain condition regardless of whether in reality its just homogenised shite that i only really like due to 'social conditioning'. Moreover what i don't expect is that when the cashier or chef gives me the burger it is half cooked (just enough so that the germs are killed), do i? No, of course not, should it be presented to me in this state and then excuse is given 'oh you are just socially conditioned to expect to be cooked the way it always has been previously', even from a friend, i would be entitled by this fatuous statement to ram it up his arse where it probably came from in the first place. <br/><br/>Most people are like 'oh its really clever' and i know for a fact half of them just say that because they don't understand that the point of the end of the film is that there is no point. I would go as far as underlining the key message of the film - a lack of meaning or point to anything or in other-words 'Nihilism'. The film makes it clear throughout with all its coin tosses, stumbling upon treasure, right-place-right-time wrong-place-wrong-time circumstances that the unforeseen circumstances are all by chance with no guidance by any higher authority just chance and human will. Of course this all fails miserable except for the 'evil' protagonist who succeeds (or so we are left to think). To me i think 'yeah i know the point is that there is no meaning, but i have wiped less meaning on to a piece of paper - its more satisfying too' <br/><br/>The film is thought provoking at best and thought destroying at worst. See it if you want to be left at the end going 'What? What? What? Is that it? i mean yeah i get it but... Come on!?'<br/><br/>Good points: <br/><br/>*Good use of music <br/><br/>*Keeps you interested (but so does any good con-artist) <br/><br/>*Good acting <br/><br/>*Philosophical undertones<br/><br/>Bad Points: <br/><br/>*Good interesting story ruined by (lack of) ending.<br/><br/>I gave it a four out of ten because regardless of 'social conditioning' i expect my burgers to be cooked when i buy one."

"paddy-2","5","12","23","29 January 2008"," hugely disappointing
","I deliberately avoided reading any reviews or seeing any clips of this film before seeing it, thinking that it would be nice to come to it completely fresh. I generally like a lot of what the Coen brothers do - Hudsucker Proxy and Fargo in particular. But I hated Miller's Crossing, and that should have warned me.<br/><br/>No Country got off to a bad start, in that the initial voice-over was almost completely incomprehensible to me. OK, I'm English, and maybe I find a deep Texan drawl as hard to understand as someone from Texas might find Glaswegian, but this just put me in a bad mood. If you've got a character who's got to impart some information, then please get him to open his damn mouth while he talks. Through the whole movie, people talked to each other in this glutinous mutter, and I just sat there rolling my eyes. CAN'T HEAR YOU! Fargo had people talking ""funny"", but at least you could understand what they were saying. So yes, maybe I missed some vital information.<br/><br/>As for the movie as a whole, well, there were good things - the landscapes, the photography, some neat protagonists, some good tense situations. I liked the lack of music, and the slow pace. But at the end of it all, it all added up to very little. A bunch of americana clichés - motel room, garage-owner, people driving around in cars, mute banal violence, sweet white-trash wife in a trailer, yeah yeah, seen it all before. It all started to feel like a mix and match style exercise.<br/><br/>I don't mind a bit existential alienation - Two Lane Blacktop and most of the films of Tarkovsky are among my personal favourites. But there was something pointless about this film. Terminator-style remorseless killer chases opportunist around, and lots of people die. Um. Old cop sees lots of dead people and gets a bit depressed, but is too lazy or stupid or filled with ennui to do much about it. Bad people wander out of the picture. The End.<br/><br/>Actually, the end was simply dreadful. I don't mind a sudden, strange, open ending. If the film ends like that, and the audience rocks back in their seats and you hear a massed intake of breath - well, that's one thing. But with the end of this movie I could sense a collective thought... ""Is that IT?!"""

","I would have given most of this movie a 7 or an 8, however, the ending is hands-down the worst I have seen, so I had to give it a lower score based on this alone since it really ruined the whole movie, rendering it completely pointless.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie, everybody in the theater was looking at their companions with confused looks on their faces, including myself. I didn't see anybody, nor can I imagine anybody coming out of the theater after watching this movie saying ""Wow, that was an awesome movie"". So all the 10/10 reviews that this movie is getting is beyond my understanding.<br/><br/>There isn't much dialog in this movie at all. The little dialog there is is incomprehensible, slack-jawed speech. You could put the whole movie on mute and it wouldn't make any difference to your understanding of the movie, which is a good thing since actions speak louder than words. But I doubt anybody will be getting a best actor nomination for their part in this movie.<br/><br/>Apart from that, 80-90% of the movie was somewhat entertaining. Nothing out of the ordinary. But the movie does make you wonder what's going to happen next. Woody Harrelson's character could have been left out completely though. He was there to confirm the seriousness of the situation, nothing more.<br/><br/>All in all, not a terrible movie. But I really wish they would have tested different endings. If they did, I would hate to know what the second choice was."

","'No Country for Old Men' does stay true to the tagline. We see midway through the film when Moss pays 500 dollar to buy a jacket to 'get away'. We see later on that Chigurh pays a large sum to a boy for his shirt after a possibly fatal accident. Being a fan of the Coens's movies, I was looking forward to this one. 'No Country for Old Men' is one of the darkest and most visceral films of the Coen brothers. One could argue that it has a lot more gore than 'Fargo'. However, this is no slasher flick with pointless excessive violence. It sticks to the main story without too many deviations (though some characters are pointless e.g. Carson Wells). It's got the Coen humour (which I very much enjoy) but I find it hard to compare to their other works. The use of camera-work and lack of colour and background score is effective. Actually it's pretty much got the ingredients of a great Coen movie. There are some brilliant performances. Javier Bardem is really menacing as Chigurh. The actor totally owns that character. I wonder why his role was recognized as supporting when the plot pretty much revolved around him. Kelly MacDonald brings a fresh contribution. The actress makes you forget her British origin and does full justice to the Texan Carla Jean Moss. Josh Brolin too gets a meaty role and the actor does an adequate job. Sadly, Tommy Lee Jones fails to impress and Woody Harrelson barely has a role of substance. Some of the dialogues are repetitive. To put it in one sentence, 'No Country for Old Men' is a dark unconventional movie about violence, murder, greed, escape, and destiny."
"bob the moo","Null","8","14","17 February 2008"," Meditative yet tense, funny yet terrifying (SPOILERS)
","While tracking a wounded animal to finish it off, Llewelyn Moss comes across the aftermath of a bloody shootout, seemingly of a drug deal gone terribly wrong. The drugs are still there but everyone is dead apart from one man who will be soon. Llewelyn finds the money and an attempted get-away only a few ridges away and keeps it. Later that night his conscience gets the better of him and he returns to check on the dying man. Unfortunately he is too late but this time he is noticed by those also looking for the money and he flees, leaving his truck behind. Knowing this will lead the criminals to him, Llewelyn packs his wife off to her mother's and he sets off with the money. Following in his wake however is an man sent to recover the money, Anton Chigurh, for whom ""evil"" is much more than a concept. Far behind both of them is aging sheriff Ed Tom Bell, who can only wonder at the daily violent outrages he has to witness.<br/><br/>Many others have already said it so I can only echo when I say that this is a real return to form for the Cohen brothers after a handful of amusing but yet not that good films including The Lady Killers, Intolerable Cruelty and so on. In something of a marriage made in heaven, the Cohens and author Cormac McCarthy have produced a great film out of what simply could have been a ""everyman dragged into job gone wrong"" thriller if it had been given to anyone else. It is impressive how they still work within this genre and produce more than expected while also still working effectively in the areas one would expect such a film to do. I have listened to those who claim it was boring and far too slow and I am afraid I just cannot really understand the point of view  far less agree with it. Likewise I have watched those leaving the cinema ten minutes from the end, I can only assume because with Llewelyn dead then the ""plot"" is closed for them and they might as well beat the traffic.<br/><br/>On the contrary, for me this film worked across so many levels that I cannot imagine leaving at any moment other than the end, and even then the film will stay around for longer than that. The slow pace never feels anything other than appropriate as it is either doing or of two things, or both. The opening and closing scenes are a fine example of how meditative it all is and this suits the pace. The film is thoughtful on the subject of violence and evil, with the title and the material questioning whether things are worse or just different (cleverly it is also set in the eighties). I found this fascinating even if I didn't understand all of it. Working alongside this is the constant tension associated with the main plot. It is unbearably tense at times and the slow pace only serves to heighten this and make the moments of sudden violence all the more impacting. With these two things working so well together I really had zero issue with the slow pace.<br/><br/>The Cohen's delivery is note perfect throughout with the characters and places being just that little bit quirky but not to the point where the violence or menace is affected in the slightest. They pace the material and perfectly balance the gripping with the thoughtful. I particularly liked the way that they handled scenes of violence  while thrilling, the viewer is never ""pumped up"" by them or excited but rather sickened or just plain deadened. It suits the material again and somehow seeing the casual aftermath of, for example, Carla's death, is so much more meaningful than seeing it occur. The cast respond well to this direction and turn in solid performances across the board. Brolin (who suddenly seems to be in everything) is a firm ""everyman"" character who we root for but not to the point where we lose the other two main characters. Jones is perfectly still and reflective and his ""good ol' boy"" mannerisms are underlain with an increasing sense of bewilderment and frustration that makes his scenes work so much better  which was important. The most impacting turn comes from Bardem, who simply personifies evil with a performance that made me want to edge away from him, far less the other characters. His scenes sparkle with menace and he represents everything that Jones' character worries over  even a simple scene in a garage is gripping due to his delivery and simple logic. Trainspotting's Macdonald gives a great performance and a great accent in her role, with a great scene late on. As per Cohen tradition, the smaller characters are amusingly quirky and fit the Texan world of small towns, with motel owners and so on all amusing in their (often fatal) interactions with the main players. Special mention for Harrelson who is so-so for much of it but is utterly convincing when he finds himself totally out of his depth in this world he tried to be in (his offer of $14k as telling as his reddening skin and panicked eyes).<br/><br/>At the end the tone is downbeat but for me it is fitting as we close as we opened, on a meditative slant, sending the audience away thinking. It is a quite remarkable film that manages to be thoughtful but yet unrelentingly tense producing quirky amusement in some scenes but never at the expense of the impact of the violence, which is terrifying offhand at times. No Country for Old Men stands above the recent output from the Cohen's and easily stands alongside their greatest work such as Blood Simple, Fargo and so on."

There's pace, intrigue, excitement and large dollops of uncompromising gore and some moments of genuine tension. All the hallmarks of a great movie. The the cracks soon begin appear and suddenly, the cracks are so wide, elements of the movie and some characters fall right through them. The sinister Anton becomes almost supernatural in his ability to defy the law.<br/><br/>It's not the law, well represented by Tommy Lee Jones, that Anton escapes from, it's the laws of physics: For every reaction there's an equal and opposite reaction, except in Antons world, with his crazy, cumbersome 'swiss army knife' of a weapon. Is there anything Anton can't do with that thing ? Speaking of weapons what's up with the the silencer that didn't .. Silence ? Why wouldn't a burst of sub machine gun fire be heard in one motel but be heard half a block away by in another motel ? Why does Llewelyn ... oh, never mind, after that shock the movie is all but over.<br/><br/>Avoiding the obvious ending was probably the worst idea ever. We were robbed !

In the world of Coen brothers the events occur out of blue, without any rhymes or reasons, and even without following the laws of probability. The killer always wins, kills indiscriminately and gets away with it. He is a ""loose canon"" yet has so much knowledge and brilliance that can spot everyone and anything at any time.<br/><br/>On the other side, the law enforcer is lame, tired and always at the verge of giving up.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the Coen brothers enjoying a ride on an industry with enormous experience in special effects and transform their imagination to a movie with powerful and shocking scenes which can be confused with reality.<br/><br/>Doesn't it sound familiar? one of the famous neo-conservatives in defense of Iraq War said ""we have come to the point that we make the reality, and you journalists (here critics) will follow after to analyze it and while you are doing so we are making another reality.<br/><br/>The ideology of Coen brothers is the ideology of Empire."

"act_of_bob","9","7","12","17 March 2009"," No Room for Platitudes
","This film really gripped me, but not in any spectacular way, more for the un/ethical values that often creep through the film at quite inopportune times. Despite the violence -although credibly a restrained use of foul-language- the film cannot really be said to be brutal, and instead examines the sinful natures of two men, who both mete out the seven equally, and never really balance the moral with the ethical value of life over the pursuit of death; instead they pursue their own agendas without regard to society or the law. By the close of the film it could equally be argued the law is culpable in sharing the pie of sin.<br/><br/>Another intriguing element is that none of the main protagonists actually meet face-to-face, despite the cat and mouse battle between Bardem and Brolin. This may reflect the changing state of crime in the US, at least on film. In classic cowboy film the two protagonists would ultimately end face to face, or be overwhelmed by the forces of good and admonished from our conscience. But in NCFOM the law in the shape of Tommy Lee Jones is reduced to an ineffective theologian mulling over the changing nature of society in the face of law, and as such most of the revealing discourse comes through Jones.<br/><br/>There are subtle elements to the film that carry the tale beyond the end, and often cause you to view the film to reason the logic for such simple elements such as when both characters desperately seek to purchase a shirt to evade a critical moment. All of which proves Joel and Ethan Cohen are becoming incredible talents in Hollywood, and their determination to do something new with script often translates into intriguing and dramatic film."

"DaveDiggler","10","10","19","28 March 2008"," Mans Misfortunes Always Leaves a Trail
","""No Country for Old Men"" has it all. It's a chase film, but it's also subdued with symbolism and subtly. The acting is top notch and everybody has heard of Javier Bardem' great performance, but I think the real standout comes from Josh Brolin- in a career year- as Llewelyn Moss. Tom Lee Jones gives a powerhouse performance in subtly which only fits the nature and the tone of the film. Kelly McDonald is fantastic as Llewelyn' wife. When those two share a scene we really get a great understanding of their relationship in just a few moments here and there. Woody Haralson will remind you why he's an actor with a very good performance as a bounty hunter.<br/><br/>The film starts and ends with Tommy Lee Jones' character, Ed Tom Bell. He has been a Sheriff since he was 25 years old with a history of lawmen dating back to his grandfather. Late in his career and late in life Ed Tom struggles with his past, future and legacy. He always questions whether or not the old timers would be proud of him because he's not proud of himself. He feels as if the world is changing; the violence is changing; man is changing and he can't keep up anymore. He's being passed by, by the younger man much like his dream with his younger father. Ed Tom is slowing down and the people he's chasing are moving faster until they stop and start a fire. Only then does he catch up. Once he get's there he knows he'll face something he doesn't understand and he'll have to put his motto at risk: ""I always knew you had to be willing to die to even do this job. But, I don't want to push my chips forward and go out and meet something I don't understand."" The evil he chases is cunning, smart, dark, and almost invisible until the final moments where fate steps in and delivers what's coming.<br/><br/>As Bell is the focus of the film, Anton Chigurh, is the driving force in the film. His evil is destructive, it's overwhelming, it's senseless, and it's the fate of a coin toss. Anton' evil is best shown in a gas station scene where he subtly threatens the life of a gas station proprietor. The dialogue in the scene is incredible and it's the Coen' at their best. After the gas station proprietor infuriates Chigurh, because of his stupid questions, Anton decides to let fate step in and settle the dispute in a coin toss. As he crinkles up a candy wrapper, and lets it go, it becomes out of the hands of Chigurh. Fate has stepped in and the coin that has been traveling for 22 years is now here and that will decide whether the man lives or dies. It's his call and its either heads or tails. Chigurh can't call it for him, but he is his fate since he and the coin arrived at the same time. Chigurh simply doesn't care what the result is, but there has to be a result. Another great scene which shows Chigurh' Grim Reaper like evil is where one man watches another man die right in front of him at the hands of Chigurh. The man absurdly asks; ""Are you going to kill me?"" and Chigurh turns around and looks right into his eyes with a grin on his face and responds with an absurd question of his own, ""Do you see me?"" Moss is a simple man. A Vietnam War veteran. A man with a determination to find a way out of the life he currently inhabits as greed and fortune take over his fate. He tries to run. He tries to get away and live happily ever after and he believes he will even after he is ""immobilized"" by a gun shot wound from Chigurh. Like any person, Moss follows mans evil on a hunting trip as he tracks down the blood trail of a wounded dog. He follows the trail back and finds a slaughtering and Mexican Drug deal gone horribly wrong. Moss finds a man in need of water and he tells him he ""ain't got no water."" He smartly figures out there has to be money somewhere and figures one man was left and ran off. So he searches out for the ""last man standing,"" leaving the other man dying of thirst. Moss comes to a shade tree and through his eyes we can see a figure next to the tree. He waits for movement, and then he walks to the tree and finds a dead man with a satchel full of money. His fate doesn't involve a coin toss, but rather a satchel full of money and a transponder. This will bring Chigurh to Moss.<br/><br/>The films end will leave viewers dissatisfied because the final act of the film is quite different than the first two acts. The final act isn't shot in the vast, empty hot lands of western Texas, but in an urbanized environment in the city. This goes well with the change of Bell' character. The terrain is not his costume. It's not his country. The final act is fast paced unlike the first two. There are no horses. There are more than pistols- machine guns. The violence is no longer shown. It's shown through a spilt milk bowl or Chigurh checking his boots. The violence takes a backstage seat where the first two acts are loaded with violence pushing on excessive. As the film unravels like the candy wrapper, Bell's fate steps in. He goes back to the big crime scene. He sees and knows what's on the other side of that door. He knows he is putting his soul at hazard. He's pushing his chips to the middle of the table and he enters in the face of evil where fate takes over."

","A huge fan of their early work and pretending that the last few films they made didn't happen I had high expectations for Joel and Ethan Coen's latest project. Based on the Cormac McCarthy novel 'No Country' is a return to form for the sibling filmmakers or at least it is for the first hour and a half. What starts off with some amazing cinematography and a Tommy Lee Jones voice-over boils over into a frenzied chase movie that has genuine tension running through its every pore and then sadly it doesn't really have an ending and all the good things that have come before seem somewhat spoilt. Javier Bardem is amazingly creepy as sociopath Anton Chigurh, his hair nearly as bizarre as his favourite method of killing, every line he delivers is unnerving and yet you hang off his every word. Josh Brolin Is great as Llewelyn Moss the Welder turned wanted man after he stumbles across a drug deal gone wrong and steals a case full of money so he and his wife can start a new life. Cue every man and his dog, literally, after Moss from cops to Mexicans and of course Nutcase extraordinaire Anton. There is very little screen time for either Lee Jones or Harrelson and if you blink you could be forgiven for missing either of their performances. There are some beautiful shots, some great lines and a fitting score but it is by no means perfect which is a shame. But for the most part the Coen's flourishes can be seen and there is nearly as much tension and suspense as there is blood but with such a strange ending and so many loose ends like not actually telling the viewer what happened or why I feel they still have some way to go to regain former glories, but this is at least a start."
"PWNYCNY","3","10","19","14 December 2007"," After watching this movie, I can't blame the sheriff for wanting to retire.
","There is a saying: a movie is only as good as its ending, which makes this movie not bad, but certainly not that good. It's as if the creators of this movie had decided that they would try to out-do The Mist for the worst ending of an otherwise interesting movie for the year 2007. Also, this movie brings to mind another good movie, The Last King of Scotland, in that how ""Scotland"" shows how a murdering tyrannical dictator isn't such a bad guy, ""No Country"" tries to make the same case for a serial murderer who systematically murders only bad guys. I guess tyrannical dictators and serial killers have their stories too. When trying to dramatize the behavior of seriously mentally deranged persons, such as serial killers, Hollywood sometimes does a good job. Case in point: Taxi Driver, which offers a compelling story about a troubled young man who kills. In Cold Blood is another excellent movie of that genre. This movie does not even come close to those movies in terms of quality or storytelling. Tommy Lee Jones is lost in this movie. He is entirely miscast. The actor who plays the main protagonist, the psychopath who goes around killing, gives a great performance as long as he does not talk, which is not his fault because the dialog is weak. Nevertheles, the movie does have its fascinating features and is watchable but with one caveat: be prepared for is just one weak ending. <br/><br/>One other point: This movie portrays law enforcement has being easily duped and completely ineffective despite the presence of massive evidence that provides an almost inexhaustible supply of solid leads. What's even more ridiculous is the portrayal of the sheriff as being practically the only law enforcement agent involved in this case when in reality such a high-profile case, involving multiple murders of foreign nationals along or near a border, would have a virtual army of federal, state, county and local officials assigned to it. They'd being practically fighting each other over who would have final jurisdictional authority. But these kind of facts do not necessarily make for good fiction, so there's one sheriff - that's it - trying to deal with a serial killer, and this sheriff is planning to retire! Can you blame him? Yeah ... right. Duh. <br/><br/>Here's another take on this movie. Maybe this movie is Hollywood's way of portraying the plight of the seriously mentally ill with violent dispositions. Remember, friends, this is Hollywood that we're talking about, not some mental health organization, and if Hollywood thinks something will sell, it will play it up to the hilt. No subject, no matter how sensitive, is off limits, and it seems that with this movie, Hollywood has decided that ""mental illness"" is in. Of course, once Hollywood gets a hold of the subject the powers-that-be, using literary license, will transform that subject into something that is almost totally unrecognizable from the original subject. In the case of ""mental illness"", Hollywood portrays it as something sinister, uncontrollable and a threat to society. Now if this sells, then who's to complain? Then again, it may be appropriate if the movie includes this proviso: ""Any depictions of mental illness in this movie may not conform with actual facts."""

","This movie is pretty much self-indulgent garbage. The story is very contrived and silly. Why would the guy who found the money go back to the scene of the crime, knowing that all hell would be breaking loose by the bad guys and cops? Yet this folly is the crux of the plot, because his return enables the bad guy to get on the chase. The bad guy, Chigurh, is a bad remake of many nut-killers of the past. Indestructible no matter what, with a stupid grin on his face all the time, and omniscient in knowing all, seeing all. A cartoon villain. A lot of Llewelyn's decisions and actions can be seen as stupid, but these were necessary to keep it going. So, in the end, who cares? They say there are 5 basic movie plots, and this one, the chase, is very common. So common, in fact, that NCFOM turns out empty and shallow. I guess the makers feel that, since this is an art film, they can just throw anything on the screen, and we're supposed to appreciate it like it was a piece of modern art hanging on a wall. That's OK, but who stares at a piece of meaningless shapes and colors for the time this movie ran? What are the Coens going to do next time?

","As I sat in the theatre, about halfway through No Country for Old Men, I distinctly remember whispering to the person next to me this was Oscar gold. Little did I know that he was asleep. If nothing else, it just goes to show how peoples tastes vary, but I cannot imagine how anyone could fall asleep. This is a film that gets you hooked from scene one, and right until the ending, it is steeped in suspense, black humour, great direction and acting and it ain't afraid to get its hands dirty.<br/><br/>Based on Cormack McCarthy's novel, No Country for Old Men dictates one simple truth. There is evil in the world, there always has been and there always will be. The previous generation of crime fighters including Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) are no match for a new generation of criminals, at the start of a new decade (the eighties). One such criminal is Anton Chigurth, who kills people with a pneumatic air gun. This strange fella is going after two million dollars in drug money which has been stolen by Llewelyn Moss. He is an ordinary Texan who just happens to stumble upon the after math of a drug deal gone wrong in the middle of the desert. He finds the money, and tries to figure out how to get him and his wife clear and safe. Meanwhile, the Mexican drug dealers, The Law, and Chigurth are all coming after him.<br/><br/>It is all the little details in the film which are what contribute to its high quality. I'll give you a great example. No Country for Old Men, is sucked almost completely dry of music. In one or two scenes, there is a very soft synthesizer drone, but the silence is far more potent. Alfred Hitchcock with the Birds was the last time I saw a music-free feature film.<br/><br/>No Country for Old Men is not for the soft of heart, or the squeamish, but it will be embraced by anyone and everyone who can appreciate great cinema. Though unfortunately it is not a very popular movie (or at least it wasn't when it came out), I have a feeling No Country for Old Men will age well."
"rcstinebaugh","6","6","10","30 March 2009"," Way way overrated
","This movie is a very good example of why I don't watch the academy awards. There is no way this is award material. The first hour and forty five minutes were entertaining and nicely shot. It was shot mostly in New Mexico, where I grew up, and to be honest anything shot there shows well because of the beautiful vistas and contrasting landscapes. So the movie gets little credit for that. This first part of the movie is mostly the bad guy meeting people and you are just wondering, will he kill them or not. Not much of a character or plot development scheme. Tommy Lee Jones character seems sort of like an afterthought. And how unrealistic is the fact that people are getting killed all over the place, automatic gunfire is erupting in hotel rooms and in the streets, and there are no cops or other law enforcement agencies involved except some old sheriff from Texas. The final 15 or 20 minutes are really what suck. It is almost as though the brothers were ordered to make the movie about 2 hours in length so they just plastered in random stuff (the car crash, what the heck was that?) and then tried to finally develop Tommy Lee's character.<br/><br/>This is what is wrong the the Oscars. Maybe I need to read the book."

","I love the works of the Coen's body of work. I love that in their careers they have managed to create films that are almost polar opposites from their previous works. They always craft fantastic stories with great characters..<br/><br/>Which is why No Country is disappointing as hell.<br/><br/>The story is all over the place, the Tommy Lee Jone's sheriff is basically useless, and the build to what seemed to be the eventual showdown between Bardem and Brolin's character is turned sideways and thrown out the window for some pseudo philosophical BS..<br/><br/>This movie is in the same vein of Burn After Reading, a movie that's really about nothing.. Except Burn After Reading was far better at being a movie about nothing.<br/><br/>In the end, this movie did nothing but anger me to no end. It built up so well, only to drop out about 3/4 in."
"mpreves","8","6","10","7 August 2008"," Reflecting current trends in America's consciousness
","One common thread running through roasts of this film is that it betrays viewers out of a satisfying ending. Critics moan about the supposed trite nature of the plot, which for them only boils down to glamorized bloodlust. There is nearly an equal amount of rah-rah rhetoric.<br/><br/>This film disappoints or confuses shallow movie-goers while wowing sycophants because of who America is in 2007/2008. We are divided between those who refuse to find ingenuity in anything unconventional on the one hand, and those who gush with joy over any social critique on the other.<br/><br/>Ironically, the movie itself reflects precisely those fears and frustrations, as well as our culture's celebration of egotistical courage and insanity.<br/><br/>Tommy Lee is the embodiment of the fears of a dying generation that is overwhelmed by the deluge of changes taking place in the world, mostly criminal in kind. His ultimate resignation reflects the threadbare nature of those who have become so paralyzed by the futility of doing good in today's world that they succumb to their desperation and bow out. <br/><br/>He is of the generation that is flummoxed by the ambiguous nature of morality in our present culture. He spends plenty of scenes commenting on brutal events in 1980 and how perplexing they are. The viewer is supposed to agree, feel dazed themselves, and to imagine how much worse things must be now. <br/><br/>Does he have his regrets about not engaging the wickedness? Of course. But he sees that it would be as silly as putting Sugar Ray Robinson while suffering from diabetes and Alzheimer's, who is said to have once ""embodied the essence of the sweet science"", in the ring with the ear-biting thug Mike Tyson at his violent peak. <br/><br/>The sheriff is factually outmatched and knows it, Whereas his Uncle, because of his hubris, ran head-on into destruction. In fact, every victim in this film seems to be taken by surprise by the tidal wave of unscrupulousness that pummels them. Though ashamed, this sheriff is more self-actualized than any idealists. <br/><br/>One dark side of our culture is seen in the blind greed of the hero. We're supposed to ask ourselves why we hope he gets away with it, why we desire that he beat the insane villain in a showdown. Unreflective Americans don't. They just want Brodin to kill the ""bad guy"" and get away with the money. Doesn't it matter that it's drug money? The one-dimensional person is being criticized for his double-standards, which the Coens know they will be employing upon viewing this. Why are most of the angry critics of this film so betrayed by an off-screen resolution of such a questionable hero? Instead of wondering about our feelings of betrayal, the spiritual bankruptcy of our society consumes us. We are merely angered that we didn't at least get to see him go down with a fight. <br/><br/>But note that our hero is a Viet Nam vet. He represents a generation of idealists who end up hospitalized and cheated out of their stand off. Though skillful and tough as hell, the spirit of the Viet Nam soldier was ultimately crushed, because he never got to face an identifiable enemy. We made them bleed a little in Nam, but the ghost-like enemy just stitched itself back up. So we lost our focus, became disorganized and intoxicated. <br/><br/>Harrelson's character is similar, yet at another level. He's no underdog VN Vet. He represents the hubris of shrewd underworld gophers entangled by greed. He and those who hired him get what they deserve: a brief introduction, moment of fame, speedy trials & executions.<br/><br/>The psychotic killer in the movie simply reflects what our country and culture is trying to process at present. He is 9/11, every tsunami, earthquake, hurricane, the L.A. riots, and an amalgam of Jeffrey Dahmer, Ted Bundy and the Iceman all balled up into one.<br/><br/>He's insane, it seems. But is his killing indiscriminate? Or is there some perverted rhyme and reason to it? He reminds me of the grim reaper, who comes and goes, exacting judgment on those who dare toy with Â– or even moralize over - the forces empowering him. <br/><br/>Insane, wrathful, yet determined destruction is what he embodies. Why stand in the path of a tornado? You'd have to be colossally dumb, have your own death wish or simply be self-righteous, proud and angry yourself to do so. Which is why most of those who meet him bite it.<br/><br/>Still, one reaps what one sows. The motto the villain lives by punishes him all the same: freak car accident. <br/><br/>But evil, although slowed by injury, somehow feels unstoppable in today's world. The villain meanders off. What chief device does ruthlessness use to distract witnesses? Bribery. Blinded by their greed, two boys in one scene no longer care about what they've witnessed or what it might mean. They are shown tugging on a hundred dollar bill.<br/><br/>The Coens show us these uncomfortable truths about ourselves and about our violent, greedy society in a crisp, harsh way. The set feels and looks beautifully gritty, the characters are believably dumb, greedy, proud, violent and exhausted. It's an interesting movie that relies much on Hitchcock-style suspense and cinematography.<br/><br/>The only reason I'd give it an 8+ instead of a nine or ten is that I am annoyed when street shoot-outs do not attract attention. A number of car crashes and gunfights are lengthy enough to have drawn some kind of crowd but don't, whereas when necessary (rag in gas tank in front of pharmacy), they do. <br/><br/>Aside from these insignificant annoyances, the content and tension in this film is well-placed enough so that anyone in their right mind would be able to see what this film is saying, why it is almost ""important"" and how it received the accolades that it did."

","I saw the trailer for this film while i was at the movies with a group of friends recently and the violence in that deterred everyone else in the group from going to see it. However i've always been a bit of a Coen brothers fan and i'd read the great reviews this movie has garnered and i was determined to overcome my general squeamishness in the face of unrelenting violence so i went to see it on my own. As it turned out the cinema was full of people most of whom i guess had read the same reviews as me. Or perhaps they'd decided to escape the unrelenting Adelaide heat by spending a few hours in the tranquility of an air-conditioned cinema. I have to say at the end that I think there was a general air of disappointment from everyone in the movie theatre. I'm still trying to figure out exactly what Tommy Lee Jones role IS in this movie. He could have been left out altogether and it would make no difference at all to the film. The ending where he describes his dream sequence is a terrible letdown. How many people enjoy listening to someone describe their dreams?Its about as interesting cinematically as it is in real life. When he finished I think everyone was hoping that this wasn't going to be the end of the movie...and then the credits began to roll. The movie does contain some wonderful quirky dialogue and some great acting from Javier Bardem. There are suspenseful moments while Josh Brolin in on the run and this is no formula driven plot where you can tell what is going to happen from one moment to the next. What it lacks is a coherent narrative and a sense of conclusion. Or is there a ""No country for old men 2"" in the offing?"

","I know it means I'm an unsophisticated dope, but I think the resolution of this movie makes the case why they don't make movie endings like this. I'm fine with movies that leave things undone and I don't need happy endings. But I'm very annoyed at the way we are brought into caring about Josh Brolin and they knock him off like that. I don't mind that he was killed, I mind that it came off like he walked off the set and they didn't have any ideas about how to kill him so they put a stand-in in the hotel room.<br/><br/>But mostly, I am getting fairly annoyed with Joel and Ethan inserting themselves into every camera shot like a couple of smug UCLA film grad students. You are always aware of them trying to show how much they know about film making. It's just tedious. <br/><br/>Really seems like an overrated film."

I can't imagine Miramax will team up with these hucksters again after realizing poor box office. Yes, the critics liked the film and so do most on this board, but were they watching the same flick as me? I damn near fell asleep from boredom and, in fact, missed the ""big moment"" during Tommy Lee Jones' pathetic soliloquy that ends ""and then I woke up."" I woke up when the credits began to roll, wondering where was the music that Carter Burwell or somesuch got credit for, where was the logic of not knowing what happened to the money, who was chasing who, why it was necessary to keep the body count rolling, where were the feds, what did Ed Tom ever do in the movie that resembled efforts of a genuine law enforcement officer, how did Woody Harrelson manage to find Moss in 3 hours, how did Anton escape at the end, ad nauseum.<br/><br/>A wasted 9 bucks.

Tommy Lee Jones was on his way to a good film and then the script failed him and he just rolled over, so I guess he needed the money. I like Tommy Lee but this was his worst effort. The best acting in this otherwise awful movie was the baddest of the bad guys who is an actor most of us have not seen before. Javier Bardem's character will make you want to sleep with a loaded shotgun in your bed tonight. Overall the movie started out with basically good underpinnings.... and kept you interested for almost 2 hours.... and then it all fell apart in the last 5 minutes. An absolutely horrible ending. I only hope that Javier Bardem is out looking for the Coens so he can blast them like his other targets! The story builds suspense and characters and then it is like the Cohens ran out of production money, ideas, talent and interest... all at the same time.

","This film has been greatly overrated. Just think, how many films have involved a person inadvertently coming across drug money (or any other maguffin) and has been chased those seeking it. e.g. A Simple Plan. Concedingly the film is suspenseful because of the marvelous stoic performance by Javier Bardem, but otherwise it is pure formula film-making. It could have easily been an 1870 Texas western or a 1980s slasher movie. I certainly admire the Coen brothers talent, particularly Blood Simple and Fargo, but this film is nothing original. So, please step back an view the film in relation to dozens of other films involving the same plot line or moral message (if any) and re-evaluate it."
"vasaro-1","1","11","22","8 July 2008"," Not worth your time, nor an Academy Award, nor ANY award. A waste of time.
","Fortunately, I borrowed this disc (Blu-Ray) from a friend. Many of us use that common rating system: Is it worth seeing at the theater, or wait until it comes out on disc and rent it? Thankfully I didn't pay anything to see this movie because that's what it was worth. Bottom line, don't waste your time; it's VERY unfulfilling.<br/><br/>I don't have any faith in the Academy Awards choosing best picture any longer. It seems that they had to give it to something, so why not this? I generally enjoy Tommy Lee Jones's acting, but for him to portray a Texas sheriff isn't much of a stretch at all; he's practically been typecast (US Marshalls, The Fugitive, etc). He's just older and more tired in this movie.<br/><br/>The movie meanders along showing us senseless killings by the antagonist using a cattle gun and a shotgun with an enormous (uh, movie blunder) brushed nickel silencer (shotgun silencers are not very effective, and only cut the VERY loud noise by about 5-6 dB). The protagonists' character development never takes place, and we're supposed to sympathize with the older sheriff's bleak perspective of the country, senseless brutality, and futility of justice all from his monologue at the opening of the film and a few short scenes a few friends or his wife. It doesn't happen.<br/><br/>Without giving anything away, the ending will probably leave you questioning: ""What, that's it?"" You might sit there staring blankly at the screen (as many people did after Blair Witch Project) wondering what just happened and how it could have ended that way, but thankful that it's finally over.<br/><br/>This movie was entirely over-rated, and is the perfect example of people thinking it's good simply because they've been told by others that it's a work of art and is good. Instead of behaving like mindless sheep, they should speak their own opinions rather than parrot the views of others and simply state: this movie was dismal. It was just plain bad. Many have said there is fine cinematography... if setting a camera up to shoot the wide Texas landscape is fine cinematography, then any idiot with a panoramic movie camera must be an incredible DP (Directory of Photography). The subject and location do NOT make fine cinematography. Lighting, focal length, aspect ratio, and filtering in addition to camera angle and movement are used to determine fine cinematography (and ""mood"") such as shown in The Godfather in the opening scene."

I lived in west Texas and Traveled New Mexico extensively so I was able to spot NM location quickly, even then the camera work and acting had me convinced I was in Texas throughout.<br/><br/>I found myself confused when the film blurred the lines of the characters, as Tommy Lee Jones and his character play a tired, regretful sheriff who realizes his sins are catching up to him, and the villain played by Javier Bardem who is ever so cold and calculated but has impeccable ethics and is anything but dishonest. You are sure to enjoy this wild ride and find yourself engrossed by the well developed characters and realistic action and typical Coen suspense and story telling.<br/><br/>Watch this film not once but two or three times. I plan to watch it again soon and I am sure I will enjoy it even more."

"blanche-2","10","5","8","16 December 2013"," The Coen Brothers strike again
","Joel and Ethan Coen know how to tell a story -- sometimes its meaning is obscure, sometimes it's in your face, but it's always fascinating.<br/><br/>In the obscure category is ""No Country for Old Men,"" from 2007, starring Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, Woody Harrelson, and Barry Corbin.<br/><br/>What I'm going to write next will mystify many. In a funny way, this film reminded me of Psycho. Here's why - in Psycho, we're led to believe that it's a story about a woman who steals money from her employer. Then she stops at the Bates Motel, and the story changes.<br/><br/>Same deal here. This starts off as a story of a man who steals money he finds at a drug deal gone wrong, and we believe we're watching him trying to escape the man chasing him. Turns out the movie isn't really about that.<br/><br/>In Texas in 1980, Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) discovers the scene of a drug deal gone terribly wrong - the ground is peppered with dead bodies. Also laying around unattended is 2 million dollars, which Moss takes.<br/><br/>As a result, a man named Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) is after him. Chigurh kills just about anybody who crosses his path. Moss is on the run, and Chigurh is close behind every step of the way.<br/><br/>The sheriff, Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), has become discouraged by the evil in the world and his helplessness in the face of it. Nevertheless, he tries to beat Chigurh to Moss, all the while realizing the job has just about burned him out. It is, in fact, no country for old men.<br/><br/>The film is symbolic of evil in human form (Chigurh) coming up against a decent man (Moss) and how it brings about his ruin. Moss' ego and arrogance make him think he can overcome Chigurh's pure evil. His innate goodness compels him to return with water for the one dying drug dealer at the scene, putting Chigurh on his trail when he finds his truck. Temptation, as in the Garden of Eden, can lead to ruin.<br/><br/>All the men involved in the story -- Chigurh, Moss, Bell, and an old man whom Bell visits, Ellis - are all fatalists. Moral weakness allows the gods to wreak havoc. Llewellyn brings his fate on himself, and the fate can't be stopped. And so much that happens seems to happen by chance, as the result of a coin toss -- for someone like Bell, looking for meaning, there is no meaning to be found.<br/><br/>The Coen Brothers take the western genre and turn it on its boots - we don't witness some of the deaths, and we don't witness the classic good versus evil fight. With Sheriff Bell's retirement, it seems that we are to conclude that evil wins. But the Coen Brothers leave us with hope, as long as we don't depend on mankind for it. Like Bell's dream about his father going ahead and starting a fire for him, the hope is outside of ourselves and our world. As we've seen in court cases, there is no getting of justice in this world. At the end of his dream, Bell says, ""I woke up,"" as we all must.<br/><br/>A remarkable film by remarkable filmmakers, demanding multiple viewings."
"MrOllie","4","5","8","19 August 2011"," Not a total disaster !!
","This film had some interesting and exciting moments - but should never have been an Oscar winner. There are simply too many silly happenings or in a lot of cases no happenings at all. Overall, there are three main characters in this film i.e., Chigurh(the killer played by Javier Bardem))Moss (the red-neck who steals the money- played by Josh Brolin) and Ed Tom Bell (The Sheriff - played by Tommy Lee Jones). It starts with the psycho killer (Chigurh) being arrested and handcuffed by a young policeman. The policeman takes him to the police station, sits him down on a chair, and then foolishly turns his back on him and makes a telephone call. The killer with amazing dexterity and all the skills of an expert Escapologist manages to contort his body so that his hands and handcuffs are not behind his back anymore but in front of his stomach. The policeman is then garroted with great aplomb by Chiqurh. The killer (who is trying to locate a bag with $2 million dollars in it stolen by Moss the red-neck) then goes on to kill many other people and to blow out door locks with either a cattle stun gun which is powered by a large oxygen cylinder, or a rifle with the biggest silencer you will ever see. Surely, therefore, someone will soon spot this madman and his oxygen cylinder and inform the army of police, who you assume by now must be hunting him. But No - because incredibly the only person looking for him is Sheriff Ed Tom Bell who spends most of his time delivering long rambling monologues or reading newspapers. So of course the Sheriff never finds Chiqurh and because he is getting old and despairing of the modern world, retires. In the meantime, the other main character Moss (played by Josh Brolin)had stumbled upon an ill-fated drug deal and finds many dead bodies. One of the gang is still only just alive and asks for water but Moss cannot help him. Moss eventually finds a case with 2 million dollars inside it. Hence the reason Chiqurh is looking for him. He takes said case and goes back to his wife, they eventually go to bed but for some strange reason he gets up in the middle of the night and returns to the scene of the drug massacre carrying a bottle of water,presumably for the injured drug dealer who by now must be dead anyway. A rather daft thing to do. The film rambles on with a brief appearance from Woody Harrelson who wears a large hat but does nothing else. This film has it's moments and is not a complete disaster but, overall, it is confusing and rather silly with a truly appalling ending."
"Ziya90","10","5","8","17 February 2010"," I don't exchange it for 1000 Fargo
","There a lot of people who hate the movie, not just disliked, they hate! Look at reviews or visit the forums, you will see. Art house movies are unconventional generally, but for No Country for Old Men is not an art house film, but it is not a blockbuster too. It is both, I mean artistic and at the same time entertaining. I know that the people who hate it would not call it entertainment, because they were not entertained. Then, why haters hate this movie? Because it is not a crowd pleaser? Well, firstly, they say that the movie was very dull, very very slow paced. If you ask me, the time flies by, I did not get bored at all. I was hypnotized, mesmerized. By the way, do you know what is one of the most frustrating things about this movie for me? Some people say this is inferior in comparison with Fargo or Blood Simple. I watched both movies and I am really sorry, but I enjoyed both movies, both are must- see experiences, but they are, Fargo, Blood Simple were just good movies to me, no more than that. A critics says that cinema feeling in There will be Blood was more strong than No Country for Old Men. How funny, I liked There will be Blood very much, but think just the opposite. The cinema of Old Men is more powerful than There will be Blood. Old Men is pure cinema. Another critic says that I would not call the movie masterpiece, because ultimately, a man pursues another man, this is the story. Well, this was what I wanted anyway, but also this is just the surface. The directors don't use background music (unconventional), I loved that, but this is the second complaint as I see. It makes the movie dull according to the haters. It causes me hypnotized. Many people like noisy, fast movies, this is the fact, isn't it? but why? Was Casablanca noisy or fast? No. Then, is it a movie to be hated? As for Javier Bardem, his performance, acting is appreciated even by the haters, otherwise I would kill myself anyway. Joking aside, you will think that I exaggerate, but no, to me, his performance, acting is one of the best ones of all time and his character is one of the best villains so far too. What Day Lewis is in There will be Blood, Bardem is in No Country for Old Men. A superhuman performance. Just by one scene, it can be understood. In one of the most disturbing scenes, even if off screen, I mean his last visit, after that, in the car, look at his face! It tells a lot of things. The opening scene of the movie is one of the greatest opening scenes ever made! In terms of content, it is horrible, in terms of cinema, it is great. In this scene, Bardem is at one of the zeniths of his performance by the way. To watch this character, Anton Chigurh was very entertaining, very interesting, sometimes funny and sometimes evil, horrible. One of the reasons that I love the movie is this, I mean, The Brothers created a great character, to be more precise, they adapted the character in a perfectionist way from the novel. As for Chigurh's weapons, forbidding, horrible, weird, but also inventive. I knew Josh Brolin by this movie, I can't remember him in The Goonies, I watched it when I was a child but. Therefore, I liked the actor very much including his character. After that I watched him in American Gangster and he was great in that movie. In this movie, he is in Bardem's shadow, but still does a great job. He was an interesting character too. On average, how many favorite scenes you have in a movie? No Country for Old Men is an exception for me, because if I count my favorite scenes, it makes almost the whole movie. All the scenes Bardem appears are my favorites once. I will mention some of them. The scene that he tries to find the bag by the device, the scene that he carries out first aid to himself (this scene also tells somethings about the personality of the character, he is really a psychopath, he seems panicked, he cares about himself, his health very much), the scene that he makes a sudden attack to the hotel, again a horrible, but in terms of direction, a fresh, great scene. I had not been on pins and needles like that in another movie. There are several reasons for that. For example, Anton Chigurh is like T-1000 from The Terminator 2. In some moments, I said to myself that's it! or something like that in theater. Now do you understand why I love that? As for the sheriff (our bonus Tommy Lee Jones), the first sheriff character on screen who is unwilling to solve the cases, catch the bad guys (unconventional and brilliant) And, as the third complaint, a few unexpected twists that take place near the final. It might be unsatisfying, but it was realistic and shocking. Everything does not work out the way we expect it will."

","""No Country for Old Men"" isn't a hard movie to enjoy. Not the the acclaimed Oscar-Winning filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen (Fargo, O Brother Where Art Thou ?, Raising Arizona) certainly rise to the occasion with this intriguing film that won Four Academy Awards... including Best Picture, Best Director(s), and Best Supporting Actor (Javier Bardem).<br/><br/>An Ordinary Man by the name of Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) finds his way into a bloody crime scene. He sees a couple of dead bodies, a dead dog and a pickup full of heroin. But Llewelyn also discover two million dollars that he couldn't resist. But a cold blooded killer named Anton Chirugh (Bardem) follows the trail of West Texas to find the money. Now it's a game of Cat and Mouse, which Llewelyn tries to outsmart Chriugh to no success. A decided sheriff named Ed Tom Bell (Oscar-Winner Tommy Lee Jones) finds himself caught in the middle.<br/><br/>Directed Joel and Ethan Coen, who also wrote the Oscar-Winning adaptation from the Pulitzer Prize Author Cormac McCarthy (All the Pretty Horses, The Road). The Coen Brothers made an highly watchable film, it has atmospheric Texas landscapes, realistic settings, incredible suspense, clever touches of black comedy, tightly edited (Which the Coen Brothers won another Oscar but they used a pseudonym for editing the movie) and Bardem's scene-stealing performance as a psychopath murderer makes this movie... a must see.<br/><br/>The Production Values are used strongly here, especially Roger Deakins' widescreen cinematography (He received an Oscar nomination for his work) and the rate use of no music score in the movie (expect only in the credits) makes this picture extremely tense by using only sound effects by giving the feature more credit. Anyone who enjoys thrillers will be not disappointed.<br/><br/>The actors are top notch here... Jones' gives an quiet good performance as a West Texas Sheriff, who doesn't like the way civilization is crumbling (Which the film's title would make sense to his character). Brolin is very good as the man will do anything to keep his irresistible two million dollars. Bardem is outstanding here, he gives one of the most coldest killers in film history (Not to mention his character name Anton Chigurh is certainly memorable). Kelly MacDonald is fine as Moss' worried wife, Carla Jean. Woody Harrelson has a few scenes as a hired hit-men to kill Chigurh and find the money. Stephen Root (Best known for doing the voice of Bill in the animated series ""King of the Hill"") plays a mysterious rich drug runner, who tries to rip-off Chigurh. Garret Dillahunt (Just recently played Krug in the remake of ""The Last House on the Left"") gives the movie some comic relief as a inexperienced sheriff.<br/><br/>Although i never read the novel. This is a solid motion picture with hair-raising suspense, it has a sense of humor and a strong cast. I wasn't surprise, when this movie won the top categories at the Academy Awards. This was one of the most critically acclaimed features of 2007. It is a movie, i would watch every year. But i think, it was close being a masterpiece (Which are truly rare in today's cinema). I felt the only fault in the movie is in the end, when Bell recently retired from being the sheriff. He sits quietly in the kitchen table with his wife (Tess Harper). He tells two stories about him as a boy, he found lost money that was given by his late father. The other story that his father rode past him on a snowy mountain pass, going ahead to make a fire in the surrounding cold darkness. Whenever Bell got there, he knew his father would be waiting... then he woke up. I felt the conclusion ended abruptly. I remember seeing that movie with an audience, they were certainly confused. But i wasn't and i thought that wasn't really the right way to end a terrific movie like this, that's the only flaw in it.<br/><br/>The DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The DVD also includes three featurettes. Overall ""No Country for Old Men"" is a excellent movie. I haven't seen this much suspense handed so genuinely like this before. It is certainly the most straightforward film coming from the Coen Brothers. Which they are known for their bizarre original comedies.

","I read a comment before from an IMDb member who gave this movie a 1-rating out of 10. This member stated that he/she loved the style of this film, but did not understand the purpose of this movie. I respect this members opinion greatly and I understand his/her poor rating. This movie may require some, if not most, viewers to take the time and watch it a second time, making sure that they watch and listen to every single thing that occurs throughout this feature. Even then one might come up with a different feeling or understanding of the movie. For me, it all revolved around Tommy Lee Jones' character, Sheriff Ed Tom Bell.<br/><br/>The movie begins with a voice-over. Bell, whose grandfather and father were both sheriff's, recounts how in the old days a Sheriff did not carry a weapon. One day, Bell arrested a man who killed a 14 year old girl. Bell recounts that his man told him that he had been planning on killing and if he were turned loose, he would kill again because he knew he was going to hell. Sheriff Bell sets the tone by telling us how these kinds of actions, ""a crime of passion,"" as its referred to in the movie, would not have occurred in the ""old days"".<br/><br/>The body, or middle of the movie, displays one man, Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), come across upwards of $2 million dollars in cash, a stack of drugs (heroin, cocaine..?), and a slew of men massacred in what appears to be a drug-deal-gone-bad. Instead of reporting this to the police, Moss decides to keep the money and leave the scene unreported. Then there is Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a psychopathic hit-man searching for, and killing anyone he encounters, the missing $2 million. These two characters, i believe, represent what Ed Tom Bell is referring to at the beginning of the movie. One mans lust for money, Moss, gets him into trouble with an insensitive and psychopathic killer, Chigurh. Its a bleak statement of where this world is heading, and Bell just can't keep up with it.<br/><br/>Much like this film begins, it ends with Ed Tom Bell telling his wife about a dream he had the previous night. In this dream, Bell recounts, his father riding horseback into the darkness and disappearing. Bell believes that his father was fixing a fire to keep warm in the cold mountains. Following in his fathers trails, Bell would get to his father and then wake up from his dream. This symbolized, i believe, how Bell so wants to go to his father, who represents the ""old days"", and is anguished by the state of the world as it is today and is it will become in the future."

","Movies that stimulate plenty of discussion about whether they are good or bad or awful are probably movies that should be seen more than once. I had that feeling after seeing films like '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.' Not much really happens in those movies and they have a lengthy runtime. Kubrick's film has 88 minutes of no dialog. That's like making a feature length film and not having any spoken dialog, and by today's standards (even 1968 standards) that is odd. The Coen Brothers' latest film has that quality to it. Not a whole lot happens for large parts of the film.<br/><br/>The fact of the matter is that not a whole SEEMS to happen. Take one of the opening scenes as Llewelyn sees the man sitting underneath the tree. He looks at him, nothing. He looks again, nothing. He moves in closer, rifle trained, nothing. He sees the man has bled. The bag next to the dead body has money, a lot of money. So he takes it. Aesthtically, not much happens as Llewelyn just warily approaches the tree. Mentally, however, is where the action is. Llewelyn is part afraid, part curious, but being cautious enough to keep his wits and try not to get killed. Obviously from the previous scene we see that the money in question is a hot item and a good deal of people died for it.<br/><br/>In today's special effects drenched age people seem to have completely forgotten what real tension and suspense is. It is not a huge wall of fire (a la 'Independence Day') coming at you, but what is going through your head when you see that wall of fire coming. With this film, the Coens have put the tension in an intentionally bare landscape in order to show as little aesthetic flair as possible. This amplifies the psychological impact and suspense as there seems to be nowhere for Llewelyn to hide from a killer who also seems to appear from nowhere. Call it a MacGuffin technique or whatever floats your boat.<br/><br/>The film is also highly more symbolic than the typical movie of today. Many things are implied, not actually shown. Much of the dialog and situations are allegorical (or applicable) to things much more general than a search for dirty money. Thus, this isn't a film solely for entertainment, which is what people want today (many people, not all). This is a film that first and foremost attempts to stimulate thought like '2001' and 'The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.' The abundant discussion here about whether it was good or bad or boring or pointless pretty much seems to confirm just that. People are talking about it. Whether it is out of frustration of praise is almost incidental, since it only confirms that the Coens achieved their goal. Maybe soon we'll see a director(s) make an actual film in response to this one. That is what living art is all about - it acts and reacts, just like its characters. --- 9/10<br/><br/>Rated R for violence. Ages 13+"

","we follow Josh Brolin's character ""Llewelyn Moss"" through the entire movie, most of the time on the Run from Anton Chigurh, and that was fantastic, real thrilling action. But when Tommy Lee Jones finally catches up with Moss we find him lying dead on the floor killed by the Mexicans, which we don't see, that to me was a big letdown of the movie, that we don't get to see the confrontation / killing, the whole movie was building up to that conclusion and we don't get to see it, what a rip. Next we have Woody Harrelson a great actor getting such a small insignificant part, I was hoping to see a strong confrontation when he comes up against Anton, but what do we get, a bit of chatting and then Anton kills him. Then finally a dreadful ending which i wont even bother commenting on as it was total crap. And guess what, I bet it will win The Best Fim Oscar to boot. Javier Bardem deserves to get the best supporting Oscar as he was brilliant."

"stowbury","6","8","15","31 January 2008"," Thin material padded out with over-familiar Coen gimmicks
","We've seen all this before and didn't really need to see it again. The ingredients in terms of the characters are very similar to Fargo - 1. Ruthless psychopathic killer(s), 2. Ordinary guy with bad motives getting into something over his head, 3. A good-hearted cop, outwardly unimpressive and seemingly impotent in the face of the evil thuggery let loose in the neighbourhood but clever and wise, trying to piece together what's going on and prevent tragedy. The story this time around however is thin and over-familiar - an obsessive vengeful quest, a duel between hunter and hunted that occupies most of the film. The characters too are dull in comparison to their Fargo counterparts. Despite the trademark style and quirky flourishes this is by and large a plodding, predictable exercise in ritualistic machismo. I didn't really care who got killed and when. It is not a masterpiece or even a return to form. The best moment was early on when the old almost retired sheriff and his young sidekick survey the bloody aftermath of a criminal deal gone wrong and exchange banter in theorising about what happened. Instead of developing the younger cop's part the scriptwriter casts it aside half-way through and with it goes much of the interest in the older cop too. The trail of violence runs its course and some empty banalities uttered by the world-weary lawman that pass for significant wisdom bring the proceedings to a close."

","The Coen Bros. have had their heyday long before the release of No Country for Old Men. Had they left the 90's burnt out, it would've been completely understandable. But 10 years ago, they crafted an ingenious comeback by making perhaps the most convincing, powerful film about pure evil in history. No Country for Old Men is one of the greatest films ever made.. but you already knew that. I'm sort of late to catching up to this one and I regret it entirely. Visually speaking, it captures the darkness of our world in ways no film has ever been capable of. In terms of acting, it absolutely soars. Broiln and Jones are incredible. Javier Bardem is terrifying as Anton. He eats at your soul. As far as films that depict serial killers, this is as real as it gets. Right down to his weapon of choice, an air-powered captive bolt gun. The savagery is what gets me the most.<br/><br/>No Country for Old Men explains to us in no uncertain terms how malicious and conniving humanity can be. What's even better is the fact that movies like these aren't rare to come by. They've been made time and again. The Coens just decided to make one more. Bless them for it."

"videorama-759-859391","9","3","4","4 February 2015"," A movie that's all country which rocks and rolls
","This is a thoroughly entertaining movie you must put on your bucket list, with one of the most scariest performances from a great actor you'll ever see. The Coen Brothers have done it again with a great structured story. Although the plot is nothing new, it's the way this story is told, only enhanced by the great performance of Bardem as a psychotic contract killer, and I really mean psychotic. Escaping from police, he's after a suitcase of cash, in the wake of a drug buy that's gone wrong, out there in the country, that's left a score of guys dead. Unfortunately, but more unfortunate for Brolin, he's found the money and taken off with it, which again shows stolen moolah is blood moolah. This engrossing film from start to finish has it all, including some great comedy moments, one a trademark one, worth all it's amount in coin. There are some other great performances, notably, Tommy Lee Jones as a cynical and aging old sheriff. The scenes with him are gold, proving he's one of the greatest actors out there. Kelly Macdonald is really good as Brolin's nagging wife, who I must admit, I didn't realize at first. The ending is pretty grim, where seeing bones broken like in the Straw Dogs remake, makes me squirm a little. Too, for the viewer, nearing it's end, a ""Did he shoot her or not"" moment, which would of left a few movie goers ruminating, moments after seeing it. I believe the Coen brothers are incapable of making a bad movie, where to me, nothing they've done would score lower than an 8. This is one of those films, which I secretly refer to as movie candy. I could watch many times, and never be bored. Even the title is great, in a can't take your eyes off the screen movie. One criticism though was how Brolin was able to outrun that pick up truck of bad dudes, after he returned with that canteen of water, but hey all is forgiven. A must watch for everybody."

","I read some if the reviews that hated this movie. They all complained there was no story. I can't believe they missed it. The only thing I can say is the movie tells the ""story"" as it was written in the book. I think for many the fact that there's unresolved conflict is what causes them to feel there's no story. I saw the movie in the theater and was so moved by it I had to read the book which is even better than the movie. The movie and the book are very unconventional. Carmac McCarthy has a style of writing that's elusive and heavy with symbolism and that's told in a manner that makes it feel common place and real. His setting is Texas and his characters are everyday people from the region. <br/><br/>There was one reviewer who didn't understand the story and his questions were clearly explained. Maybe he stepped away at some point and missed some important scenes in the movie. <br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie, watch it. It's incredibly disturbing. More of a horror movie than a crime drama. Years later I can watch this movie and still be blown away by the simplicity and deep emotional impact of the story."
"andy-933-696608","9","3","4","15 November 2013"," You know how this is going to end?
","The film's poster is both captivating and dark to the extent that each face represents a hardened entity within its own representation. With the face of Tommy Lee Jones in his always wise and powerful presence, comes the wisdom of a warrior who seeks justice in a world filled with malice and destruction. Brolin's face gives a similar feeling, with some wisdom, but stubborn determination. Bardem's face is haunting and yet intriguing, as it gives off the feeling of incomprehensible force beyond human conception, and that is exactly what his character Anton Chigurh stands as. In their first attempt, and it is a successful one indeed, the Coen's have delivered a faithful and brutal depiction of Cormac McCarthy's book of the same name, as they return to the darker psychological roots that first spawned their Neo Noir debut, Blood Simple. No Country for Old Men although dawned with the usual Coen Brother's humor, has very little hope to go on as it borders around a world that McCarthy knows all too well, apathetic, deteriorating ,and absent of God.<br/><br/>Through the calm, but tired out narration of Jone's Sheriff Bell, we are introduced to the wasteland he believes West Texas has become. In his father's time, police officers never carried a gun. They didn't need to, and in fact back then people use to address one another as Sir or Madam. Bell draws his sorrow and uncertainty from a world that is slowly changing, and becoming more deprived of the integrity his father, his grandfather, and their father's believed in when they sought to uphold the law. Aside from a barren dry wilderness, morality has forsaken the land that the wise lawman can't understand the cruelty and the indifference of this jungle as murder, rape, and sadism keep coming and going as if they were cherished past times. Bell's contemplation of this indifferent universe further comes at the revelation of his latest endeavor, as he searches for justice, despite what little faith he holds for the concept.<br/><br/>Upon the sight of drug deal gone wrong, Lewlyn Moss (Brolin), a Vietnam vet, with little to say, takes a case of two million. After a mild and sarcastic conversation with his spunky wife, Carla Jean (Macdonald) he returns to the sight of the crime. Little does he know that his little scavenger hunt has set him in the sights of hit man Anton Chigurh (Bardem). Chigurh, or sugar, to humor Moss's Sarcasm, comes off as vastly different than the more typical movie villain. His insanity and his cunning patience are not anything new to bask in the captivating performance Javier Bardem gives in this Machiavellian entity. With Anton's dreading eyes and the cryptic language Bardem captures a haunting and mysterious presence, beyond his own dark nature. Critics along with an assortment of scholars have praised this character in their interpretation, delineating on his persona, labeling Chigurh as the devil, the grim reaper, an agent of God, and many other forces that represent an unstoppable force of judgment. There is one scene where Anton confronts a store clerk with a coin toss after hearing him make a stupid and ignorant remark. Chigurh tells him to call heads or tails, saying that only he has the right to, and when asked what's at stake, his only answer is ""Everything"". After the coin lands on heads, Chigurh cynically congratulates what might have been his next victim, but due to fate he feels an even greater desire to abide by the laws of chance, than to slaughter mindlessly. It could be said that he is neither man nor monster, thus making it difficult for him to be killed, despite Lewyln's resourcefulness.<br/><br/>In the course of this film, as the cat and mouse game between Moss and Chigurh plays out with brutal bloodshed on both sides, Sheriff Bell tracks Moss, encountering one clue after another, finding very little truth if any in this enigmatic game of good and evil. The film's ending, not to give any spoilers, is neither about resolution nor despair, as little of the film offers hope, it is more of an insight towards humankind's struggle for survival, and comprehension. In our post 9/11 world, our hostility has grown drastically to the point where our own outlooks on morality has constantly been re-evaluated. Torture has been used as a means of acquiring information, and war has been given a religious manner of patriotism, deluding the masses into believing that our enemies are not human, but subhuman. The Coen brothers present these questions in the post-Vietnam era, mostly through the existential perplex ion Bell contemplates, and the tactical survival skills of Moss and Chigurh. The characters in No Country for Old Men carry with them a uniqueness that grants them a greater intuition into the world they inhabit, thus transcending the more oddly comedic aspects you see in a character within a Coen Brother's film.<br/><br/>No Country for Old Men, as a thriller, and as an examination into the human condition is horrifying, yet equally intriguing within its presentation. It explores an ever changing world, as people become more violent and more hostile within their desire to survive, by whatever means, motives, or for what they justify as reasons. Several quotes by a former deputy played by Barry Corbin sums up for Bell all that we can ever expect in a world where the question of God's existence, although mysterious, seems meaningless at this point. ""What you got, ain't nothing new. You can't stop what's coming."" It seems that we've reached a point where words as such can no longer hit us like a lightning bolt. Our immunity is due to the very violence we've become accustomed to, and the very hope we have lost in the world that as we grow older becomes more and more alien to us."
"l_rawjalaurence","9","3","4","9 November 2013"," Quirky Anti-Western Chase Film
","Based on the Cormac McCarthy novel, NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MAN is quite simply a joy to watch, as it continually frustrates our expectations of what kind of movie it is expected to be. Set in Texas, New Mexico and Mexico itself, it is a western that isn't a western; a chase film in which bad guy Anton Chigurh (Javier Badem) pursues Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), while being himself pursued by Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones). One of those chases is resolved; the other is left hanging in the air. The film builds up a fair amount of suspense, as we wonder whether Chigurh and Bell are going to get their men, yet the Coen Brothers continually combine that suspense with an eye for telling detail, or the inclusion of quirky sequences designed to show the futility of the entire quest theme. One of my favorite quirky sequences takes place in a dirty roadside motel, where the camera cuts to a sign outside saying (""HBO Available""). The whole notion of cable television in this kind of motel seems particularly incongruous. The performances are simply brilliant: Bardem doesn't have a lot to say, but communicates everything through telling glances. By contrast Brolin seems more laid back, despite the fact that he is being continually pursued. Jones goes through the motions of ensuring that justice should be done, but seems to be looking for a quiet life all the time. It is significant that the dramatic tension slackens somewhat during his sequences. NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is the kind of movie that befits repeated viewings in order to uncover its subtleties. A true modern classic."

That's ""No Country for Old Men "", with humans and a nowadays western, and arguably the best work of Joel and Ethan Coen .... the Coens!

Suddenly finds himself being hunted by the pure evil that is the character Anton Chigurh (Javier Barden) a violent persecution from Texas to the Mexican border. And behind them, Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) in search of Anton and somehow protect Llewelyn. Most intriguing in this persecution is that the three characters never interact, just chase between them, which increases every second.<br/><br/>The Coen once again surpassed themselves, not only were super loyal Cormac McCarthy's novel, but took your stuff to a new level. ""No Country"" has a dark tone and a really scary cat-and-rat persecution through the vast modern western that brings many kills and whiles much suspense. The three characters never interact in the film; one is always one step after another, getting much more electrifying and frightening.<br/><br/>But even with the dark tone, the Coens have managed to make the film strangely fun, the little black humor of the Coens (even in small amounts) is present here. Not only is the tiny humor that make's the movie really fun to watch, but is full of intriguing dialogs and very interesting to listen to, the Coens have never been good at writing on his films. But not only is the partnership of the two brothers in the screenplay that stands out but also the direction. The film manages to have action sequences filmed in a greater perfection and style, the two Coens working behind the camera is delightful to watch.<br/><br/>The cast also not left behind, both Tommy and Josh are perfect in their roles, but Javier is fantastic in every detail, her character is so mean and cruel and at the same time, very intriguing. He is the wild cat whatever grease, money Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee's old dog who wants to do ""justice"".<br/><br/>The Coen brothers were overcome by presenting a film written and performed in a fantastic way, a story full of suspense and a final electrifying message as in every movie of the Coens, while in ""Fargo"" it was about the lack of decency and respect for human beings , ""No Country for Old Men"" takes us back to the lack of honor that our society suffers today, and how respectful and honorable are our ancestors. A modern Western that manages to be the definitive masterpiece of Coen, totally recommended!"
"Hey_Sweden","8","3","4","9 February 2013"," What's the most money you ever lost on a coin toss?
","Opinions do look to be sharply divided on this typically interesting effort for the Coen brothers. Some hail it a masterpiece, others don't see the appeal at all. While this viewer doesn't quite fit into the former camp, he will say that it's one of the more unconventional examples of crime fiction that one is likely to see. It's much more of a character piece than anything, with some grisly scenes of violence here and there. Based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy, it centres around three characters, one being a poor hunter named Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), who one day stumbles into the aftermath of some drug deal gone horribly wrong. He finds $2 million on the scene and impulsively decides to keep the money for himself, while a mysterious, creepy, sadistic stranger named Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) tracks him down, porting a unique pressurized air weapon. Somewhat involved is a weary Texas sheriff, Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), who's unsettled by what he sees as the changing times. Now, granted, what's going to test the patience of some of the viewers are some of the monologues; this isn't for people who want a straightforward story and who are turned off by philosophical musings. One can hardly fail to notice how low key most of this narrative is; even in the more intense scenes there's never really a sense of urgency. On the plus side, what we do get are some excellent character moments from the solid star trio of Brolin, Bardem, and Jones. The supporting cast is equally impressive - Woody Harrelson, Kelly Macdonald, Garret Dillahunt, Tess Harper, Barry Corbin, Stephen Root, and Beth Grant. The Coens work with some of their reliable prior collaborators such as composer Carter Burwell and cinematographer Roger Deakins. All things considered, ""No Country for Old Men"" may not be to all tastes, and does require some patience on the part of the viewer. It also doesn't resolve itself in the way one might expect for this genre, and might prove to be less than satisfactory in this regard for some of those watching. There's one fantastic confrontation near the end, but the film closes, curiously enough, after a monologue by Bell about a dream he's had. How much or how little all of this works will be up to the individual viewer. In any event, the actors are all fantastic, especially Bardem, and they make the journey worthwhile. Eight out of 10."

","This is actually one of the best book adaptions ever. It's almost impossible to tell a story accurately with such little dialogues and without a narrator voice, but the Coen brothers accomplished it fantastically. A perfect cast till minor roles and Javier Bardem makes one of the best film villains of all time! The style of the film is absolutely unique and the mixture of western, thriller and satire is excellent. The ending is realistic and leaves a couple of questions open, which makes you think a lot about the film afterwards. Everything seems sophisticated, even how scenes succeed on one another and that's what is so fantastic about this movie. Everything that happens in No Country For Old Men keeps your eyes peeled on the TV screen, even if it's just normal dialogue. I.e. the showdown between Chigurh and Moss, which is one of the most thrilling scenes I've seen lately or the Chigurh's conversation with the gas station proprietor which is absolutely awesome. The screenplay, the direction and Javier Bardem totally deserved the Oscar. There were better movies in 2006 but this flick is a very favorable tale about bad people that is both confusing and stunning."

"TheFamilyBerzurcher","9","3","4","8 June 2012"," The Dismal Tide
","No Country for Old Men is a faithful adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel. It was impossible to foresee such a remarkable fusion of genius between the Coen's and McCarthy. Both harness a proud idiomatic style, but down to the weird rhythms and pregnant pauses the two form one of the great literary/cinematic matches in recent memory. Perhaps long-term memory. The Coen's precise ambiguities blend perfectly with McCarthy's ability to fill one conversation between two strangers with the wisdom of the world. Especially in Tommy Lee Jones's monologues, we hear a type of earnest realism — somehow simultaneously so contrived and so faithful to our imaginations.<br/><br/>The denizens of No Country are not interested in us. They don't want to be our friends. Anton Chigurh is at once an animal and a god. He is on a mission seemingly more powerful than even he. And the mission is a spiritual one. There is a scene inside of a gas station that, not unexpectedly, pits old against young. The elderly clerk cannot come close to understanding Chigurh's deranged existentialism. Like many of the other scenes in the film, this one seems to hold the mysteries of the film — presenting an incomprehensible and unstoppable force with simultaneous belief and disbelief in mysticism. ""It will become just another coin which it is.""<br/><br/>We are trapped into accepting Llewelyn Moss as our hero. We meet him looking through his own scope and endure a regular cycle of point-of-view shots until his death. Indeed, this is what makes his death so unbelievable. So frustrating, even. Some have complained about the offscreen death of our hero but we are never meant to see him die. We are led through a gripping, near-silent chase for 60 minutes — always aware of the sheriff lagging behind. Just as he is allowed to engage in the chase, we assume his point of view. One step behind the rest. Like the sheriff, Llewelyn is a man who understands the operations and mysteries of the land but cannot comprehend the ghosts. This is what makes them old.<br/><br/>One character calls it ""The Dismal Tide"" of youth coming in. We are meant to think of Chigurh and his final scene. He is a ghost, capable of enduring all. However, it is right to call it a ""Tide."" For the tides come in and go out regardless of our small plans. Youth force out the old regardless of theirs. But it isn't even that simple. Not only can the old not comprehend the young — they were once the young themselves.<br/><br/>The Coen's have presented a complicated perspective on their interpretation of the film's style. Thus, a flurry of nonsense has been written about No Country. However, it is impossible to deny the influences of silent Westerns, Sam Peckinpah, and Hitch. Hitch would have been proud of the Coen's and their astonishing mastery of editing to serve suspense. There are long chase sequences. Twenty to thirty minutes of minimal dialogue. But you never look away. The cuts are so specific. They are more than motivated. They're somehow essential. The impressive thing here is not the silence, it's the fact that you'll never notice if you're not listening. When characters do talk, their dialogue seems to drop away just when we least expect and least desire but always at the perfect time. Visually, it is impossible to deny Peckinpah's eye on the West. Horizon's are mostly in the middle of the frame, unlike Ford and Mann. Things are arid and empty. No Country harnesses the old idea of the West that has been lost on my generation — the existence of a place populated by another side of the human spirit; castaways, ghosts, gods, and prostitutes. The landscape isn't one that crushes or waits. It's merely the place where the coin is flipped and fate is decided.<br/><br/>What ultimately lends No Country with enduring greatness is its overarching simplicity. The Coen's are always looking back and revisiting formal structures. Consider how the plot breaks down — Good Guy finds Money. Bad Guy hunts Good Guy. The states are clear and so are the roles. These characters might be archetypes, but they inhabit a separate realm. Only something so simple can harvest the contradictions of humanity. Only in creating these timeless, ghostly creatures can we see so deep into ourselves. The film is a triumph of the highest order.<br/><br/>93.8"

","No Country For Old Men starts out as a traditional Western: beautiful cinematography, funny accents, cowboy hats, Mexican drug cartels, satchels of money, the works. We have our good guy, down-on-his luck sharpshooter Llewelyn Moss who finds the money, and we have our bad guy, raging maniacal psychopath Anton Chigurh who is chasing after him. Now before you go ahead and say, ""I know where this is going,"" you can stop right in your tracks because you don't. You can and never will know where this is going until you see the movie. Now to all those nay-sayers out there, calling this film petty names and making fun of it. While I respect your opinion, you must look beyond the surface of this film into its deeper meanings and implications. No movie is perfect (I personally think this one is, but that's just an opinion), but you are criticizing the length of a shot or a technique one character uses, all of the little things, while important, are no reason to give a movie a one or a two. Looking beyond the surface, one can find many hidden themes to this movie. One is about the nature of violence, an age old theme that dates back to Biblical times. Ed Tom Bell, the local sheriff, opens up the story talking about how the older sheriffs didn't even carry guns. Then, you meet Anton Chigurh, the reason behind Bell's decision to wear one. Chigurh strangles a man with his handcuffs, and kills many others with a silenced SPAS-12. His very presence is intimidating, his actions are unclear and ambiguous, and his face expresses no emotion. He is the perfect villain. Finally, you have Llewelyn Moss, who is, arguably, the main character of our story. He kills exactly like Chigurh: he shoots beings that he believes are inferior to him. However, he doesn't shoot blindly; he takes his time, lines up his shot, processes his thoughts, then shoots at an animal (he misses anyway). The only other time he tries to kill is out of self- defense when Chigurh is attacking him. Chigurh represents the unnecessary violence: killing for pleasure, for sport, and killing beings of equal stature. Moss represents this to a much lesser degree: he never tries to kill humans for sport, but he kills animals for sport. Bell is pure goodness: he doesn't kill anyone on screen. He doesn't even try to. He talks about a death he enticed once, but that was only as a preventative measure against more death. You also have the relationship between the hunter and the hunted. Everyone plays both characters in this film. Chigurh is hunting Moss, and is always hunted by the police. Moss is hunted by Chigurh, the police, and his wife, but, in return, he hunts game and once goes after Chigurh. Bell is hunted by his conscience, but is also hunting Moss and Chigurh. There are so many other intricately laid details that point to many other global messages that there are too many to delve into. If you just want to watch this movie for the sake of watching it, please note: it is very gruesome, and it features one of the best villains in the history of filmmaking. Very few people will appreciate this movie, not because of its beginning, but because of its ending. The ending is very articulately planned to have complete and utter meaning in every camera movement. Focus on the ending, be warned of gruesomeness, and watch Javier Bardem give the performance of a lifetime. Go see No Country For Old Men."
"drqshadow-reviews","9","3","4","26 March 2012"," Brooding, Unusual and Completely Unforgettable
","I hadn't seen this since it was in cinemas, and found that it's even better than I'd remembered. It's a very unusually-paced film, with a lot of long silences, seemingly-innocuous conversations and dangling plot threads that don't ultimately lead anywhere. In many instances that could make for some infuriating viewing, but in the Coen brothers' hands it all somehow comes together into a master tapestry. The word of the day is suspense, an emotion the brothers have excelled at in the past, and No Country is a glorious example of it at play. The film's three protagonists, retiring sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), stone-cold killer Chigurh (a terrifying, star-making turn for Javier Bardem) and land-living cowboy Moss (Josh Brolin), never actually meet face-to-face but the wake of ripples left in their dueling pursuits is enough to power several movies' worth of rich, intriguing material. Sweaty, intense action walks lockstep with outstanding characterization, top-notch dialog and a hearty dose of respect for the novel. Like many Coen classics, it gets better with each subsequent viewing."

","OK simply a great film. The reason is it's deep metaphorical meaning in tone and atmosphere. I must warn people who view this film that you might have mixed feelings. The reason is simple. It's a complex movie. If you want to see a movie for just entertainment value then you are in the wrong place. It is entertaining to a point, but it's best to have an open mind. It is simply a metaphorical and symbolic film. It is a movie about strength. It reflects on audience's own strengths if they have it. It is violent and haunting.

","This movie is one of the best I have seen and it is all due to the psychological killer Anton Chigurh played by Javier Bardem. There is no real logic in his actions as he uses a coin in his decision making process (especially when he is going to kill somebody). He does this in a very cold way as if it is a matter of deciding in which restaurant am I going to eat today. This is something that I think gives him strength as he never doubts his actions, there is no second guessing. Of course this is a very sick individual. But there is a twist which I am not going to reveal here. Also the move hides a powerful message between the lines. For me it has a deep meaning when it comes to faith and chance. The character played by Tommy Lee Jones is also a powerful one."
"dmdavidsonhome-267-593710","10","3","4","3 February 2012"," One of the best films I have ever seen
","No Country for Old Men is one those rare films that I not only never tire of watching, but actually seems to improve with each viewing. I have found that some people have not taken the time to see it simply because of the violent content. What a great shame and pity that they would miss out on and deny themselves a truly marvelous viewing experience. I don't recall people staying away from The Godfather because of the violence. To me it is not the violence but the sense of menace and dread that makes No Country for Old Men such a tension-filled nail biter and a truly edge-of-your-seat film. Everyone I have talked to who has actually seen it used the words "" very tense"" and ""it kept me on the edge-of-my-seat"". Javier Bardem's ""Anton Chigurh"" is the greatest screen villain since ""Hannibal Lecter"". Tommy Lee Jones played a very understated character in ""Sheriff Ed Tom Bell"", who is the conscience of the film. Josh Brolin was also excellent and vastly underrated as ""Llewelyn Moss"", the hunter who unwittingly becomes the hunted. The lovely Scottish actress Kelly Macdonald is also great in an all-too-small role as ""Carla Jean Moss"" (""Llewelyn""'s wife). She does a flawless West Texas accent. Woody Harrelson is also superb as the somewhat mysterious ""Carson Wells"", who we never really learn a lot about. Gene Jones is so superb and so memorable as a country store proprietor in a truly unforgettable scene. The Coen Brothers did a splendid job of adapting the book to the big-screen and their casting of even the smallest roles was flawless. I would not recommend reading the book by Cormac McCarthy before watching the film, as it would spoil some of the film's surprises. However I found that the book did clear up some of the things that the film did not explain in full detail. A great film based on a great book. It has fast become one of my favorites and I always recommend it to everyone I know who hasn't seen it. And the film's Oscar-winning cinematography by Roger Deakins makes it well-worth getting the Blu-Ray version and watching it on a big screen. The harsh and inhospitable West Texas landscape makes for a stunning background. No Country for Old Men may not be a perfect film but it comes as close as any I have ever seen in my nearly 53-years."
"Wasp-12-21-11","8","3","4","31 January 2012"," An Impressive Modern Western
","The second cinematic outing from directing duo Joel and Ethan Coen, No Country For Old Men is a finely polished, ultra-violent Western-thriller that, despite a slow- burning pace full of extended monologues and seemingly random interludes, rewards patient viewers with edge-of- your-seat thrills, stunning cinematography and top-class acting, especially from Javier Bardem as the ruthless sociopathic hit-man, whose very presence in each scene will scare the living daylights out of each viewer. The underrated Josh Brolin is impressive as the Vietnam veteran who stumbles across a drug deal gone murderously wrong, while Tommy Lee Jones is exceptional as the policeman who overviews the case in its bloody entirety. Maybe not worthy of all the awards it received (particularly Best Picture/Director), but an intoxicating affair overall."
"plpregent","10","3","4","20 October 2011"," The Art of simplicity and using it in creating an experience rich in tension, thoughts, and cinematic awesomeness.
","Not many films accomplish what No Country For Old Men does. Coming from the Coen brothers, this slice of western-influenced, 80's style storytelling just flows in front of your eyes at a slow yet enigmatic pace, delivering a form of tension that you rarely get to see in films nowadays.<br/><br/>To your ears, this experience will seem very intense yet pretty minimal, especially in terms of music, which is pretty much absent from the ensemble, only to leave you with the calm sounds of the windy Texas desert, dry gun cockings, the brutal sound of Chigurh's infamous tank or silenced shotgun (doing bloody damage shown in all its graphic greatness!), among many, many others. Every footstep is a part of the experience, every gun shot sounds loud and lethal, every silence builds the tension, and the almost scientific pace of NCFOM.<br/><br/>Nowadays, music dictating how you should feel and crescendos on queue with the jump-off-your-seat moments is a common thing. Music being absent, you are left with your own nerves, and the incredible tension generated by Javier Bardem's character, one of the coldest-blooded human beings ever portrayed on film, period. What ensues is so effective and precise, it's both completely badass AND cinematically stunning.<br/><br/>You become quite worried about this poor kid, Moss, who's being ruthlessly chased by this complete psychopath who murders anyone stepping on his path without any visible kind of emotion. With basic yet brilliant subplots involving Moss' wife, the Mexican cartel, and an ageing sheriff losing control and confidence in this whole situation, this adaptation of Cormac MacCarthy's novel will simply blow your mind if you have the slightest interest in either western cinema, genuine writing and storytelling, or minimalist cinema.<br/><br/>Hell, whatever your favourite genre is, if you're not expecting Transformers or some other MTV-style blockbuster and have a minimal interest in auteur cinema, No Country For Old Men's experience will exceed any of your expectations.<br/><br/>Now, what I previously called a ''subplot'' is, in fact, the whole core of the movie. It's Sheriff Bell's part. Again, it's very minimal, but it does dictate the whole narrative line of this film, and gives it its aura, its magic feeling of old people getting constantly bullied by the young, which is exactly why this film is called what it's called. And why you get this narration at the start, while witnessing some crude and cold violence, committed by a young man. Through two young men's classic western pursuit, you get an old man's struggle with the pain of getting old and feeling obsolete next to these younger, meaner wolves.<br/><br/>This is why the ending is what it is as well. And what an ending this is! Pure brilliance. Had me smiling in admiration for 20 minutes after the film ended.<br/><br/>A brilliant piece of cinema, just as incredible as Fargo was. Yet these are two very different films, they both shine with irresistible brilliance. Congratulations to this top-notch cast, these two incredible film-makers, this genius of a man who wrote this story, and to the whole team behind this modern-day masterpiece."
"Momcat_of_Lomita","Null","3","4","23 July 2011"," No country for happily ever after, but a great suspenseful movie, great performances.
","I loved this movie. But this is not a movie for everyone, I want to be very clear about that. It is violent, it is scary, and it doesn't end with the bad guys losing and the good guys heading off to a ""happily ever after."" If you're looking for a harmless popcorn movie with comic-book violence that's so exaggerated it's unreal and a feel-good ending, be warned: ""No Country for Old Men"" is not what you're looking for.<br/><br/>There's also no romance here, so forget it as a ""date movie;"" and while there's a certain amount of irony to it, there really isn't any humor.<br/><br/>Which leaves: a suspenseful plot in the chase/hunt genre, some really superb acting, and everything put together in a movie that just won't quit.<br/><br/>Plot basics: Llewelyn ""Lew"" Moss (played by Josh Brolin), a hapless regular good ol' boy in the desert southwest country, lucks into $1,000,000 in cash when he stumbles on a drug deal gone bad. He doesn't know that the guys the money belongs to tucked away a transponder in the middle of one of the bundles of cash, and that he can be located by someone who has the receiver tuned to the proper frequency who knows roughly where he may have gone.<br/><br/>Lew and his wife Carla Jean abandon their trailer home; Carla Jean heads off to her mother's, and Lew heads off to try to figure out how to hide the loot.<br/><br/>It's Lew's bad luck that one of the parties to the drug deal has hired Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), an executioner that's as relentless as Arnold Schwarzenegger's ""Terminator"" android and is pure sociopathic killer.<br/><br/>Chigurh (pronounced like ""sugar"") has to join the movie bad guy Hall of Fame. He simply doesn't care who he has to kill to get a job done, and when he decides he has to kill someone, he isn't going to change his mind. (This figures very prominently in the way the end of the movie plays out.) Once he knows that Lew is who he is hunting, the chase is on.<br/><br/>Chigurh isn't just the hunter in this film; he's hunted by Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), the lawman in whose jurisdiction the drug deal gone bad went down. Bell quickly realizes what's going on, and unlike Lew and Carla Jean, he realizes how deadly serious the situation is. Lew knows he's being hunted, but he doesn't know how deadly the guy hunting him is; he also has a cocky belief that he's smart enough to shake off the pursuit and hang onto the cash.<br/><br/>Bell tries to communicate with Lew through Carla Jean; he tries to get across to Carla Jean that Lew's life is in danger. Carla Jean is rattled, but she can't convince herself that shopping her husband to the law is the lesser of the evils.<br/><br/>The hunt is on. And that's basically what the rest of the movie consists of: Lew trying to escape with the money, Chigurh (and ultimately several other parties to the drug deal) trying to hunt Lew down, and Sheriff Bell trying to get to Lew in time to save him.<br/><br/>There's a lot of collateral damage in this hunt, and it's the way Tommy Lee Jones' Sheriff Bell is affected by the carnage that raises this movie above the level of your average hunter-and-hunted movie. Bell realizes that what he's dealing with in Chigurh, and to some extent the people who employ Chigurh, is something so far beyond the average kind of criminal he's used to dealing with that he literally cannot win. Chigurh is without any compunction: if the way to get to Lew involves killing people who are totally innocent, but whose deaths make it easier for him to get to Lew, then those people are going to die. And unlike the sheriff, who wastes time and effort in feeling something for the victims (even those who aren't completely innocent), Chigurh just mentally closes the books and moves on, the dead forgotten.<br/><br/>Sheriff Bell realizes that however good he is at what he does, however well he does his job, he can't stop someone like Chigurh, he can't win the fight. Maybe nobody can, but for sure he can't and so it's time to step down and let someone else try.<br/><br/>This is an excellent movie, but it doesn't spare anyone and it doesn't finish in a way that leaves you feeling good. It's unrelenting in following the story through to the bitter end. Literally the bitter end.<br/><br/>Bardem and Jones are unforgettable; Woody Harrelson does a fine turn; Kelly Macdonald is sympathetic and completely believable as the wife who is content to let her husband make the choices for both of them...until it's too late.<br/><br/>""No Country for Old Men"" is an excellent choice for an intense, powerful, suspenseful movie with some top-rate performances in it. But definitely not for light entertainment or easy viewing, or for people who want a happy ending."

","No Country for Old Men is a rare movie that gets every aspect of film perfectly. Every character gives an award deserving performance? Yes. The script perfect? Yes. The cinematography, the directing, the camera angles? Yes, yes and yes.<br/><br/>No Country for Old Men starts with a very creepy Javier Bardem who is chasing Brolin's character (who is very much deserving the academy award). The Coen Brothers nail the atmosphere of a modern western. The filming is done in Texas, and if it wasn't for the cars, you would think its a classic western. The sets, everything from the desolate wilderness, to the run down motels, fit in perfectly with an excellent atmosphere. The script sets up a very tense film, a chase between three different characters.<br/><br/>I am almost positive that you will be entertained while watching this movie. It is one of the best of the 2000's."
"wilsr","10","3","4","25 April 2011"," Superb!
","I have just amused myself reading through the (long) list of goofs. Fortunately none of them spoiled this, exceptional, movie for me! The Coen Bros excel in working the landscape into their films. Both in Fargo and No Country the vast expanses dominate the characters, but without dominating the film. Contrast that with Brokeback Mountain, where the outdoors overrode the story IMO to the extent it became a travelogue.<br/><br/>Casting is so important in any film: even one actor looking out of place can spoil the whole exercise. Not here, though: each and every one looks and feels the part. Jones - a much under-appreciated actor - is simply superb. His long, pensive pauses are exquisitely delivered. Bordem is so quietly menacing you almost have to watch from behind the sofa: his psychopathic disinterest in his many slayings should be a part of every budding actor's course notes.<br/><br/>I would never have placed Harrelson as a hit man in this sort of movie but he also plays the part as if he's been killing all his life, in a casual way. Brolin, too, knows the ranch life and that shows.<br/><br/>It's so pleasant to see a modern day film made with a beginning, middle and .......end? Well, yes: that's the whole point - there IS no end to the drugs and the violence. The ""end"" (which is really just the point where the movie itself stops, because the losing battle continues) has the killer limping off down a suburban street and the sheriff contemplating a quiet, definitely less stimulating, retirement. Fade to black.<br/><br/>No question: NCFOM sets the gold standard for this genre."

","This is a rare (perhaps unique) occasion when I can read all the 1-star and 10 star reviews and partially agree with both polarised camps. After my first viewing, I thought ""WTF?"" but the film haunted me afterwards which made me want to view it again. The images are powerful and the bleak message ""Life's no fair"" is far from the usual Hollywood stuff.<br/><br/>The film is rich in intentional ambiguities such as repay various viewings. The scene in which Tom Lee Jones enters the cordoned off motel thinking that Chugar may be present, is a wonderful example of the power of film. On the other hand, there are occasions when the confusion is a result of an inadequate explanation, such as why Wells does not retrieve the money bag. Details like this matter.<br/><br/>My other gripe with the movie is that it loses energy in the last twenty minutes. Perhaps this is a result of following the source novel. But films are not novels, they have a different dynamic. Some of the wordiest exchanges come in this part including the introduction of a new character in a scene which is strangely isolated from the rest of the film. But I have no problem in them in themselves, merely in their placement at this late stage in the film.<br/><br/>Some feel cheated that the protagonist (or the character they imagine to be the protagonist) dies off-screen and unglamorously, not even at the hand of his enemy. But this arbitrariness is the theme of the film and thus a fitting end.<br/><br/>This is a truly innovative and important film and one of the few Oscar winners which will stand up to future generations."

I would go as far to argue that it is the best psychological thriller I have ever sat through, it just had all the right ingredients and equally was missing all the crucial bits.<br/><br/>Sometimes its important to praise something for what its missing, not just what its got in abundance. A good psychological thriller is meant to leave the audience asking questions, to allow them to draw their own conclusions on aspects of the plot which are frankly, not crucial. So yes this film did have plot holes, however I feel every one of them was deliberate. Mainly because it encourages you to ask questions, challenge theories and ultimately be psychologically tested.<br/><br/>Additionally, this film lacks a score, with virtually no music whatsoever: adding to the terror of this film. It creates an atmosphere which doesn't just stay on the screen, but oozes into your front room and grips you around the throat. The camera work, the pace, and most of all the assailant.<br/><br/>Bardem's character is clearly what makes this movie. The aura surrounding this psychopathic murder is so intense that you feel yourself tensing up every time he comes into view, yet you are so intensely fixated by his ruthless, emotionless manor so that you don't turn away. Even from the very first shot of this masterpiece creation, you are immediately made to feel uncomfortable. The shocking realism of this cinematic creation is blood-curdling. Even if the rest of this film was terrible, I would probably praise it just as much for the creation of such a villain.<br/><br/>Luckily, its not. Brolin and Jones clearly are due some praise, both delivering solid performances. All three performances offer contrasts in pace, technique and screenplay skill, culminating in a memorable masterpiece worthy of praise for a long while yet.<br/><br/>Basically just watch this, you will not know just how terrifyingly brilliant this film is until you feel your mind racing afterwards.<br/><br/>92/100"

Set mostly in Texas around the 1980s, this film contains what is considered to be brutal and with gruesome violence for the reason why it sometimes has its criticisms and some saying that Tommy Lee Jones' Sheriff ET Bell wasn't doing anything to tackle it with the real killer getting away with it only just. Well, others would consider saying that he wisely chooses to distance himself and not to risk it because what's the point when it comes to dealing with a vicious triangle of dodgy drug gangs as it would be difficult to tackle it alone.

It has been nominated for Best Picture for the Golden Globes and one would expect the same for the Oscars.<br/><br/>Put simply, this is the Coen's best film since Fargo.

And yet there are subtle elements which lift it above the level of thriller which may leave fans of straight fare confused. To say more would be too revealing.<br/><br/>Typically for the Coen brothers, it's very violent, but this only adds weight to Bardem's extraordinary performance, alone worth the admission price.<br/><br/>The photography of the Southern American desert is graceful but spectacular and sits non intrusively alongside the narrative.<br/><br/>'Rising' star Josh Brolin (Into the Blue, Goonies) is great to watch and you'll be pulling for him even though he's risking it all for the cash. Tommy Lee Jones plays Tommy Lee Jones in a role not too dissimilar, in feel at least, to his directorial Three Burials.<br/><br/>There are other performances of note, including Woody Harrelson and Kelly McDonald (Trainspotting), but this is a showdown between Brolin and Bardem, with the Coens' hunching eagerly behind both.

","Loved it from beginning to end. The Cohen Brothers are nuts. They produce the best and weirdest movies on the planet. Never a dull moment, the movie has you on edge from beginning to end. I really don't get the casting of Tommy Lee Jones but no doubt they had a good reason for choosing him as the country sheriff.<br/><br/>I have only watched it once so far but I have no doubt I will see more in it after a few more viewings. My first impression is that the Cohens have produced another classic every bit as good as Fargo or The Big Lebowski.<br/><br/>Not a lot of dialog but what there is holds the story together without imposing on what is essentially a visual movie."

","Directed by Joel and Ethan Coen (the Coen brothers), No Country for Old Men (NCFOM) is a simple story that expands itself stunningly, and unloads skip-a-heart-beat action scenes, controlled and scarily realistic acting, and some of the most tense dialogue scenes in recent years.<br/><br/>Based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy, it tells the story of Moss, a retired Vietnam soldier, who has a strange yet eerie lifestyle and wife (brilliantly played by Kelly MacDonald, who puts on a continuously convincing West Texas accent). However, when Moss stumbles upon $2 million, he gets himself caught in a chase against 'the devil reincarnated', Anton Chigurh. Played by Javier Bardem, who won a supporting actor Oscar for his role, Chigurh is a fate-driven phycopathic killer, who mercilessly kills anyone brutally (and graphically) in his path, except for those saved by the fate of a coin. Bardem is so spine-chillingly complexed and terrifying that not even the blisteringly hot desert landscapes can warm this film.<br/><br/>And that's the main, if not only, problem with NCFOM. It is so unmercifully depressing and disturbingly eerie that it offers little redemption in return for the audiences pounding hearts. The kills are so graphic and violent, that your stomach scrunches up and the acid at the bottom swishes around.<br/><br/>That said, NCFOM is so brilliantly acted and engagingly heart-thumping that it doesn't need much remorse, nor a score (only 16 minuted of minimalist music)! Superbly and patiently shot and developed NCFOM is one of the year's best thrillers/horrors."

","No Country for Old Men is a grandiose, dark, violent Neo-Western thriller from the Coen Brothers.<br/><br/>Adapted from a novel by Cormac McCarthy, it stars Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin. Brolin plays an ordinary Joe who whilst out hunting finds a fortune in the aftermath of a drug deal that went bad.<br/><br/>This leads to a cat and mouse game involving three men. Brolin who has to evade the relentless hit-man with a bad haircut played by Bardem.<br/><br/>He also has to steer clear of Lee Jones, the violence weary veteran sheriff on the hunt for both men knowing that Brolin has bitten off more than he can chew and is in danger.<br/><br/>The film is set in Texas of 1980 with a bleak, desert landscape. It is important to note the year, it means Brolin's character is a Vietnam war veteran and the film deals with the purported rise of modern urban violence from the 1970s onwards.<br/><br/>McCarty's novel and its adaptation deals with themes of fatalism, conscience and circumstance. The Coen Brothers have dealt with various types of crime genres before in their film careers ranging from Blood Simple, Crimewave, Fargo and Miller's Crossing.<br/><br/>In those films there have also been some form of humour even the the dark kind. Here they can pull the themes together in a grander scale as they have the source material that richly delivers. There is much less humour. A journey to bleakness lies for a lot of the participants.<br/><br/>It is a combination of a modern western and an urban thriller. Even its 1980s setting with its fashion and style can easily merge with the present day with the presence of four wheel drive vehicles, high rise buildings and automatic weapons.<br/><br/>The violence displayed is an important part of the film but some viewers may find this with the grim tone too much for them."
"majesty327","9","4","6","12 November 2013"," This film is near perfect.
","As a large proponent of ""Show, don't tell"", I'd say that this is in one of my top-ten movies. It's a marvel in the power understatement. Just simple actions like picking up the casing after shooting a deer make characters seem that much more real and deep. The rolling valleys, and corporate roads perfectly capture both the identity and the plight of the modern South-west. The lack of music and the addition of little background noises like the commotion in the streets, and the blowing of the wind make this movie almost seem like it's real. I felt like I was really there the entire movie. Is there plot holes? Maybe. This is a film that you have to pay attention to and pick up on the subtleties. Whether that's a good thing or a bad thing I'll leave up to you. For me at least, my favorite things about this movie is the atmosphere and the subtlety. The actors also put in good performances, with Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh ultimately being the character that everyone remembers and talks about. I highly recommend this movie to people who can overcome its slow pace and general lack of explicit explanation. It's a 9.5/10, an excellent movie. And no, I don't pretend to ""get"" this movie. Whether you do or don't is not a sign of your intelligence, so much as how much you think this movie is worth getting into. It's not a fast-moving-action-thriller, but it's a great suspense film with near flawless sound design and cinematography."

","All my friends hated this film. Most of them said that this film was just a waste of time, with horrible plot and confusing ending. I think everyone would think that Josh Brolin (Llewelyn Moss) would actually become a hero, a good guy with a good luck to found two million dollars cash and had a potential to kill the psycho-killer man. <br/><br/>But for me, No Country for Old Men is ace.<br/><br/>This movie shows us that evil sometimes win. That a hero sometimes lose everything and life isn't going as well as we hoped. That you should always make small decisions to change your life forever, like choosing one side of the coin. And no matter where you go, death is near. One day you find your money, and another day you'll lose more. <br/><br/>Javier Bardem performance was exceptional. Chigurh character haunted me for days after I watched this movie. He's the most perfect villain I ever saw. Every little thing he does is scary. The way he walks, smiles, stares, drives or even asks questions. Javier Bardem played him exquisitely, impeccably wonderful. <br/><br/>Although some people say that there are a lot of scenes had been cut out from the movie, I don't mind to watch it over and over again."

The cast performance, cinematography, direction, plot & screenplay are perfect factors. Some of them are second only to music, although a little more engaging score could've changed my 8.2 rating. Speaking too much but not going over is what the plot does. The trembling effect it has on its viewers is that the definitions re boundless and 80% of the happenings are free to imagination. As the message that comes out of it is varied, No Country For Old Men is a must watch, since we need to feel the gravity of the other side of humanity.<br/><br/>Alas, it does have its dull moments, mostly carried by conversations or self-thoughts.

"schell-7","10","4","6","30 April 2012"," A Giant Leap from ""Fargo"" to Kierkegaard, Sartre and Camus
","The title comes from the opening line of W. B. Yeats' famous poem ""Sailing to Byzantium,"" in which the aging narrator wishes to exchange his hard life in Ireland (""no country for old men"") for an imaginary aesthetic existence in ancient Byzantium. But neither the novelist (Cormac McCarthy) nor the Coen brothers are promising any sort of deliverance through art or any other imagined alternative to mortal existence. This isn't a story for elitist intellectuals and interpreters of Yeats' frequently arcane visions. On the other hand, it's not a story for those those film-goers who insist on a traditional ""movie bad guy"" and simply cannot, or refuse to, see the universal and very personal meanings represented by the characters, all of whom--from Barden's unstoppable killer to Tommy Lee Jones' sheriff--mirror our deepest desires, fears, and insecurities. Although not a movie serving up the escape and closure expected by traditional theater audiences, it nevertheless has the power to grip and engage the viewer like few other films. And like a Flannery O'Connor short story, its dark humor and violence ultimately lodge in personal consciousness (I frankly was hanging on to my seat with white knuckles to the very end, before leaving the theater ""sadder but wiser"" for the experience).<br/><br/>The story is the Coen brothers' ""bait"" to get the viewer to think about non-trivial matters. After all, it's only we humans who are blessed with ""self-consciousness""-- with the capacity to think about our individual ""identities,"" and even about our own life and death. The key to putting together all that the spectator has experienced comes with the appearance of Tommy Lee Jones' sheriff in the final scene of the movie. He says that he's quitting as sheriff. He had expected ""God to somehow come into his life"" but is now too fully aware that God (much less he himself) is over-matched. The film's nemesis is a merciless ""executioner"" with less conscience than The Terminator and sufficient inscrutability to make even Woody Harrelson's perceptive diagnosis of him (as a psychopathic killer with principles, albeit devoid of ""morality"") inadequate. We, like the sheriff, are now faced with the inescapability of our own mortality and with re-visioning our past life in light of this disturbing reality.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin appears to be the sympathetic ""hero."" he has a John Wayne-like rugged individualism, a knack for survival, and commands instant respect from those around him once they learn of his service in ""Nam""--but that won't cut it in the relentless, fatalistic, chancy determinism that, in the Coen Brothers' view of modern existence, controls our lives. Brolin's conscience requires him to return to the scene of a crime with water for the survivor of a drug deal gone terribly bad, yet he can dismiss his wife's concerns for her mother and he can be distracted by a female sunbather.<br/><br/>Brolin's wife suddenly becomes a central figure, but only briefly. She at least has no illusions about getting a lucky roll of the dice. Her fate, like that of all mortals, is preordained, and she refuses to play the Executioner's coin-flip game, representing mortality more accurately: ""It's not me or the coin that decides what happens to me. It's you."" But in this circular question about free will and the meaning of life, Bardem answers her back: ""You're wrong. That's how I got here."" It's a game of chance, and there isn't even an authentic card dealer. But its through Bardem's mysterious (and deadly) character that the movie destroys all of our illusions and ultimately goes after the worst of the deadly sins--pride, hubris, taking upon ourselves what belongs only to God. When will we learn? Why can't we?<br/><br/>And therein lies the film's admission of Aristotle's ""fatal flaw"" and along with it a small ray of light. Human agency has a role after all. Brolin did make a mistake and had the arrogance to think he could get away with his theft of the drug money intended for someone else. And for a moment, he let carnal desire distract him from the real threat. Moreover, he took his own life more seriously than that of his wife or mother- in-law, selfishly assuming that the Executioner was interested ""only"" in him. <br/><br/>The last two scenes practically ""require"" interpretation. The Executioner (vulnerable himself, but a better survivor than Harrelson or Brolin) walks away. Behind him he leaves the seeds of greed (and of fatal pride) in a young boy who took money in exchange for what began as a Good Samaritan act. The recovered Executioner now ambles off into a typical American neighborhood (like that in David Lynch's ""Blue Velvet""). What's next on his agenda? The viewer can only speculate, even as the film cuts to Jones' sheriff relating a dream about meeting his father (who did not die an old man), and then says: ""I woke up.""<br/><br/>That awakening is what this movie is all about. The screen goes black waiting for the spectator's inner light to come on. It's time to wake up--perhaps now more than ever. There may be a future, but there will be no lottery tickets--even to those who win them. It's we who must act to make the best of that mortally-defined fateful span of existence that lies before us. We can't know if our efforts will bear positive fruit, but we can know that ""good"" isn't simply going to happen by wishing and waiting for it. And we can also know that our prideful moments can only bring more misery. And if we don't know this now, the storyteller seems to be saying, we most certainly will when we're older.<br/><br/>Finally, the film's setting must be taken seriously. It repeatedly points to a vacuum, a void, a land laid waste by the same human beings it once nurtured and empowered. Everyone wants answers. We have the power to find them, but only if we're not too complacent or proud to search for them."

","A+ <br/><br/>The Coen Brothers have definitely caught my eye. I know they have an impressive career, but this film is my favorite of theirs. It has the cinematography and location of a great modern Western, the lighting of a film noir, and the great dialogue of a Coen Brother film. The difference though is that ""Fargo"" (another Coen brother favorite of mine) is a dark comedy-drama, and this film, as the Coen Brothers put it, is about the unstoppable evil"". Playing that evil is Javier Bardem as Anton Chigur, and he's one of the best movie villains I've ever seen. The theme of the movie, as in the book it is based on, is the decadence of our country. Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones are subject to this. Those expecting a traditional morality tale, the triumph of good over evil, will not find it here.<br/><br/>I find that the majority of the viewers say that they love the build-up of the movie, the pacing being perfect, the action great, and the drama well-written. What they often say they can't stand is the ending. Without spoiling the climax, I can understand where they're coming from, but I have to disagree. Anybody who watched ""Fargo"" for the first time surely didn't expect the brand of comedy the film dwelled on. In the same light, viewers of ""No Country for Old Men' should expect the usual guidelines to go right out the window. As a true film lover, the ending, no matter how against your wishes it maybe, try to keep this in mind: the filmmakers are attempting something different, something bold. I learned this lesson the hard way some time ago when I first viewed ""Arlington Road"".<br/><br/>Also, kudos to Kelly Macdonald, who did an extremely well done job, and I love Woody Harrelson no matter the film. And despite all the film's seriousness, it does have a touch of comedy with the MacDonald character's mother, played well by Beth Grant."
"clarem-7","10","4","6","22 December 2011"," Logic to a fault
","No music. The sound we can sometimes hear is like the pulsating of a gong. The impression it conveys is that of waves spreading in circles on a still water surface after it has been disturbed by an object. It is heard whenever the characters are confronted with the results of their past decisions – the waves' inexorable advance, often stirred far back in the past. Naturally, people try to influence this course, but the best they can do is confuse the pattern – in the end, the waves will hit the shore.. The symbol for this type of fate is Chigurh: ""You've been putting it up – your whole live .. The coin has been traveling twenty-two years to get here."" All who have to deal with him try to change the course of events but only manage to disrupt the pattern: Moss cunningly escapes several traps while sheriff Bell remains in constant pursuit, unable to catch up with his ""ghost"". We must accept that our decisions will have uncontrollable effects in the future – we are part of this world and we have not much influence on what is coming. Maybe Chigurh made his decision during the war which convinced him that mankind obeys its rules and morals only to its own convenience. ""If the rule you followed brought you to this, of what use was the rule?"" It seems that his logical conclusion is to leave the system of rights and responsibilities and to refuse the abstract world of human ideas and values which make our society work. What we can learn: think ahead of what might follow your actions and then make the right decision – you won't be able to correct your mistakes later. Don't even try to ""get back what's been taken from you"" – lingering in the past won't help, ""you can't stop what's coming. Ain't all waiting on you ... That's vanity."" Thankfully, this film leaves us the freedom to judge for ourselves: we perceive things close up, from the characters' points of view and no music guides and influences our perception of the events."

","Cormac McCarthy's national bestseller help the coen brothers make their first and finest adaption. No Country For Old Men, the bloodiest hell ride that shows the horror of the notorious psychopath kilter, named Anton Chigurh.<br/><br/>This madman soon chases this guy named Llewellyn Moss, a Vietnam veteran who finds a truckload of Mexican brown dope and a case filled with ten million dollars in cash, with dead bodies laying around him. So Llewellyn tries to keep the ten million so his wife can have all that she needs, then thats when chigurh comes in. The man in back of the situation is Ed Tom Bell, an old sheriff thats new to these kind of crimes (hence the title of movie), with 1980s Mexican border problems, much more murders happen.<br/><br/>These three men are never really filmed together throughout the movie, even though its a chase movie, but it shows how the creative mind of the coens put a unique their in there movie, which makes it not very visible to you. I've also heard that it stayed true to the book, and has set a great visual to it as well. The originality of this film definitely makes it a much watch, and its the bloodiest from the coens I've seen yet.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem shows his skills in new type of work, being Chigurh. His creepy looks (mostly the haircut) shows that the character is insane, has no sense of humor, and no sense of compassion or regret. His weapons are as unique as him, being some strange air tank that shoots through locks, and this shotgun with a gigantic silencer, which probably makes most of the gore in the movie. Nobody can play a better role as Llewelyn than Josh Brolin. growing up as a country man made this role easy for him, just acting like himself will be perfect acting. Tommy Lee Jones plays sheriff Ed Tom Bell, which Jones also said that the character he was playing was a lot like him as well as Brolin, like some of the parts was just like a natural conversation to him.<br/><br/>No Country For Old Men has inspired me in so many levels. A movie this original, could be one of the best. This movie is one of the best of the decade, very close to ""There Will Be Blood"", and thats one good compliment."
"cuppa_tetleys","9","4","6","24 April 2011"," One of the best most intense film experiences ever - I've never loved and hated a film so much at the same time.
","This film is tense. That is the biggest aspect of this production for me - I have never before experienced film so suspenseful that even a cut to a different angle makes me jump. To get the praise out of the way as I'm saying nothing new - it is masterfully directed, acted, written, paced and shot.<br/><br/>However - I hate this film's ending. I was actually seething at the last 20 minutes or so that I just sat there reeling, not really taking in what happened. Mild spoiler alert, but the film builds up for an hour and a half to an epic final showdown with a character that we have followed since the beginning that we are really connected to, and then it just cuts to the aftermath. It skips over the ending. It take the most anticipated moment of the entire film and just dismisses it, giving us no details of how or when it happened, just the result. And I just sat there and said aloud 'WHAT?' to myself. I felt so cheated out of a satisfying ending that I just stared blindly at Tommy Lee Jones for next half hour or so.<br/><br/>Now, apparently this is how it happens in the book, but I think it's safe to say in this case, that breaking away from the source material would've been preferable - even if they had to make the film 2 and a half hours instead of 2, that would've been better than successfully creating a character and then just cutting their development arc short just because the book did it. Hell, it probably would've even supported the Sheriff's message at the end even more."
"Rockwell_Cronenberg","9","4","6","23 April 2011"," Violence in the Heartland.
","At first, I saw this film as a straight story of violence and greed. However, it is so much more than just what's on the surface. The Coens take this interesting story of violence and turn it into one of the most shocking and intelligent studies of themes ranging from predestination versus the unpredictability of chance to American greed and consequences for violence.<br/><br/>Llewelyn Moss is our main protagonist for the majority of the film, but it's Ed Tom Bell who serves as our opener and closer and his approach to the whole state of the world in this is a fantastic way of not letting the audience disappear into this world of violence. Instead of just accepting that this is the world of the film, we always have Ed Tom to come in and explain to us that this violent existence is our existence as well and it's disgusting. I've always loved the approach of a character who looks back on life with regret and this is one of the best examples of that. Tommy Lee Jones was the perfect choice for this role, and he really hits that stoic manliness while also just being filled with guilt and borderline disgust over the state of the world. Except it's gotten to a point where it's not even disgust anymore, it's just depressed indifference. It's brilliant.<br/><br/>Our look at these characters ends with Ed Tom detailing one of his dreams to his wife. In the dream, him and his father were back in older times, traveling in this mountain pass. His father rides ahead with a fire and a blanket, not saying anything as he passes. The road is cold and dark and hard to get through, but Ed Tom knows that once he gets through it all and makes it to his father, he'll be warm and taken care of. Everything will be alright. Then comes the film's now-famous final line, ""And then I woke up..."", with him coming back into our world. It's kind of a chilling ending, again commenting on the rough and ruthless state of our current existence. Back in older times, no matter how hard things got, you would know that everything was going to be alright in the end. There would be a fire and light to keep you safe and warm. But now, that doesn't exist anymore. He woke up and now he's not so sure that everything is going to be alright when he gets through that rough terrain. There might just be more.<br/><br/>I feel like the film is two almost separate entities. There's the chase down with Anton and Llewelyn and the drug money, then there's Ed Tom almost acting as his own audience, coming in and just being marveled by the immense violence that these men run through during the film. In so many ways, this is a film that doesn't follow any conventional means, and in keeping with this it's one of the few films where we not only see the consequences of violence, we see the aftermath. It's not like a serial killer movie where the detective gratuitously goes through the blood and carnage to find a clue. Ed Tom rides in and just...experiences the cost of the violence that these men don't think twice about when they present it into the world.<br/><br/>One of the most interesting aspects of the film comes in the form of Anton Chigurh. Classified by most as a ""villain"", the character for the large part of the film represents so much more than that; anarchy, the cruel and unpredictable act of fate and, most importantly, consequence. A lot of people see Chigurh as just this unstoppable evil, but it should be noted that the character only acts out of a response to the violence of the world. He is only a part of this world because the world requires him to be. Someone like Chigurh coming into existence is nothing beyond the consequence for a world that has become so lost in it's belief that violence is the ultimate answer.<br/><br/>Although in certain scenes, particularly the now infamous gas station exchange, he simply represents the uncertainty of fate. All of your life you make decisions that lead you down certain paths, and making one wrong decision could lead you to an immediate and unexpected demise. Chigurh at times can be the ultimate example of this, with the simple choice of heads or tails standing between you and a grave. The scene near the end with him and Llewelyn's wife, Carla Jean is a great representation of this whole thing. She tells him that he can choose to leave, that it's up him and he responds simply by saying that it's out of his control. Fate isn't in anyone's control and whether you like it or not, sometimes there are choices you make that lead you down completely different paths and this story just happens to have that choice potentially leading to the ultimate path.<br/><br/>This is perhaps my favorite aspect of No Country for Old Men, the fact that the film isn't conventional in any way whatsoever. We have a ""villain"" with absolutely no backstory, there's no sign of hope or bright light at the end of the tunnel, the film doesn't end with a bang but with a whisper, major characters get killed off-screen, nothing is safe here and nothing is predictable. I think that the best films are the ones where you have no idea what's going to happen, but you know that whatever it is, it's going to be unique and incredible. You don't know what path you'll get taken down, but you trust the director(s) to take you down it."

","No Country For Old Men is one the best I have seen from Coen brothers. I liked their O Brother Where Art Thou but I disliked Fargo. Well, I gotta tell you, it's like a day and night with Fargo. The movie is an extremely creepy. A very haunting tale. There's something very gripping about this one. I think girls won't find it interesting that much. It's more like a guys territory. Boys enjoy it. Plenty of cool chase scenes and some awesome action ones which has a touch of Coen' power in it.<br/><br/>The trio is fantastic. Javier Bardem, in his own words, is out of his comfort zone, but he delivers. A scary performance by him. Well, Tommy Lee Jones for that, is totally in his comfort zone.

","The best Coen movie since Fargo! Javier Bardem gives a terrifying performance as Anton Chigurh. From the opening scene we are introduced to this morbid character who has the coolest weapon I have seen for a villain in any movie. There is a lot of silence in the film which adds to the tension and thrills. The dialogue is excellent and philosophical at times. Tommy Lee Jones narration is great as he realizes no matter how hard he tries he cant change the evil in the world after he had maintained order as a sheriff in his small and quiet town in west Texas. The movie begins and ends with Jones narration. In the opening narrative he tells the story of a boy he sent to the electric chair who had killed his 14 year old girlfriend for no apparent reason. This narration sets the tone for the entire movie as we are introduced to Anton, a evil man who kills without hessitation. The abrupt ending has a lot to do with what Jones has been saying since the beginning of the movie. His final narration deals with the issue of the impossibility of understanding these evil characters and feels all he has done has been in vain. Great film which lives up to its predecessor, Fargo. Well deserved win for best picture of the year!"

","""You can't stop what's coming. It ain't all waiting on you. That's vanity.""<br/><br/>Even if No Country for Old Men didn't have gorgeous cinematography, excellent pacing, a near perfect script, and an absolutely perfect cast, I still would have loved it for its tone. It's the most similar movie to Fargo that the Coens have done, and the similar theme of implacable and unfathomable violence in a rural American area (once again initiated by money) is one of the main reasons why I love the Coens so much.<br/><br/>The breathtaking, empty setting of south Texas is a seamless compliment to the measured pace of the movie. No Country has suspense coming out of its ears, as each scene seems to somehow surpass the previous ones in measured tension. The overall quiet of the film only serves to magnify the eventual scenes of violence when they come, and the fact that you don't see everything happen on-screen keeps the viewer fully invested in the story. There's no constant quick cuts and hyper-kinetic camera work to be seen; only long-smoldering sequences that pushes your anticipation to the brink of breaking, and then pushes it some more.<br/><br/>In a cast this good, two people stand out even beyond the others. Tommy Lee Jones as the world-weary sheriff who's the heart of the story, and Javier Bardem as the relentless, inscrutable, main antagonist of the story. Jones was perfect, there's no other way for me to say it. And Bardem gives life to the best and most interesting villain since The Operative in Serenity. Both performances were among the best that I've seen in my life.<br/><br/>No County for Old Men is the kind of movie that improves with every viewing. Ten years from now, I'll still be watching it and loving it.  It's film-making at its finest. When you take an amazing story and marry it to directors with immeasurable talent and a cast that couldn't have been better chosen, you get a masterpiece."

","This movie took a while to really get into, but once I did I was pretty overwhelmed. It isn't a classic fight between the good and the bad, it's more like a brilliant cat-and-mouse game between the unlikeable and the even more unlikeable. I felt bad for Llewellyn Moss, who had no idea about how far over his head he was, but he's mostly the hero because of the contrast with Anton Chigurh. Chigurh is the unstoppable evil, which is mainly apparent in the gas station scene, in which he decides the clerk's fate in a coin toss. It's so random, it has nothing to do with the main plot, but he wants to kill him because he can. That's the frightening thing about Chigurh, he does bad things for no reason. It's a brilliant character, and his cold-blooded antics give the movie a breakneck pace. The pseudo-intellectual ending scene is an anti-climax, but that's pretty much the only criticism I can give."

","Overview:<br/><br/>No Country for Old Men is a movie based on a novel written by Cormac McCarthy with the same name. The story describes how a cop discovers a bag full of million dollars at a site where a drug deal went awry. The cop takes all the money and runs away with it. Chigurh, a professional hit-man, wants to retrieve the satchel of money (which contains a hidden radio transponder to which Chigurh has the corresponding receiver). With the help of the transponder Chigurh tracks the cop. What happens next is ought to be seen in the movie !<br/><br/>Was it any good?<br/><br/>No Country for Old Men will blow your mind off with the sizzling performances from all of its actors. Javier Barden is the show stealer in the movie. His portrayal of the character Anton Chigurh is very realistic and is worth every penny of your movie ticket! He won an Oscar for his work in this movie. Josh Brolin as the cop comes second in the department. I don't think any other actor has the guts to portray the character played by him. The role of a tough cop always suits him (see American Gangster). The movie has a 1980's touch to it. The barren lands of Texas sharing borders with Mexico adds a cow-boy-movies like backdrop to the film. I give it a 5/5 for the beautiful cinematography. One of the distinctive features of move is that there's hardly any background music in it. You just get to listen to a bit at the starting and a full length(er) at the end. This makes the viewing experience very different compared to other movies.<br/><br/>Verdict:<br/><br/>No Country for Old Men is a solid movie. Very realistic movie with some of the finest performances of the decade. It won 4 awards at the Oscars. If you have missed this film at the theaters, go grab a DVD."
"hardrock666","10","4","6","3 August 2008"," Yet another brilliant Movie from Coen Brothers
","'No Country for Old Men' is a grim and unsettling film that curiously makes its viewer beg for more of the same. In adapting Cormac McCarthy's 2005 novel, sibling writer-directors Joel and Ethan Coen, the team behind 'Fargo' and 'O Brother Where Art Thou?,' keep their quirky humor in check and stare unflinchingly at the worst humanity has to offer. As a result, the duo may have created their most accomplished and compelling movie to date.<br/><br/>The Coens have always penned lively dialogue (""We felt the institution no longer had anything to offer us,"" says John Goodman, justifying his prison break in ""Raising Arizona"") and demonstrated visual panache (the wood chipper scene in ""Fargo"" is hard to forget).<br/><br/>But the characters in ""No Country for Old Men,"" despite being larger than life, seem more real and believable. It's much easier to get worked up over their outcomes than wondering how the broad characters in ""Intolerable Cruelty"" might fare.It also doesn't hurt that the new film is loaded with several first-rate performers who can make potentially outlandish situations seem real. Tommy Lee Jones stars as Ed Tom Bell, a grizzled, third-generation lawman who has stumbled upon a grizzly case that makes anything he's handled before seem tame.<br/><br/>An antelope hunter named Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin) discovers the aftermath of a drug deal that turned into a massacre. The only survivor of the class is a mortally-wounded man who's only able to beg for water, which Llewellyn doesn't have.In what seems like a major stroke of luck, he discovers a case of money that no one at the site of the debacle has lived to collect. He takes it home to his trailer park, bewildering his wife (Scottish actress Kelly Macdonald).<br/><br/>The seemingly untraceable fortune actually has several people eager to claim it. A flashy hired gun named Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson) has the dual task of retrieving the money and finding another fellow who's after it.Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem, obliterating his Spanish accent) may have been hired initially to find the cash, but he quickly leaves a trail of blood as long as the Nile. With his drooping bangs, Chigurh looks almost comical from a distance. His cold, brown eyes, however, betray how dangerous he can be. He murders anyone who gets in his way. And he often seems to dispatch people simply for pleasure.<br/><br/>He's also as inventive as he is arbitrarily cruel. He can turn air tanks into a both a weapon and a door opener. Think of his as a Satanic McGuyver. Barden also projects the right blend of menace and buffoonery that makes each of Chigurh's attacks seem appropriately shocking.As Chigurh's quarry, Brolin is appropriately compelling. He may have been dumb to get himself in his current predicament, but he's resourceful enough to survive longer than anyone else who crosses Chigurh's path. Brolin has a likable sad sack quality to makes you wish he could get out of his grim situation.<br/><br/>Following all of the sordid events is Jones' Earl Tom. The sheriff can read a crime scene with astonish accuracy, but correctly worries that it will take a Herculean effort to prevent a greater bloodbath. Jones demonstrates a fascinating vulnerability that belies his tough guy image and manages to make a character who functions primarily as a narrator engaging on his own terms.<br/><br/>In addition to three terrific lead performances, the Coens manage to deliver some of their usual wordplay. When asked how dangerous Chigurh is, Wells simply replies, ""Compared to what? The bubonic plague?"" And thanks to McCarthy's plot line, they also have some genuinely surprising plot twists. The film constantly throws off a viewer's expectations.<br/><br/>""No Country for Old Men"" is sometimes a difficult film to watch because it's unflinchingly grim and often leaves viewers to reach their own decisions about what happened.But the film lingers in the brain long after the credits start rolling and proves the Coen's can examine the frailty of the human heart as skillfully as they can manipulate words and images."

","This film was pure genius. The Coen brothers are very talented. Like Fargo, this film was riveting and full of surprises. Unlike Frago, it had little, if any, humor. The cinematography was breathtaking, with scenes of the desert and big sky captivating. The protagonist, Chigurh, was relentless and you kept hoping he'd get his just desserts in a big way. This was a three-way chase film,, and had its shocking moments. Josh Brolin was excellent as the cowboy type and he carried the film in a big way. I don't know if he was nominated for an Oscar, but he should have been. Tommy Lee Jones's character seemed to epitomize the title of the film. An unforgettable classic. Chigurgh has a haunting presence. A scary, brutal, tense drama that reaches out and grabs you. There are times in a film when you wish you could intervene and step into the screen. That means you're captivated. This is one of those films. It grabs yo emotionally. What a ride."

","Hailed by thousands as an instant classic, and also hailed as a disaster by thousands more. It has been a while since a real 'artsy' type movie has been so successful at the Academy Awards, but this one is definitely deserving of all its glory. <br/><br/>The film's central theme is not only a changing world, but the fact that the people who kept the world in order once before have seen their day and it has truly become 'No Country for Old Men'. With Tommy Lee Jones' opening and closing monologues, he beautifully exemplifies the point the story tries to make. It isn't easy to see, i assure you, which is why this isn't really a film for everyone. But deep meaning aside, the film also illustrates excellent use of suspense, character interaction, and amazing direction. <br/><br/>It has been said that a single emotion can be the drive behind a story, and the emotion that really gets you while watching this film is fear. The Coen brothers brilliantly used fear to shape Javier Bardem's character as the 'psychopathic killer'. When he comes on the screen you get a sense of a dark shadow casting over the whole room and it really makes you feel like you are in the presence of true evil. <br/><br/>I would like to point out that there is little to no music in the entire film. The use of silence throughout the majority of the movie is very original in the sense that the music doesn't cue the viewer how to react and when.<br/><br/>So again, not for everyone, but if you are a frequent movie goer and truly understand the makings of a good film, this is an excellent one to see.<br/><br/>I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did...it is definitely worth your time."

","This is the first time I leave a comment on a movie here on IMDb. Before leaving for the cinema I had a look at the score and I found it was 45th in the top 250 (plus 4 Oscars and 83 other prizes). I knew I was in for a violent movie, but I was also expecting a satisfying experience having appreciated Cohen brothers' work in Fargo. The ending was met with a stunned silence by the audience (expected, since the ending is one of the most abrupt I have seen in years). A middle-aged couple who entered the theater and sat beside us about 30 seconds after the movie had started even asked us about the beginning of the movie to learn if they had missed anything that would make sense of the narrative mess they had just witnessed. All my friend and I wanted back were the two hours of our life we had just spent watching one of the worst displays (IMHO, of course!) of violence for violence sake and unsympathetic and mono-dimensional characters produced for the silver screen. Judging from the reactions of our fellow spectators, I can safely say that most of them agreed with us."

","The Coen brothers seem to think that if they put enough blood on the screen that will make up for everything else. This movie was looked forward to for quite some time and now I still have to try to figure out how it ended because the brothers apparently ran out of film before they got to that point. Tommy Lee Jones and the other actors and actresses did a good job with what they had to work with but the directors are, in my opinion, idiots. Each time I have seen a movie by these two brothers I end up with the same reaction. I think they set out to try to gross the audience out and that's the only thing they do a good job at. From now on I will check to see who made the movie before I see it, and if the Coen brothers made it, I will skip it."
"Willemite","8","10","20","10 February 2008"," Minority Report on Majority Favorite
","No Country for Old Men was an engaging and interesting film, but I was not as taken with it as most seem to have been.<br/><br/>Plot-wise, it is primarily a chase film. Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin) having made off with found drug money flees; psycho-killer Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) chases him; Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) chases Anton; Carson Wells, (Woody Harrelson) in the employ of the money side of the drug deal, chases the money; drug dealers chase Llewellyn. Can Moss get away with the money? He concocts a devious scheme for hiding the cash, but is not clever enough to figure out soon enough how Anton can find him so easily. He is smart enough to know his wife will need protecting but then sends her to a place where she is certain to be found.<br/><br/>Anton is a bad-hair boogie-man, in the mold of Jason, Freddie or Michael Meyers, maniacally intent on retrieving his money, determined to kill any who have wronged him or even to have gotten in his way, and willing to lay waste any unfortunate enough to be nearby. Doesn't he catch up with Llewellyn rather quicker than seems likely for anyone not blessed with symbolic DNA? Isn't it at least a little suspicious that he knows exactly what medication to take from the pharmacy, and is able to deliver exact dosages? And how about his reaction when faced with a compound fracture at the end? Grits his teeth, wraps the sucker up and walks off into the distance like any good boogie-man might. Yet he cloaks his actions under the guise of having ""a code."" This ""code"" seems to impress some of those around him. Carson Wells and the sheriff both refer to it. A code that allows a madman to kill based on a coin toss is crying out for a rewrite. That Anton takes sadistic pleasure in bullying those to whom he offers the coin only reinforces that he is a nut-job. Does fate take pleasure in our demise? Not likely. Adding personality to Anton makes him less a symbol and more of a monster. The scene in which Carla Jean refuses to play, insisting that Anton was responsible for his actions and was not merely an instrument of fate, reinforces this. (A switch from the book, by the way. She accepts and loses in the novel.) So is Anton a symbol for fate or just a crazy guy? Both maybe, but if so, that muddies the issues.<br/><br/>McCarthy's an adherent to the ""Life's a bitch and then you die"" school, with a career-long focus on violence in human existence. He sees things getting progressively worse. The violence here is more mindless than in his prior work. The message comes across that things have changed for the worse within the last generation. That probably references the disrespect for authority that grew out of the 1960s, the growth in the drug trade that happened in the 1970s, and by implication the spectacular growth of private gun use. To see where he is going with this, I suggest reading his award winning The Road, an incredible book about a post-apocalyptic America.<br/><br/>The Coens offer snippets of their very welcome humor. Llewellyn appearing at the border crossing in a bathrobe was wonderful as was the scene in which he appears in the same outfit at a clothing store and the clerk asks in a deadpan how the boots were working out. Woody Harrelson gets a few nice comedic lines as does Josh Brolin. While no one gets to say ""I think I'm gonna barf,"" there are enough small yucks to lighten the overall emotional load.<br/><br/>Could either Llewellyn or Anton bleed as much as they had and not go into shock? I don't know, but it certainly was impressive seeing them self-medicate.<br/><br/>I liked the cinematography, the beautiful opening serenity that would play host to the high body count to come, the claustrophobia of the hotels, some very nice in-town shots looking down at the streets and storefronts.<br/><br/>Acting-wise, Josh Brolin was perfect as the everyman who sees his opportunity and takes it, then trying to cope with the results. I would have liked to have seen him get a nomination. TLJ played, well, TLJ. It seemed to me that this is the same role he has played in many, many films. Of course, I really like TLJ, so I do not know if this is a bad thing. Kelly McDonald (Carla Jean Moss) earned her money for her scene with Javier Bardem. Riveting. Harrelson was fun. But I do not get what all the excitement is for Bardem. Yes, he was effective in portraying a nut-job. Should Ah-nold have gotten an Oscar nomination for his homicidal robot? That was effective too. Bardem is arguably one of the brightest acting lights of our generation. Before Night Falls and The Sea Inside show his unmistakable genius. But the role as written is confusing. Is he a symbol or a person? The role does not really offer all that much range, in my humble opinion. Yes, he is scary. He uses silence effectively. And...<br/><br/>So what are we to take from this movie? Life is ultra-violent and tough noogies? When your number is up, your number is up? Cormac needs to get out more. One need not go along with McCarthy's dark view of life to enjoy the film, and I did enjoy it quite a bit. I am a fan of the Coens. I love their sense of humor, particularly. But I do not believe that this film is their best work. Nor do I believe that it merits a best picture nomination. I know this puts me in a minority. It is an interesting film, dark yet amusing, and I would recommend it. But somehow it is not, to my mind, at the top tier."
"Pete-230","9","10","20","18 December 2007"," A portrait of evil
","Strongest examination of evil since ""Silence of the Lambs."" Almost nihilistic in leaving no promise of redemption - near the end, Sheriff Bell remarks to his uncle that he expected that, as he got older, God would reveal his face to him, ""but he never came."" Early on, Bell tells his deputy about sending one young man who had killed a girl to the electric chair. But it's obvious that he no longer believes his efforts will stem the tide of evil - he's just going through the motions. He tells the deputy that he didn't know what to make of the boy's crime, and he knows even less what to make of the massacre in the desert, ""and I don't want to be riding into something I don't understand."" In his last speech he describes the dream where he sees his father riding past him, carrying fire in a horn. He knows his father is going to make a fire for both of them. He followed his father as sheriff, but his father died in the line of duty while still a young man, while he's grown old without making much difference. Almost all the old people in the film are broken - Bell, his uncle, Carla's mom, the owner of the gas station Chigurh toys with (""you married into it"").<br/><br/>Evil is portrayed as something that can infect you simply by proximity. The boys on the bicycles are corrupted because of their brief encounter with Chigurh - they agree to lie to the police; one removes his shirt, revealing himself to evil/Chigurh; and as Chigurh walks off, they can be heard arguing about the money. It's implied Chigurh got the money when he killed Llewellyn. The way he removes the hundred-dollar bill and hands it to the boy echoes the way Llewellyn paid the cashiers earlier in the film. Both times the bill is bloodstained.<br/><br/>Llewellyn is not evil in the sense that Chigurh is, but he is not blameless. He tolerates evil and tries to profit from it. He commits each of the seven deadly sins at some point - greed, pride, sloth, anger, envy and lust, definitely; possibly gluttony. Wells, the bounty hunter, tells him Chigurh has principles ""of a sort,"" while Llewellyn and Wells do not. Chigurh tells Carla Jean that Llewellyn betrayed her by protecting his own life while not agreeing to a deal that would save hers. This contradicts what Wells told Llewellyn, that Chigurh would not offer him a deal. He does, but Llewellyn is too dense or prideful to take it. He was able to escape Chigurh once, and in his arrogance thinks that he can again, and Carla Jean pays the price.<br/><br/>Chigurh's motives for his murders, beyond the fact that he is a hired killer (he's only hired to kill one person in the film), seem to be sexual. It's implied when he garrotes the deputy that he is deriving pleasure from it. It is staged as a sexual encounter; his expression when the deed is done is post-coital. At times his conversations with the victims resemble foreplay. Carla Jean, however, refuses to play along and give him his pleasure by calling the coin toss; her murder is thus most like a rape.<br/><br/>I think neither Bell nor Chigurh lives much longer after the story. Chigurh is broken in a way he cannot fix alone (a bone - his structure - has fractured and pushed its way out of him). Bell is existentially broken, powerless to even slow evil down, and his chance to die young, with glory, is long gone. There's nothing left for him but look for his father and join him at the fire. This refers to the exchange between Carla Jean and Llewellyn when he tells her to tell his mother that he loves her, and she says ""your mother is dead."" ""Then I'll tell her myself."" The last line is like a jail cell door closing - Bell tells his dream to his wife and expresses one last hope that he will be reunited with his father...""And then I woke up."" <br/><br/>Other random observations: The plot is set in motion because Llewellyn, though presumably an experienced hunter familiar with the desert, is away from his vehicle without water (more below). All of the mayhem fails to attract much notice - the gun battles in the desert; Llewellyn and Chigurh's midnight shootout; Llewellyn's stumbling around at the border crossing and tossing the bag over the fence; his later wandering through the streets in a bathrobe; and the auto accident in broad daylight in the middle of a suburban neighborhood. Bell alludes to this anomaly early on when tells the story of the couple who were burying people in the backyard, but no one noticed until a naked man escaped and went walking down the street. And what was it with the boots? Much was made of characters putting on or removing them - Chigurh before sneaking up on the motel room, for instance. Llewellyn is specific about the kind of boots he wants, and is later seen wandering around in them while wearing almost nothing else. Blood pours out of Chigurh's boot in the hotel room when he removes it prior to digging out the buckshot in his leg. There's a POV shot of him moving his boot out of the way as Wells' blood creeps into the top of the frame, and he checks the soles of his boots, presumably for blood, after he leaves Carla Jean's mother's house. As in many of the Coen's crime stories, including ""Fargo,"" ""Blood Simple,"" and ""Man Who Wasn't There,"" the scheme goes awry because the protagonist makes one stupid choice - here, Llewellyn tries to expiate his sins by going back to the massacre with water for the dying man, even though he knows the man is almost surely dead and he risks discovery by doing so."

The problem is sometimes its not worth taking the ride with them, they seem to be exploring cinematic terrain and while that is notable you have to understand that there will be some wrong turns. No Country for Old Men is one such wrong turn, they seem to almost be toying with the audience, finding joy in making an almost completely backwards movie. Pay no attention to the trailer it will tell you nothing.<br/><br/>You think this movie revolves around Brolin, it actually is a film with three leads, Brolin, Bardem, and Jones. Eventually shifting to Jones near the end.<br/><br/>I know there's symbolism, and some of it is meant to be deep. I know this, but I just didn't like the film.

","This is the one movie that I allowed myself to go into with ridiculously high expectations. The reason was, that the source material, Cormac McCarthy's novel of the same name, was so perfectly suited to cinematic translation, and more specifically, to a cinematic translation at the hands of the Coen brothers. The novel was packed with a great cast of characters, a deliciously dark sense of humor, and set against the backdrop of the vast desert vistas and small towns of the American south. With stuff like this, I thought there was no way the Coen brothers could possibly go wrong, and I was right. The plot follows Lewellen Moss (Josh Brolin) who, while out hunting, discovers a stash of $2 million dollars in a drug deal gone wrong. Without fully understanding the consequences of taking the money Moss, something of a cross between average blue-collar Joe and resourceful survivalist, is thrust into a world of very dangerous men who will stop at nothing to get the money back. The brutal hunt is played against small town Sheriff Ed Tom Bell's (Tommy Lee Jones)own attempts to find and help Moss before it is too late. Cormac McCarthy, who is the premier chronicler of the loss of the American west, is here telling the story of the loss of small town America through the eyes of the over-matched Sheriff Bell who has a hard time coming to terms with the boldness and brutality of this new generation of outlaws. Figures like Anton Chigurh, who draws his victims into discussions about causality before having them flip a coin to decide their fate.<br/><br/>It's hard to comment on the film, because it's such a direct translation of the book, but I do have some complaints about the casting decisions. Chigurh, who is such a larger-than-life, terrifying, and seductive figure in the book really needed to be played by someone with more presence (I personally think Benicio Del Toro would have been perfect). While Javier Bardem does an okay job, he plays Chigurh too much as a pure psychopath and the biggest thing about his performance is his distracting hair cut (what was up with that?). Tommy Lee Jones also seemed a bit out of place in his role. Too often a leading man, it seemed impossible for him to play a thoroughly beaten old man who knows his limitations to draw the type of sympathy the part demanded.<br/><br/>Quibbles aside, the movie is propelled by its plot, and it's definitely a fun ride. Anyone that knows McCarthy's work knows they aren't going to a get a conventional feel good Hollywood fairytale, because McCarthy understands only too well that the world is a hard and pitiless place, and this ain't no country for old men."

","Be suspicious of a few negative reviews sticking out among overwhelmingly favorable ones; i.e., is this person trying to show how smart he/she is? Is he/she trying to attract attention? I like the Cohen brothers' movies and am generally optimistic about films. I didn't care for NCFOM.<br/><br/>FARGO was excellent in part because of the banal evil contrasted against the equally matter-of-fact goodness of McDormand's family, friends, etc. Good overcame evil without fanfare, moralizing or -for that matter- very much thought. Further contrast was provided by Macy and Buscemi's characters, who being lost somewhere south of good but north of pure evil, became doomed.<br/><br/>Watching NCFOM, I gathered in the meaning of Tommy Lee Jones opening narrative which laid out the good v. evil motif (if a bit explicitly). Thereafter the theme was supported by little more than cop banter until the end of the film when we get two lengthy and embarrassingly moralizing speeches from the sheriff's friend and family. I'm no intellectual. I can appreciate a movie strictly for style (MULHOLLAND DRIVE) with uneven style (DOGMA) or lacking traditional or cohesive narrative (tons of them). If that's what you set out to do, however, don't paint your film so tediously! Why provide such detailed plot? Why am I fed precious moments of Brolin's fashioning a hook to retrieve the money bag? Why waste minutes teaching us how to self-treat a shotgun injury or where to hide a handgun under a trailer? What am I to do with these details? Why infuse so much deadpan humor; e.g., mother-in-law's back seat rant and Bardem's deadpan monster (this is a relatively juvenile device,see the TERMINATOR). What am I to make of a Texas town entertaining dozens of gunshots and a car crash in the middle of the night with all the townsfolk remaining asleep? If I'm supposed to feel remorse for the futility of goodness I need to see goodness at least FACE the evil. Presently I won't visit West Texas because the lawmen are sipping coffee and the people are zombies.<br/><br/>The Cohen brothers are far better film makers than; e.g., Quentin Tarentino, but I saw a parallel with the hype for PULP FICTION, which I abhorred. I'd read a ton of reviews for each movie. Yet none of the reviews where able to tell me, besides the plot itself, WHY the movie was good or what it was supposed to convey. In other words, all the reviews were gushers of praise by apparently hypnotized viewers. I read Ebert's review after I watched NCFOM. Roger's our finest movie critic and a true gentleman. He has obviously read McCarthy and I have not. Usually after reading an Ebert review I realize how ignorant I am, Usually he points out specific things I didn't pick up or of which I am just unaware. I didn't feel that way this time. NCFOM just did not do it for me."

","If you wish to see a psychopathic monomaniacal killer with a peculiar choice of weapons dispatch his victims in a totally cold blooded way without a trace of humanity, then you might enjoy this film. I went because I enjoyed Tommy Lee Jones in ""The Fugitive"" and he has been reprising that role ever since. I did not like ""The 3 Burials of Esqui-somebody, and I did not like this film where he simply coasted and accomplished absolutely nothing. As the sheriff, he did not solve a single crime, did not make a single arrest, and never came to a face-off with the killer. In the end, a pointless tale. Big drug deals gone bad, and big money gone astray corrupt everyone they touch. We know. What else is new. I cannot recommend this film. I have ordered Cormac McCarthy's book of the same title as I am curious whether Hollywood script writers made major alterations in the story. Hollywood script writers are presently on strike. Based on recent movies I have seen, they should just all be fired and a whole new generation of writers given a try. They surely can do no worse."

","It must be hard being a Coen brother: knowing that no mater what you do it'll no doubt be compared to something from your ingenious, genre spanning filmography; Blood Simple, Miller's Crossing, Fargo, The Big Lebowski, O' Brother Where art Thou- the list goes on. That's no excuse for knocking-out out back-to-back let-downs that don't compare to Jaws 4, though. Alright, alright, that's a little harsh. Joel and Ethan's last 2 collaborations (Intollerable Cruelty, The Ladykillers) weren't that bad but they were found wanting in every trait and department we'd come to expect from the brothers grim: atmospheric set-ups, sublime photography, onion-like plots, cult characters, quirky humour, dark and light topics- inspired commitments to celluloid with a real sense of time and place. So what about No Country for Old Men? The Coens' perilously grave adaptation of Cormac Macarthy's acclaimed 2005 novel. Well, it doesn't so much signal a return to form as it does shove a cattle gun in your face while screaming ""GUESS WHO'S BACK AND GUNNING FOR Oscars!?""<br/><br/>Opening with an eerie and muted montage redolent of their first film Blood Simple, The Coens' loyal spin on Macarthy's western thriller is a slow-boiling affair that unfolds in and around the Tex-Mex border. It's 1980 and after stumbling across a drug-deal gone wrong, cunning 'nam vet Lleyweln Moss (Josh Brolin) makes off with a case full-of cash and changes his life forever. But not in a good way. Apparently the money belonged to an imposing and methodical, almost ghost like killer called Anton Chigurgh (Javier Bardem) who's either Death incarnate or Satan himself. Who or whatever he is, the Devil's advocate wants his money back and absolutely will not stop until he gets to Moss. Enter Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee-Jones), a nostalgic old-timer who's haunted by the mind of the modern-day criminal but will do whatever he can to stop ""the dismal tide"" and get to Moss before Chigurgh.<br/><br/>As the bodies pile up and the plot thickens, it becomes clear that No Country for Old Men is much more than a bloody game of cat and mouse with shot guns. It is a taut and chilling meditation on contemporary crime and criminality that bitterly chews on the themes of money, morality, youth, age, fate, faith, evil and society. And it's absolutely majestic. A meticulous and suspenseful fusion of cinematic art and high- quality entertainment with layers and substance in spades. The Coens even have the nerve to pepper their morbid principle-play with bouts of jet black humour. Hell, they even toss-in an abrupt ending. The brilliant bastards.<br/><br/>No Country for Old Men is their most profound and important film to date. Better than Fargo. Better than Miller's Crossing. It could well be their masterpiece. A bold claim, yes, but everything just seems to come together; the look, the score, the feel, the acting: Brolin, Bardem and Tommy Lee-Jones are all excellent. Former two giving stellar, break- through turns that'll kick-down doors for their careers. Brolin is bang- on as the dry and driven Moss and Bardem's forbidding portrayal of the mop-top hunter Chigurgh is nothing short of memorable. Woody Harleson's even in there with a guardian angel-like side character but it's Lee- Jones turn as the overwhelmed Sheriff that proves to be the most important and pertinent of the pack. His opening monologue and insights into what's unfolding speak not just for the Coens' 1980's based thriller but for today's world. ""A crime's so harsh these days it's hard to even take its measure"" Not only does Bell represent a cleaner, pre- drug generation but also the conscience of the film. He's more of a hamstrung bystander than the cop charged with bringing an end to the evil and bloodletting. His sombre and reflective words of thought and fear book end the film in some style and leave plenty of room for interpretation. ""When I got older I always thought that God would sorta come into my life. He didn't"".<br/><br/>Through their encyclopedic knowledge and love of film along with the exemplary photography of Roger Deakins, Joel and Ethan are able to extract the prose right from the pages of Macarthy's lucid parable and paint the screen with them. The Coens' do a little more than justice to the book. No Country for Old Men is a monumental piece of American film that could clean-up at this year's Oscars. And that's saying something when you consider the competition in The Assassination of Jesse James.. and There Will be Blood. My god, what a golden period for US cinema. This awesome Coen comeback is deserving of the best director(s) gong at the least. Joel and Ethan have set the bar for 2008 with an instant- classic. Miss this at your peril."

Possibly a way to understand the limits of our fixation on violence. <br/><br/>The Coens are just brilliant enough to possibly pull-off something like this. <br/><br/>And judging from the orgasmic praise this movie has received from the intelligista, it seems we might be in deep trouble."

"Jonny_Numb","8","7","13","8 December 2007"," No country for young men, either
","At various moments in ""No Country for Old Men,"" we are shown rusty, weather-beaten windmills squeaking in the dry desolation of the American Southwest, doing their 360-degree revelations in the passing wind. This imagery ties in nicely with the elliptical nature of the characters and plot (based on a novel by Cormac McCarthy), but also shows Joel and Ethan Coen coming full circle within their own career, as this film plays like a ""desert noir"" companion to their debut feature, ""Blood Simple"" (1985).<br/><br/>The brothers' requisite plot devicea large sum of money being stolen and sought afterfinds an Everyman foil in Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), who happens upon a massacre site where a drug deal went awry, and makes off with a satchel of cash pried from a dead man's hands. His wife, Carla Jean (Kelly Macdonald) is skeptical, and it is not until Llewelyn commits an act of charity that he finds himself in a relentless chase to outrun the innumerable factions seeking the cash. As in McCarthy's novel, these factions are vaguely defined at best, save for Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a seemingly indestructible boogeyman who possesses no loyalty, and only the faintest trace of humanity (some of his potential victims are absolved by the luck of a coin toss). Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (one of the ""old men"" of the title, played with depth and grace by Tommy Lee Jones) is the outsider intermediary, whose own jaded feelings toward the inexplicable senselessness of crime in America is magnified in the increasingly nihilistic pursuit between Chigurh and Moss.<br/><br/>""No Country"" is like a symphony of aesthetics, with the Coens showing an affinity for wide-angle photography (captured by DP Roger Deakins) of the vast American Southwest; close-ups of faces of a variety of ages, weathered by age or fatigue or shrapnel; sound-effects editing so razor-precise that the squeaking of an oxygen valve or the clicking of a safety-catch in an otherwise silent scene is enough to inspire chills. Also worth noting is the absence of musical score, with Carter Burwell's orchestrations swelling only a few moments after the end credits have started to roll.<br/><br/>I find it refreshing that, in our era of cinematic spectacle, replete with CGI-candy, that ""No Country"" derives much of its impact from the characters themselves, often filmed in the aforementioned close-ups that makes their dialogues resonate with a profoundalmost meditativeurgency, conveyed wonderfully in the subtly understated performances. This is an interesting adaptive choice on the Coens' part, since many of their films take a parodic approach toward ""country folk"" as witless yokels designed as vessels for comedy. And while ""No Country"" finds some clever comic asides (Moss's exchange with a testy American border guard is a gem), the tone is that of pervasively ominous uncertaintythe tags of ""hero"" and ""villain"" are not easily applied, and the Coens are not above showing the moral ambiguity of their characters with a flatly objective eye.<br/><br/>And the performances are indicative of this flat objectivity. Talented character actor Josh Brolin (""The Goonies""; ""Grindhouse"") embodies the quirks, flaws, and traits (both heroic and anti-heroic) of Llewelyn; Bardem is a towering iceberg of intimidation, whose Chigurh becomes an almost-infallible extension of some mythic desert dweller (existing solely in a world of self-obligation and passive violence); Jones brings a worldly wisdom and depth to Ed Tom, the glue that bonds the narrative; English actress Macdonald (probably best known for ""Trainspotting"") slips into a Southern accent and conveys the necessary fearand finally, acceptanceof being an unwitting pawn in a situation beyond her control.<br/><br/>In the end, there is a paradoxical thematic synthesis as two characters ""walk away"" from obligation and into a future that is, at best, uncertain (the characters ""unite"" in a slow fade); and while Bell's closing recollection of a dream veers into Oscar-nod territory, it perfectly resolves ""No Country for Old Men,"" a story so open-ended and incendiary that its grislier moments could easily be culled from today's national headlines. The movie may be set in 1980, but its parable-like presentation will prove timeless. One of 2007's best."

I tried to like it, given it's critical reviews, but found portions of it rather boring, and also couldn't figure out how certain characters got involved in the story at all. They often seemingly appeared out of nowhere, leaving you to ponder who they were and what relationship they had to other characters as the movie rolled on. And the ending has been well-documented. I would guess most viewers basically zone out at that point anticipating the next bit of action, and the next bit of action is the credits scrolling by. Fargo and The Big Lebowski remain on top of my Coen Bros. list, with No Country perhaps bringing up the rear. I have no trouble with movies that reqire some thought, but am not a big fan of those that simply try to confuse you."

That's reason enough for me to shell out the $11.50. Something I do less and less these days. Do I think I got my money's worth? Yes and no. For the first hour and change I was treated to a first rate thriller with grand, Sam Shepard's America type themes, a lot like Blood Simple actually. And I, the eager film goer, became immersed, developed a fondness and then considerable concern for the guy I took to be the protagonist. Then with less that a half hour to go, they did the darndest thing. They dipped out of my hero's story, at the climax of all places..in an edit that looked and felt like a bad projectionist had just changed reels. It was, as I've read here and elsewhere, a move in keeping with the style of the novel. The choice to tell the story in this way was apparently one of those form equals theme moves like Beckett's Waiting For Godot. I spent the better part of an hour chewing it over with my girlfriend. We're not the sharpest knives in the drawer for sure, so maybe a second viewing will give me something more to hold on to."

","There are three actors that bring class to a great film or a not so great film. Morgan Freeman, Michael Cain and Tommy Lee Jones. There is only one reason I liked this overrated film and that is Tommy Lee Jones. He is better on his worst day's then most actors are on their best. I admire directors who challenge their audience by putting away the spoons but on this journey the fabulous Coan Brothers ask just a little to much of us. I haven't seen so much supernatural clairvoyance since the sixth sense. And the actors were constantly doing things that were beyond stupid. Bringing water to a man several hours later that obviously had only a few moments to live? I adored Fargo and Oh Brother. The Coens are very talented . But on this journey I had to keep asking myself did I miss something? In closing I will sum up by lifting a quot from another review I think is brilliant. ""NO WAY is this academy award material. Stupid man stumbles on $2 million. Psychopath somehow finds out about it and wants it. Chase ensues -. Old sheriff, a day late and a dollar short, retires. The End."" I give Old Country For Old Men 4 stars only because of Mr Tommy Lee Jones."

","The Coen Bros. who have a fine body of work, do a Good job of presenting Good vs. Evil, in "" No Country For Old Men."" The main message of the film seems to be that Good and Evil have no purely defined path or motivation, and they have more common interests than differences, interesting, but NO, that is simply not true. <br/><br/>Based on a novel by Cormac MeCarthy, the story centers around a drug deal gone bad in the Texas desert, and stumbled upon by Llewlyn Moss(Josh Brolin). He tracks down the theoretical last man standing,(the one who carries the money away), that person is found dead, with $2 Million dollars. Not one to turn down his new found wealth, he takes the buckaroos and goes back to the trailer court where he lives with his wife.<br/><br/>Feeling guilt by not assisting one of the dying drug dealers, he returns in the dark of the evening to give him water, only to find himself being hunted down by more henchmen. He escapes, but the money men hire a psychopath,Anton Chigurh(Javier Bardem), to recover the $2 Million , in his own way. Of course he kills people at random, anyone who he chooses to ,sometimes by the flip of a coin, as if he has no will of his own. He is just a regular killing machine, and he has a unique(plot device) way of doing it. <br/><br/>So , you have two story lines going, and then enter a third story line,Carson Wells(Woody Harrelson), a bounty hunter sent by the money men to stop Anton Chigurh. Needless to say, the hunter becomes the hunted. The film moves at a nice pace, the music score kept to a minimum, with regular sounds , ramping up the creepiness... The performances are solid by the top 3, Javier, Tommy Lee, and especially Josh Brolin, who has really developed into a top flight Actor!!!<br/><br/>The major flaw of the film is similar , believe it or not to ""Smokey and the Bandit"", the two main protagonists, do not meet, and without conflict, there is no resolution. And finally, at the very end where Tommy Lee Jones is rambling on about his 2 dreams, the film cuts to the credits, hummmm, what is wrong with this ?, NO Resolution.. Yes, this does mirror life, but I like my films , like a good cup of coffee, you know that it will end with some satisfaction.... It is 90% a good film, but doesn't satisfy....Maybe the DVD will have 4 endings , like ""Apocalypse Now."", at least you would have a choice...<br/><br/>There is also the premise in the film that ,most cops are not hip, and that they don't connect the dots, I found that somewhat insulting, because with all of the murder and mayhem, that scenario is very unlikely.... So, if you like a film with no resolution, or non-ending then you should see it, but don't expect fireworks, just a good, tense thriller with an undefined ending, like math,you can't divide by zero...."

This is just more of the same old snuff porn that has been making the rounds of Hollywood since at least ""The Godfather"", except now it's being directed by the usually incomprehensible and slow-as-molasses Coen Brothers, who seem to have decided to exchange art for profit, this time around, by following the psychopathic-killer-on-a-rampage gravy train all the way to the bank and giving the dumbed-down US public what they really crave: a virtual murder spree à la Grand Theft Auto with lots of comic book horror. Not that you couldn't see that coming all the way back with ""Blood Simple"", of course...

The Coens are superbly talented and I have to admit I wish I had been born with their remarkable talents. I went at 1:00 pm and was in the theater with five other people scattered about. I was so excited, as I hadn't been to a movie theater in probably five years and went to see it on the sly while my husband was at work. I anxiously sat through the trailers and then the movie began. It dragged along and I kept looking at my watch. It dragged along some more and I checked my watch again. I thought his movie would never end, and then when it did end it ended so abruptly with the plot hanging that no one in the theater moved. It was like all of us were stupefied. I thought about it all the way driving home. Did I miss something? Was this really an intellectual movie that was supposed to carry the audience into some deep abyss of thought--good v. evil, etc., or what? I'm a college graduate, school teacher, a ""thinker"", but the $5.50 matinée price of the ticket was more than what I got out of the movie. I was sooooo disappointed. The Coens clever little tricks and remarks that add so much color and flavor to their work emerged weakly in spots, but I guess I expected more witticism and quirkiness, and I was very disappointed that I wasn't treated to this side of their talent. Like another reviewer who didn't like this movie, I also wish the loose ends had been sewn up. With all the problems in the world today, I want the movies I see to allow me to leave the theater with the story in place, without having to dig deep and ponder some hidden meaning or esoteric something or other. That takes too much energy in this heavy energy-expending world. I asked a worker at the theater if he had understood the movie and he said he heard that the killer supposedly represented the devil, but that's all he got out of it. I wish that the scene changes hadn't been so choppy in places (editing?)and had not been spattered with white flecks that made it seem like it was an old film from the 1930s. The acting was definitely noteworthy. Anyway, I was sorely disappointed. I wanted another clever film, one I would later purchase on DVD and watch over and over again with enjoyment. Maybe not another Oh Brother, but something comparable in style. My advice to movie goers is to give this movie a shot, but you may be disappointed for what you pay for the price of the ticket."

Lot's of things happen and even there are only a few characters, the movie gets a fast speed. But as the movie is thrilling at the beginning, it gets annoying in the second halftime. The same things happen again and again just in a little different way exactly how there are some illogical incidents that will bewilder you.<br/><br/>I didn't't like the bad guy at all but got all my symphaty for the good one and I think the personification of good and evil was just too obviously.

First I was extremely bored and annoyed. The plot is of a typical action movie featuring Steven Seagal. What's different is that there are moments of long silence and static scenes. Like you would expect from an intelligent drama. And well, there's nothing intelligent about this movie. This is somehow due to the fact that you don't get emotionally involved with any character. That because you don't know anything about them<br/><br/>It's an extremely confusing movie. You don't know what does the guy intend to do with the money, who the hell are those Mexicans, whats up with the maniac killing everybody, who is that maniac by the way, who is the guy popping up in the middle of the film, why doesn't he take the money etc. I didn't even understand the main guy had been killed firstly. Characters just pop up out of nowhere and disappear just as suddenly.<br/><br/>There is also some boring sheriff there, meditating about life and telling stories of his father. <br/><br/>Maybe I just didn't understand the movie. There are a few persons that told me they liked it. Maybe in those long moments of silence and boredom I should've been impressed or something. But it's hard to be touched when the only thing that ever happens is someone else getting killed. I think it's one of those movies: you love it or hate it<br/><br/>Just to clarify, as I said a few times about how boring it was. I am not saying I wanted an action movie with big booms and crazy gunfire. I am saying there were moments when I was thinking : ""ok , now I should cry or what?! get on with the next scene!""<br/><br/>The only thing I liked about the movie was the acting of Javier Bardem. he created a great character."

NCFOM is a gritty, dark, southern Gothic thriller adapted by the brilliant Coens from McCarthy's visceral novel. The Performances are superb throughout, Brolin, Jones, and Harrelson are great and Javier Bardem simply becomes the psychopathic Anton Chigurh who represents a relentless evil and in a way an amoral judge. People say that it's easy to play a psycho, well when one embodies a deranged mind so completely subtle nuances, idiosyncrasies and all then a praiseworthy performance results (remeber Hopkins' Lecter and Kathy Bates' Annie Wilkes). In essence what i'm saying is, you will never forget Bardem's role after watching this film. The Coens yet again manage to fill this grizzly story with their unique humour especially when Jones and Harrelson are on screen, delivering some great one-liners. What must be commended most of all is the brothers' directing, coupled with a stunning, sun-scorched cinematography of the Texas wasteland, every shot in the film is a work of art. Every frame seems to be utterly planned out with amazing composition and style, hats off! I only wrote this review because i went to see this film 3 times in the cinema in one week, which is a first for me, and i could not stand to have people giving ridiculous scores of 1/10 to this masterpiece, simply because they did not absorb anything it has to offer (and it has plenty!) So 10/10 to the best picture of the year!"

","OK not everyone likes all movies. I hated Closer and this and the Star Wars I II and III. This for me was a meaningless load of drivel - what was the point? Either it is just so clever that I missed it or it really is crap. Javier Bardem goes around killing people and your point is? For me acts of random violence are just that meaningless acts of random violence. David Grey shooting people - if you were one of the people shot it would be terrible but there is no story in it for me - it just happened and this is how I see this movie. Sorry Coen Brothers and as for Oscars well I know they are a complete farce after this won one."

","Charged with all the appeal of fingernails on a chalkboard this movie mindlessly wanders about before mercifully ending. Much like Tommy Lee Jones does in this movie as he wanders around mumbling to himself and picking his nose. What a waste of a great actor although his performance did give me a title for this review. Let's start with some of the basics of good film making.<br/><br/>1) Did the movie present strong characters in such a way that the audience cares what happens to them? Nope, there's no one I want to know better nor is there anyone I hate. Much like the rest of the movie they are a 2 dimensional cardboard cutouts moving through a 2 dimensional landscape. the only time the characters really elicit emotion is when they are killed since that probably means they won't be coming back to bore me any more.<br/><br/>2) Is the plot believable enough not to detract from the movie? In this movie there is one absurdity heaped on another. When you combine that with the terminally slow pace of the movie, you'll have lots of time to pick up all the flaws which will destroy the illusion of reality. Here we have a case where huge numbers of people are killed, even police and yet Chighur moves freely about without fear of reprisal. Law enforcement in the states he moves through is apparently all on strike. They don't even bother showing up for running gun battles in the street accompanied by crashing vehicles. Sheriff Bell's vigorous attempts to catch the man who killed his deputy mostly involve drinking coffee with retired lawmen and plodding along to scenes of crimes long after the criminals have left.<br/><br/>Well, I lost enough of my life to this movie just watching it and this is about all I'll lose warning others of it..."

","I have to say that this movie was intriguing, full of surprises and more violent than I expected. And although I suppose I understand the intentions of the plot, as convoluted as it was, I am kind of disheartened that it won so many academy awards. It's not just that it was full of errors (check the goof section), nor is it that in my own humble unprofessional opinion that although Javier Bardem was great, I saw no acting that was worth the award - I just don't think the role was written well enough to support it. But most of all, I really don't know what to make of anything anymore when a film of such overwhelming violence is put on such a coveted pedestal. Yes, I am aware that there have been other violent movies that have won, and maybe it is just the sad revelation that as I get older, what we see as entertainment - strike that - what we see as THE BEST of entertainment, is still nothing more than useless violence that carries with it no repercussions for the guilty. The film industry rarely gives us what we need, but feeds us over the top with what we shouldn't have; glorifying theft, betrayal, greed, and as we see in our latest best picture, murder. Maybe I'm just getting older, I don't know. Personally I can handle the violence and all the other garbage, but I also believe the more graphic and blatant our so called entertainment becomes, the less value it must have. But as I said, this is just my unprofessional opinion, so I'll end this ""review/rant"" with this; if you are in the mood for a story full of death, some of it implied, some of it right there for you to enjoy - and if you are itching for a movie with no happy or justifiable ending, leaving you feeling like you went on a ride that was supposed to be the best ever but was really just sitting in your car parked in your garage with the motor running, then by all means...Enjoy!"

","This film is rubbish but before I start talking about how rubbish it is I have to tell you something which you must understand and be aware of. If you haven't seen this rubbish film then you shouldn't read what I am about to write because I have written some talking which have details all about almost all of the plot. I would suggest most pleasantly that you DO NOT READ THIS because it will be bad for you and will spoil things in this movie.<br/><br/>A lot of people have been tricked into liking this film because this is one of those films that tries to make you think it's better than it actually is, but if you think about it you will see it's rubbish. Everybody mumbles or wails like pigeons. I wish I could make sounds on this website to explain.<br/><br/>It's all about a man who finds some money and runs off. He's being chased by a man who wants to kill him and steal his money. This man has weird hair that hangs off his head like yesterday's tacos and he is annoying to look at. He mumbles so nobody knows what he is saying. He carries a silly little toy (that is actually massive) that kills people with little puffs of air (as if air could kill people LOL!). He is being chased by a crooked old man who is a sheriff who always looks like he's about to cry. The man with the money even has a wife (she's the one who sounds like a pigeon) who looks miserable and has a face like a wedge of cheese. There are WAY TOO MANY characters in this film.<br/><br/>What is also rubbish is that we never see what's happening because the camera is pointing in the wrong direction for all the exciting stuff like killings and explosions. It takes 10 boring minutes of planning an explosion and then when it happens it's in the background and we can't see it properly. When everyone gets killed at the end (which is rubbish) the camera is pointing at the sheriff driving a car, and WE DON'T EVEN SEE IT HAPPEN! LOL it's like a space movie where everyone sits in a room and then someone comes in and says we've just come back from space and we had a big fight with some aliens. That would be rubbish and this film is just like that."

","Well. What can I say other than: ""I was wrong""?<br/><br/>I completely misread this film. At first it angered me with it's dangling situations and lack of conclusions. <br/><br/>Still, I watched it again and again, at least seven times. (Not an easy task as this film was never in wide release in my area.) I watched it again and again and if you asked me why I was continually watching a film I claimed I didn't care for, I would have no answer for you...<br/><br/>Other than it mesmerized me and there was something deep within the film I had missed in my reactionary knee-jerk original response (Which is below.)<br/><br/>Don't watch this film. Study it. Over and over again. Javier Bardem MUST get an Oscar for his amazingly cold portrayal of a mechanical killer. In fact, every actor in the film is worthy of praise.<br/><br/>Does it end tidily? no. Not by a long shot.<br/><br/>This story is not the ending...<br/><br/>see it again and again.<br/><br/>You'll find the genius in it.<br/><br/>------------- This is an awful tease of a story that ends abruptly just when you think every aspect of it will begin to come together to form a D'enouement or climax, or at least make sense.<br/><br/>It is a pointless, ponderous, pretentious film consisting of nothing but light, shadow and words (-and precious few words at that!). I have watched it four times and it is an intellectual and emotional sucker punch. Not since 'The Majestic' and 'Gigli' have I gone to the theater and felt so robbed.<br/><br/>Though moody and well shot, I didn't find it entertaining or clever. The lead character is killed off screen. His wife might be dead. The money is gone. And we are left with not the slightest idea or hint of what really happened, other than a monologue from a retired sheriff who whines about how he finally realized he had a thankless, dangerous job.<br/><br/>It is a film you have to sit through so you can (finally) get the point of it; violence is dangerous to people and if they're lucky, makes them old before their time. Maybe that's a surprising idea to some, but as a combat veteran, I don't need to sit through a film to know that. <br/><br/>I'll go out on a limb here and offer that anybody who has ever rubbed shoulders with trauma doesn't need an overly long Hollywood treatment to tell them violence is unsettling and soul consuming. <br/><br/>This is a film devoid of any conclusions, repercussions, resolutions or (finally) value. Yet, Apparently we're all supposed to rush down to Starbucks and huddle in excited circles while we discuss amongst ourselves <br/><br/>The phrase 'cop-out' comes to mind. In fact this movie reeks of a film school student trying way too hard. It would have made a better graphic novel. <br/><br/>People who find value in this film are the same suggestible types who see Jesus in a piece of toast, or the virgin Mary in a rust stain on a highway overpass...<br/><br/>THERE IS A REASON WHY THIS FILM NEVER HAD A WIDE RELEASE. When an expensive film fails to achieve a wide release it is the studio or producers or distributors or even the director(s) telling you it is a flawed film.<br/><br/>Honestly, each time I left the theater I felt as if I was denied the second half of the film...<br/><br/>Save your time and money."

Although the movie is visually compelling and works for about the first 45 minutes; there really isn't much after that. it just goes downhill faster than an avalanche sliding down a mountain.the end is such an anti-climax that it leaves the viewer feeling ripped of and taken for a joke. it makes the whole movie suck and (me at least) never wanting to see it again.

"wright_hinsdale","1","11","24","12 April 2008"," dumbest. movie. ever.
","No Country for Old Men is a pretentious, over-the-top slasher film for the art house crowd. Think Friday the Thirteenth meets Ingmar Bergmen.<br/><br/>Without giving anything away, the movie's plot can be summarized as follows: Guy finds money. Bad guy chases guy (killing pretty much everything in his path). Other people show up for no particular reason, and add nothing to the plot (other then to often be victims of the bad guy). Sheriff sips coffee and murmurs silly coffee house philosophy. The end.<br/><br/>Of course, it's all supposed to be quite artsy. Maybe the bad guy's a murdering psychopath. Maybe he's Fate. Maybe he's death incarnate. Or maybe he's just Freddy Kruger with a bolt gun and a great big silenced rifle. It doesn't really matter because the movie doesn't actually make anything of any of this. Fans of the film say it's ""mirroring the randomness of life"" or ""it's a morality play"" or ""it shows how the characters' fates are intertwined"" (all of which can be said about Spongebob Squarepants as well). But what's it all add up to? Tommie Lee Jones mumbles about this in the end, but his monologue feels tacked on and superfluous, like a Jerry Springer lesson at the end of one of his shows.<br/><br/>The film's also been lauded for having great cinematography and shot selection  which it does. But this only highlights the emptiness of it all, like a high-gloss paint job on my '72 Pacer. Want to see a guy get strangled in real time from an artsy overhead angle? It's in there. Want to see compound fractures, decomposing bodies, brain splattering head shots, and buckets of blood? It's got that too  but again, it doesn't add to our understanding of the plot or the characters.<br/><br/>Don't listen to the hype."
"rads2005","1","12","27","29 February 2008"," What a PIECE OF CRAP
","I gave this movie one star because there's no option for zero stars.<br/><br/>This movie reminds me of a story I once read. A mother, disgusted with modern art and its pretentious nature, had her two year old daughter finger paint on various canvases. One such canvas featured about 6 different colored vertical lines. She entered this piece as her own work in a modern art competition, entitled ""Dance of the Trees."" The work won. after she revealed who had actually done the work of art, the award was taken away, but not before she had made her point.<br/><br/>Another example? In the Museum of Modern Art, in NYC, a prominently featured exhibit is a blank white room where the lights turn off and on every 5 seconds. I kid you not.<br/><br/>You'll get all sorts of weird, hideously stupid and boring things that people call art. I guess I don't mind people having their own opinions about various things, it's just that I find it incredibly bizarre. You're not a bad person for liking these types of things, just understand that most normal people are laughing their ass off at you while you adjust your glasses and the guy next to you is thinking about giving you a wedgie.<br/><br/>This movie is another of those obtuse pieces of art that I fail to comprehend, mainly because I'm normal and still have my sanity. I must say I'm amused by many of these fawning IMDb reviews. It's like a bunch of pseudo intellectuals, nodding sagely at for instance the above MOMA reference, and creating some pseudo-intellectual artsy-fartsy reason about why you should love it. Other people join in, thinking that they'll look uncultured and stupid if they say they ""don't get it,"" when everyone else so obviously seems to. Look, the emperor has no clothes! anyway, as you might imagine, I found this movie to be a complete and utter waste of two hours of my life that I'll never get back. What a complete piece of crap. There's some decent acting in there, but so what? that's like saying at least it's not too cold in hell."

","The film starts like a thriller. We meet Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) who seems to be killing for fun. Then we meet Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) who finds a bag full of dollars. And then, Anton is chasing Moss. The film moves like a thriller. But unfortunately, it does not end like one.<br/><br/>There is no history or reason to Bardem's character. He is pure evil. He is invincible. On the contrary, Brolin's character is real and vulnerable. This difference in their characters lends a demon-vs-human kind of feel to the story. But the second half of the film disappoints. Chigurh's chase and Moss' accidental fortune both end in nothing. Then there is Tommy Lee Jones character which I found added nothing to the storyline, other than dollops of philosophical musings.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem packs in a powerhouse performance. The cinematography is fantastic. Coen brothers do create an interesting character in Chigurh. But all that are achievements in isolation. I failed to understand what the story was about. It would have been an interesting thriller with a more simpler and straight forward climax."

In the real world he would have been in deep trouble for abandoning his line of duty, rather than happily engage in pseudo- philosophical thoughts.

For some reason, the directors have taken all the revenge they ever wanted to take on movie lovers. <br/><br/>The movie is so frustrating and irritating, and it ends up nowhere.I am not at all interested in putting up a brief summary of the plot here. Actually, the movie just stops. JUST STOPS!!!!Probably, the producers were out of money to shoot further. Perhaps, the movie title should be, ""No money for a complete movie"" or ""No brains for Oscar jury"". <br/><br/>It is doubtless that it is the worst ever movie to win an Oscar.If you always expect an Oscar movie to be a whole lot entertaining and amusing, keeping in mind Titanic or Lord of the rings or any other, you are dead mistaken. Well, even I made that mistake. This movie doesn't have any sort of entertainment. It's no way an Oscar worthy movie.<br/><br/>Though there were some instances where there was good acting from, Javier Bardem, it was of no use. Some of the conversations in the movie seemed as if they were written by a school going kid.

And it happens off-screen. The movie leaves us with no clue if the assassin retrieved his lost money bag. He is just shown walking away with a bone sticking out of his elbow. There is a large store of such intriguing and complex, yet stupid, senseless ideas in this movie. If this movie is the best of 2007, does that mean all others were worse than this???????No way there are a hell lot of good movies in 2007. They are much better than this one. I have read many people saying it leaves a mark on the memory of those who see the movie. It's true. It left a horrendous impression on my mind. The memory of this movie is still stinking in my mind. I waited at least for a satisfying end but the directors dumped it too. Some stated they watched the movie twice to understand every detail of it.

With tremendous efforts from Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones, I thought I was settling into a memorable picture. Even the Oscar winning mommas boy, Javier Bardem, was giving everything he had. (Who is this guy again and why do I care?) The cinematography was beautiful. The drama was wonderful, building excitement with every minute.

Then time started to run out and I was beginning to get nervous. I kept waiting for it to happen, but it just never did.<br/><br/>This is not a great movie; this is a bad movie with great acting, which is almost becoming a clique in Hollywood these days. Terrible direction and no storyline. This movie could have been above average, but instead the directors got caught being too cute. Trying to make some sort of statement, which had no meaning to the picture itself? Instead of just ending the film, I was left with nothing. Don't get me wrong, questions for the sake of being mysterious is good. Questions that leave me saying what the #@*^ was that, is not good. It's really, really, really bad. In any event, I give it a 5 out of 10. For what they gave me, half a movie. And why do I want to see the so-called ""bad guy"" win?

"MichaelMargetis","10","10","22","23 November 2007"," The Coen Brother's Finest
","Anton Chigurh: What's the most you ever lost on a coin toss.<br/><br/>Goddamn! The Coen Brothers are back and in full form. It seems as though 'No Country For Old Men' is the film to beat this year for the coveted Best Picture Oscar prize. Although it was a different film than I expected, it's every bit as powerful, tense, awkwardly funny and relevant as I had hoped, perhaps even more so. Based on Cormac McCarthy's critically acclaimed novel of the same name, 'No Country For Old Men' is a deeply symbolic and straight-forward story of the struggle between good and evil. The film opens with a flawlessly delivered monologue by the ever-so-great Tommy Lee Jones who portrays Sheriff Ed Tom Bell. Bell is a small-town sheriff in the state of Texas, and in his monologue he talks about how hardened and ruthless we've become as a society. ""The crimes we see today...it's hard to even take it's measure. It's just all out war."" mutters Bell. This monologue is the perfect setting for Llewyn Moss (Josh Brolin) who while hunting antelope in the desert stumbles upon half a dozen dead Mexicans, heroin and $2.4 Million. Being the road scholar he is, Moss figures no one will come looking for the moo-la if he snatches it. WRONG! Not only does the Mexican mafia and reputable bounty hunter / smart-ass Carson Welles (Woody Harrelson) pursue Moss, but also one of the most twisted, unpredictable and unreasonable villains in recent film history. His name is Anton Chirguh (Javier Bardem), and when he's not blowing innocent civilians' heads off with a cattle gun or flipping a coin to determine whether you live or die, he quietly observes everybody and everything around him.<br/><br/>'No Country For Old Men' is a triumph in film-making in that the film has no real flaws. Critics might pan it as ""slow-moving"" but that's essential in order to correctly build the tension for the key scenes. Most of the film is actually quite fast-paced with such nerve-wracking sequences it will have you on the edge of your seat with a knot in your stomach for a majority of it's runtime. But 'No Country's' quiet and subtle scenes are every bit as powerful as it's action-packed and suspenseful ones. This is due in large part to the screenplay. Supposedly following very closely to McCormac's novel, the Coen brothers deliver their finest work EVER from a screen writing perspective. Yes, it's even better than 'Fargo'. As for the Coen's directing and editing, it has never been smoother. The film's transitions are nothing short of breathtaking.<br/><br/>From an acting stand-point 'No Country For Old Men' is also incredible. The stand-out of the film is of course Javier Bardem as the ruthless homicidal maniac Chirguh. Just his facial expressions and body language is enough to make your skin crawl, and if that's not enough, he delivers every line including his catch-phrase ""friend-O"" with such brooding intensity and creepiness it makes you want to sink in your seat. Bardem is a lock for a Best Supporting Actor nomination this Oscar season, but his biggest competition is the two other key performances of the film. Josh Brolin who last week impressed me with his malicious turn in 'American Gangster' as a crooked cop, is the best he's ever been here in the role of Moss. Moss is such an unlikely hero in the sense he is kind of dumb, not very nice, makes stupid decisions and yet we still root for him to escape the drudges of the Mexican mafia and even worse, the wrath of Chirguh. Tommy Lee Jones I'd say is Bardem's biggest competition. With this and 'In the Valley of Elah', Jones has proved this year with these two performances that if anything he's getting better with age. Jones' monologues are flawlessly delivered like I previously stated, including his final one which left me with goose bumps at the end of the picture. Woody Harrelson is humorous in his limited role as a sharp-witted and over-confident bounty hunter, and Scottish actress Kelly MacDonald is phenomenal in her role as Moss' butter-brain wife. The film has a numerous amount of strong small performances including Garret Dillahunt as Bell's Deputy, Tess Harper as Bell's wife and the 'Office Space' stapler guy (Stephen Root), in a well-played dramatic role as a crime boss. Roger Deakins outdoes himself yet again with some awesome cinematography, and while quiet and subtle, the film's music score is haunting.<br/><br/>There is no other film this year that I can recommend as highly as 'No Country For Old Men'. There are times when it has you on the edge of your seat in suspense, there are times when it has you laughing violently at some of the darkly humorous scenes and through-out the entire 121 minutes it has you using your brain. There's a lot of symbolism and powerful metaphors in the film, but since I'm not writing a 5-page essay, I'll let you figure them out for yourself. With 'No Country For Old Men' the Coen Brothers have once again raised the bar on how outstanding and thought-provoking a simple crime-drama can be. Grade: A"

How did the killer know where to find Llewellyn in the second town (I've forgotten its name, was it El Paso?), and at which hotel (most American towns, even small ones, have lots of places to stay, perhaps you get a discount for staying at the 'Hotel for Potential Murder Victims', or 'Hotel Feeble Plot Device') <br/><br/>8. Why was the transponder a) so poorly hidden, surely a decent drug gang would have hidden it in the fabric of the case rather than sticking it between a few notes on the top layer. <br/><br/>9. Why was the transponder flashing? Surely you'd want to keep the power consumption to a minimum - I was surprised it wasn't going BEEP BEEP too. <br/><br/>10. What kind of idiot sits right behind the door than an armed murderer is coming through? (Hint - Llewellyn), a smart murderer with a silenced gun might even put a couple of bullets through first in case there's someone sitting etc.<br/><br/>11. As others have remarked, do the Texas police regard the murder of one of their colleagues as of no more significance than a parking offence? <br/><br/>12. Why was there only one policeman in the whole of Texas? (I suppose there were two deputies as well, but both of these were certifiable idiots and there was a fat guy late on, but what he was for is a mystery), have the FBI / DEA etc been closed down while no-one was looking? <br/><br/>13. Can you just walk over the border into Mexico, are all Mexican border guards permanently asleep or is this just another witty racial slur (surely he should have had a sombrero and a big moustache and have a radio playing 'La Cucaracha'))? <br/><br/>14. Do the nice Mexicans always wake up American bums with a nice Mariachi band in the morning? (Is this what the non-gang members do?) <br/><br/>15. Are Mexican hospitals all free for Americans? Someone should tell Obama so he could sort out US health care by just saying 'Go South, the Mexicans will fix you up for no charge.' Didn't anyone tell the US consulate in Juarez that one of their citizens was all shot up and in hospital - obviously the 'Murderers and stupid Gunmen's' news service is much better than the US government can manage. <br/><br/>16. I suppose it proves that Mexicans really are stupid by the fact that we all know (from watching this film) that all you have to do to get into the USA is to say 'I was in Vietnam'(Point of information - would this have worked for ex-Viet Cong too?) and check out when some unit was there - you even get a lift into town... Why do they all try to go through the desert? Silly people. <br/><br/>17. How did Carson Wells and Chigurh both work out where Llewellyn had gone? He'd told no-one, even his girlfriend had no idea and there was no compelling or even uncompelling reason given, and it seemed as though he was just trying to find the most difficult place to move around unconstrained? Given that a) all the dead people in the initial scene were Mexican, b) he knew that people were after him, and that c) they were Mexican, why not go, oh I don't know, north, to somewhere like, I don't know Fargo, North Dakota, where there aren't many Mexicans and the local police might take some interest at a van full of men in sombreros waving guns and no doubt shouting 'Arriba arriba!' while dancing on their hats and beating up a toy donkey. Besides a pregnant Frances McDormand is a much better bet than a mumbling Tommy Lee Jones if you want protection. <br/><br/>18. In fact, why wait anywhere? A 48 hour drive will take you a long way (say 16 hours a day at 60-65 mph - that's 1000 miles a day - Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas, etc), and you don't really need to stay in a nice unsafe motel overnight. <br/><br/>OK, I've decided. <br/><br/>It was rubbish."

","For a start I've only voted this a 1* in the interest of equilibrium, it's more like 4*, really.<br/><br/>This is one of those films where nothing seems to happen. There's plenty of killing, lots of beautifully shot locations, excellent acting, and absolutely no character development at all.<br/><br/>When it came to Woody Harrelson's final scene I just didn't care. I knew that this was supposed to be a pivotal part in the story, but even by the time he dies I knew or cared very little for his character, and didn't see how his death could change the outcome of the movie, which seemed from the start to be about an unstoppable psychopath.<br/><br/>I watched this with a friend who was entranced by the performances the whole way through, and when we came to discuss it he couldn't understand why I didn't like it, just as I couldn't understand what he got out of it.<br/><br/>Personally I think it alludes to a depth which it doesn't posses. It's unfair to compare them, but this seems to be caught up in the Saw bandwagon, wherein people are willing to laud praise on a film just because it's filled with grotesque violence.<br/><br/>If I have to sit through 90+ minutes of murders I expect to walk away with new perspective on life. If I just want to watch endless violence without any kind of perspective I can watch the news."

I dare say from now on i will not pay any attention to the Oscars in deciding on which film to watch. What a mess!!! We were still waiting for the film to start when it ended!! Maybe the whole accolade is a reflection of American's greed for violence and blood. They have thrown common sense into the bush and now revel in evil and blood letting. I think this is a further testimony to the fact that we are witnessing the gradual disintegration and demise of what was once a great Nation. I will probably boycott Hollywood after this experience.

"luke-346","10","7","14","25 January 2008"," A beautifully intellectual work of art, not for all audiences.
","Not since Fargo have these two talents, Joel & Ethan Coen, approached and delivered a text with such finesse. No Country for Old Men is an amalgamation of concentrated characters, beautifully constructed metaphors and intertwined narratives that consummate in an astounding subversion of the thriller genre. The film is an insightful interrogation of manhood, or more predominantly American manhood (so often witnessed in a lot of the Coen's work). With its unconventional storytelling and unorthodox narrative No Country for Old Men is a film that requires the viewer to be sagacious and perceptive in order to heed and unravel the films intertextuality. It is arguably one of those films that will require multiple viewings to fully appreciate it.<br/><br/>The film takes place on the Texas border in 1980 and tells of man called Llewlyn Moss (Josh Brolin) who stumbles upon a heroin trade off/massacre, loots two million dollars and returns to his wife Carla (Kelly Macdonald) only to succumb to his own stupidity and return to the scene at night to help a wounded man he had previously left for dead. A drugs cartel hire a recently escaped sociopath called Anton (Javier Bardem) to retrieve the money, meanwhile Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Le Jones) and his deputy investigate the massacre. The narrative model exercised here is evident throughout the majority of the Coen's work, this model being the recognition and tackling of an obstacle between the hero and the object of his/her desires - the obstacle often being the hero's stupidity. For example the fumbling naivety of Norville Barnes in The Hudsucker Proxy (1994), the endearing fatuousness of The Dude in The Big Lebowski (1998) and the bumbling buffoonery of the convicts in O'Brother, Where Art Thou (2000) all hinder progress.<br/><br/>Chiefly the film tackles the ideas of choice, fate and chance personified by the coin-toss scene at the beginning. However, No Country for Old Men employs an unconventional story which has dismayed some critics, some even citing occurrences in the plot as examples of the films faults. One such example is the timing and choice to dismiss a centrifugal character which has been described by some critics as an illustration of directorial arrogance and contempt for their audience. In a direct response to these widely held allegations I feel that the choice to dismiss this character was a brave decision and a more truthful representation on the musings of human life and its many dispositions fitting entirely with the over arching theme of the film. Criticisms of plot and narrative devices, such as the example mentioned, tend to occur because of a belief that generally speaking a film should serve up conventions that allow for it to be understood and followed and if these conventions are ignored or dismissed then the film is not a film but a mishmash of ideas. To put it bluntly I feel that this belief has developed through conditioning. Additionally it is often perceived that if a film challenges conventions or reworks them then it is, in essence, original - which is widely read as cinematic progress.<br/><br/>At its heart No Country for Old Men is a thriller that delivers brilliant levels of suspense, fear and apprehension whilst simultaneously disposing of the genre's preconceived conventions. The cinematography on show unashamedly harks back to the Coens debut Blood Simple (1983) and with their regular Cinematographer at the helm, Roger A. Deakins, it is no surprise that No Country for Old Men has been nominated for an Oscar in this category. The films score is so subtle that it aids the tension by unwittingly achieving an omnipotent silence recognisable only through an assortment of wind noises which have been superbly complemented by the bleak dialogue and dark humour.<br/><br/>To complement the film further it should be noted that on show here are some of the most powerful and flawless performances for some time and Tommy Lee Jones's is purely outstanding. His character embodies a demeanour of pensive sadness beautifully portrayed by the veteran actor in what is conceivably his best role to date (shocking that he has not been nominated for an Oscar, but this could be due to a lack of screen presence) it should also be noted that the final reels of the film are probably among his best ever committed to celluloid. Javier Barden's role as the relentless and ruthless psychotic killer is astounding, his on screen presence mesmerising and his mere appearance a pure treat. When it comes to playing a psychotic I would go so far to say that his performance has only ever been equaled by Anthony Hopkins portrayal of Hannibal Lector and maybe in years to come, dare I say it, better than.<br/><br/>I have yet to see its fellow 2007 Academy Award nominee There Will Be Blood, but No Country for Old Men is surely an Oscar winner and perhaps it will be the Coen's first as directors or second as writers. It is cinematic excellence of the highest pedigree that is both lasting and haunting."
"dave-3537","10","7","14","22 January 2008"," It's NOT about a ""deranged serial killer"" !
","SPOILER ALERT ----- SPOILER ALERT ------ SPOILER ALERT<br/><br/>This story is an ALLEGORY! To see it otherwise is to recognize only one level of meaning.<br/><br/>Do NOT read this until AFTER you've seen the film!!! <br/><br/>The title is from the first line of Sailing to Byzantium by William Butler Yeats, a classically trained poet and considered by many to be the greatest the 20th Century produced. This signals author McCarthy and the Coen brothers are up to more than just a drug deal gone awry.<br/><br/>Who is Anton Chigurh? He is Death. His hair style (hood-ish, shroud-ish) and black clothing suggest Death. As we know from the universe in which we live, Death takes the innocent as well as the guilty and has its own set of rules. When the witness to the high-rise killing asks, ""Are you going to kill me?"" Chigurh answers, ""It depends. Do you see me?"" When the kids on the bicycles help Chigurh after the car accident he tells them, ""You didn't see me."" You don't die unless you see Death. No one in the film dies at Death's hands without seeing Death. Sometimes you don't die even if you do. Chigurh walking away from the accident at the end shows that Death cannot be stopped. It will always exist.<br/><br/>Carson Wells compares Anton Chigurh to the Bubonic plague. The plague was vectored by rats upon which resided contaminated fleas. One small flea-like parasite is called a ""chigger"". Yes, like ""Chigurh"". Probably no coincidence. Death is not evil, however. It is as much a part of life as any of life's other qualities and remember Orson (not Carson) Welles's quote, ""Without death, life would have no meaning."" It does make one wonder whether McCarthy recalled this quote when assigning the name ""Carson Wells"".<br/><br/>Death kills with a cattle stun gun like a member of the clergy administering a cross to the forehead of a parishioner. In Western culture, Death often is portrayed as a hooded figure dressed in black with a scythe. In this case he's a ""hooded"" figure with a more modern weapon and black clothing.<br/><br/>Man is Llewellen Moss: part sinner, part saint. Offered a deal by Death (""This is the best deal you're gonna get""), Llewellen instead challenges Death and by so doing causes his wife's later death.<br/><br/>When Carla Jean tells the Sheriff, ""He won't quit, neither. Never has."" the audience expects a later showdown because we've been trained to see the protagonist take on the antagonist at the climax of a story in a High Noon ending. Before that can happen, however, life's randomness gets in the way --- the Mexicans kill him. This is the first major turn in the movie and the one which takes the sail out of the audience, which has been led to expect the showdown later and is now deprived of it. The audience is now adrift and probably is hoping Sheriff Bell will take vengeance. The audience is in for more surprises.<br/><br/>Free Will is Carla Jean. She chooses self-determinism and refuses to allow Death to be random. She has a chance to save herself but chooses not to call the coin toss. She is the bravest of the lot by choosing to die by her own decision.<br/><br/>The scene with the Sheriff and Death at the same hotel room at the same time is vital --- the Sheriff does not see Death and thus lives. This scene solidifies the allegory. The Sheriff enters the room but does not see Death and so does not die. This is the ""supernatural"" scene which signals we're watching an allegory, something more than it appears.<br/><br/>Death then claimed Carla Jean. Her refusal to call the coin is self-deterministic free will. <br/><br/>We misinterpret the protagonist at first. This is excellent misdirection. The High Noon showdown never occurs. That which does is off-screen! Some have criticized that after Moss's death the story is anti-climactic. Viewed with Moss as the protagonist it would be. But Moss isn't the protagonist. Sheriff Bell is. It is Sheriff Bell's story --- he is the philosopher attempting to understand the universe. At the end the Sheriff bemoans the fact God never entered his life. The irony is that God had. God had visited a plague upon Sheriff Bell's land in 1980 like the Great Death of 1348.<br/><br/>Ellis is described in the screenplay as having ""one clouded eye"". The Coen brothers' tribute to Ulysses/Odysseus utilized classical mythology --- remember Goodman's portrayal of the Cyclops and the Homeric figure on the handcar at the beginning? Is Ellis the Sophoclean chorus? Ellis says, ""You can't stop what's comin'"" and Llewellen, asked by the girl at the motel, answers, ""Lookin' for what's comin'"". Her answer to him is ""Yeah, but no one ever sees that."" Excellent thematic planting.<br/><br/>Ponder this parallel --- Moss buys a coat from some boys as he crosses the border; Chigurh buys a shirt from some other boys after the car accident. Think about it.<br/><br/>A few of the film's messages:<br/><br/>1 --- accept that Death is all around us all the time and will be coming for you. You can't hide from it; it won't stop; it will find you someday and you will see it.<br/><br/>2 --- forgive those who have wronged you. Holding onto anger and revenge will only eat you alive. Ellis, Sheriff Bell's wiser uncle, sums this up nicely when he talks about the man who shot him and left him paralyzed..<br/><br/>3  accept random violence as part of our existence. Watch the news and you'll see those lessons daily. Again, Ellis's anecdote about the 1908 killing of an ancestor on his porch illustrates this.<br/><br/>Enjoy this excellent film again!"
"jellobiafra2000","9","7","14","14 January 2008"," For The Viewer Who Desires a Challenge
","After viewing the Coen's ""No Country For Old Men,"" I encountered a number of people who professed a dislike of this film. The two reasons given were due to a lack of catharsis at the conclusion and the failure to fully develop certain characters. The lack of catharsis is a complaint that seems to spew from people who have grown to become familiar with the formula that the ""bad guy"" must lose and the ""good guy"" must win.<br/><br/>However, the Coen's are not interested in pursuing such a route. They instead give fate a physical manifestation in the character of Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a chillingly emotionless killer stalking through the plains of West Texas looking for a briefcase filled with money that has found its way into the lap of Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin). Moss, though a Vietnam vet, is in way over his head when he comes across the money, as Chigurh will stop at nothing to track down the Texas everyman. Lagging behind the both of them is sheriff Ed Tom Bell in a superb performance by Tommy Lee Jones. Jones is well aware of how sadistic Chigurh is, but resides in the twilight of his career, constantly leaving him a couple of steps behind Chigurh and Moss.<br/><br/>That is a very broad overview of a very complex plot, but I wish to address the critics of this masterful film noir. There is really no satisfying a viewer who can not find satisfaction without the absence of a macabre reality whereby your hometown hero may not conquer Goliath. Chigurh is the dictator of fate, and I believe there is a Satanic element in him, as evidenced by his name (the spear-header of the Church of Satan is named Anton Levey). Can an average Joe Texan and an over the hill lawman rise up to defeat Fate and his ethereal qualities? If the viewer desires a challenge, the answer is a resounding no. The viewer is forced to deal with the idea that Chigurh is not your average villain: scary for a while until his ultimate defeat. Fate can only be realistic when fate wins. Can you handle that dose of reality, or are films merely a vehicle for rapturous escapism? As far as character development, I keep hearing ""What was the point of Woody Harrelson""? Harrelson is the bounty hunter out to track the money for his employer, played by Stephen Root. People have argued that his character wasn't truly developed. My argument is that he wasn't supposed to be. The Coens have a great talent for introducing ancillary characters; Frannie's old high school pal Mike in ""Fargo"" comes to mind. I view these characters in a different light than most. I do not see these characters as their own entities; I see them as vehicles to enhance the dimensions of the main characters. The Coens don't ever resort to that corny method of having characters speak aloud to themselves just to reveal their true characters to the audience. Instead, they introduce these side character: We learn more about Chigurh from his conversation with Harrelson than we had learned about him from the whole film up to that point. He is the only character who actually knew Chigurh from the past, so Chigurh is talking to him in a way that is foreign to the rest of the film. Frannie's benevolent nature is amplified in her conversation with Mike in ""Fargo."" Both these films seem to have characters that do not drive the plot that much, but what they do is drive the other characters. To make complete and fully realized characters, the Coens ingeniously use the services of other unrealized characters.<br/><br/>For the viewer who recognizes fate for what it is in life and is not looking for the rewards of victory, ""No Country for Old Men"" is one of the top films of 2007."
"petersj-2","2","11","25","28 May 2008"," over rated and confusing
","There is nothing wrong with the acting in this movie. Indeed all the performers give strong characterisations. Visually at times it is splendid and the small cameo performances such as the two kids on their bikes fascinated with the guy's bone sticking out of his arm and handing him a shirt he uses as a sling. Scenes of an injured dog on the plains are heart breaking. There are some gruesome scenes unbearable to watch but that rarely worries me. I do think it becomes over done though. Shock and shlock! But in the end its a very over rated empty vessel. It is totally confusing, convoluted and incoherent. Either the film is badly edited and we end usp with a disconnected mess or the directors are trying to be too clever for their boots. Obviously audiences liked it but for this movie goer it was very unsatisfying and hardly worthy of an Oscar. Still if the Academy can over look a masterpieve like Broke Back Mountain and give it to a dud like Crash, what can one expect?. Another woeful unsatisfying move by two over rated movie makers. A cop out ending."

","This is good film with nice settings, story, acting and character development. It goes wrong when it tries to be too philosophical and preachy, especially from the Tommy Lee Johns character. Also the ending is terrible. It nicely builds up the characters of the good and bad guy then suddenly the good guy dies which is completely unnecessary. This part is similar to unexplained ending with the bad guy. I don't know what meaning of these are and I don't want to know. I am sure in the Caan film festival they can give a million explanations for weird evens like this. Would have been a fantastic film if it just delivered what a film is supposed to do instead of complicating things unnecessary."

I think that he did this dramatic and thrilling scenes just as he had to do , even better . He was out during narrative part because I think that he was sometimes bad because he looked too uninterested . Looks like he just wanted to do it . It wasn't done with soul .<br/><br/>Javier Bardem was great villain . I think that he won't act something better than this . He was silent and I was astonished with his performance . I think that he was well prepared for this role . He was great and I think that this fight scenes was just as he wanted . I know that it is hard to act some villain .

","I was hopeful of this movie, as I love many (not all) Coen brothers films. However, the implausibility of several scenes (Chigurh being able to bring his cuffed hands around to the front of his body - try it yourself - Chigurh just picking up the transponder signal initially by chance, Chigurh hauling around a big air tank, and so many others already pointed out by other reviewers), in addition to how the movie just fell apart at the end, earns a thumbs down here. And really, how does Woody find Moss in 3 hours? I can buy a character being evil and pointlessly doing evil things. I can even buy a character doing stupid things (going back to give the practically-dead drug dealer a drink of water before he dies, running back into the hotel where the madman is to see if the hotel clerk is OK, and on and on and on). But there are too many improbabilities that the viewer is asked to ignore."

","I watched this film knowing it was written by the Coen brothers. I have enjoyed their films in the past. I sat through this waiting for an ending, but none ever came. There is no hope in this story. There is no message. Parts of it were just plain wrong. The film was laconic and in the end, I wondered what role Tommy Lee Jones's character had in it at all. Nothing he did had any effect on any of the events or the characters. What were they thinking? Have the Coen brothers just grown mean? What I am wondering more than anything is how on earth this won Best Screenplay? This is why I no longer watch the Academy Awards. It this is the best that Hollywood can muster, then the film industry is doomed.<br/><br/>Where O Brother, Where Art Thou was clever, No Country for Old Men was cruel. There is nothing noteworthy about this film. The acting acting sustains a rather mundane piece of scripting.

","Where would there be a country for no old men? Logan's Run? The 1960's science fiction film based on the book of the same name where the main plot of the story is to voluntarily commit suicide by the age of 21. This might seem more plausible in one's own personal world of dreams. Herein lies the main fault with the latest Coen Brothers big screen extravaganza: No Country for Old Men. The tract of the film seems more like a personal dream by the Coen's and not a film script. Many groups of flickering images are presented before the eyes of the audience but there is little final transion to an outcome. Llewelyn Moss (JossBrolin) is one of the films heroes, pursed by a very psychotic killer called Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem). Llewelyn has stumbled into a very large drug deal, gone bad at the tale end. He grabs the money, like so many other Coen Brother plots and the chase begins. Unforturatly the pursuit is more like a Tom & Jerry cartoon. We meet many other characters who get in the way of the scramble, and just like in those Saturday morning cartoons, they die. Did I forget to mention the over narration by Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones)? Mr. Jones does very well, as he does in most of his efforts, because he has practiced his trade down to a fine art. Sheriff Ed is almost a re-creation of the role Mr. Jones played in Men in Black, and just as sarcastic. The Coen's undertaking is quite funny all the way to it's final flicker. Next time the Brother's Coen could use a bit more adhesive, less nightmare, and men of any age."

","Wow! I must to go with how I felt about this movie after I saw it and not be swayed by all the great reviews this movie received from the so-called ""movie critics."" THIS MOVIE SUCKS! My family has officially barred me from ever picking another movie for us to go see ever again! The start was slow. Then there were a few semi-interesting points and the end was dull! Wow, what were those critics drinking when they rated this movie? This is the exact same reason why the theater bottom line is suffering! People are not going to the movies anymore. They're buying boot-leg copies of these movies because of movies like this. This movie is being touted as one of the best movies of the year? Huh??? Wow! I will definitely wait until it comes out on DVD to see it again, just to be sure I didn't miss what all the hype is about. I went to see this movie premiere week and there were less than 50 people in the theater... Over 100 seats were EMPTY! That should've told me something there. I love old western movies. I also love suspense, drama and the unexpected. This movie had little to offer for my taste. Hopefully, those that rated this movie rated it using their own thoughts and not jumping on the bandwagon of some drunk, loony tunes Movie critics. I can guarantee money was exchanged under the table for some of those critics reviews, cause, THIS MOVIE STINKS!!!!!"

","When you think of watching ""No Country for Old Men"", think: Sam Peckinpah with only half the plot, and no conclusion. A movie in which Tommy Lee Jones provides the comic relief, spouting pseudo-Texas-isms, presumably to take shots at Dan Rather  Courage! Javier Bardem, an excellent Spanish actor who plays real roles in Spanish movies, is once again cast as an over-the-top maniac (as in 'Dance with the Devil'.) For this movie to have won Academy Awards is either telling us that 2007 sucked for good movies (although in 2007 Hollywood had record profits,) or that Academy members have a secret cabal to make the Awards seem as worthless as Nobel Peace Prizes!"

It's not so much about finishing it as it is enjoying the tastes, smells, sounds, and sights along the way. Can't wait to watch it again. It comes at a time where Hollywood is content soaking us in a stagnant pool of mediocrity. Breath in this fresh air people, take comfort in the fact that there are still those out there that care deeply about making great films. The Coens use of lesser known actors for pivotal roles can only attest to their vision. Big name actors playing leads can often be the Achilles heel of a potentially epic film. Past performances have a way of bleeding into the project. The Coen brothers tread carefully here ensuring that no compromises are made in the telling of this griping story."

The entire cast, writers, director, all of them are laughing at everyone who watches this mesh. There is nothing poignant or deep here.

One finds all kinds of money, and magically everyone knows where everyone else is all the time. Now some of this is explained by a bugging device, but somehow everyone knows who everyone else is.

Jones takes the part once handled by Gregory. It's unfortunate that Jones is not an actor, but acting is looked down upon by the twerps of modernism.<br/><br/>How does junk like this win awards?

","I was told before I watched this movie that the ending sucked. Well, I never could realize how awful a movie ending could be. The movie was moving at a good pace with ""the good guy"" Josh Brolin evading the silent psycho killer Anton. It was a cat and mouse game and the viewers were left ultimately rooting for Brolin even though his character had no real depth and we never really got a feel for him. That was what was really wrong with this movie, it had a bunch of random characters that were not developed, and we didn't care about them. Take the always awesome Woody Harrellson. What the heck was he doing in this movie? We see him come into an office and crack some jokes with a guy behind the desk and then he starts tracking the ""bad guy"" to supposedly stop him from slaughtering more people. Well, he finds Brolin in a hospital in Mexico and ten minutes later he gets killed sitting in a hotel room. Pointless role, and it served no purpose. Then just as you feel the movie is coming to a conclusion, we see Josh Brolin lying dead in a hotel room with like 25 minutes left in the movie. The rest of the movie consists of Tommy Lee Jones (who I love)engaging in pointless conversation about dreams, etc. Then the movie just rolls the credits! I was stunned that this movie was able to win best Picture. But I guess it follows along the lines of other sucky movies that win Best Picture. I was happy last year when a good movie like ""The Departed"" won for once. I recommend you to stay away from this one at all costs."
"Turfseer","4","6","12","22 February 2008"," More hokum from the Coen Brothers
","More semi-entertaining hokum from the Coen Brothers. It's quite curious that the mass killings by a sophisticated serial killer only garners the attention of one hick small-town sheriff and his staff. What happened to the FBI? Yes the DEA is mentioned but we never see them. What happened to all the media coverage? The serial killers picture would probably have made the national news and he should have been on the FBI's 10 most wanted list but we see none of that. Yes I know it's supposed to be 1980 but still the pursuit of this fugitive would have been a big story. The reason why the Coens don't show that is because they've created a totally unrealistic character that exists totally in their specious imagination. In real life there would have been hundreds of law enforcement agents tracking this guy but we never get a sense of that in this laughable scenario.<br/><br/>Although the story is supposed to be 25 years before our own time, the killer seems more like a specially trained Matt Damon CIA agent straight out of the Bourne Identity. He's so good that he knows how to create the perfect diversion to obtain the proper drugs and has the medical training to remove a bullet from his leg. He almost seems like a superman, gunning down anyone who comes into his path without a whimper from law enforcement. What's more he always seems to know how to find anybody he plans on eliminating. We also never completely understand his motives for killing the many innocent people he comes across. Is he simply a thrill killer who enjoys terrorizing the public at large? We never really learn anything about his past history. Usually there's a discussion amongst law enforcement officials detailing a killer's background--we never get a sense of that during this movie.<br/><br/>Just as we must have a Superman for an antagonist, we must also have a Superman for a protagonist. Josh Brolin, a welder who lives in a trailer park, seems like the perfect match for the evil Chigurh. Brolin's 'Llewelyn Moss' shows absolutely no fear taking $2 million from Mexicans, mostly all massacred at a crime scene. But suddenly, he has a pang of conscience which propels him back to the crime scene with a gallon of water to help one of the dying drug dealers. The average person would have called the police had they come upon such a scene; if he was amoral (as he is initially depicted), then he certainly wouldn't have been so stupid to return to the scene and put himself in such jeopardy. When he does return to the scene of the slaughter, suddenly he's a superman again, eluding a truck full of drug dealers shooting at him, swimming in the rapids and fending off a vicious dog who swims after him in the river. Then he devises this incredible plan where he stuffs the $2 million bucks in a ventilator shaft at the motel, has the drug dealers occupy his motel room (didn't they also have a transponder and would have discovered the bag in the shaft?) and has the serial killer eliminate the drug dealers and evades being eliminated himself.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Tommie Lee Jones, our hick sheriff as well as all the other stereotypical Texans depicted in this film, seem powerless against this maniacal killer. One gets the impression that just about all ordinary folk who lived in the South in 1980 are a bunch of dumb yokels. To be fair, the Coens also depict their hired killers as dumb yokels too. Woody Harrelson suddenly comes out of nowhere, is presented as some fantastic hired killer who's going to track down the serial killer and within half an hour, ends up the killer's hostage in a hotel room and is blown away (not before however he just happens to be strolling along the bridge near the US-Mexican Border and just happens to glance downward and discovers the bag full of money! What a coincidence!)<br/><br/>The Coens' view of life is basically nihilistic and pessimistic. What they're saying here is that evil is stronger than those with a moral compass and that we live in a universe where we have no control over random events (even the serial killer is almost killed himself in a random car accident at the end of the film). <br/><br/>Sure, bad things sometimes happen to good people but those who have a moral purpose in this world are not ineffectual pushovers (as depicted by a character like the Sheriff who basically concedes that he will be the serial killer's next victim and that he is powerless to stop him). When the deck is stacked as it is here in this movie, evil is the clear winner. But in reality, it's not so easy for the bad guys to walk away without being brought to the bar of justice. The Coens are trying to say that we are only observers here--that sometimes men are powerless in the face of evil. There is nothing profound about their observations; and their strategy is dishonest because their antagonist is way too smart for his opponents. When the opponents are nothing but a bunch of stereotypical hicks and losers of every stripe, it's easy to understand why the bad guy walks away with nothing more than a broken arm carefully held in place by a self-constructed sling."
"dtb","10","6","12","26 January 2008"," A Career Best for the Coens, and the Scariest Oscar Nominee Since SILENCE OF THE LAMBS
","The Coen Brothers turn back to crime in their stark, stunning, justifiably Oscar-nominated adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN (NCfOM). There's a Sam Peckinpah feel to this gripping 1980-set thriller. It's a morality play and a tense suspense story rolled into one  the leaner, meaner, more vicious brother of the Coens' previous great thrillers BLOOD SIMPLE and FARGO.<br/><br/>NCfOM's protagonist is Vietnam vet Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin in a brooding, laconic, star-making performance), who goes hunting near the Rio Grande and finds himself embroiled in nightmarish mayhem and violence, Texas prairie style. Instead of bagging wild game, Llewellyn bags $2 million in drug money after stumbling across the aftermath of a drug deal gone wrong, complete with corpses, even a dead dog. (It's chilling to see the bodies in the process of decaying as others happen upon the scene over the course of the movie.) Llewellyn thinks he can just take off with the money, dodge whoever might come after it, and live happily ever after with his sweet wife Carla Jean (played with a letter-perfect Texas accent by winsome Scottish actress Kelly Macdonald. Brolin and Macdonald make a wryly endearing couple. The rare times Llewellyn smiles, it's usually when he's talking with Carla Jean). To his peril, Llewellyn doesn't figure on being pursued by the likes of murderous bounty hunter Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a mysterious figure with a pneumatic cattle gun, a penchant for using a coin toss to decide whether someone should live or die, and a voice that sounds like it's coming not from a human being, but from the bowels of Hell itself. Chigurh relentlessly pursues the equally dogged Llewellyn through Texas as the compassionate, sad-eyed Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones as the film's voice of reason) tries to catch up, feeling overmatched by the sheer implacable evil of the ""ghost"" that is Chigurh.<br/><br/>The film's pacing is deliberate, but for me that simply increased the suspense as I wondered what Chigurh would do next and if Llewellyn had a chance in hell of eluding him for good, especially with his ever-increasing number of injuries. The suspense scenes are real nail-biters. There's a thrilling chase with Llewellyn pursued at night, first by a monster truck, then into the rapids by dogs. Pit bulls don't stand a chance against bullets! :-) One of my favorite scenes finds Llewellyn in his motel room in the dark. The only lights are the glowing tracking transmitter he finds in the drug money and the light under the door from the hall outside -- until a pair of feet appear on the hall side. All we hear is the transmitter...and the sound of a light bulb in the hall being unscrewed, resulting in more darkness...and I can say no more!<br/><br/>It's a tribute to the power of Bardem's portrayal of Chigurh that his unflattering Beatles moptop-cum-Prince Valiant pageboy haircut doesn't stop him from being one of the most terrifying villains in movie history. It got so that every time Chigurh showed up, I'd watch the rest of the scene between the fingers covering my face, because I knew Bad Things Were About To Happen. Bardem's Chigurh is all the scarier because he can seem utterly calm and casual even as he blows people's brains out with that pneumatic cattle gun of his. The thing can blow out locks as well as brains, so its versatility makes up for its cumbersomeness. :-) As good as all of this year's Best Supporting Actor nominees are, I'm rooting hardest for Bardem to win the Oscar.<br/><br/>There's some humor in the dialogue (taken mostly from the novel), but it's of the low-key, matter-of-fact variety. My favorite is the exchange between the deputy and Sheriff Bell: ""It's a mess, ain't it, Sheriff?"" ""If it ain't, it'll do till the mess gets here."" My favorite black-humored sight gag: after Chigurh launches a protracted attack in which a cop is killed, the camera pulls back to show that the floor is completely covered with scuff marks from the dead man's shoes flailing and scraping against the floor during the struggle.<br/><br/>Be warned, NCfOM is not for the squeamish or for those who like their endings neat and tidy, with everyone getting what they deserve. Nevertheless, it still haunts me, to the point where I happily paid to see it in a theater for a second time (with relatives who were as blown away by it as I was). Could NCfOM end up being the bloodiest, most suspenseful Best Picture Oscar winner since THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS? I feel that NCfOM is not only one of the best films of 2007, but one of the best films the Coens have ever made, richly deserving its 8 Oscar nominations. It's still playing in theaters as of this writing, so by all means, get out of the house and into a theater to see it for yourself!"

","And I thought Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut was a kick in the teeth. Apparently the Coen bros have become so sophisticatedly successful as film makers that pleasing American audiences is of little concern to them. All the basic formula gimmicks are shattered and we are left with an ending as disturbingly fatalistic as that found in the opera Rigoletto.<br/><br/>Symbolically the film's story might have something to say. What happens when a fortune in loot becomes an obsession to someone hunted down by a relentless psycho? What happens to a country obsessed with materialism when religious psychopaths long for its demise? The hero certainly represents most of us. We all desire wealth and are basically good. Our hero's mistake is being human; he attempts to help someone who asked for water. <br/><br/>It's too easy to define this film as just a wild depiction of modern day, American Gothic. If that were the case, the ending probably would allow the same kind of satisfaction we experienced in Blood Simple or Fargo. Instead, we are purposely let down and Tommy Lee Jones doesn't get the bad guy. The law fails to protect and exact justice and surrenders to a world of increasing hostility. Even his dream recounting in the final scene reflects America's hypocrisy, or inattention: Who cares? ""Dreams mean little to other than the dreamer."" We want the tangible . . . now, not a dream, not a meaninglessly slow ride to oblivion, not a fade-to-black. Whether you are young or an old man, this country in film is hard to appreciate. <br/><br/>Without doubt, the script should be nominated for an Oscar, as well as the cinematography."

I want two hours of my life back from spending on this pointless crap. Unbelievable!!! The plot has to be reviewed thoroughly to believe how primitive it is. One can't make it more simple. It's not necessarily an attribute of a bad movie, but I simply didn't care a bit for any feeling or motive of anyone on the screen, no matter how well each played their role.

","Coens previously attempted to produce thought provoking movies that might get closer to description of art movies, like Barton Fink. But they also enjoyed popular big success with titles like O Brother and Big Lebowski. I suspect the idea behind No Country is an attempt to merge these two genres. But to me, result fails badly as a movie.<br/><br/>Appearantly, with occasional philosophical rumbling and abrupt ending, writers/directors try hard to underline their message: violence and evil people just continue being while good people are unable to do anything about preventing that, neither young nor old, I think. However, in order to maintain this visibility, they don't fear sacrificing and crippling the story itself.<br/><br/>For the sake of first twenty minutes or so, until when Llewellyn discovers the gun fight scene and later grabs the money, I give two stars. Rest of the movie, although being a technical and stylistic accomplishment, does not deliver promised expectation neither as a blockbuster nor as an art movie."
"koojaho13","10","4","7","29 September 2010"," A movie that's both art and entertainment; absolutely terrific
","No Country for Old Men became my favorite movie of all time instantly. It is so close to being the perfect film with it's immense amount of suspense, solid dialog and it's meaningful characters that develop the movie's theme.<br/><br/>The western background creates an excellent setting for this movie. The opening sequence is great as it shows all the landscape of Texas. A monologue takes place and sets up the western feel. And how can that southern accent be unlikable? It's appealing and contributes to the western atmosphere.<br/><br/>The characters work because they are very well portrayed by splendid actors with a screenplay of crisp dialog. The dialog is out of the everyday life. There are no punts, no one liners but good, short yet stylish dialog. The three main characters slightly remind me of the ones in the Good the Bad and the Ugly. The whole movie is a three man chase and from the movie we all know that they are all very intelligent characters. The characters are easy to be hooked on. Anton Chigurh is the perfect villain; fair yet homicidal. Moss can be a greedy man yet has a soft spot from time to time. And finally Ed Tom is a man who does not understand the cruelty of the present world. The trio create a perfect combination.<br/><br/>No Country for Old Men is an outstanding thriller and is a role model to future neo-western thrillers. It stays true to it's source material and shows it's true meaning that the book wanted to convey which makes this movie an excellent piece of art. While the movie is criticized for ending abruptly, again it's staying true to its source material.<br/><br/>This movie is crazy. It keeps you in suspense throughout and when it's over it makes a good transition into developing it's theme. There is almost no music and when it comes to an intense situation, it's completely silent, creating more suspense. There are not many violence depicted in the movie but the things that happen off screen are disturbing, creating a mental image. The Coen brothers do a fantastic job of keeping true to the thriller genre.<br/><br/>There's not much to say when it comes to the effects. I felt that everything was authentic. There are some bits of good gore that portray the necessary violence. Every violence in this film has a purpose unlike a bottom material action film. The violence contributes to the film's theme.<br/><br/>Because this is a Coen brothers film, it has some dark comedy. The hair of Anton Chigurh is one of the primary examples. You'll see a lot of this during the film yet the movie never loses it's seriousness.<br/><br/>This is the comeback of the western genre and a great adaptation of one of the greatest books on humanity. The movie is filled with philosophy, thought provoking questions. This is the classic film people will look back to in the future. No Country for Old Men is an upgrade from all the previous Coen brother movies; it's more modernly done in a positive way yet feels like their movie. The Coens have shown us an example of what cinema should be like: art."

","Sometimes a movie just works. It is tensive and multiple dimensional. It appeals on many levels. Whether it edifies seems not to matter. Whether it improves my character seems not to matter. In some ways, I doubt that I even like the films of Joel and Ethan Coen. I do not go out of my way to watch their movies. When I do watch them, the films captivate me, at least for the time I watch them, but also they linger on the mental palate with vivid images and verbal memories.<br/><br/>""No Country for Old Men"" has a script that almost seems too good, too literate, and too clever for my good, if not for the sake of the movie itself. I suppose that this is a cynical and brutal story, but somehow it just does not seem, in the end, sarcastic and scornful.<br/><br/>For whatever reason, this flick recalls ""Pulp Fiction"", another enjoyable iconoclastic movie that it seems to resemble. Notice that I use the qualifier ""seems"" often in this summary. I do because ""No Country for Old Men"" has an indefinite, almost indeterminate tone.<br/><br/>The minimalist Carter Burwell score has an indefinite, indeterminate quality. Cinematographer Roger Deakins modulates his styles as a jazz artist might with a score. Here he transposes Western icons from one range to another. The brothers themselves edited the film. They are simply geniuses. This is a well narrated movie—like ""Pulp Fiction"". Talking about any aspect of this movie necessarily involves dealing with other aspects. For example, the iconic use Javier Bardem involves plotting, cinematography (for example, framing and lens choice), editing, and dialogue.<br/><br/>The Coen brothers do not seem as serious as Antonioni, but their work reminds me of the classic body of work the Italian director created. I tend to undervalue Tarantino's body of work (I admit that) and the Coen brothers might seem too much like him in their creative effort, but somehow their work haunts me a tad more than Mr. Tarantino's work does. This is just an opinion, a highly personal one that I cannot defend."

","There are many viewers who tend to believe that Coen brothers enjoy making light,enjoyable thrillers which are easy to comprehend by all and sundry as their humane protagonists hover around seemingly tolerable lines of good and evil.However,this is not at all true about their latest film ""No Country for Old Men"" as they have made a brilliant film in which an apparent simple cat and mouse chase becomes a ticklish affair for everybody involved in it.This film is able to strike a pleasant chord in viewers' hearts and minds as Coen Brothers make people believe that they are going to see something extraordinary as this particular film's emotional as well as philosophical dimensions are almost matchless.It is sad to state but many a viewer might be tempted to comment that superb acting talent of great American actor Tommy Lee Jones is not properly utilized.He has been given an extremely odd role where he looks very old,tired and completely depleted of energy.One would also not fail to remark that as usual,Coen brothers have given actress Kelly MacDonald a secondary role which would enable her to join the list of weak women characters in their films.Fargo is the only exception to this rule as it featured an extremely strong woman character.After having watched ""No Country For Old Men"",film critic/Senior French translator/interpreter Lalit Rao joined that famous league of extraordinary cinema admirers who have all been part of a hallucinatory experience called cinema as nights have a very special meaning in ""No Country For Old Men""."
"dimitrisalomao","10","4","7","17 March 2010"," For all film noir fans!
","The Coen brothers are one of the best directors still working (It's hard to tell, between Mel Gibson, Christopher Nolan , Scorsese and The Coen Brothers, who is the best) and they prove they are masters in film noir, making the experience so interesting that can bypass some screenplay mistakes, deserving 100%.<br/><br/>We follow a story of Llewelyn Moss (Brolin), who discovers the remains of several drug runners who have all killed each other in an exchange gone violently wrong. Rather than report the discovery to the police, Moss decides to simply take the two million dollars present for himself. This puts the psychopathic killer, Anton Chigurh (Bardem), on his trail as he dispassionately murders nearly every rival, bystander and even employer in his pursuit of his quarry and the money.<br/><br/>The acting is this movie is absolutely fantastic, from Bardem ,Who deserved the Oscar (And is really the best performance in the film), to Gene Jones, who is the gas station proprietor, that is in that intense coin toss, that both ,Chigurh and him, knows that they are betting for his life. Or Woody Harrelson, who plays a charismatic investigator, that pays attention to minimal details. And Tommy Lee Jones, that is a sheriff, who is constantly suffering from all the disgrace that he is seeing (Who Remembered me of Morgan Freeman's character in ""Se7en"").<br/><br/>The Screenplay mistakes that I referred in the first paragraph, is that if sometimes they use Chigurh to show how disgraceful our world is, but in other times they discuss the authenticity of that case, and how unusual it is, so it's a little controversial, but like I said, it doesn't stop this movie from deserving 100%. Some people told the accident in the end of the movie was pointless, but I think it was there to show us that, even an intelligent and meticulous psychopathic killer, is subject to unforeseen, and is vulnerable to accidents.<br/><br/>Verdict: This proves again that The Coen Brothers are extremely talented directors, by giving us a masterpiece of film noir.<br/><br/>Ps: Note that this review is bigger than my last ones, so tell me how do you prefer it, Longer reviews or like the last ones?"

","""No country for old men"" is one of the best thrillers that I've seen in years. This is the first movie of the Coen brothers that I came upon and there's no doubt that I'll reach out for more. Their innovative writing and masterful story telling techniques has made quite an impression on me to check out their much earlier films.<br/><br/>The story follows a poor farmer (played wonderfully by Josh Brolin) who came across a suitcase of money in a drug deal gone wrong and his struggle to steer his life away from the villainous Anton Chigur. A man with a terrifying smile, who travels across Texas, carrying a cattle gun, destroying anything that would cause him any inconvenience when it comes to acquiring the briefcase. It is hard to even imagine such a man could exist, but then again its not. This may sound as quite a simple story but then again the great masters such as Ozu and Bresson used simple stories to create innovative work. It is through their simplicity that they evoked such powerful emotions in the characters as well as in the audience. Here the Coen brothers follow the same route. It is flawlessly shot to the point that it's suspense would without a doubt hold you at the edge of the seat. The photography of the stark beautiful western landscape and creative writing are two more aspects of the film that deserves much admiration."

","So, you saw the film, and you didn't get it, or maybe you thought ""there was nothing TO get!"" Well, I too love a good action movie with lots of unbelievable chase scenes and explosions and nice clean ending that wraps everything up neatly, and you can watch this movie and enjoy the action and the thrill of the hunt/chase which is really well filmed/edited (although there's not nearly enough to call this an ""action"" movie), but THAT is not what this film is really about.<br/><br/>And I'm not sure I should really tell you what it's about, but I will direct you how to get there.<br/><br/>The key is Tommy Lee Jones' dialog throughout the film, especially his voice-over at the very beginning (that you forget all about once the movie is going), but also his various interactions with his co-workers and friends. If you can watch the movie on DVD you should NOT tune out his dialog, you should pay very close attention to it. There are certain key phrases that come up that are deep and true and ring out like a Bible verse or a haiku. The movie is not about two men fighting over money, the movie is about Sheriff Ed Tom Bell; the rest of the action is a musical counterpoint to him. I suspect a lot of people get it backwards and come away confused.<br/><br/>There are some other themes in the movie (chance, fate, justice) that I find less important, but certainly they are there and shouldn't be ignored.<br/><br/>I have watched this film over and over the last few weeks, and come away every time with a strange feeling inside, a kind of ""existential spiritualism"" that I can't quite put a finger on. The movie is that deep if you give it the chance."

","From the town of Lincoln, Nebraska with a sawed off .410 on my lap through the badlands of Wyoming I killed everything in my path...""<br/><br/>'round the age of 14 (1986 or so) I bought a copy from Springsteen's 1982 solo-album for 5,-DM (2,50 uro or approx. 2$) in a second-hand-record-store, listened to it twice and put it away  disappointed for finding no ""Born..."" party-sound but a dark and scaring side-path of the American Way. I obviously made the same mistake as the shop-owner then, underrating this album (good for me, so I could buy it for toffee). It was only the early '90s when I put it on again to find out that it's the most essential of all Springsteen-albums. Since then it's among my all-time-top-five-records, the only one carved in stone there. <br/><br/>License, registration, I ain't got none, but I got a clear conscience about the things that I done. Mister State Trooper, please don't stop me...""<br/><br/>Years ago a friend gave me a copy of McCarthy's ""All The Pretty Horses"" which was practically glued to my hands in the following months, making CM one of my all-time-favorite authors. Unfortunately since then I have neither seen the Horses..."" screen-adaption, nor read No Country..."". I was nevertheless pleased to read this movie to be made by the Coens, some of my main favorite and un-compromising filmmakers. Uncompromising as the novels of McCarthy.<br/><br/>The film is set in 1980 but it even appears as it was shot then; Josh Brolin comes along as a younger Nick Nolte in E.P."". The opening sequence instantly devastates all eventual hopes for a good"" en-ding, as Walter Hill preferably did too around that time. Watching Javier Bardem's first appearance with his lunatic eyes and haircut reminded me of Powers Boothe in Southern Comfort"". His interpretation of Anton Chigurh to me was the most terrifying psycho-killer-performance since Benoit Poelvoorde in Cést arrivé près de chez vous"" (1992) <br/><br/>Only by the second time watching it I realized what the final consequence of his sole-inspection"" in the sequence on the porch was. A brief but meaningful gesture, performed so minimalistic that it could easily be overseen, but strikes the viewer the deeper as soon as it's been noticed. <br/><br/>Seeing a man standing over a dead dog lying by the highway in a ditch. He's looking down kinda puzzled poking that dog with a stick...""<br/><br/>The Coens revive the early 80s with a love for the detail and the certain atmosphere which Hill and Tarantino probably envy and enjoy too. I'd therefore say that this film would fit better in a double-feature with ""Death Proof"" than the clumsily ""Planet Terror"". ""Death Proof"" also works with the Tarantino-typical sense for the hilarious, which the Coens cultivate that well and preferably; but ""No Country..."" is no fun, only bitter. Maybe a little like ""Reservoir Dogs"" (mind the torture-scene).<br/><br/>All in all there are gorgeous actors, a great script, no annoying score and an adequate because unromantic display about what violence is about  something truly horrible (as soon as it happens to yourself) that simply should not be: <br/><br/>""...People accept the most idiotic and unrealistic use of sex, violence and politics in any other book (...) I don't' take the reader into a world were all the girls are sexy and all the guys are dress-men, were somebody gets bashed with a rod and doesn't even have a headache next day, catches 15 bullets and wipes them away with a grin. Such a world I don't know..."" Andrew Vachss,""Flood""-afterword, German edition. <br/><br/>Right. Neither does ""No Country...""<br/><br/>I'm glad that the Coens worked once with Tommy Lee Jones now, a perfect match. As the character closest to the viewers point to lead through the plot, Jones was the right choice, his character Sheriff Ed Tom Bell, a valuable alter ego to look through his eyes, an old, experienced but disillusioned officer who tries to outweigh his sense for duty against his hope to reach retirement unharmed. Thank you all, cast and crew.<br/><br/>""Well I chased him through them county roads 'til a sign said Canadian Border 5 miles from here.

","Our post 9/11 world is an increasingly dark and frightening place, and more and more, independent films are reflecting this. And none does a more effective job than NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN. Although conceptually it is hardly the best or most satisfying of the Coen Brothers films, possibly because it does seem to stay true to the spirit of Cormac McCarthy's bleak worldview, it has some of the best performances the team has ever gotten from actors they've worked with.<br/><br/>Just as the title baldly states, the world is becoming a much less accommodating or welcoming place for old time lawmen like Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones in the role that SHOULD'VE won him the Oscar.) There is no clear delineation between good and evil anymore, and evil has gotten more potent and a lot crazier. There is no honor among thieves or those sworn to bring them to justice, and the price of upholding principles could very well be everything...including your life.<br/><br/>Even the hardiest (if not the smartest) of young men can only hope to survive. In this case, the young man in question is one Llewelyn Moss (an excellent Josh Brolin.) Moss is out hunting one day when he comes across a scene of unspeakable carnage out in the middle of the desert: a drug deal gone spectacularly wrong. Following a trail of blood and heroin, Moss comes across the one would-be survivor of the massacre, and a case of money that's more than he could hope to put together in three lifetimes. Remember what I said about young men not being too smart? Well, Llewelyn's no rocket scientist, because even though he knows it can only bring him the worst kind of trouble, he takes the satchel anyway. <br/><br/>What Moss could've never guessed is exactly what kind of trouble, and how bad it would be. Trouble's name in this case would be Anton Chigurh (a nearly unrecognizable Javier Bardem, in the role that rightfully won him a Best Actor Oscar.) With that frightening Dorothy Hamiil- meets-Dustin-Hoffman-in-THE-GRADUATE pageboy haircut, and that voice that sounds like Mercedes McCambridge practicing lines for THE EXORCIST, he's your worst nightmare...a psychotic hired killer who revels in his psychosis, and regards killing the way we would regard grabbing a two-scoop cone at Ben and Jerry's.<br/><br/>One of the most disturbing scenes comes in at the very beginning, when Chigurh murders a deputy who thinks he's got it all under control when he brings this maniac in. The scene is exactly the kind that would have Hitchcock rubbing his hands together with glee. It's shot almost like a sex scene. Don't believe me? Watch closely...then run for the nearest shower afterward.<br/><br/>Chigurh's been hired to follow Moss's trail to the money, but the fact that he has his own twisted agenda and crazed sense of principles is what makes him dangerously unpredictable. And it's the trail of corpses he leaves in his wake, using an instrument of death that has to be the most bizarre so far in movie history, (and that's saying something these days), that leads him to cross paths with Sheriff Bell. <br/><br/>I don't want to say much more about it, except that another stroke of brilliance the Coens stole from Hitch, is how there is virtually no music whatsoever until the credits roll. You are so engrossed in the story and the characters that you don't really notice...until it kicks in at the very end. And juxtaposing the violence and moments of nearly unbearable tension is the breathtaking job that DP Roger Deakins did on the cinematography. It takes nothing away from the film to note how gorgeous the images are - one standout scene being a chase sequence involving Moss and some of the interested parties who are after him for the money, besides Chigurh. <br/><br/>Singing the praises of Jones, Bardem and Brolin, I don't want to shortchange any of the other cast members, since everyone gives phenomenal performances - most of them so good, they don't even seem like acting. Garret Dillahunt as Bell's stalwart deputy; Tess Harper as Bell's wife; Woody Harrelson as a tracker who really underestimates Chigurh's insanity; Kelly MacDonald and Beth Grant as Moss's wife and mother-in-law, respectively and Stephen Root in a role that is a shocking departure from his usual comedic work. They are all unfailingly good. <br/><br/>Where most moviegoers will find fault with COUNTRY is the lack of an ending that ties up all the loose ends, finding the bad guys dead, the good guys riding off into the sunset and everybody living happily ever after. Yet once again, considering the times in which we live, would you really have expected a tale so dark to end any other way but the way it does?<br/><br/>Not a bouncy, breezy evening at the movies, but unforgettable nevertheless, and I think it will equally please McCarthy and Coen Brothers fans without missing a beat.<br/><br/>Oh, and horror fans...Don't be too shocked to find that Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees have been replaced in your dreams by the face and voice of Anton Chigurh. He's so much WORSE.<br/><br/>Because Michael, Jason and Freddy are not people who could be parked across the street from your house right now. Anton could be..."
"ag-21","10","4","7","15 August 2008"," An Explanation For The Ending
","An explanation for the ending: an implied scene5 The ending of the film should be understood in the context of preceding scenes, and in particular, the scene just prior to the final scenes of the film - in the motel - where Anton is hiding behind the door with a loaded gun, and the Sheriff holsters his gun and sits on the bed. This scene ends with the Sheriff noticing, and focusing on, the coin left on the floor by Anton. The focus on the coin incidentally, was the Coen Bros. clue to the viewer. This scene implies that Anton 'gets the drop' on the Sheriff, and gives him a chance to escape by calling the coin toss correctly. This then explains the ensuing scenes where the Sheriff discusses his retirement plans to his friend and his wife, and recounts his dark dream to his wife; a dream of a dead father and mortality. A dispirited Sheriff has realized he is no match for Anton. Hence the film's title: ""No Country For Old Men"". This implied scene underscores the greatness of this film. Most films, particularly Hollywood films, usually make everything obvious to the viewer, leaving no room for thinking by viewers. The Coen Bros. have elevated film-making to new heights. On another level, they have elevated the notion of randomness or chance in the world, to a primary theme, in this film, as commented on elsewhere by some contributors. It seems that Cormac McCarthy, (the author of the novel on which the film is based) had been reading the works of Nassim Nicholas Taleb and his discourse on randomness/chance in ""The Black Swan"" and ""Fooled By Randomness"". In the Talebian view of life, the real terror for us humans, is that our lives are determined by chance. We have no real control or escape from chance events. Anton is the embodiment of a random event. Its no surprise that Anton strikes a deep chord of terror in viewers given that the whole history of human civilisation has been fundamentally aimed at gaining security and protection from random events."

","I am surprised by the amount of good press this movie has received, both in the media and on sites such as IMDb.com My wife and I rarely go to the the theater, so we were really looking forward to renting this DVD. We are both huge Coen Brothers fans and believe they are among the the best film makers currently working. This movie does possess many of the traits that we have come to love about Coen movies. The cinematography, acting, editing, pacing, sound work and soundtrack were all up to their normal excellence. Where this one fell flat for me was in the storytelling...which normally is a strong suit of the Coens. The movie started very, very well. In fact, through the first half of the film I was literally on the edge of my seat. The pacing was brisk and the plot was tight ... in other words exactly what we have come to expect. Then, between 1/2 and 2/3 way through the movie...my wife and I both lost the plot. It was as if we suddenly were wrenched from this great story into a place where what was happening did not follow from what had happened...and there seemed to be little desire by the filmmakers to create a logical line from A to B. We watched the movie again, and came to the same conclusion. In fact, we could pinpoint the moment this happened to the scene in the stairwell ( I will not go further as I prefer not to be a spoiler. ) Anyway, those are my 2 cents. A great movie for an hour or so...then it just all falls apart. Not a terrible movie, but no where near the Coens' normal quality in my opinion."

"photoe","6","4","7","5 May 2008"," Massively Overrated
","Let me start with the good. The movie is beautifully shot, creates an authentic feel for Texas, is well acted, offers good suspense, and has a truly scary villain. What starts out good goes severely downhill to a really unsatisfying ending, however.<br/><br/>I was shocked but fine with Brolin being taken out (from an unexpected direction), and it lent realism. I also understand Tommy Lee Jones wanting to give up. However, to let the villain off the hook after he does the huge dirt he does, was a total crock. It wasn't just Tommy Lee Jones who would be after this villain. He kills a deputy at the very start of the movie. Texas law enforcement does not look too kindly on that sort of behavior. I'm also getting tired of the constant justification of murder in movies by a 'murderer's code'. We have enough lack of justice in real life. What people pay to see is the bad guy eating his sanctimonious trumped-up morality at the end. So the direction this movie took was bad morality, bad logic and bad entertainment all wrapped into one. <br/><br/>These movies feed a curiosity for violence, and of course I watched the movie knowing what I was in for. To build up hatred for a villain, and doubt in the hero, Tommy Lee Jones, and then show the hero to be weak, and the villain to go scot free is pointless. Is the final car crash supposed to be god playing with him? Why isn't he killed? Why don't two kids carjack him and kill him on the spot? That would have fed into the title, the villain being done by someone even younger than him. As I said, we know real life already, and even in real life, killers like this guy don't go scot free. This villain killed 20 people over a week, and no one is capable of catching up to his randomness? Perhaps things are that bad in TX, but I doubt it. Pretty stretchy on the believability.<br/><br/>They also don't show a couple of key murders, including one that's fairly critical at the end, and adds to the chaotic finish. Harrelson's disposable character makes zero sense. He's sent after the villain because he's a supposed pro, and then just gets caught and offed so easily? Harrelson had to be given something to showcase his toughness, and there was nothing. The villain then goes into his employers office and kills him for sending Harrelson. Talk about clichéd.<br/><br/>The philosophical conversations about murder and death and honor were done FAR better in Apocalypse Now. I cant believe this movie received ANY Oscars, except maybe for cinematography. Ultimately a pretentious film with a disturbing subtext about powerlessness that is addressed but not fully developed.<br/><br/>Yes, I grasp films that break the mold in which the villain gets away, but in this film it is a pretentious choice. Brolin's character was doing a great job of fending off the villain and his childish arrogance, but then Brolin got caught from a different direction. Doesn't serve the previous character development, but OK, The villain then goes after Brolin's wife later because of his psycho 'code', with what happens not shown, but implied. This was a moment for Tommy Lee Jones (or anyone) to show up and finish him, including her. I know this would have been a predictable ending, but the film was more or less a typical mob money chase movie, not a particularly original premise.<br/><br/>The Cohn brothers are renowned for a style, and it's turning into a set of gimmicky choices about breaking clichés in ways that are more annoying than effective and original. When you make a movie far less entertaining by deconstructing a cliché in a way already done, you aren't being original, you are being a pretentious bad director. I understand Tommy Lee Jones abdication at the end, but what is the point of all the conversations about how his granddad had it tough as well, or that evil is eternal? He just decides to sit it out? He doesn't even speak on the topic in a manner that you can tell he's deciding to sit it out. VERY sloppy, indifferent, inadequate rendering of the material in my eyes.<br/><br/>Overrated for making a violent aggressive movie with a confused whimper of an ending, and calling it the 'real world' doesn't cut it. Even if this is the way the book was written, the finale, or lack thereof, was directed in a way that was chaotic, indifferent to the audience, and therefore pretentious."

","The story that this movie is based upon, Cormac McCarthy's 2005-novel, reveals an America that's no country for anyone; and Tommy Lee Jones' character Sheriff Ed Tom Bell reflects the crime out-of-hand with wisdom, wit and maturity - as his narration over the deserted landscape tells his hours of darkness. And crime doesn't come any more out-of-hand, any darker or more horrifying than Anton Chigurh, masterfully played by Javier Bardem, an evil assassin which seems alienated from the rest of the world, looking at the other human beings as targets, intruders or no nothing. And crime floats over in the desert, as drug-dealing Mexicans executes deals-gone-bad, and this is where Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) comes in; as he discovers the $2 million in cash, he decides to take the money and run - who wouldn't? Drug-money belongs to nobody, and Moss becomes the film's moral dilemma, and Brolin gives the character the human heart the part needs; as we can put ourselves in his boots in this hellacious setting of crime and disgust. The great Roger Deakins, the director of photography, along with the Coen-brothers creates poetry here; not just one of 2007's most brilliant movies - but this is up there with Coen-classics as Fargo and the Big Lebowski. Rarely, a suspense-thriller makes us look into the abyss of our own making - No Country for Old Men does that, and it's one of the most delighted and tensioned experiences I've ever had in front off the screen."

","I really enjoyed this movie. I am neither a gun nut nor a nihilist. What I found refreshing was the DEPTH, pace and even fearless moments of quiet. I say DEPTH because I was inclined to have stimulating conversations about the deeper meaning of the film with friends that resulted in satisfying revelations. I say ""fearless"" because the film actually slowed down and let the audience just DRINK IN the landscape, expressions and well spoken words at key moments that kept the pacing satisfying. That takes bravery because it creates a ""naked"" moment for the film maker. Some critics complain that is is a movie of too much ""darkness."" Great tragedies are rare nowadays.

","I'm a hardcore Lebowski guy. No Country is a great movie, but it's no Lebowski. But then what is? And never mind that comparing the two movies would be like a comparison between a rabid rhinoceros and say, a bowl of oatmeal. But I still believe strongly that if any Cohen movie deserves best pic, it's Lebowski. It was just the right time, the right set of circumstances for them to get the nod for their latest work, which is well deserved, but feels more like a lifetime achievement award than a best pic/best director. I'm impressed, however, that the Oscar would go to a couple of my 'against the grain' film-making heroes and for such a dark, brutal film no less. Maybe things haven't completely given way to shmaltz and fluff in the motion picture academy? <br/><br/>But what about No Country? As a long time admirer, I'm biased towards the Cohens so I loved it (more than many perhaps) for that reason alone. I wouldn't quite say that it's the Cohens at the height of their powers, but they definitely explored another avenue with this one. There's hardly a trace of the bizarre, deadpan humor that one has come to expect from a Cohen movie (even the often brutal Miller's Crossing had some chuckle-inducing moments). No, they definitely turned down another street with this one, a very dark, scary street.<br/><br/>The signature Cohen way of giving the 'chaos and randomness' feel of real life occurrences to circumstances of fiction (even some of the most outlandish scenarios - as they've done in the past) is present, though. And when the Cohens apply their special brand of realism to violence, it produces some of the most frightening scenes of bloodletting in cinema...scenes that can't really be matched (unless you're Cronenberg or Kubrick). I love violent movies that shock you into thinking...""man what would that be like if it were happening to me?"" or ""That's probably what it would be like if it were really happening."" I think that's what really kept the movie afloat for me. It brought back some of the things I liked about Cronenberg's History of Violence, but No Country is a lead foot on the throttle when it comes to violence. Incredible. This movie sports some of the most realistic gunshot wound effects I've ever seen in film, and I've seen lots...I mean LOTS of movies depicting people getting shot. The movie's other main strong point is the the tight, relentless focus. Nothing is ever taken away from the nitty gritty of what is happening. The pacing, even when it slows to a meandering 'observing moments of a character' scene, never takes its eyes off what is unfolding between Brolin, Barden, TL Jones. I liked that a lot.<br/><br/>The Cohens take liberties in No Country, and I sensed that they were indulging themselves a bit at times. But if you're a fan of their work, you'll appreciate this movie for many things that would skip past the uninitiated. They were indeed toying with the audience, but if you like Cohen bros. movies, then you like getting toyed with."

If you want all your action films to be like 'The Terminator', all your thrillers to be like 'The Silence of the Lambs', all your teen comedies like 'American Pie' well there will be no point of cinema.

Not a 'dud' by any standards.<br/><br/>This movie has got a lot of things going for it. Javier Bardem's performance is right up there with the best. The visuals are ABSOLUTELY stunning.

The same goes for this film, where script, direction, acting and cinematography play equal parts alongside long-time Cohen-accomplice Carter Burwell's chilling soundtrack to make this a film about consequence, circumstance and cold-blooded action - the latter in stark contract to Tommy Lee Jones' brilliant portrayal of an experienced and jaded - yet human - sheriff. It must be said that I think Javier Bardem's performance is worthy of the Oscar he won a week ago. He's chilling like hell, but as written was, not only because of his supreme acting, but the script, cinematography, the Cohen's sublime sense of using silence, timing and soundtrack. This is a must-see film."
"billion_mucks","9","4","7","15 February 2008"," A Sea full of Sand
","Latest work from the Coen works as expected, or a little less. As much as you can hope on deep interiorizing, the most explored characters are the ultimately classical versus between Good and Evil. Bardem personifies Anton Chigurh, a man with no hints of humanity that kills because it's convenient and because he can. He never smiles, he talks clearly and with a profound, steady voice. He is the unrelenting evil Coen's want to explore.<br/><br/>Although the premise follows Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin) and his escape from Chigur's deadly hands, Brolin must not take that big of applause, neither big protagonism. His acting is hard, unrevealing. Instead, Tommy Lee Jones is textured as a sheriff that avoids violence, in a town where only dust and cactus gather. But his deep, extremely deep sensation of disturbia, nearly death and sense of duty is worth the ticket.<br/><br/>Within it's minimalistic reach, no soundtrack, long determined pauses, ""No Country..."" accomplishes. It's a studied character piece, that I believe will be overgrown by oblivion within the pass of times; as it's popularity is within being unconventional, slow and impervious to common places."

","Wow just saw it really good film ill separate it into categories<br/><br/>Story: Simple story man takes money not belonging to him sets off a chain reaction of violence from a crazy yet calm man who wants at nothing but to get the money. 9/10<br/><br/>Script: Witty dialog with comedic lines that are clearly a coen brothers film. Resembles some big lebowski moments which includes a milk scene lol. Not focused to much on dialog but telling a scene using the actions of the characters. End sequence was interesting yet could have been better maybe i was distracted by someone on the phone. Themes used from other coen films Barton Fink: Hallway scenes and some person to person scenes/ interior of houses including wallpaper scenes. Big Lebowski: Normal man in bad situation, Milk lol Fargo: Long shots of scenic Texas similar to styles used in Fargo/ Cop dialogue resembles Fargo 8.5/10<br/><br/>Cinematography: Simple yet elegant lighting used in the film similar to Barton fink especially the hallway scenes. Excellent landscape shots which really blew me away. Favorite scenes were nightime shots. 10/10<br/><br/>Acting: A class by all except for Tommy lee jones seriously that guy is becoming type-casted in all his films lol. Best performance is by josh Brolin in my eyes. 9.5/10<br/><br/>Production Design: Similar to Barton Fink for the interior scenes<br/><br/>Overall a good 8.5 out of 10"

","I have read FAQ's, reviews, and comment boards and I still don't understand the ending to this movie. With the majority of the plot still up in the air the movie literally stops. It just stops--in mid sentence. It was absolutely ridiculous. I still managed to give the movie a 5 out of 10 because up until that point the movie was pretty amazing. It was fast paced, and full of plot twists, and than it just ends. My thoughts were, ""Wow, that was amazing for the first hour and a half, but I don't pay $8 to go to the movies and make up my own ending to the movie"". I'm sure that mostly every review that you will read will say how amazing this movie is, and I certainly see where they are coming from. The ending just frustrated me so much that I failed to see its brilliance. I would offer this advice to you, read the book first. That way you may have some type of idea what's going on when the movie ends."

","Joel and Ethan Coen's 'No Country for Old Men' has proved to be one of the year's most critically acclaimed films, with a raft of Oscar nominations adding to its apparent lustre. On viewing though, one has to ask what all the fuss is about.<br/><br/>The story contrives to be straightforward and opaque at the same time; trailer-trash Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin) happens upon a corpse and a bag full of money in the Texan desert. As always happens in the movies, he decides to keep it for himself, thus attracting the attention of the extremely sinister Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem sporting an equally sinister pudding bowl haircut). The first three-quarters of the film are essentially about Moss trying to evade Chigurh's murderous clutches, whilst folksy but ineffectual Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) follows two steps behind. This section of the film works well as a thriller, with some tense and exciting scenes as Chigurh relentlessly pursues the resourceful Moss. However, much remains rather unclear; for instance the origin of the money is never really made clear and a bounty-hunter type character (a nice cameo from Woody Harrelson) enters and exits the story quickly and rather pointlessly.<br/><br/>Had 'No Country' continued in the thriller vein for its two hour running time, then it would have been a strong entry in the genre, but those Oscar nods would still have been rather mystifying. However the film literally loses the plot in the last quarter, with the abrupt, off-screen death of a central character and a slow, meandering and ultimately rather pointless finale. All in all, 'No Country For Old Men' must be one of the more disappointing and over-rated films of recent years."

","Was it any good? Well if you have to ask then the answer is probably no, and I have watched it and I am still asking myself was it any good.<br/><br/>The individual elements were great.<br/><br/>Actors on top form. Check. Original plot, packed with social commentary and subtext. Check. Music score to create atmosphere. Check.<br/><br/>In theory it should have been great.<br/><br/>But was I entertained??? <br/><br/>The answer is NO.<br/><br/>If there is a duller action/thriller movie out there then I have yet to see it.<br/><br/>I honestly think that this movie will be like most Oscar nominated movies, lauded for its cinematography and pathos, yet instantly forgettable. When you look back and remember the best films of 2008 this one will have faded into the mists of time."
"dminkster","3","4","7","24 January 2008"," Where are the characters?
","I was pretty much bored stiff by this film. We learn nothing about the important characters, and the only character we could care about, the Tommy Lee Jones character, is so removed from the action, that caring about him doesn't matter.<br/><br/>The pacing is not only deadly, but never varies when the situation gets more intense, or when the situation is not critical. <br/><br/>There is none of the Coen Brothers trade mark 'quirkeness' to any of the characters, and tho the Javier Bardhem character may be 'a man on a mission' we never know why, or get a clue as to what makes him tick. <br/><br/>I am shocked that this film has met with such enthusiasm, and can't believe Bardhem is nominated for his one level performance. And further surprised that he is nominated as supporting actor, when he is on screen for most of the film.<br/><br/>Bring back Fargo and Oh Brother. Now those were the Coen's at their best. Mostly with this film I was bored stiff. No character, no relationships, no suspense, and no pacing. A not very good film from two talented film makers. <br/><br/>Why did you like the film, is my question to all those enthusiastic viewers. My friend said, ""I was on the edge of my seat the entire time."" But, with such lousy pacing, and no clue as to who anyone was, I couldn't have cared less."
"karen-913","3","4","7","6 January 2008"," Typical Cormac McCarthy
","I was extremely disappointed with this movie, as I have always been with Cormac McCarthy's writing. I am perplexed by the review score here. I think Cormac McCarthy takes the easy way out and as a result, the reader/view is left unsatisfied. I left 3 stars only for the first half of this movie.<br/><br/>Spoilers below: On a positive note, I was very taken with and absorbed in the story up until the main character was killed. I felt totally cheated that as a viewer I was robbed of what could've been a great scene. The entire movie thus far had built up to that moment and we were robbed of it.<br/><br/>Regarding the ending, I didn't mind that the question of whether the villain killed the wife went unanswered. I don't need everything spelled out for me, nor does the story need to resolve into a nice, neat, little package. HOWEVER, I think that Cormac McCarthy and/or filmmakers made some very basic mistakes--not the mark of a great writer, in my opinion: 1. The slaying of the main character did not translate well to film. This is a visual media after all. I image the showdown was quite spectacular. Too bad we didn't get to see it.<br/><br/>2. What was the point of Tommy Lee Jones' character? He had no real ties to the actual story line. Several of his scenes--including the last one--could have been cut with no sacrifice to the film's quality. Again, perhaps this didn't translate well from the book. But I see pretty much every scene with Tommy Lee Jones as fluff and padding.<br/><br/>3. The car accident at the end...well, again, what is the point? I see this as typical of McCarthy's writing. He has wasted my time.<br/><br/>I don't enjoy movies where the plot exactly unfolds as expected. I am a highly educated person--you don't need to connect all the dots for me--that is insulting. I'm also an avid reader. I totally enjoyed the movie up until the main character was found dead at the hotel. Up until that point, I was looking forward to seeing the movie through.<br/><br/>The car accident, most of the sheriff's pontification, and especially the last scene, are totally random, not well thought out, and irresponsible on the part of the author. I believe in leaving something to the imagination but I don't think that was accomplished here. There was no satisfaction at the end of this movie.<br/><br/>I do not see Cormac McCarthy as a reclusive genius. I see him as a writer who writes random thoughts without keeping his reader in mind, and he lucked out. Three stars are for the first half of the movie."
"Jawsphobia","Null","4","7","5 January 2008"," nihilistic escapism
","Marred only by the fashionably nihilistic stated theme, the movie is fun to watch when it has momentum and also tense when it wants to be. But a grandmother character sticks out like a broken bone among an otherwise great cast as indirect as the screenplay tries to be with exposition it sounds ham-fisted in its attempts to prove the crazy hit-man baddie's world view correct. It will be called a ""smart man's thriller"" but it still has moments where the audience may be brighter than the protagonist and a tracking device premise that we have already seen easily defeated in The Da Vinci Code. So much for playing superior, Coens. The movie is at its best in silent stretches, though tolerable when reflective. Based on a novel or not, for me it is the movie where Two-Face/Harvey Dent Tommy Lee Jones from Batman Forever is trying to track down a baddie who has the same quirk of coin-flipping to determine one's fate. It occurs to me that we give a bad guy more slack; he can be a superhuman Rambo figure sewing himself up and evading the worst you can dish out as long as he makes matters worse. It's not pandering to wish fulfillment fantasies, unless your wish is to steer clear of happy endings. Is there any such thing as a spoiler if the ending is a downer? I say no, but I've left out the details just in case."
"MattSeven","6","4","7","24 December 2007"," The discussion is the point
","Before anyone assesses this movie properly, one must look at the fact that the Coen brothers knew what they were doing each step of the way. When we're told Moss is a Vietnam vet, our expectations are intentionally being set up. Another reviewer here was disappointed in the simplistic caricatures in the film. But when you consider the menagerie of interesting and clever characters these brothers created before, you have to consider that these caricatures are all part of the plan to set the viewer up by exploiting viewer expectation. Simply *casting* Tommy Lee Jones as the sheriff is a setup. On and on...a drug deal gone bad...a hero determined to defeat the villain...these expectations are engineered and betrayed purposefully.<br/><br/>Like Michael Myers (Halloween), the villain is intentionally inexplicable and omnipresent. He is intentionally overwrought, oversold, and overinvolved all over the film. In some ways his presence in the flick is reminiscent of Barton Fink -- and this comparison is a useful tool to analyze the movie: In both movies, an irrational psychopath's senseless violence rips through the plot line. In Barton Fink, the cherubic John Goodman and the exaggerated irrelevance of the violence slap the viewer with a dark humor that entertains. It leaves the viewer wondering ""What was that about?"" but does so while giving the viewer what they seem to want. It is almost as though the Coen brothers simply decided they had not made their point strongly enough and wanted prove that the viewer is, in fact, a tool.<br/><br/>In No Land for Old Men, the senseless violence is dressed up to look like a plot mover. The viewer EXPECTS raw violence in a drug deal gone bad. They expect violence between rough hewn men in a bleak western landscape. The Coen brothers provoke and exploit these expectations at every opportunity, giving clues along the way that some violent climax is about to unfold. ""Keep watching, the violence will make sense."" INSTEAD, the senseless violence leaves only these broken expectations in its wake. The directors want you to see the violence for what it is: senseless. Ridiculous.<br/><br/>And when the end of the movie comes and you are slapped in the face with this reality, you are one angry viewer. And that's what they want. You should be angry. You WERE shortchanged. You were screwed. And when you go into another movie that gives you what you want, you are still a tool."
"mariadepool","5","4","7","16 December 2007"," What is all the fuzz about???
","I do not understand what is all the fuzz about this movie, OK, it is good, but that's it. Is not perfect, is not excellent, is just good. Is very, very, extremely slow paced, some dialogues are difficult to understand because some of the characters don't talk, they mumble. This movie will probably win many awards, please tell me why. The best part of the movie is the acting, especially from the always more than perfect Kelly McDonald and also Josh Brolin, Tommy Lee Jones and Javier Bardem. Woody Harrelson is another story, what was his business in this movie?, I know the part he played, but, what did he bring new that he never brought before to any of his characters? Exactly, nothing, he may as well stayed at home and pass this on to somebody else. Anyway, if you saw it and enjoyed it and think this is absolutely the best film ever, I respect your level of intellect that obviously I have not achieved yet, but if you haven't seen it and want to see an excellent movie around this time of the year (there are so many great movies out there) I will recommend to skip this one and rent it later. You should not miss it if you are a movie lover like me, but it may not be the wonderful movie experience that you would expect from all the great reviews."
"gelatin25","6","4","7","28 November 2007"," Disappointing...
","It definitely had its redeeming qualities, but overall I was rather let down and found it to be somewhat over-hyped. I expected this to be the Coen Brothers masterpiece thus far, a new level for them, but it still seemed to be the same old same old. Now Javier Bardem (where did this guy come from??) plays an excellent villain, you can see it in his eyes alone. He's completely ruthless and without a conscience to the point that it's just funny. And that's vintage Coen Brothers right there- this kind of black humor. There's some great dialogue, and even some classic moments of stylized violence that give it real potential. Watch for one memorable scene involving a very explosive diversion this villain creates outside a small-town pharmacy. The film moves at a rather slow pace, and taking place in the southwest, the Coen Brothers, as they did in ""O Brother Where Art Thou,"" seem to rely too much on southern stereotypes for humor's sake rather than a true knowledge and understanding of the south. Still worth seeing."

","This movie changed my life. Ah the blood, the gore, the random executions... what can a viewer ask for more. I just could not wait for that psycho killer to shoot another man. And that old sheriff... he delivers such clever philosophic thoughts there. I will treasure them for the rest of my life.<br/><br/>And I also like the accurate depiction of Mexicans: nearly every Mexican in this movie is either a drug dealer or a hired gun; well there is also the other type of Mexican, i.e. street guitarists in sombreros. Then, I did not know that Mexico had hospitals, but strangely we can't see any Mexican doctors; could it be because they are too busy with their other job as drug dealers? <br/><br/>And the reality factor is great too: the psycho killer is free to move around Texas killing men by the dozens without ever encountering a police roadblock. He also finds a clever use for this compressed-air pistol, which also seems to give no backlash at all when used to shoot out key locks from doors... think of the great work those engineers must have done to bend the laws of physics that way.<br/><br/>Seriously, the things that this movie has taught me, are: <br/><br/>1) Oscar prizes mean nothing.<br/><br/>2) most people think ""if it won an Oscar, it MUST be good"" <br/><br/>3) Some people find amusing to watch other people being slaughtered and have no objection at all to that. That's what scares me the most.<br/><br/>I give this movie two stars for the good acting and filming, but otherwise it is just another step in the planned de-humanization of the western people.<br/><br/>I am really, really sorry that I wasted my 7 euros on this."
"a-little-squeek","7","14","36","12 December 2007"," No Film for Fans of a Tidy Ending...............
","Throughout the experience I kept telling myself ""yes, this IS an 8.9 grade movie"". Beautifully filmed and directed, generally, I think it is one of the best Coen Bros. films produced to date. The scenes, scenery and settings are stark, grimy, impoverished and just great as a palette to the interaction of superb dialog and interesting characters. Check the camera play throughout the film. The Coens have a style and execution all their own, in a league with De Palma, Scorsese and the like, yes, maybe even Hitchcock. Plot development is subdued but edgy and there are some surprising and gratifying twists and turns.<br/><br/>Character development is great and I am impressed with ALL the performances but especially with Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, Woody Harrelson, in that order. Jones shines with his portrayal of the grizzled cowboy/sheriff, in a character reprisal similar to his role in ""Three Funerals"", I would love to see him paired up in a southwest movie along side Robert Duvall. Bardem is sinister and unflinching and reminds me of a flesh and blood ""Terminator""; Josh Brolin(looking like his dad's twin) terrific as the prey; a surprise appearance by Harrelson, sharp and witty, I'd like to see more of him in future projects. <br/><br/>The big problem I have with this film is in it's culmination. I will say nothing more on this subject so that I do not create a spoiler. Suffice to say, despite ALL of its cumulative wonderfullness(?) I downgrade it from a 9 to a 7.5 because of the ""ending"". Reminds me of how I felt at the end of ""Blair Witch"". Too bad.....I hate unfulfilled expectation, especially after spending $8.50 for it..........Wait for the DVD rental........<br/><br/>I'd like to say that I'm becoming more and more disenchanted with the ratings levels that appear in the IMDb. Clearly, because of the ending, this is NOT an 8.9 grade movie."
"rfrenzel2002","1","8","18","3 April 2008"," One of the worst movies I've ever seen
","This is another case of the public joining in praise for a movie that is simply awful. The little ""acting"" that's attempted in this movie falls flatter than day old beer. Tommy Lee Jones sits around for 2 hours drinking coffee and reading newspapers in his office and various diners while the two main characters try to outwit one another. The dialog goes no where, usually involving subject matter that bears no importance to the plot, atmosphere or any thing else that might serve to redeem this pathetic film. Picture Tommy Lee sitting in a diner talking to another character about peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and you'll get a feel for what your in for if you ever decide to attempt this film. I was hoping he would eventually redeem this film but sadly it never happens.<br/><br/>The Coen's were always an odd bunch, whether they're working with their own material or someone else's, and with this film they simply perpetuate that legacy. Nothing more, nothing less. If you like watching paint dry or like to spend long lazy afternoons watching snails copulate, this film's for you."

","This film is not one I would sit through if I were not voting on it, and it is a film that I truly regret watching. There are memorable moments of psychopathic cruelty portrayed here that I never needed in my memory. I don't ever want to see a snuff film, and I don't ever need to see viable facsimiles of them. (And NO, memorable does not mean it is a good film, it just means that film images are very potent.) My father is a huge fan of westerns and of Tommy Lee Jones, hated this film. He watches most films multiple times and will not watch this again.<br/><br/>This film IS completely relevant in terms of history, border wars, drug wars, illegal immigration, and the impotence of our law enforcement to deal with ingrained attitudes of immorality and an insane level of escalation.<br/><br/>The acting is why I gave this a 2 instead of 1(awful): Javier Bardem is not a supporting player, he is a lead - he causes all the action throughout the film, and he DID deserve any acting award for his excellent, nuanced portrayal of the gradual degradation of this disturbed individual. Excellent lamb-like performance by Kelly Macdonald in a thankless role. (I love her. She starred in ""Gosford Park."" But come on... we have hundreds of brilliant American stage actresses who could have done this supporting role.) Josh Brolin does a great job with a well-scripted role of an ethically bankrupt everyday ""hero."" Tommy Lee Jones does what he can with a very impotent role. It had to be a star of his gravitas to make anything memorable of that role.<br/><br/>But relevance and accuracy are not enough to make something ""art."" Nihilism is no answer, and it certainly is NOT entertainment. Folks - with all the power and potential of this medium, is this really the best we can do? Imitate the worst of humanity?<br/><br/>Not Debatable: RECORD low numbers watching of the Oscars this year; even with all the additional news/publicity &the hype about the writers's strike potentially canceling it. <br/><br/>Debatable: This film and the morally blank and hope-deficient films of this year are directly accountable for the lack of interest in the Oscars or film in general. Of course something else that turns people off the Oscars is this kind of ""positioning"" a lead actor as a supporting actor to help ensure that he wins the supporting award."

"Comandante666","7","17","47","26 October 2007"," It's good enough to be great
","First of all I have to admit that I'm a hopeless adherer of Coen movies. So to all the folks who basically don't like 'em: better skip my comment simply because it might not be objective in every sense. <br/><br/>I watched the movie yesterday at the Vienna International Film Festival and I must say it is awesome in many ways. The actors (and not only Javier Bardem whom I totally admire since his portrayal of Ramón Sampedro in Mar Adentro)are superb. Tommy Lee Jones as aging Sheriff and Josh Brolin as the one who kicks off the whole mess. Their performances are outstanding and even Scottish Kelly Macdonald, whom I still remember as delightful Diana in Trainspotting, was pretty convincing as Texan trailer-girl. <br/><br/>Back to the mess: And there is plenty of mess in that movie for sure. Counting dead bodies is almost a Sisyphean task. So don't even try. By the way, apart of a dead dog, that actually looks more like a stuffed potato, the bodies are really well prepared. Also a scene where the psychic killer (Bardem) is operating on his own leg looks pretty real and gives you the creeps. But it's not only blood and violence as some critics have found fault. There is much more of course. It's the irony and sharpness that lies in every spoken line and joke. As in earlier masterpieces by the Coen brothers this combination of brutality, irony and every day life brings flavor to the movie. It's set in the amazingly beautiful countryside of the US-American south. And images of slowly hovering clouds are a welcome variation of otherwise rather cruel pictures.<br/><br/>What the movie maybe lacks a bit is deepness of the plot. I mean don't get me wrong the plot is fun and all but it's not quite the story of Fargo or The Big Lebovsky. Though one might argue that the plot isn't the most important part of a Coen movie, which is probably even true, I find it worth to mention that they have already written better screenplays. <br/><br/>To sum up, though the film is not as consistent in all possible aspects, as some of their earlier work has been, the created ambiance is definitely worth spending some bucks for two hours of splendid 'coenic' cinema feeling.<br/><br/>Watch it and convince yourselves. It's good enough to be great!"
"sebastiangarbarz","2","5","10","13 September 2016"," Bad movie, bad ending, cliché plot.
","Well this is my first review. It will be really short. The plot is simple and very common. Javier Bardem is really great, besides playing a psycho-cliché role. There are scenes that are just to fill in some time (the woman in the pool, the car accident at the very end). The end is illogical, no point in making a 'different end' where the bad guy lives. Everybody get's killed except Tommy Lee, who's part is poor. I'm not being able to find out why this movie worth 4 Oscars. It has a plot that has been filmed and produced 50 times a year since the past 50 years. There's no elements of surprise, and some twists made all of the sudden (for example, they show you how everyone gets killed except for the main character Josh Brolin) That was my opinion. Regards."

However, he fails miserably at his job, and kills the wrong people by the dozens.<br/><br/>The police is unable to track down a man leaving behind a ramboesque bodycount of dead people, and fingerprints all over, uses a unique weapon and unique behaviour that witnesses would be able to remember for years.<br/><br/>An unbelievable story with unbelievable characters."

","I'll be brief on this one. A typical example of the present-day trend to focus on gratuitous violence dished out with a tasteless watery semi-philosophical sauce which aims at conveying a vague ethical message. Others have pointed out that I didn't get the humor of it all. Well, apart from all the excessive visual violence, I particularly remember one scene where the psycho leaves the house of yet another victim whom he has obviously just slaughtered and casually looks down at the sole of his shoe to see if there are no bloodstains on it. Humor? Funny? I think not. Sam Peckinpah would have made this movie in his usual detached way. The fact that the Cohen brothers favor the same kind of meaningless violence but nevertheless try to add a vague form of moral concern is not only revolting but also extremely hypocritical."

","OK! So there are great characters, good atmosphere, good hook to a story but then what? The movie by its end leaves you like you had a big sneeze coming that just didn't. The underdog, the quasi-good guy dies at the hands of the psychopath about 90% into the movie. Then the psychopath visits the dead man's wife, presumably kills her, then has an accident fractures his arm and walks away. Nothing is explained. WHy does the guy survive for almost entire movie just to die near the end? What happened to the money? WHy did the sheriff give up on catching the killer? Why is an air gun the killer's weapon of choice? WHy does the sheriff visit the cat person out of the blue for a totally tangential plot line when most of the movie is done? Most importantly what was the point of the whole darn movie?"

Some of the scenes in it were very surprising. I didn't see some of the stuff in the movie coming. This movie was actually suspenseful. All of a sudden you are just watching and then the next the killer just pops out of no where. Javier Bardem was the perfect actor for this film. He looked just like a killer should, red eyed and creepy. Tommy Lee Jones although he was a supporting actor. He still played a good part and gave the movie more information. The action started out at the beginning and went until the end. The whole entire movie it kept me on the edge of my seat. Josh Brolin did an amazing job playing a man who finds two million dollars. After he finds the money he is chased down by many different people also searching for the money. I am not surprised that this movie won so many academy awards. Especially for the acting. Overall this was a very very good movie. That should be seen by anyone who likes western, action, or drama movies. I promise you will like this movie, after all look at all the other reviews. One more thing about the acting it was just amazing, I can say that over and over again. Especially Javier Bardems character. They needed him to look as scary as possible and they did. He was very scary looking to me. He is one guy I wouldn't want to meet. Their was also a lot of bloody violence. So if you want blood and violence this was great for you."

Tommy Lee Jones, whom I like a lot, is deadpan and not that interesting.

What's with Woody's character? Why was it even a part of the movie, it didn't really add anything to it. They could have left out all the scenes with the guy who hires him, too, and it would not have changed the movie. Anton has no redeeming qualities and is quite boring as a character.

No offence intended to anyone: Im speaking generically, not personally. <br/><br/>Pointless movie. Poorly shot in places - I can see where they were trying to be clever, but it just wasn't. Some interesting attempts at what i will now call 'movie jazz' (filming around the main event rather than the main event itself, bit like jazz musicians hitting the offkey note rather than on), but it was so haphazardly done, with too many incidental nobodies that it BARELY held itself together. <br/><br/>And the bad guy? PLEEASE! he was pathetically overly-intensified (and not event that intense anyway). Were we all supposed to be scared by his personal honour system? Or his methods? Or the fact that all the hit men in the film (well, all two of them) were 'superhunters' that could find you in minutes if your granny crapped in a trailer park 50 years ago? PLEASE!

","... Or alternatively, as the tagline puts it: ""No one gets away clean"". At the outset, each character is confident that they can outwit their adversaries and that their idealistic vision will ultimately prevail. What time comes to show them, however, is that life always holds all the aces, and that not one of them will emerge from their struggle with an ending that suits them in the long term. Even Chigurh, the one whom all his fellow humans fear throughout the runtime - seeming to carry as he does an aura of supernatural invulnerability - gets an implacable air of natural justice served upon him by receiving the scars of hard-fought struggle. It's an extremely fatalistic message delivered to us, emphasised by the barren and unforgiving landscape that is the arena for these happenings. Sooner or later, every mortal will find themselves accountable to a force beyond their comprehension.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem becomes an utterly terrifying figure, despite never appearing to exert himself much, on screen. That's good acting, I guess, when you can distill your performance and still find it encompasses everything that is necessary. The other cast members are worthy of praise too, and the Coen brothers marshal each individual element at their disposal to deliver a full tale that seems note-perfect and quietly resonant. ""No Country for Old Men"" is a film that leaves its imprint felt for a long time after viewing, and will deservedly be hailed as one of the true masterpieces of 2007."

"dianewds","10","5","10","31 December 2007"," Best Movie of 2007
","2007 was a good year and offers many excellent films; domestic and international but among them all, NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, is perhaps the best of the best. (Yes, I have seen THERE WILL BE BLOOD and loved it but due to this film having 10s in all categories, think it best).<br/><br/>Others have already commented in great detail about the storyline so will not address other than to say it was stellar and delivered some of the most memorable one-liners of a single movie that I can easily recall. Though I will say for those who had a problem with the ending, consider seeing it again.<br/><br/>QUESTIONABLE ENDING: The ending was brilliant. We all want to think good guys will triumph and we'll finally know more about the sociopath killers and there will be an end will be in sight but (regrettably) the older we get, the more we come to realize there is likely not going to be an end to maniacal killings, not back when, now or in the future. ""Whatever is coming is coming"" as the old man says later in the movie. It is a ghost that continues to appear time and time again despite modern technology or know how. Though we've grown accustomed to our Westerns showing the good guys winning we see a realistic, mature and modern Western through the eyes of realism an older experienced lawman who now perhaps recognizes in a dream that a father is preparing the way for him. Think about it. Coen Brothers are brilliant.<br/><br/>SANS MUSIC: No music risky? Yes and oh what a good choice. The screenwriter is so gifted; that combined with impeccable direction, grade A actors,and camera/sound work makes the choice to forgo not only purposeful but actually intensifies the suspense.<br/><br/>Too, one can argue that there was a natural chorus of background sounds, i.e. the wind rustling, car on gravel road, boots on pavement, gravel, the sounds that seem to echo loudly especially in tense moments. While music can be crucial to building dramatic tension it can also detract.<br/><br/>From the very beginning we are purposefully placed, frame by frame, within the film along with the characters; we see and hear what they see and hear. Immediately we - through the passport of our senses, see and hear where we are - vast Texas country flatlands. Instead of a beautiful score to match the panoramic view we hear the beauty of a mature, older man's telling or overview of his experience and we begin to prepare ourselves for what ""might be coming"".<br/><br/>We hear the sounds of that vastness of country road and see a cop placing a man (only a side-view of Bardem) in handcuffs in backseat of car, then in jail house seated behind him. The camera allows us to focus on conversation of the good-looking deputy in foreground and prisoner in the background with a first look at his face though not clearly the focal point. Then, within seconds we see his advancement, hear and see (from above) the look and sounds of a maniacal first and then second killing.<br/><br/>Then shift to another countryside scene and are behind the gun focus of hunter, Josh Brolin's character, Llewelyn, who is taking aim of a deer. All we hear and see is what he hears. Wind rustling, natural sounds. He's quiet and focused. We're quiet and focused and then, BANG! No music is needed, the action, the natural noise places us squarely where the director wants us, suspensefully riding shotgun throughout the entire movie. And, it works! <br/><br/>CAST: Stellar cast. You know it's stellar when you can't make up your mind which star shines brightest. They all do. Perhaps one of my favs was the character with so little lines, Kelly MacDonald who plays Llewelyn's wife. First, she does a killer southern accent and second, her character is completely believable and you want to see her even more. Each times she's on screen is meaningful and memorable, especially the last scene.<br/><br/>Brolin is also entirely believable as a Texan whose Nam experience (we learn latter) prepares him for absolutely any encounter. His performance deserves nomination for best actor category. The Texas mindset, dry wit, economy of words juxtaposed to swift and decisive actions have never delivered more authentically than they do in this screenplay. Brolin, Lee et-al get it and deliver.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem in the opening scene tells us with no words, only his action and body movements what evil looks like. He is ruthless, calculating and crazed. He's the kind of character that engenders immediate fright and respect for his ""principles"" as Harrelson describes later. We learn all of this within ONE singular frame shot (from above) in the jail cell when he is strangling the deputy. It is that camera work and focus on Bardem's facial expression (no words and no music) that says it all. This is brilliant direction and acting perfection. He also deserves nomination for best actor and is phenomenal, period! <br/><br/>Tommy Lee Jones delivers a perfect performance. I am always in awe of his ability to develop his character. He can take any role, lead or character, and make you wait with baited breath for his return to the screen. The sheriff is perhaps my favorite character in this movie. Again, the screenwriter really understands Texan mindsets and motivations. TLJones understands it and what he does with the lines and the silence in between the lines is what translates into a winning performance and movie.<br/><br/>CREW: Camera (incredible),Sound (especially), sets, folio, editing, costumes, etc. all impeccable and a real blend of talent.<br/><br/>See this movie and see it again. There's so much that makes it great. It's a winner now and will no doubt become a classic. Well done!"

","What if the Terminator was real but this time took the form of an infallibly clever, spaced-out-looking Mexican cat hell bent on retrieving the $2 million he lost in a drug deal gone bad? In 'No Country for Old Men,' the Coen Brothers follow up the engaging meditation on evil depicted in their groundbreaking 1996 film, 'Fargo.' In a hyper-real bleak-scape of rural Texas circa 1980 we variously follow the adventures of parallel protagonists as they quest either for the lost loot, the whereabouts of the Mexican, or an escape from the latter with the former.<br/><br/>Along the way we are treated most notably to heart-breaking murder scenes in which Javier Bardem's spaced-out Mexican, Anton Chigurh, slowly drains innocents of their dignity and then pitilessly snuffs out their lives in that winkingly ironic fashion so popular in modern American film-making. It's a real laugh-factory.<br/><br/>Additionally, we get long-winded, mind-numbing soliloquies from Tommy Lee Jones's Sheriff Ed Tom Bell about very little having to do with the actual plot. These speeches might have had a home in a film that connected them to anything going on in the story, but they seem variously lost and smug in this picture.<br/><br/>Gluing it all together is a dreary and nihilist sensibility that loses all authenticity in its attempt at super-authenticity, not to mention story-telling that too often forgets its audience.<br/><br/>Granted, the violence is visceral, mostly consequential and each scene in which it occurs is effective. It's not let-you-off-the-hook A-Team violence. It's all frightening and real. But you know what? So's my tax bill -- what else ya' got? Just because you've larded it up with ultra-realistic violence does not mean you've made an important film. Fargo wasn't great because the violence was real, Fargo was great because everything else was, too. No matter his methods, anyone leaving a trail of bodies this long would have inspired a dragnet of epic proportions -- especially in Texas. And especially considering Chigurh's first victim was a policeman.<br/><br/>And for the coup de grace, we land on an infuriating, art-film ending that will leave you wishing upon the Coen brothers the same kind of pitiless death they'd portrayed throughout. Granted, there's some poetic logic that comes into focus at the end, but be assured it will render cold, cold comfort.<br/><br/>The Coen boys were clearly trying to make something more than your average thriller, but it comes off like a snuff film pretending to be a parable.<br/><br/>This movie review by Erik Gloor"
"srstolz","8","5","10","2 December 2007"," The Western is most certainly not dead
","Cormac McCarthy finally gets a movie worthy of him. Astonishing performances (esp. from Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem) and absolutely masterful cinematography mix with a deceptively simple narrative. Indeed, Bardem at times reaches the level of Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter in his character's creepiness. This film is like a much blacker Fargo. The Coens wonderfully use Texan slang (""It's a mess, ain't it?"" asks one character, to which Tommy Lee Jones' replies ""If it ain't, it'll do till the real one gets here."") for various purposes--building tension, playing with ideas, relieving tension.<br/><br/>McCarthy's recurring question, which was front and center in All The Pretty Horses-- is there such a thing as a meaningful code of honour?-- is tossed around, sometimes casually, sometimes horrifically. His deeper concern-- a mythic interest in what we might call karma, or the inescapable balancing act the Universe makes, or the relentless absurdist logic of obligation-- unfolds through various kinds of horror.<br/><br/>The film's only weak point is its occasional moralising speeches. It is as if the Brothers worried-- as did Coleridge of his speaker's impact int he Rime of the Ancient Mariner, a poem with more than a few similarities to this film-- that the sheer power of their story would overwhelm its moral concerns. But ultimately this is the Coens at their best."
"hardycampbell","9","5","10","28 November 2007"," ""No Country"" is No Country for the Unallegorical
","Americans watch American movies expecting to see tried-and-true American themes of criminality punished by good ol' American violence, our overwhelming preference for solving all of the world's ill, even when it usually doesn't. So along comes this faithful (so I'm told) adaptation of the McCarthy book by the same title, which on the surface doesn't seem to have anything to do with the film (the title comes for a poem called ""Sailing to Byzantium."") But if one looks at the movie as the ancient Greek philosophers would have, then maybe everything makes a great deal more sense. Take the title. The movie starts with a voice-over narration by the Tommy Lee Jones character, an old school lawman in West Texas, who tells us he comes from a long lineage of Lone Star justice enforcers. He lets us know quickly that the new breed of criminal, motivated by drug-fueled greed and remorseless mayhem, bewilders him. This New Country is No Country for this Old Man. He is an outsider looking in, and throughout the whole movie he is always a step behind the main protagonists, the younger generation personified by Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem. These are men for whom the 1980s Reaganite mantra of money at any cost will be drowned out by the drug wars, the contra wars, and the Greed is Good ethos of an unrestrained and predatory Wall Street. Brolin, a white trailer trash welder, finds himself the only man standing amidst a scene of drug sale gone bad carnage. He callously ignores a dying Mexican's request for water while searching for the cash he suspects motivated this desert shootout. When he finds it, he returns home, and that, in the real world, would be that. He and his cute country girl wife would party lifelong in Tahiti with their sudden wealth. But no, this is a Greek story, and the Greeks would make man do things for the pleasure of the Gods, like get up in the middle of the night, pierced with guilt, to take water to that now long dead Mexican who he wouldn't give the time of day to just hours ago. In any case, that questionable decision sets off a chain of events that should have been the segue for introducing the Bardem character, the chilling menace of Anton Chuigich, who must join the ranks of Hollywood's all time great villains. But we meet Anton in the first scenes of the movie, before Brolin's discovery, being arrested by some highway patrolman who confidently trots him to jail, only to be strangled like some country chicken on the waxed floors of the police station. We see that Anton likes killing, indeed, it seems to be the only time he's really alive. He kills the people who hire him to find the stolen cash simply because they hired him, and must be worthy of extinction for that reason alone. Others he gives a fighting chance. He asks a gas station attendant to call a coin toss, without telling him that his life depends on the call. The symbolism seems clear to me. Chuigich's concern for money only devolves around that small piece of metallic coin, and he tells that attendant his whole life has come to this random chance meeting and this random chance coin flip, a cosmic convergence around an otherwise meaningless medium of monetary exchange. When the attendant makes the life saving call, Antion urges him to keep that coin separate from the other coins, lest it revert to what it was and is, useless lifeless money. And he understands that God is a Random deity, at least from a a mortal's perspective; everyone's going to die anyway. Does it matter if that's decided by a coin toss or a traffic accident? He murders bad people without the lottery of gravity tugged metal because their end was predetermined by their knowledge of him. Probably most disappointing to many was the ending, which did not have Chuigich being arch typically killed by lawman Tommy Lee. The last scene shows Tommy Lee recounting a dream he had of his father, who tries to impart some wisdom to his son before this No Country for Old Men reality interrupts. There is no bloodbath, no retribution, no hail of bullets with a blonde hanging off his arm. Tommy Lee is alone and he knows it, alone in a random world where justice appears like a black wrath with a bad haircut that no one really wants to stop. Is this a great film? No, I can't rate it that highly, though Bardem's performance is riveting and certainly in the Anthony Hopkins-Hannibal Lector ranking of malevolencies on screen. But the direction was taut, the photography gripping and the story, if one divests themselves of American prejudices of what film-making should be, a morality tale worthy of Olympus. But I would liked to have had more focus on these themes, actually a longer film to be honest, and more of the Harrelson character involved instead of making a brief appearance and then getting killed. Still, it's one of the better films down the pike for a while."

","Maybe I'm admitting to old fogey-hood, but, to me, this movie is bad for society, though it's effective, disturbing cinema. I can see two powerful fallouts from it: 1) people with a violence problem have found a new hero. The movie makes it seem realistic that this Terminator-like avenger could actually be that continually successfully lethal and impregnable. Someone will channel that guy. 2) Is anyone going to stop to help a stranger after seeing this? Is anyone actually going to want to interact in any way with a stranger??? These points, though heartfelt, are somewhat ironic. The movie could also be looked at as a statement ABOUT our society which glamorizes violence. Yes, it was effective, but I worry about its impact"

","Most UN-satisfying movie experience. Have seem something like this done better in Fargo. It leaves a lot of loose ends, does not follow through with the characters. The lead Character, his wife, the money etc. nothing resolved. It left a lot of sour taste in the mouth. Most of the time it was slow. Have to give 1 point the weapon used by the bad guy. The acting and cinematography was good but not enough to save the movie. The sheriff's character, Tommy Lee, made for a frustratingly slow character. And most of all a very abrupt ending.... Yawwwn.

Heck for the 10 minutes of the film that Woody Harrelson was in, he was a good character. It's starts off very interesting and has a good main character driving the story with the antagonist character closely pursuing his prey. The premise was believable and the way the story evolved, you knew that there was going to be some sort of apex that would happen, the ultimate showdown between the hero and the villain. WHAT A LET DOWN. It didn't play out that way at all. Not to mention a lot of mumbled dialogue and misqueued direction that the film eventually took for the last 45 minutes.

","Like so many others, I went to see this movie based on the good reviews and high score on IMDb. None of my friends have seen it, so I got no warning of what was in store.<br/><br/>Everything here is my opinion, I bought it on the flea marker :) The movie starts out well, I was impressed with the style, camera work and the down to earth choices the characters made. This lasted as long as there were no dialogs though. From that point on I started to feel uneasy, things just didn't connect. I started to notice how unreal the whole setup was and how illogical the story worked. In the end I felt that there was no conclusion or ending at all, because I couldn't figure out why anything really happened or ended and what the motivation of the characters was.<br/><br/>It wouldn't be so bad if I could find some underlying message, or at least the movie put me in some different mood when I started to watch it. But no, I could feel nothing for the characters, because there was no connection on any level. And if there was some underlying message, that was overshadowed by the massive violence and imagery.<br/><br/>Maybe I could find something enjoyable/thought provoking about this movie on a second viewing, but I just cannot bring myself to watch it again.<br/><br/>BTW, I would have given it 4/10 for the visual style, but I don't want to see this movie anywhere near the TOP 250, thus the 1/10."

The main character (who got the cash and ran away) returned to the scene to bring water to the dead guys ??? C'mon, give me a break. If you paid attention, you would realize that this guy had no mercy when he looked the injured Mexican guy on the truck. ""Bringing water"" was just an excuse for the man hunt to continue. <br/><br/>As the story went further, I was further intrigued by how the serial killer could find the main character at every corner, and why the main character was so stupid as he couldn't find a way to break the chase. There was absolutely nothing that impressed me.

"ackstasis","8","6","13","4 January 2008"," ""Even in the contest between man and steer, the issue is not certain.""
","There are very few filmmakers working today who can match up against Joel and Ethan Coen. Since their neo-noirish debut with 'Blood Simple. (1984),' the brother directors have dominated modern cinema with their unique brand of writing and storytelling, evoking the atmosphere of classic films while always maintaining a distinct sense of originality. 'No Country for Old Men (2007)' comes after a somewhat disappointing five-year stretch, during which they produced the second-tier remake, 'The Ladykillers (2003),' and the fun but inconsequential 'Intolerable Cruelty (2004).' Adapting the 2005 novel by Cormac McCarthy, the Coens have created one of the most harrowingly-intense cinema experiences you'll have all year, a cat-and-mouse game of drugs, violence, money and murder that will leave you gasping for air, and clawing at your armrest in search of some comfort. While this film is not the pair's most respectable outing  there's a certain roughness to the film that I couldn't quite connect with  they've certainly never delivered anything so chillingly gruesome and suspenseful.<br/><br/>The year is 1980. When local hunter Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) happens upon the site of a massacre in the middle of the parched, Texan desert, the apparent aftermath of drug deal gone wrong, his discovery of the $2 million payment, bunched neatly in a leather suitcase, prompts him to make a few decisions he'll come to regret later on. A psychopathic hit-man, Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a grotesque killer with no scruples, arrives at the scene to recover the money, only to find the loot missing and the remains of Llewelyn's abandoned vehicle. While the two men play a deadly game of hide-and-seek across the Texan countryside  Anton killing fellow conspirators, law enforcers and innocent victims at every turn  soon-to-be-retired sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) reluctantly follows, disillusioned by the overwhelming amount of evil present in the current world. The exploits of these three main characters, though they rarely share the screen, seem to blend feverishly among one another, and the eventual outcome of the story is one that you're unlikely to see coming.<br/><br/>Anton Chigurh is certainly one of the more formidable villains to come our way in recent years. Though lacking the complexity of somebody like Hannibal Lecter, Chigurh is most terrifying because he is the complete opposite: silent, methodical, ruthless His actions are almost mechanical in their simplicity and practicality; he will do whatever is needed to get the job done, with little thought for human life {it would not be unreasonable to liken Chigurh to the Terminator (1984)}. His opening scene is the cinematic equivalent of a violent kick in the gut, a sequence as shockingly violent as I've seen in the first five minutes of any movie in recent memory {though, admittedly, I do tend to stay away from any film that promises a lot of bloodshed}. After this, the Coens show no signs of letting up, and, time after time, we are treated to one graphic death after another. The presence of a few off-screen murders does show that the two filmmakers' awareness that a cut-away is often more appropriate, but I think perhaps their penchant for blood takes the film a bit too far. I'm generally all right with violence if it contributes to the story, but at what point does it simply become gratuitous?<br/><br/>Sprinkled amongst all the tattered bodies in Anton Chigurh's wake is a Coen Brothers script that delivers the black humour and witty dialogue of most of their previous films. The screenplay cleverly interweaves the extreme violence of the story with an amusing combination of droll banter and uneasy conversation, most noticeable in the scene in which Chigurh challenges a nervous service station owner to a coin toss (""what's the most you ever lost on a coin toss?""). Though I chuckled quite regularly, I also feel the need to denounce the film-goer in the row ahead of me, who, rather distractingly, laughed at every single line as though it was the greatest thing since Charles Chaplin got himself caught on the conveyor belt. 'No Country for Old Men' is most stylistically similar to the Coens' debut effort, 'Blood Simple. (1984),' and, thematically, it deals with the same issues explored in both this and 'Fargo (1996);' namely, the corrupting power of money.<br/><br/>The ending for the film, which was greeted by a hushed moment of universal confusion in the cinema, remains true to the source material. Though it was undoubtedly interesting to hear Sheriff Ed Tom Bell recounting his confused and insightful dreams, the tension in the final twenty minutes drops off so dramatically that ""anti-climax"" is the only word that comes to mind. The Sheriff's vision of his long-deceased father ""riding on past"" and ""fixin' to make a fire somewhere out there in all that dark and all that cold"" is an obvious allusion to death and the possible afterlife. As near as I can tell, and I have a history of missing the point on such thing, the dream seems to be summarising the film by declaring that there is evil in the world, there always has been evil in the world, and there always will be. Perhaps the only way you can escape this evil is in death, where the Sheriff's father is waiting for him by a roaring fire in the depths of the cold, dark night."

Quality actors, fine cinematography and all-around technical competence (why I gave it any rating at all) don't make up for a pathetically meaningless story.

I'm no movie critic, but listen, neither was them who wrote, no? I'm not gonna be french and try be all intellect but you know this art-fest is more of a fart-fest if you get my drift. Listen, I wish I could people would stop putting them Mexicans as the dead animals putting themselves over a border THAT Doesn't EXIST! I've seen borders, and they make difference. How they all speak Spanish, like the guy says Medico Por Favor? When he is white? Now one more thing, you know how Bardem, if that's his real name, makes it like they all magic die with metal head bang? That isn't pa-usable, or even plausible. For peat's sake, get something more pa-usable. Like a stick of that hard Italian cheese they put on that pasta, you know?

"charchuk","9","7","16","25 November 2007"," Emotionally draining
","This is probably the definition of a film you have to watch twice. I don't really feel like I can do it justice after just one viewing, especially one in a noisy theatre, full of restless teens, next door to Fred Claus being played at full volume. As such, the lack of music really stands out and the delicate dialogue is difficult to decipher at times. Furthermore, from a purely movie-going experience, the dark ending feels unsatisfactory, and I know that I have to watch the film again, forgoing the narrative, in order to fully understand it. As it stands now, though, it's one of the very best films of the year.<br/><br/>A lot of people seem to be complaining about the Tommy Lee Jones subplot, and of course everyone has something to say about that ending. I don't think these two are unrelated. On the surface, this storyline seems extraneous, taking away from the extremely intense main story. The constant asides to Bell and his deputy's investigation seem only an attempt to explain the events that are happening, but as nothing is ever fully explained, this subplot seems useless. I don't necessarily agree with this. Bell - his opening narration and final thoughts especially - seem to be a representation of the thematic element of the story, whereas the Llewellyn/Chigurh story is an affirmation of these themes. I'm not sure if I've got a full grasp on everything the film is saying - there's definitely ideas about morality, violence, money, death, and the changing world thrown about - but I got enough to know that multiple viewings are required. And I'm looking forward to it.<br/><br/>Of course, one can not ignore the utterly thrilling and exceptionally shot main storyline, which, at least up until Llewellyn's death, seems to be operating entirely within conventional, Hollywood standards. That's not to say it isn't incredibly effective. From the get-go, Chigurh is shown to be one of the most ruthless, calmest, inventive and downright terrifying villains in cinematic history. His unique appearance, his physical tics, his unusual choice of weapons, and his very precise manner of speaking combine to create a full, fleshed-out character - but as for portraying a human, well, that's another story. On the flip side, Brolin's quiet, reserved Llewellyn is the emotional core of the movie, making us feel for him even as he proves to be just as selfish and villainous as those chasing him. The conflict between the two is the highlight of the movie, from the terrifically tense cat-and-mouse chase in the first motel to the terrifically intense gun battle in the second one. Though there is no real physical payoff to these confrontations, I think the phone conversation between them - the one and only time they speak - is fitting enough. Both characters receive their retributions in other ways, which is the perfect capper to the conflict. Though their ends may be narratively unfulfilling, I think they work flawlessly thematically.<br/><br/>One must not forget about the fantastic technical aspect when reviewing this film, either. The lack of music is very stark and though makes the scenes much more suspenseful and scary, as there's no musical cue to tell us when to be frightened. Tied in to this, the use of sound in this movie is impeccable, and may be even more effective than the visuals. The scene where Chigurh finds where Llewellyn is hiding while the latter waits for him is accomplished almost entirely through the use of sounds - Chigurh's boots on the floor, the beeping of the transponder, the unscrewing of the lightbulb, the readying of his gas tank weapon. We, like Llewellyn, are forced to just listen, but we know what's going to happen next, making the inevitable that much scarier. Of course, as with every Coen film, the cinematography is stunning, and nearly every shot in this movie is stunning and artistically rich. The careful, eloquent nature of the dialogue that has become a staple of these brothers' films is utilized to full extent here, and as I said I need to see it again to take in everything. Overall, just a fantastic achievement.<br/><br/>Even so, I couldn't help but be disappointed by that ending. It wasn't a ""that was it?"" response, where I felt something was left unexplained and I didn't know what happened. It was more of a ""oh, that's it"", where I just feel depressed and emotionally drained. There is no character redemption - even Bell, the most moral of the characters, is not left untouched - no plot threads being tied up, no happy ending. It's just a hopelessly dark finish. Of course, that fits in perfectly with the film's perspective on the world, so perhaps it's a great ending. I just couldn't see it that way."

Maybe I went into this expecting too much given the high rating & all, it's not like I need a happy or Hollywood ending to like a movie, but this movie was just ruined in the final act, to the point where I was kind of shell shocked, and after that wore off I was kind of pissed knowing I blew 2 hours on this. The best analogy I can give is working on a good jigsaw puzzle only to find there are missing pieces in the end, leaving you feeling cheated.<br/><br/>Acting wise I thought Javier and Josh were great and I liked them both. Tommy & Woody were both wasted and didn't serve any point or advance the plot of the movie at all. In fact both of them could have been stripped out of the movie completely and it wouldn't have changed a single thing. Kelly was okay, but nothing special<br/><br/>Personally I though the effects were kind of hokey, and very noticeable GCI when it came to certain gunshot hits and it always reminds me that practical effects always beat out GCI any day of the week, but sadly this is just the way of things I guess<br/><br/>Overall I think the movie had a lot of potential, but it's as if they ran out of money or just tried to pull off some weird M. Night Shyamalan ending which failed miserably. It's really hard to digest and describe without directly spoiling, but in the end I was left unsatisfied and a bit confused, and not confused as in I didn't get it, but again I really can't dive into that more without giving away spoilers.

","4 Academy Awards, Come On?!?! I admit there was some good acting and good cinematography but the rest was a total disappointment. It was not a modern day Western as I was led to believe: it was a farce. Here are some things I found farcical: the deputy leaves the prisoner handcuffed with hands in from of him. Was there no cell to put him in? The hunter has a pang of conscience and returns to 'drug deal gone bad' scene with some water for one of dying dealers. There was no explanation of why the deal went wrong in the first place; obviously the two parties each brought their goods. Why didn't the hunter just call the police/sheriff from a payphone and say he saw a scene of carnage in the desert instead of taking a dying man water in a jug? After the deputy was killed, why wasn't there a manhunt out for the killer? The sheriff seemed to dwell on his retirement more than stopping the carnage. Where were the Texas Rangers in all of this? If the sheriff was overwhelmed, why didn't he call for help? Did no one in Texas carry a gun other than the killer? Well you get the picture: gross carnage, how many people can we kill in a 2 hour movie, etc. Glad I didn't pay to see it in a theater."
"ironhorse_iv","8","3","5","21 February 2019"," It's time to call it, friendo for what it is! A cinematic masterpiece.
","Based upon, author, Cormac McCarthy's 2005 novel of the same name; there is no doubt, 'No Country for Old Men' was an amazing movie. This film written and directed by the Coen Brothers was mostly entertaining from beginning into the end. However, there were some flaws. Such in the case of pacing. This Academy Award-winning best picture crime drama and neo-western really takes its sweet time, telling the story of a disillusion elderly cop, Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), having to find & protect an West Texas resident Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) whom recovered stolen drug money in a drug deal gone bad, before a psychotic and sociopathic hitman, Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) and the Mexican Cartels get a hold of him. Without spoiling this motion picture masterpiece, too much, while the game of cat & mouse story is a bit slow at parts, mostly in the opening & the subverted your expectations off-screen ending with Moss was a bit annoying. I still love this film. Glad, the Coen Brothers did cut out a few of the unneeded moments from the book, such as Moss picking up a hitchhiker. Nevertheless, most of the scenes, they did left, didn't felt unsatisfying & too scattered during most of the movie. The only one that was a bit bothersome was the swimming pool chat. I really don't get, why that was in the film. Nevertheless, while, the story is not that original, as there is striking similarities regarding the storyline and setting to 1973's crime thriller film 'Charley Varrick' aka 'The Last of the Independents"" directed by Don Siegel & the 1968's novel 'The Looters' by author John H. Reese. One thing, the source material and film does well, is explores the human struggle toward trying to define the frameworks of code of ethics and morality, both within the perspective of the story's heroes and the villains with a minimal use of dialogue. I like how, each of the three main characters, has their own set of ideas of what that can be. Some of them, are very tired of the gruesome violent nature of humanity & struggles to find a moral center within it, to a point that they often abandon their authentic duties, due to being fearful. Others are not, like that; some function in a moral framework given to them by society, either by social norms, family or faith. However, the most chilling character in the film is the one driven by his own internal framework. His actions do not fall either, pragmatism or moral duty. That person operates outside of any sane understanding of morality and ethics, and continually raises conflicting philosophical questions to his victims often with a game of luck and chance with a coin toss. The only thing, he knows, is no matter, what people chose how to live life, death comes to us, all, either fast or slow. In his eyes, we all cattle, that one day, will be slaughter. We all, living pieces of meat. This is his mindset. No wonder, why his choice of weapon, the air powered bolt gun stronger symbolically his views. It's a powerful comparison. The actor, Bardem really did a good job, showing how unpredictable menacing such men can be, by his body language & facial expression, even if his character's haircut is a bit goofy. Glad, he still won Best Supporting Actor at that year's Oscars. As for the other performers, they were just as good, especially Tommy Lee Jones. The delivering of his character's dreams really does hold some emotional weight. It's here, we get hints what the title of the film taken from the opening line of 20th-century Irish poet William Butler Yeats' poem ""Sailing to Byzantium"", means, as he felt really defeated by the harsh ambiguity of this new time and mourns of the loss of the bygone era of decently, even if this ideal world might probably never even existed but has been an illusion, all along. While, this pessimistic somewhat preachy, yet violent ambiguous ending might turn off some viewer from rewatching this movie. I do have to say, the film is worth seeing, regardless. The cinematography alone is amazing. Some of the shots of the West Texas desert is beautiful to look at. Cinematographer, Roger Deakins did a hell of a job, setting up the camera & scenes. However, I wish, the movie had more of a score by composer, Carter Burwell to go with. For me, the minimized of the score leaving large sections devoid of music was a mixed bag. Some parts, the suffocating silence, kinda works like the gas station stop; in other moments, it undermined some of the gripping gory action sequences like the chase scene involving the Pitbulls. Nevertheless, overall heads or tails: the film still fire on nearly all cylinders. This is one motion picture worth checking out. It is a must watch."
"MonkyMangler","10","3","5","30 June 2018"," My Personal Favorite Movie by The Coen Brothers
","I heard about this movie when it was being advertised in 2007. I really wanted to see it but as i always do, i kinda put it off and i slowly forgot this film even existed. But recently i watched some of the other Coen Brother films such as The Big Lebowski (great movie), and Fargo (pretty good but not the best they've made), and i guess that alone sparked my interest to see this movie, and to this day i still hate myself for not seeing it when it came out. <br/><br/>No Country for Old Men is a ""Neo-Western"" film (meaning it takes place in a western setting, but differs from the usual western movie) that takes place in the early 80's. It all starts when a Hunter (played by Josh Brolin) stumbles across a drug deal gone wrong and takes 2 million dollars from which he recovered from the site. Soon after, a ruthless hitman is hired to retrieve the stolen money and kill the man who took it. <br/><br/>First of all, i gotta hand it to the Coen Brothers. They made such a spectacular looking movie with astounding visuals and camera work. Another thing that makes this movie special is that the soundtrack, is barely present. There's only one time in the entire movie where you can slightly hear it, and it's done in such a good way, almost as if it were creeping up on you. Goes to show you don't need music to build suspense nor do you need it during a thrilling action sequence. The performances were pretty amazing. Josh Brolin has a lot of time to show off his acting skills, Javier Bardem is absolutely terrific and he really carried this movie, and Tommy Lee Jones was a great supporting character and it was cool to hear his character's point of view on life. <br/><br/>While the action and acting is great, there's something deeper to this movie that i love even more. There are countless of questions the film puts out, but there are few answers. I believe this was a creative choice by the Coen Brothers whether it would be the philosophy of not everything as an explanation, or they wanted the audience to make their own portrait of it. The film also has a theme of justice and how it's not all that it seems. The main character of the film is killed off screen by the Mexican Mob without the classic showdown in a typical western. The Sheriff (played by Tommy Lee Jones) later visits the Murder site of Llewelyn Moss while Anton Chigurh is waiting for him. But he shows up and leaves, leaving the audience with no payoff or justice as to what happens to the main antagonist. The end of the film shows that Anton Chigurh kills Moss's woman, and soon after he is hit by a car and nearly killed. I find that pure poetry, Chigurh views himself as an unstoppable force of Fate. And fate has been given to him. He is injured, weak, and vulnerable. Chigurh and the Sheriff are now Old Men as the title claims, and there is No Country for Old Men. <br/><br/>This is easily my favorite film by the Coen Brothers and one of my all time favorites. 10/10 would watch again, and again, and again."

","Dont read my review. Just watch it. You know, some masterpieces you just gotta experience yourself. This is such a masterpiece...<br/><br/>The fact that you are reading this review is really a sign that you dont know who the Coen Brothers are. Because WHEN you would have known the Coen Brothers, you would have seen EVERYTHING they made already and you wouldnt be reading these reviews. The Coen Brothers didnt exclusively made classics, some of their farcical comedies are flops. But ALL of their drama/thrillers are definitely worth watching. This one though reaches movie heaven. ""No Country for Old Men"" has been awarded with multiple oscars and an abundance of other awards worldwide. This movie is truly a modern classic of the highest order, equalling the brilliance of their earlier work like ""Blood Simple"", and ""Barton Fink"".<br/><br/>The story in a nutshell: a hit man (Javier Bardem) goes on a killing spree in order to find a lost bag loaded with drug money, which was accidentally found by Josh Brolin, who plays a trailer trash redneck. The extremely suspenseful pursuit by the hit man is what the story is about. Tommy Lee Jones plays the sherrif who investigates the killing spree that comes along with this suspenseful pursuit of the money bag.<br/><br/>This is NOT a mindless funny action popcornmovie. Please stay away from it if you are only into mindless entertainment. Or do watch it and get pummeled by the psychotic mood that prevails in this classic. It killed any happy mood I had, after I had watched it for the first time. But it did so in a way that is brilliant. As brilliant as the Coen Brothers can be!<br/><br/>No one besides the Coen Brothers themselves have this extraordinory talent to make a scene interpretable in different ways. In many scenes it aint certain if one should laugh or cringe with fear. These twin director brothers have perfected a style in which they walk a tightrope between black humor and sheer psychotic suspense. Spooky note: actor Woody Harrelson's father (in real life) was a contract killer for a drugslord. Since this movie is all about contract killing, this biography fact is spooky and chilling since Woody Harrelson is pursuing a contract killer in this movie.<br/><br/>Everything and I mean really everything is perfected in this movie. From acting, to photography and editing. And the story and dialogues are just way of the charts, way outhere. Those dialogues in some scenes are without a doubt the most thought provoking and eery dialogues I have heard in a long time.<br/><br/>Seen it over 10 times and I am still in awe of it every time. I can still remember so vividly HOW I felt the very first time I saw it. Because I was left with a very UNcomfortable feeling afterwards. I felt lost and bleak inside. And those feelings got stuck inside me for hours after seeing it. Many questions lingered through my mind afterwards. I was disoriented and confused about what I had just seen. I honestly believe this is one of the best Coen Brother films ever made. And it is one of my most favorite movies amongst ALL movies ever made in my personal life up untill now..."
"Floated2","9","3","5","2 March 2018"," Suspenseful and Gripping
","No Country for Old Men has been widely praised by critics and considered one of the greater films of its release year as well as of the decade. This film may be classified as a perfectly realized modern day western thriller which combines moments of hard-edged violence, several sequences of suspense, frequent interjections of deliciously dry and laconic humor, and flashes of how not only the world has changed but the way our perspectives do as we get older.<br/><br/> Much of the suspense comes from the cjaracter of Javier Bardem, as he steals his scenes. Josh Brolin is one of his earlier star turning roles, delivers a masterful performance. With these performances, is the main reason as to why this film is as great, as well as the directing and overall visuals of the scenery. The violence stands out in the film as graphic and it works in its favor. Overall, No Country is a well made drama, though a film not for everyone."
"Joenovak32","10","3","5","9 February 2015"," Another great movie by two of my favorite directors
","The Coen brothers are excellent directors, they inspired me to get interested in film. Fargo is another great film by them, but this is probably their best film ever. The social commentary on the increased violence of crimes is a good one. Javier Bardem gives his best performance, Tommy Lee Jones was great as the sheriff, and Josh Brolin did really good in this movie too. The Coen brothers had fun random side characters like they always do. Their direction is great. The cinematography is great, and the violence is important to the story instead of just being violent for shock. All the awards they got are deserved. So mostly every thing about this movie is great, I would even say this is one of my favorite movies of all time. I am giving this a 10/10. I would recommend this to anyone who likes crime thrillers or good movies in general."
"moldo_bmf","6","3","5","1 January 2015"," Could have been great...
","One thing I have to admit is that I put off seeing this movie for far too long. I knew it was highly praised at most occasions where awards are handed out. I knew it was directed and adapted for the silver screen by the Coen brothers, for whom I have always had a great appreciation. I wanted to love this, and for the first hour and a half, I truly did. And then... something happened.<br/><br/>It all started with the abrupt death of Llewelyn, slightly foreshadowed and poorly executed. While I did expect his death to occur at some point in time, it came and went so haphazardly, it actually went below feeling like a cheap plot device. Carson's death had some weight to it, at least, and he's a secondary character! <br/><br/>Ambiguity works wonders for most of the Coen directed films, but here it only serves to frustrate anyone who even tries to make sense of what happens throughout the disjointed narrative. I've always loved the inherent randomness that comes with any movie directed by the Coen brothers, but in most other movies, it actually seems plausible and character motivations and actions seem grounded in some underlying logic that seems doomed to fail at one point.<br/><br/>But here, ambiguity skirts the boundary of interesting, and then veers off to the realm of an unintelligible mishmash. And what makes that sadder is that there's a genuinely tense buildup for one of the most interesting antagonists I've seen for a while. Chigurh emulates a deceivingly simple archetype for a psychopathic murderer. But underneath that lunatic polish lies a complex character with both a meticulous conduct for murder, as well as an almost religious regard for the duality of fate. <br/><br/>But even though Chigurh steals the show, he still feels like a dog without a leash sometimes, lacking any real purpose beyond his propensity for organised mayhem. While his motivation, in the form of retrieving the stolen money, is made relatively clear, whom or what he is working for is never really made apparent, and only serves to confuse, rather than entice.<br/><br/>Th last minutes of the film make even less sense, slapping on events that serve no real purpose beyond being narrative hokum. I understand that the theme might be more about Bell realising his principles regarding the world may be outdated, but that is neither emphasised, nor is it framed well. The book may carry with it certain concepts that don't need much explaining, but the movie needs to shoulder its own weight, and I believe that it has failed at that from a narrative point of view. <br/><br/>Perhaps I viewed the movie with escalated expectations, but I see no reason why that shouldn't be the case, as both the Coen brothers and Cormac McCarthy have delivered beforehand.<br/><br/>While ""No Country for Old Men"" isn't a bad movie, I do believe it could have been more than has been presented. I know I won't receive much praise for the bashing I have given the movie, given its considerable amount of fans, but although I tried to be part of that group, I can't bring myself to enjoy the movie as much as I would have wanted to.<br/><br/>I rated the film lower than movies that have a much lesser significance mostly because the rating was given in regard to other productions by the Coen brothers, which I feel possess more quality and depth than what I have witnessed in ""No Country for Old Men""."
"MovieGuy109","9","3","5","7 November 2011"," Very powerful Coen Bros. film
","No Country for Old Men is a powerful thriller filmed to perfection by Joel and Ethan Coen. The performances are searing but what really wins this film over is the Coens' inventive techniques in creating suspense, throwing in comic relief, and finally having a quirky but effective choreography of violence. It's a potent thriller full of great shots of the landscape and the suspense techniques intelligently use brutal violence and plenty of great camera work. Bardem gives his strongest performance of his career as the killer. The symbolism and cultural satire the Coens throw in is that of two filmmakers who know how to powerfully create both a violent and very humorous film in the same shot."

"radman_art","Null","3","5","19 July 2011"," This is one of my favorite movies
","To me this is more than just a movie; it is a statement of a time in America that shocked us all. This movie also takes place in my home state of Texas. Sometimes a movie transcends being a movie and becomes a historical icon. I love Texas and have always wanted to live here since first heard the word cowboy and I bought my first ZZ Top Album in the 1970's. There is a certain mysticism about Texas, the cowboy life and wide open spaces. Suddenly violence struck America over drugs. Suddenly this violence grew over night; it seemed. It even spilled over to the open plains of small town Texas. Drugs ushered in the lose of the all American innocents. The acting is absolutely perfect. Javier Bardem who was this guy? His performance was amazing. Josh Brolin: again I never heard of him till I saw this and he was so convincing as his character; I could picture no one else as good. Tommy Lee Jones and Woody Harrelson all I can say it is about time we have seem them shine as they should. This movie is not about violence it is about the end of our ignorance to how far people go in the name of money and greed.<br/><br/>Other movies by the Coen brother I love like my favorite Levis is: Burn After Reading, The Ladykillers, The Man Who Wasn't There, O Brother, Where Art Thou?, The Big Lebowski, Fargo. Come on Coen's you can do it, I am keeping my fingers crossed for you."
"Tom-But","10","3","5","7 April 2011"," So, what would you ""Call it?""
","I'm still not entirely settled on Fargo, even after the third viewing. O Brother Where Art Thou is still a little hazy for me, after the second. Even The Big Lebowski took four or so solid sessions to bring me around. There is no doubt about it: the Coen brothers, awesome as they are, don't exactly make the most accessible films. Sometimes, you just have to work at them.<br/><br/>No Country For Old Men took me one look to know that I loved it. The other six were just to love it all the more.<br/><br/>This is an undoubtedly brilliant film, complex and yet told with such tempered minimalism and restraint that you really have to immerse yourself in it. Every time I watch No Country I find a new layer of it to appreciate and contemplate, new complexities and quirks in the characters and their choices, new hidden nuggets of dialogue that I might have missed the first time.<br/><br/>Just this last time, I realized as Chigurh went into his motel room at the Del Rio that the reason he placed his hands on both sides of the bathroom wall was to measure its width, so as to determine if a bullet would pierce it in the ensuing firefight. I smiled, and a little chill ran down my spine. I felt as if I'd just had a small encounter with him and we'd exchanged some private understanding.<br/><br/>Small moments like this, and dialogue like ""Age'll flatten a man"" and ""It's not often that you see a Mexican in a suit"", and small moments like Moss's reaction to finding the satchel filled with $2 million: ""(sighs)...Yeah..."" These are just some of the reasons why I love this film.<br/><br/>The performances are uniformly brilliant, and I don't mind saying that, as chilling as Bardem is as Anton Chigurh, I find Tommy Lee Jones as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell to be the standout in No Country. No one can teach you to speak with that jilted, sporadic intonation that they have way down south, you have to know it and know it well to carry it as convincingly as he does. He brings character to simple throwaway lines such as, ""Somebody unloaded on that thing with a shaawt-gun!""<br/><br/>The allegorical sensibilities and underlying themes in No Country are infinite, ranging from fate vs. choice vs. randomness, to our ongoing battles with the nature of this world, a cruel and unforgiving place where we wear our mortality on our sleeves for all to see... <br/><br/>Unless you're Chigurh.<br/><br/>Maintaing Lee Jones as the stand-out performer, Chigurh is undoubtedly the most fascinating character. Is he human? Is he just some arrogant douche bag whose thus far been incredibly lucky? Is he Death? Did he kill Carla Jean?<br/><br/>The ending of No Country has been criticised somewhat for it's abruptness and intentional abstruseness. But every time I hear that final line (""And then I woke up."") and see that final exchange between Bell and his wife, and that final shot of Jones staring enigmatically of into space, the tumultuous country framed perfectly behind him in the widow, and then cut to black...<br/><br/>Shivers, man. Maaaaajor shivers!<br/><br/>P.S. If the ending to No Country p!ssed you off, DO NOT watch A Serious Man."

","Although based upon an original novel, I was surprised at the plot similarities of this Coen brothers work to their earlier 'Fargo'.<br/><br/>Both featured a nest-egg of money. Both featured a sullenly psychotic baddie. Both featured a hick law-enforcement officer out of depth with the viciousness of modern crime. And both featured small-town America and the human struggle against wilderness. In 'Fargo', winter snows set the backdrop; in this movie, it is the sweltering desert.<br/><br/>Another movie to draw an emphatic de-ja-vu is 'A Perfect Plan'. In that work, three friends stumble upon a case full of crime money in a small crashed plane. All on board are dead. It's winter, and Fargo-like snow blankets the world. But soon there's a ruthless criminal enforcer on the case.<br/><br/>In 'No Country For Old Men', a trailer-trash hick stumbles upon a desert drug-deal gone bad. Once again; everyone's dead. There's a pick-up loaded with dope and a case with $2million just ripe for picking. Actually there's one survivor, and this basically good-natured hick has a nocturnal crisis of conscience and goes back to help him. By then, others are on the case, and he is discovered and a marked man thereafter.<br/><br/>One of those in the hunt is a 'Terminator' type assassin. Unstoppable, almost indestructible, he has absolutely no mercy. And he has a very curious (and improbable) weapon. We've seen his kind a dozen times. Think of 'Collateral', think of 'Assassins', 'Death Wish', and many more.<br/><br/>Despite all of the familiar and formulaic stuff, the movie still makes very compelling entertainment. It is filmed in a washed-out print style reminiscent of French film-noir. The pacing is often very slow with sometimes meticulous attention to small, seemingly insignificant detail. But that only compounds the interest as it leaves the viewer constantly second-guessing their relevance to the plot, causing surprises and unexpected twists.<br/><br/>The titular 'old men' are of the Sheriff's generation. He is convincingly played by Tommy Lee Jones. Jones provides both a voice-over narrative and also plot-infil as his experience and deduction cement any stray plot threads together and offer some topical commentary. As a presence in the movie, he is more of a cameo than a star. And perhaps in this regard the movie should be viewed as an entity in itself - as indeed all movies should be; it's just not usually possible to do this with over-paid and over-hyped stars invariably hijacking them as a vehicle for their own egos.<br/><br/>The Coen brothers have seen to it that this hasn't happened. This movie is a complete work. It is fascinating from start to finish, with lots of interesting camera work, location choices, shocking drama, a good script and solid performances from the players.<br/><br/>It takes great skill to produce work like this. I am not surprised that it won 4 academy awards. The Coens have produced one or two bummers, but when they do it right, they do it very well indeed.<br/><br/>Highly Recommended.

"iam-michael-p","9","3","5","5 May 2010"," Chigurh: A Simple Representation of Situational Violence in Film
","In Joel and Ethan Coen's No Country for Old Men, the character Anton Chigurh explores the concept of unadulterated violence in an environment that is neither the old west, nor modern times. Chigurh is part of a larger argument, that incorporates the films three main characters. Each character represents a different thematic element, such as Chigurh's representation of evil, because of his tendency to execute merciless killings. Sheriff Bell takes on the dual role of unwitting prophet via his narration, and actively participates in the investigation of the drug deal gone wrong that sets of the chain of events that creates No Country for Old Men. The third main character, Llewelyn Moss, stays true to his introduction, and never fully realizes the potential the rewards he sought had to harm him. Chigurh though, truly represents Joel and Ethan Coen's goal of creating a simple, yet realistic representation of situational violence and its implications.<br/><br/>""The crime you see now, it's hard to even take its measure,"" Bell intones as desert scenery gives way to a shot of a man being led into a cop car, ""It's not that I'm afraid of it. I always knew you had to be willing to die to even do this job. But, I don't want to push my chips forward and go out and meet something I don't understand. A man would have to put his soul at hazard. He'd have to say, 'Okay, I'll be part of this world.'"" This line, along with a shot of Chigurh being led into a cop car serves as the character Chigurh's introduction into the world of No Country for Old Men. It takes the Coen's only moments to make good on Bell's observation of crime that's, ""hard to even take its measure,"" (Coen).<br/><br/>This is merely the beginning of what can only be described as Chigurh's wholesale assault on No Country for Old Men's other characters. As Bell steps out of the role of narrator and into the role of character, Anton Chigurh is in custody, in a police station. This does not stop him from manifesting both resourcefulness and sociopathic tendencies, when he uses his handcuff's to brutally strangle his arresting officer. The manner in which this scene is filmed lends much to the Coen's creation of Chigurh as a character.<br/><br/>As Chigurh slowly kills his victim, the shot is switched to an overhead view, which shows both men's faces while they are locked in a battle to the death. Chigurh's face wears an empty, twisted smile, while his victim stares into the camera displaying a look of shear terror. During this overhead shot, and for the whole murder sequence, there are no sound effects or music played. A highly unusual move for any movie made after the invention of sound on tape, the absence of music is an element repeated throughout No Country for Old Men. By showcasing Chigurh's brutality simply and explicitly, the Coen's establish a character who serves only his own purposes, regardless of morality.<br/><br/>The third main character is introduced in the next scene in a similar manner to the other two, that is being shown in a way that establishes both his character and the path that he will tread through the rest of the narrative. Llewelyn Moss is shown sitting on a bluff somewhere in the desert, dialing in the scope of his rifle. He lines up his shot on the heart of a distant animal and then fires. The shot hits its mark, but does not kill the beast. Moss ejects the spent round from his rifle, carefully picks up the shell and proceeds into the valley to pursue the injured animal. Upon arriving at the location the animal had been shot, Moss finds two different trails of blood, one following the animals path and the other leading out into the dessert. He follows the trail and finds a drug deal gone wrong. Moss investigates the scene and finds a satchel full of money, which begins the game of cat and mouse between him and the man tasked with retrieving the money, Chigurh.<br/><br/>The man responsible for these shots, Roger Deakins, is quoted himself as saying that, ""There's nothing worse than an ostentatious shot, or some lighting that draws attention to itself, and you might go, 'Oh, wow, that's spectacular.' Or that spectacular shot, a big crane move or something. But it's not necessarily right for the film – you jump out, you think about the surface, and you don't stay in there with the characters and the story"" (Siegel and Block). The violence portrayed in the film, then becomes something that is there to establish who the character is and what they are willing to do.<br/><br/>No Country for Old Men provides an unrelenting vision of what men are capable of inflicting upon each other. The Coen's have created an important film, that presents moral arguments that work on several levels. Representing the three concepts that drive No Country for Old Men, the three main characters of Chigurh, Bell and Moss reflect a disturbing mix of absent morality, clinging to the past and not preparing for the future. Chigurh, is the representative with absent morality, or at least operates on a twisted version of what he sees as morality. Moss would be the hero, if in the end he did not fail to escape the consequences of his violence. Finally Sheriff Bell, embodies the concept of fate, both because he endures the chaos of Chigurh and because of his narratological omnipresence. Through the use of cinematography that mimics the style and layout that is found in photography, No Country for Old Men is a cinematographic wonder, in which, what occurs visually is representative of what is occurring within the story. Through a simple portrayal of violence, No Country for Old Men sets a precedent for providing a simple, yet realistic representation of situational violence and its implications."

And this, No Country For Old Men.<br/><br/>No Country For Old Men is the tale of a drug deal gone wrong and the violence that follows. The film follows three characters, Llewlynn Moss (Josh Broline) who is the hunter that finds the drug money and the bodies, Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) who is one of many bounty hunters hired to retrieve the money and Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) who tries to find Moss before Chigurh does. The film is very violent but is a fantastic, character and action driven film by Joel and Ethan Cohen. The film is based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy.<br/><br/>The film is a modern western. It features amazing performances by the three main actors, especially Javier Bardem (who is the best part of the film). Javier Bardem's sociopath Anton Chigurh is most definitely one of the most chilling characters to ever enter the crime genre, he is better than Hannibal Lecter.<br/><br/>No Country For Old Men is basically a tale of cause and effect. The actions of the Moss character set off a chain reaction of violence. The film has cliffhanger ending which might disappoint most viewers, but it didn't bother me. The ending (which I will not spoil) has a meaning which I have yet to find. The whole film includes multiple situations of symbolism. <br/><br/>All and all, No Country For Old Men is one of the best films to come out of the year 2007.

","No Country for Old Men is a terrifying insight into how the freedom to bounce around the USA, like a bad penny, can leave trails of destruction unimaginable to even the sturdiest of law enforcers.<br/><br/>The Cohen brothers use the wild and endless landscapes of America's south as the canvas for the calmest imaginable psychotic, Shagor, (Javier Bardem), the ageing and tired Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) and country boy Llewelyn Moss' money triangle.<br/><br/>The trail begins and grows after Moss finds and runs away with two million in cash. Shagor is employed to track it down and Bell is chasing all concerned after cleaning up the finale of a drug deal gone bad. Bell realises that Moss needs protecting from his own greed as Shagor is a man familiar with taking the freedom to roam as synonymous with the freedom to kill.<br/><br/>The film is a work of art: silence and tension fill the gaps between the noise and death. It is also a metaphor for the reality of western freedom. A storm is brewing; money and freedom are its heart and men are the ones stirring up the wind and rain."
"zardoz-13","10","3","5","23 July 2009"," Memorable, Chilling Crime Melodrama in the Modern Day Southwest.
","""O' Brother, Where Art Thou"" co-directors Joel and Ethan Coen have created another classic melodrama with their quasi-western, road trip crime epic ""No Country for Old Men"" about an inexorable killer and his quest to recover millions in illicit drug money. This art-house saga is a simple, but powerful tale that involves four primary characters and a host of supporting characters. Ostensibly, the narrator, Sheriff Ed Tom Bell, spends most of his time dwelling on the psychology of the characters as well as the changing times. ""No Country for Old Men"" isn't your ordinary shoot'em up with cut and dried heroes and villains. The Coens have adapted the Cormac McCarthy novel and retained its pervasive sense of irony. Indeed, the moral universe of ""No Country"" is skewered because the villain survives, the protagonist dies, and the sheriff is so scared that he quits his job. Paid killer Anton Chigurh embodies the essence of pure evil. Despite the fact that he is a flesh & blood character, Chigurh could send shivers up the Terminator's spine because he never gives up. Although the Coens may not realize it, Chigurh resembles another inexorable killer, the Lee Van Cleef gunman called 'Angel Eyes' in director Sergio Leone's ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly."" Like 'Angel Eyes,' Chigurh always finishes the job no matter what the consequences.<br/><br/>The action opens with a sheriff's deputy arresting Chigurh (Javier Bardem of ""Collateral"") and taking him in hand cuffs back to the jail. The unsuspecting deputy leaves the cuffed Chigurh sitting in a chair behind him while he calls up the sheriff and talks about the unusual weapon that Chigurh uses to kill people. At the end of the conversation with the sheriff, the deputy promises his boss that ""he has everything under control."" Meanwhile, behind him, Chigurh has slid his cuffed wrists up under his thighs so that he can hold his hands in front of himself. Immediately, he attacks the deputy and they leave many boot heel scuff marks on the floor while they struggle. Chigurh kills the deputy, confiscates a police cruiser, takes his peculiar weapon that consists of a slim canister, a hose, and a firing mechanism and pulls over a motorist, kills him with this odd weapon and steals his car. Later, at a Texaco gas station, Chigurh takes umbrage when the attendant asks him about the weather. This is quite a chilling scene as Chigurh stares at the attendant with his opaque eyes and forces him to play a game that involves flipping a coin. The attendant–like many characters–isn't the brightest bulb in the factory and he can never get Chigurh to spell out the stakes riding on the coin flip.<br/><br/>The ostensible protagonist, Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin of ""American Gangster""), is hunting deer antelope in the desert and wounds one. He sets out to track down the wounded animal and comes across a scene straight out of Hell, a circle of trucks in the middle of nowhere and bullet-riddled bodies strewn about them with a dead dog. Earlier, Moss saw a wounded pit bull limping in the high weeds. He finds one Mexican still alive but bleeding to death. Eventually, Moss figures out that one Mexican got away and he follows him to a ridge clad with two trees and finds the man dead with a satchel and a shiny automatic pistol. When Moss returns home to his trailer, his wife Carla Jean (Kelly MacDonald of ""Trainspotting"") watching television. She inquires about the pistol but Moss brushes off all questions and threatens to take her to bed and have sex with her. She snorts derisively and quips, ""That'll be the day."" Later that night, Moss decides to return to the scene of the shooting because his conscience has gotten to him about the sole survivor that he found. No sooner has he set foot on the scene that some Mexicans wheel up in a truck, slash his tires, pursue him and take shots at him. Moss dives into a river and the Mexicans dispatch a tenacious pit bull dog that leaps into the river and swims after him. Moss barely gets out of the river and clears his pistol before the dog lunges at him and he guns it down. You don't often see dogs die in modern-day movies.<br/><br/>Chigurh arrives on the scene with two other men later on, studies the site, shoots them and sets out to find the stolen money. ""No Country"" depicts his pursuit of Moss. These two guys are pretty obstinate characters. Neither one of them gives up, but Moss has no idea about the lengths to which Chigurh is committed to go. Moss sends Carla Jean off to Odessa, Texas, to be with her mother while he heads off in a different direction. At the same time, Sheriff Ed Tom and his deputy investigate the killings and Ed Tom is clearly shaken by what he sees of this killer. In a border town, Moss and Chigurh shoot it out in the street after Chigurh storms the hotel where Moss had holed up and kills the night clerk. He wounds Moss, but Moss wounds him, too. Chigurh stages a car fire in front of a pharmacy to get the medical supplies to tend to his wounds, while Moss walks across the border at night and winds up in a Mexican hospital where he recuperates.<br/><br/>""No Country for Old Men"" is a chilling tale of crime in the southwest about a killer who will stop at nothing to complete his mission. Nevertheless, this isn't an action shoot'em up clever dialogue. Nothing goes as it should in a regular crime melodrama. Good loses in the long run and evil wins out in the end. This movie justifiably received four Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Bardem netted the Best Supporting Oscar for his killer."

","No Country for old men a Coen brother film that in many ways is a hands down classic, and a fantastic peace of cinema. a film that has everything any film would need, brilliant acting especially from Javiar Bardem his character was truly a chilling person, Tommy lee Jones as usual really brought his character to life as a near retired sheriff who could only look on at the madness that was unravelling in front of his eyes and knowing he could do nothing about it. Josh Brolin was wonderful in this film. i could feel the changes his character went threw as he was over come by greed to keep the money.<br/><br/>Overall i believe this film is truly masterful and one to watch before you die. it is worthy of all the awards it has won."

","There is literally nothing in this film that could have been done better, and it is a rare film that possesses that quality. This is film making at its best, people who are bothered by the open ending need to get an imagination, fill in the blanks. The acting is top notch and every shot and colour used in the picture was carefully thought out. No Country features one of the best serial killers ever, and is a true thriller flick. The Josh Brolin character is very authentic and Tommy Lee Jones is very subtle in his role, but still commands a certain power. This truly is a great film and I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a great movie experience."

","I have been around scary people for much of my life and have scared a hell of a lot of people whom I think deserved to be frightened. I spent two years in Vietnam, worked in prisons, with alcoholics and addicts and mentally ill street people who occasionally, unmedicated, can get pretty worrisome. I've found myself on the wrong end of too many guns. A white guy, I've lived in ghettos. I've been around more than my share of heavily armed and angry drunks. I've been attacked with murderous intent in foreign countries and while riding a motorcycle on U.S. rural roads, a la Easy Rider.<br/><br/>Despite this, I can only think of a few instances in my life when I have been truly afraid, such as when I've fought a raging forest fire with middling chances of escape, and being in the middle of an ocean in a hurricane on a small ship.<br/><br/>I'm not someone who is easily able to suspend disbelief. I have found few science fiction movies of any interest, save for comedies such as ""Mars Attacks."" None have been fear provoking.<br/><br/>But sitting there with my wife in a darkened theater, I found Javier Bardem's portrayal of Anton to be truly a frightening and believable character. From his first encounter with a storekeeper, he was completely convincing. When he had the upper hand over a competitor assassin and he was described by the latter as ""a psychopath,"" I thought, ""Well, that sure fits."" <br/><br/>The only thing I couldn't understand was the failure of a character (trying to avoid a spoiler here) to dare the coin toss. People cling so tightly to life, it seemed difficult to believe.<br/><br/>What a great movie. What great actors and directors."

","I don't understand the negative reviews ""No Country for old men"" has received! Its absolutely riveting, with amazing performances all-round. The script is predictably good. (It is the Coen's, after all!) The cinematography is bleak and suits the sparse plot-line but the sound, Oh God, the sound!!! With absolutely zero soundtrack, the sound is easily the best thing of ""No country for old men"". I could close my eyes and just listen to the story unfold through the sound-effects. Everything is crisp and heightened, the wind on the plains in the beginning, the guns being cocked and the air-rifle providing the films' most intense moments. Javier Bardem carries the film with easily the scariest villain on screen since Peter Lorre in ""M"". He simply oozes menace and one is left feeling slightly unsettled by the fact that you simply cannot help being drawn in by him. I cannot stress enough how GOOD this film is. If you haven't seen it yet, you simply have to!"

If you liked ""There Will Be Blood"" or ""The Godfather"", you will enjoy this movie too. Well, it's full of violence, but not foundation less. It's like a jigsaw.

The other stars were somewhat unknown to me.<br/><br/>If you can't handle blood, don't watch. If you can (surprisingly, I found out I could - I am female), you are in for a very entertaining movie. I understand why it won 4 Oscars (I think I am right about that). My husband and I laughed several times in the movie (watch for the receptionist - she is a hoot). That was very unexpected.

The photography of the west is stunning as is the acting. You see what the west symbolizes is a time when law and order existed along wit justice. But as characters like Sheriff Bell realize that time is over. Javier Bardem is simply chilling as the psychopathic killer Anton Chigurh.

"supramaxx","10","3","5","3 July 2008"," No Country for Old Men, Exceptional.....
","No Country For Old Men Review<br/><br/>I have to admit I knew absolutely nothing about this film before watching it, never saw a trailer, or nothing. All I knew is that many people were saying it should be the film of the year and IMDb's 8.6 Rating. Much like ""There Will be Blood"" I came into the theater with a clean slate not knowing at all what to expect and what the movie was about. When the movie ended all I could do is sit with my mouth agape as a million thoughts and questions ran through my mind. This is an epic movie, a movie which makes you think philosophically and moralistically , makes you appreciate characters, makes you appreciate the art depicted so masterfully in not only the acting, but the cinematography and even lack of musical score and a movie that you will never figure out with just one sitting, its a movie worth watching over and over again. A modern classic.<br/><br/>Genre: Action/Drama<br/><br/>The Good: There are so many things that are not good, but utterly EXCEPTIONAL in this movie. From the acting, which is exceptional by everyone in this movie to, well everything else. Josh Brolin is excellent as the conflicted resourceful protagonist Llewlyn Moss, Tommy Lee Jones as the nostalgic reflective observer sheriff Ed Tom Bell and one of the most haunting performance by Javier Bardem as the destructive personification of death with an airgun, Anton ""Sugar"" Chigurh. Anton is truly chilling in all his scenes, with a memorable and unique demeanor and appearance as well as philosophy in life. Everyone else in their supporting cast is excellent as well. The cinematography is awesome as well. The lonely Rio Grande Desert landscapes are hauntingly amazing, especially with lack of musical score. The violent scenes and lack thereof also give a unique approach to this movie. The setting of Texas, 1980 is also done perfectly. The unconventional ending is also that was welcomed for me, although to many people it was disappointing, I found it extremely refreshing. The reflective monologues used by the Sheriff to reflect on changing times is also something that for me was almost Shakespearian in nature. Also the questions the movie will leave you asking enhances its overall quality.<br/><br/>The Bad: Nothing, I got confused a few times on some of the roles of the minor characters, but this is a movie I will watch over and over again. Many will be disappointed with the unconventional ending, I loved it. Many will also not like a movie that makes you ask so many questions, to me that enhances the replay value infinitely. Many will also not like at the exclusion of some key and violent scenes, ala ""Reservoir Dogs"". But to me it makes this film as unique and as refreshing as possible.<br/><br/>The Ugly: Antons overall destructiveness, but being zapped by his powerful airgun through your neck is a terrifying scene in the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, one of the best films I have ever seen. To me this film is more entertaining and as deep as ""There Will be Blood"". The acting is also comparable, To me they are about equal, as well as cinematography. The one thing that makes this better than ""There Will Be Blood"" is the entertainment factor. This film is more entertaining in various aspects. A movie that will definitely be in my collection and should be in your too.<br/><br/>Supra Score - 9.7/10"
"TommyDeWito","9","3","5","3 July 2008"," Predestinaion
","I think this movie is about predestination and free will , Chigurgh doesn't believe in free will ,"" I got here the same way the coin did"" , he is almost like a robot , and scientifically he is totally right we don't have free will , Chigurgh is not guilty , he just has killer genes and his mother didn't hug him so that's why he turned out to be this way , there are no choices in matter , just cause and effect , only quantum psychics can show some difference(i think Coens are into these kind of things , the man who wasn't there is about quantum psychics) but it can only prove that we are randomly acting machines and not deterministic ones. Anyway i believe in soul so i think Chigurgh is a disgusting monster but i have to give him some credit. The reason this movie is so wonderful that it makes you think about these staff , i don't think i even figured out the exact meaning of sheriff's second dream and the car crash, it's one of the few movies that did this to me."

","This film from Ethan and Joel coen is their masterpiece (In my opinion). NCFOM is a breakaway from their usual quirky style and really gives you something to serious to watch and think about. All cast members give incredible performances especially Javier Bardem as the haunting Anton Chigurh. The film provides good action and incredible suspense, but also keeps you gripped in the non action scenes. There is also a lot of symbolism and running themes throughout the movie, and they leave an incredible impression. The movie illustrates the changing state of the world. That is really the main theme and it is excellently expressed. The cinematography in this film is also incredible. Although it is just the barren west, it is portrayed with incredible light and shadow. This film is a true winner and will keep you thinking about it long after you finish."

","When I saw ""No Country for Old Men"" I was very surprised to hear Comanche County mentioned; the beginning dialogue stated that a certain Comanche County sheriff never wore a gun; his name was given as ""Gaston Borkins."" I believe that would have really been Gaston Boykin, who was Comanche County sheriff two different times in two different decades; his wife was a distant cousin of mine on my dad's side. I grew up in Comanche, Texas, and have traveled many times by car or train through extremely desolate parts of West Texas; in the movie, many of the scenes looked very familiar; on the other hand, there are undoubtedly many parts of West Texas that are relatively unexplored and would prove to be a safe haven for the likes of Anton.<br/><br/><ul><li>Cheryl Braziel Montoya</li></ul>"
"famous_players","10","3","5","10 June 2008"," One Of Year's Best
","Words could not describe how I felt when I left the theater after watching this masterpiece. The Coen brothers prove again their excellence in the art of film-making with No Country For Old Men, starring Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bordem & Josh Brolin. The more I think about it, the more I realize how flawless this movie is.<br/><br/>Javier Bordem, along with the other actors, play magnificent parts. Bordem plays one of the most realistic sociopath characters I have ever seen, and for that matter acts as good as I have ever seen. For anyone to believe There Will Be Blood had a better villain they are far mistaken. Bordem does not show near any emotion whatsoever, his lines are very clever, and proves his one-track mind will stop at nothing. ""You need to call it. I cannot call it for you. That would be unfair."" For some to believe it a slasher film, or one you must watch more than once to fully understand is untrue. There is definitely violence, and plenty of it in a rather Coens-esq fashion, but the story is positively excellent and the plot speeds up rather normally for a great conclusion.<br/><br/>I tell anybody, preferably 14+, to check out this movie at least once. I went into it with just seeing the trailer once,no expectations, and I was blown away. A great, classic film, for sure to be watched by all."

","I watched this film 3 times back to back to back on a long flight and absolutely loved it.

Go into it expecting something more along the lines of Seven or Silence of the Lambs.<br/><br/>This film will leave a lot of questions in your mind and it won't spoon feed you the answers. You are expected to think and come up with some of your own conclusions. And you won't necessarily be happy with them (again I think this rubbed people wrong).<br/><br/>Overall though, this is just a great suspense-thriller with some of the best dialog I've heard in years. Anton Chigurh is easily a top 5 on screen villain.<br/><br/>It will keep you thinking with you for days if you let it."

","I really enjoyed this movie. Very suspenseful. You're pulling for the Vietnam vet to outsmart the heartless assassin and there are all kinds of twists and turns and whatnot. I did not find this film boring at all.<br/><br/>You need to pay attention during this movie or it might not make sense. It might be best to watch it a couple times. I liked it the first time, but on second viewing I noticed things that I'd missed before. And I definitely think this is a good movie for repeated viewings, as long as you liked it. Engrossing suspense.<br/><br/>As to the ending, it's controversial. I won't give it away, but some people like it and some people hate it. I guess what you might want to think of is that Tommy Lee Jones's sheriff character (the ""old man"" in the title) is really the main character. The point of the story is how the world is changing, as seen by an old Texan sheriff. Everything else happens around that.<br/><br/>I haven't read Cormac McCarthy's book, but this film is supposed to be very faithful to it, ending and all.<br/><br/>The story also seems to deal with some fairly deep philosophical ideas, which I am not prepared to delve into. You can find out more about that stuff in the discussion topics.<br/><br/>I'm not a film scholar, but I had no problems with this one, acting, writing, directing, or otherwise. There IS violence, and that didn't bother me. If you don't like violence, this might not be for you. Definitely not for children, and that's why it's rated R.<br/><br/>Despite the violence and the blood, this isn't an ""action"" movie. But this film commands your attention and has you on the edge of your seat. Even when you know how it all ends, it's still fun to go along for the ride all over again.<br/><br/>I could watch this film again and again and again."
"editor-131","9","3","5","23 April 2008"," Josh Brolin overlooked; also the sly echo of the ending of ""Raising Arizona""
","""No time for sheriffs"" in world done gone to hell. Chalk up another one for the Coen brothers, in the vein of their great crime dramas ""Miller's Crossing"" and ""Fargo."" Taking nothing away from the latter, ""No Country for Old Men"" is also a masterpiece, but of a different sort. Based not on real events, like ""Fargo,"" butcloselyon a novel by Cormac McCarthy, ""No Country"" lacks the other film's undercurrent of grim, black humor. Like last year's allegorical Western ""Seraphim Falls,"" this film is structured as an almost breathless chase, a cat-and-mouse in which men of seemingly supernatural resourcefulness track and evade each other over the spoils of a drug deal gone bad.<br/><br/>Esquire magazine among others cites Javier Bardem's performance as creepily implacable killer Anton Chigurh as Oscar-worthy, but it seems to us it is the character that is so prepossessing, not that its portrayal is so stupendous. More demanding, it seems to us, is the role of his quarry, Llewelyn Moss, played by a perhaps under-appreciated Josh Brolin. Woody Harrelson provides a sliver of quasi comic relief, with his overconfident swagger. Kelly MacDonald surprises in her skilled, convincing ""Texas trailer trash"" (Carla Jean Moss) after notable stints as Peter Pan in ""Finding Neverland"" and as Evangeline in ""Nanny McPhee."" But it is Tommy Lee Jones' Sheriff Ed Tom Bell who provides the moral and narrative axis or at least center of the film. The weariness in his old lined face and the woeful humor in his voice offer a near-complete character study, and the dreams he relates before the sudden soundtrack-less appearance of the closing credits are perhaps less meaningful in their content than as the film's final framinga bookend paired with his opening soliloquy about the seeming incomprehensibility of modern brutal criminality, the worst in human nature having taken some kind of quantum leap to much worse still.<br/><br/>Cinematically, Jones' visage seems organically part of the bleak, parched Texas landscapebut so do the mortality, blood, maimings that we see on the screen. There's nothing here like ""Fargo's"" garishly unreal, burgundy-colored blood spattering the pristine snow as Steve Buscemi is disposed of via wood-chipper. Bardem's character seems to represent, not a sinister force of nature, or the cosmos, in his bizarre sense of the fatalistic source of his actions, so much as a force of evilwhere a corrupting, dominating malevolence has contorted the very landscape into grotesque barrenness (like in C.S. Lewis' Space Trilogy). In this world, he's a pestilence quite other than the chthonic (and thus still inherently Gaian, or Manichaean) evil represented by the motorcycle dude and the Snoats brothers in the Coen brothers' ""cult"" classic, ""Raising Arizona."" (Likewise, Jones' recounting of his dreams in ""No Country"" echoes the Nick Cage's final speech as the hapless H.I. McDunnough in ""Arizona""though kind of inversely: i.e., instead of ""Maybe it was Utah ..."" ... ""Maybe it was Shëol ..."")

"gftbiloxi","8","3","5","19 April 2008"," Violence, Emptiness, and Flashes of Dark Humor
","The Cormac McCarthy novel NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is an ideal vehicle for the Coen brothers, who have used violence and emptiness laced with dark humor as an artistic aesthetic since the beginning of their careers--and although the setting and story are quite different it is very, very like FARGO in mood, style, and themes.<br/><br/>The story concerns Texan Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), who stumbles across the aftermath of a drug deal gone bad, takes the money, and runs. He is pursued by hit man Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem); both are pursued by sheriff Tom Ed Bell (Tommy Lee Jones.) Curiously, the film never allows any of the three men to meet; it instead follows their various paths toward and away from each other, paths that cross, diverge, and at times seem quite random.<br/><br/>Although the characters drive the story in the sense that they make the decisions they do because of who they are, the overall impression of the film is one of an initially calculated violence that becomes increasingly random as it progresses. There is no ultimate reason or deep meaning; just an open-ended emptiness of non-resolution and futility.<br/><br/>The cast is quite good, with Brolin, Bardem, and Jones perfectly cast and extremely believable in their roles; Kelly MacDonald, who plays the role of Llewelyn's wife, is particularly fine. The production values are also memorable. But like most Coen films, NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN seems to skate on the surface of its story rather than offer it to us in depth--the idea, one presumes, to allow us to impose our own ideas upon its very carefully crafted blankness. In this instance it works more often than not, but it is extremely noticeable when it doesn't, and the film often reads as self-consciously quirky as a result.<br/><br/>The DVD contains three backstory documentaries including a ""making of"" piece; in truth, however, all three are of a piece. Recommended, but not to all tastes.<br/><br/>GFT, Amazon Reviewer"

","This movie was amazing. It definitely deserves the Oscar for best picture. I'm going to give you a few reasons why this movie is so amazing. The reason why they killed off the lead was to show that know one, not even the lead character in a movie, is invincible. The reason why the bad guy lived was to show how good at killing people he really was. If he was killed by a hillbilly with a shotgun then he must not be very good at his job. I love how at the end you don't actually know if he killed the wife, it just shows him walking out the door. On a side note, the main reason why this movie won best picture was because of the performance by Javier Bardem. He is EPIC in this movie."
"RaiderJack","8","3","5","13 March 2008"," Simply Chilling
","The latest outing by the Coen Brothers is a chilling mix of horror, film noir, thriller, western, and yes even comedy, (Tommy Lee is always a stitch) but still remaining true to the twisted vision of the very entertaining work of these rather unorthodox artists.<br/><br/>No Country For Old Men is somewhat reminiscent of Blood Simple, their first outing, but infinitely more bloody. When I first viewed it in the theater, quite frankly I was NOT well for the ending. Absolutely no loose ends were tied up. A subsequent viewing helped me realize it was for the best. Each viewer will have to decide exactly how it ended and from what I understand the movie ending was not like the novel ending.<br/><br/>When the interpretation of a work is totally up to the viewer, that, of course, always makes for a more compelling artistic presentation simply because the art does not do your thinking for you: this one is no different.<br/><br/>Hands down, the most chilling aspect of this was the performance of Javier Bardem and his Oscar was indeed well-deserved. He was so calm he was very, very frightening. You did not (or more aptly, COULD not) invest anything into him emotionally. This was indeed deliberate. There was no need to, actually to adequately present the story. Even Llewellen (Josh Brolin's character) you felt something for, and Tommy Lee Jones, who, regardless of the character, ALWAYS manages to make you care about him, was probably the most fleshed-out character.<br/><br/>Actually the movie was not as slow as one is led to believe...it is most deliberate and since the Brothers get right to the point at the very beginning, you are indeed intensely involved with how this will play itself out.<br/><br/>If you are a Coen Brothers fan, you will certainly appreciate it.

For instance the scene where the villain cleans his wound (echoed in the end when he buys the boy's shirt, which in turn echoes Brolin buying the border guy's shirt). how many times have i watched a movie where a character is badly hurt, but then seemingly fixed in the next scene when some unstated amount of time has passed? instead of skipping that detail the bros. focus in on it uncomfortably close.<br/><br/>so this film is a meditation on the mundane nature of violence in the west (and the western genre). the characters fade in and out in an almost haphazard manner, the plot meanders in no particular direction, over the border, back again, characters entering as if important only to be cut short quickly (notably Harrelson) by death, the money becomes meaningless by the end and all that matters is killing and more killing. the bros decide as randomly as the flip of a coin whether to show a murder in close up, lingering on the bloody gurgling throat of a meaningless character in an office, or having major characters die off screen.<br/><br/>there really are no major characters in this film, just people waiting to die, and death himself. the film is a series of red herrings, and Brolin's death 3/4's in also evokes psycho. the scene with the two lawmen talking later that night even recalls the doctor explanation scene at the end of psycho, as does an earlier scene where the two cops discuss a murderous couple in California.<br/><br/>the bros. viciously play with audience expectations and desire. when Brolin threatens from the hospital that he's decided to make the villain a special project of his i felt satisfaction the same way i would watching the Bourne identity or superman, the hope of watching good triumph over evil in some way. but the fruition of this sort of resolution is stymied again and again. Brolin is killed before he ever comes face to face with the villain, and even the car accident which seems like it may bring some cosmic justice fails to do so, the villain just walks away. finally the honorable sheriff cannot do the deed, instead he retires.<br/><br/>no wonder many people on here seemed to hate this film, it's challenging and very mean to the audience. Fargo was much kinder with it's local charm. this is a finer film however, and will likely go down has one of the greatest American films ever."

He's come a long way, baby, and does a bang up job here just by living to the end of the story!

I kinda understand the meaning behind the title in comparison, but Tommy Lee is getting kinda up there, and he's been out in the sun way too long, he looks like a raisin, no offense, Tommy.

"kausix777","10","3","5","6 March 2008"," Interesting
","I did not want to give it 10. I wanted to give it 9.5 because of the loose ends (not explained, I mean) and the sudden end.<br/><br/>But that may well be the beauty of it. I am going to remember that scene where Chigurh checks his boots. <br/><br/>This film is obviously open to interpretations but a nice story, nonetheless. What starts as a 'what will happen' suspense leads to some 'what will happen' philosophy and all characters put in their best. <br/><br/>I had to read a few other comments here to actually understand the movie - the accent was so hard. But that is the setting of the movie - so I cannot complain.<br/><br/>The whole film is somehow based around this psychological case study called Anton Chigurh. His character has been so well brought out in the movie that Bardem HAD TO perform well to survive in this role. He did a good job but I am not sure if he deserved so many awards and the Oscar for this one role. This is more a movie than a one-man story.<br/><br/>Some people are angry about this movie getting a better deal than 'There will be Blood' at the academy. I liked TWBB for its performances but I am with the academy on this. I watched TWBB before this and I feel this is the kind of movie that would make one reduce the rating for TWBB. Basically, both the movies are good and will appeal to a wide set of, often common, audiences. Then on, it becomes a matter of personal choice. My vote still goes to NCFOM which I think is a supreme movie.<br/><br/>I'll NEED to watch this again."

The Texas style way too speak, the dessert apply perfectly in the scenario giving the extra thrill. It just takes you away, from start too finish. Not much film can do this, this one can. Every Oscar he got, is deserving therefor. Directly considered a all time top 50 film.

","For the ones that didn't like the ending, you either didn't understood it or you are just plain stupid. People expect a Hollywood, narrowed-minded, classical ending, and the Coen brothers are excellent filmmakers, so they are not going to go that direction. They only used the plot to express their idea (and Cormac McCarthy's) This is no country for old men anymore people! Violence and the thirst for money is destroying our world, and this is represented by Anton Chigurh (Javier Brdem creates the most memorable character of 2007). I'm not going to tell or explain the ending. I'm not saying I got it the first time. I had to watch it twice, but let me tell you...it is worth the effort. Just listen carefully to the character played beautifully by Tommy Lee Jones. That's the key to unlock the powerful meaning of this picture."

","With it's lavish cinematography (Roger Deakins), the sheriffs (Tommy Lee Jones) rambling hick rationalism's and Carter Burwell's eerie music setting, this movie lures you into a desolate, desperate and dangerous world. In fact, no country for old men. In this respect the movie faithfully delivers.<br/><br/>However, the leitmotif of this movie is pursuit. We watch two pursuits being played out. One is the sheriff's, to catch the murderous and chillingly portrayed psychopath, Chigurh (Javier Bardem). The other is Chigurh's pursuit of Llewelwyn (Josh Brolin) to recover a huge bounty of drug money.<br/><br/>This story framework, set against the beautiful and stark Texan landscape, powerfully delivers the 'psychopathic murderer' movie genre. The Coen brothers deserve recognition for giving us something entertaining, but unlike movies of the same genre such as Terence Mallicks 'Badlands', it doesn't carry the same creative punch.<br/><br/>This is a one to see, albeit you'll need a strong stomach, as it dwells on gruesome images in the style of a horror movie.<br/><br/>In the end, the movie abandons you with the 'wounded animal is a dangerous animal' idea. The psychopathic murder is out there, on the street and you share his country!"

","This is really a masterpiece, probably the best film among all the Coen's brother's works, and deserved all the Academy Awards it just won; Brolin gives a really perfect performance as Moss, Bardem is literally terrific in the role of Chigurh, a crazy predator showing craziness for two and a half hours, Tommy Lee Jones as well is outstanding. It's an extremely original perspective of life, violence, loneliness, regrets, never boring, though a bit disturbing due to the terrifying violence. The underlying message of No Country for Old Men is also the unpredictability of real life, the set of opportunities we are missing and we have missed. Think the power of the movie is enhanced by the appropriate locations where it was shot, an outline of rural and backward America, along with violent and dangerous Mexico. I'd have expected a different finale, clearer at least, whereas this one might leave the onlooker with some doubts. Nevertheless it's surely an extraordinary story."
"jfcthejock","8","3","5","1 March 2008"," Violence, Drama and Menace!
","The desert, violence and murder... oh and a hell of a lot of Heroin and cash! This would make any person's mouth water at even the idea, not to mention seeing it in person and a load of dead corpses around it. Now that would usually put off a person from the idea of taking the loot and scampering off, knowing in their minds that death seems to be a common factor in the situation. An ordinary man while out hunting stumbles across the find, and rather than report the deaths and the loot to the police he takes both the drugs and the cash and prepares to flee for a new life. That is until he comes face to face with evil in human form, a hit-man set on taking the same loot in question for himself.<br/><br/>What follows is pure carnage and devastation that only the Coen brothers could imagine, this being evident in their past classics like Miller's Crossing and Fargo. For many the violence in the film would put them off from viewing it, but remember shock is one of the best tools to catch a person's attention. All in all No Country For Old Men is a classic in the making and of course has made Javier Bardem a household name as the high powered air-gun wielding assassin. I'd recommend this film to anyone who wants to see excellent acting and a great storyline that would put even LOST to shame."
"conker457","10","3","5","29 February 2008"," An American Masterpiece.
","I normally don't write reviews on here(especially when I've written such a review beforehand), but the backlash needs to be handled.<br/><br/>It's rare for a great film to consist of nothing less than great scenes. Every single second of ""No Country for Old Men"" maintains its purpose, yet the film strays away from a true conclusion. Some people like their endings chewed down and spit out, but the Coen Brothers avoid copping out by copping out. As strange as it sounds, the ""nonending"" channels the confusion and despair of the characters.<br/><br/>Then, there's Anton Chigurh, one of the great cinema villains of all time. He can scare even the bravest soul with his blank stare, and he practically redefines the term, ""killing machine."" Josh Brolin acts in a bare manner stripping any verbal complexities while adding many physical complexities.Brolin believably endures every ounce of Llewelyn's agony. Tommy Lee Jones shows the real despair as Ed Tom Bell, a sheriff that can't understand or catch as enemies as well as he desires.<br/><br/>The Coen Brothers aren't unfamiliar with greatness. ""Blood Simple,"" ""Miller's Crossing,"" ""Barton Fink,"" and ""Fargo"" all maintain appropriately impressive reputations, but with ""No Country for Old Men,"" The Coen Brothers use Cormac McCarthy's novel to breach the suspense genre. It's a bleak, challenging, funny, honest, suspenseful, and uncompromising epic that'll separate the true moviegoers from the fans of ""Rambo III."" This is probably my favorite film of the last five years."

"don85","10","3","5","25 February 2008"," - Hunter Becomes Bait  A Story About Keeping Promises & Consequences -
","-Hunter Becomes Bait  A Story About Keeping Promises & Consequences.-<br/><br/>After a long wait, the Oscar-rumoured No Country for Old Men, came into European cinemas and immediately I went to see if this film was worth all the prizes it won and the attention it got. Asking this question is, of course, answering it.<br/><br/>Let me first say that I'm not a die-hard Coen bros. fan. I love(d) The Big Lebowski, O Brother, Where Art Thou?, Fargo and the unforgettable Miller's Crossing. However some of their early movies, like Raising Arizona and Barton Fink, weren't really my thing. Matter of taste, I guess. With their latest, No Country for Old Men, they delivered a perfect blend of different genres while keeping the style and tone that's so typical Coen. <br/><br/>The plot is pretty (blood)simple actually. 'Man finds money from a drug deal gone wrong, which leads to other men coming after him to get back their money.' The way this violence-packed, western-crime-drama story is told, and shot (cinematographically) comes to life on the big screen in a way that is without a doubt beyond the words that will follow.<br/><br/>'Set somewhere in a country next to the Mexican-American border where the wonderful south-western accents sounded so incomprehensible that I am glad there were subtitles.'<br/><br/>""Josh Brolin plays a man who, while shooting deer in the desert, finds some dead Mexicans, guns, a truckload full of drugs and a bag of money. Naturally he keeps the 2 million crispy dollars and when the story unfolds the questions rise: 'What's the money really worth?' or 'What's the price of money?' From that moment on his life changes. He's being chased after where ever he goes and has to watch every step he takes. And the bait seems to be inventive enough to do so quite well.""<br/><br/>All the (other) actors also do a great job but Gran Canarian Javier Bardem (Spain) really stands out playing a man who's hired to return the dollars to its 'rightful' owners. People will see him as a ruthless killer which, of course, he is. But this 'bad guy' certainly keeps his promises and lives up to the few words he speaks. Tommy Lee Jones does a terrific job, playing a cop with a history what lead him to develop an indifferent look at the world. Once he gets involved Jones, like the audience, is destined to find out what is happening and hereby questioning (criticizing/commenting) his (our) way of life. And not to forget about the small, yet great part of Woody Harrelson: unforgettable.<br/><br/>Most of the Coen's movies could be seen as crime movies and/or classic comedy. This movie however throws all different kinds of genres in the mix. They easily switch from western to crime and from drama to the darkest of dark humour. Joel and Ethan manage to do this without and maybe because of a total lack of a music score which I didn't even get onto until the credits began to role.. <br/><br/>And, mostly at a very slow pace, the movie glides so perfectly well from one genre to the other, so you never get the idea you are really watching more movies than just the one you paid for.<br/><br/>A couple of words to describe this movie-experience: magnificent & mesmerizing, incomprehensible & unforgettable, beautiful & breathtaking.<br/><br/>(Today, No Country for Old Men earned 4 Academy Awards in the categories: Best Film, Best Director, Best Script and Best Actor (Bardem) in a Supporting Role)"
"lgorenc","6","3","5","29 January 2008"," Horrible ending
","I loved the first part of the movie. Both Bardem and Brolin are perfect in their roles. You get high hopes, because the movie gives you a thrill ride from the very beginning. Although quite simple, the plot slowly drags you in with intense and suspenseful gory action scenes that make you hold your breath. You get personally involved with the characters and, of course, you take sides, expecting aging sheriff and his young deputy to step into action and resolve the situation of cat and mouse chase. But, no. Instead, in the last 30 minutes of the film or so, the characters just kind of fade away and all you've seen that far starts to lose any sense, and at that point it makes you wonder if this is some artsy European flick that's supposed to leave you thoughtful. It all comes down to sheriff's reminiscence of the past times and the action outcome you awaited simply vanishes into thin air. Then you get totally confused by the final developments in this movie. After all he's been through, the main character (Brolin), who was hunted by this psycho killer (Bardem) throughout the movie, dies in the background shootout by the hand of some Mexicans, while the bad guy supposedly kills his wife and manages to escape wounded, but alive, after a totally unrelated car crash scene. You get the feeling the movie's been resolved like this due to the sudden death of the leading actor, so the crew just threw away the plot and finished the production with the leftover scenes they shot earlier. So what's the purpose of this ending? You can't go from gory action to melodrama in 30 seconds without giving viewers a bad headache. At the end you're wondering why you even bothered watching that 90 minutes of suspense, if it all comes down to nothing. I really think this movie is overrated and it doesn't deserve any Oscars, that's for sure. Maybe if there's a nomination for the screenplay gone terribly wrong. If it is for an unexpected ending, go and see Stephen King's Mist."

Fargo gone Texas, but with a pinch of Tarantino. a crazy killer, an old sheriff, the usual gallery of immortal heroes or antiheroes.<br/><br/>there is in American movies , this idea about people , or at least some of them, that basically you can shoot them, you can beat them, you can crash them, and they still stand. last man standing, bleeding, with bones sticking from their bodies, it doesn't matter: they still stand up, say something tough and off they go.<br/><br/>they don't cry , they don't shout, no! they are real men! they stand up and go. like on Lost, the TV series, concussion after concussion, punch after punch, bullet after bullet.<br/><br/>i wonder, don't they ever get tired of this life? and movie people, don't they ever get tired?<br/><br/>clearly there is never enough violence, shootings and killing and bleeding; because this movie has plenty. Yes, it's beautifully shot, yes the landscapes borrowed from mother nature are beautiful, and grand, but these are the Coen brothers, they are pretty good at what they do, technically. what is missing is that sense of uniqueness , of unseen, of unprecedented, of originality that we tasted so many times in the earlier movies that made us love the brothers.<br/><br/>Read my reviews on http://benmovies.blogspot.com"
"bobfitzgerald-1","3","3","5","27 January 2008"," Dreadful waste of some fine actors
","This is an interesting illustration of the often astonishing difference between the parts and the whole. The film has some spectacular cinematography, the charming presence of Tommy Lee Jones, a nice gritty performance by Josh Brolin, but all of this is in aid of a completely pointless film.<br/><br/>The brothers Coen have managed to turn Javier Bardem, an actor with the ability to show real subtlety when given the opportunity, into a cartoon character. The notion that this performance is worthy of an Oscar nomination is a frankly discouraging commentary on the state of Hollywood cinema; menacing zombies really don't require much range. Mar Adentro was an Oscar-worthy performance; this is just embarrassing.<br/><br/>I'm willing to sit through a fair amount of blood and gore, as long as I can nourish the hope - however faint - that it will lead somewhere, that it will make some commentary, that there is something to be learned from it, that there is some kind of idea that drives it. This film does not begin to deliver on any of these promises. I am entirely unconvinced that it's much of a revelation to be told that large wads of cash corrupt, or that there are some salaried psychopaths in the dope distribution industry.<br/><br/>Through the course of this overly-long film, the audience alternates between boredom and disgust, with occasional interludes of admiration for the technical details of the film-making. If the film itself had been up to the standard set by some of its parts, it would be worth watching. Unfortunately, it's not."

","The Coen Bros. are laughing all the way to the bank. Many critics often rave about products that are incoherent but somehow have the appearance of lucidity. These critics certainly do not want anyone to know they have been snookered. No Country for Old Men is perhaps the crowning achievement for this ""tongue-in-cheek"" crowd.<br/><br/>Here we have a film that builds up to great expectation with meticulously crafted tension and extraordinary production values, casting and performances but in the first part of the third act simply stops. Strong characters rendered by actors in good performances are either killed or hinted at being killed with no scenaric detail. The killer whose enigmatic character has become magnetic simply drives off into the horizon suffering only a broken arm in a mindless car accident. Cosmic intervention or comic relief? <br/><br/>The overall feeling is that the Coens ran out of budget but one can also strongly suspect that it might be that they decided to simply screw the audience and see if they could get away with it in a bizarre and sinister mind-set perhaps borne of some kind of chemical or psychological overdose. In any event at this writing it appears that they have, especially with eight Oscar nominations, at least for a great number of fans and critics not yet sure of themselves.<br/><br/>The movie is about as fulfilling and satisfying as being stood-up by an important romantic date for which one has spent half a day preparing. The level of impact and effect then depends upon one's level of masochistic personality, sense of self or overall intelligence."
"shermanlazzar","6","3","5","9 January 2008"," Disappointing
","I went into this film with high expectations. So, that being said I would still consider this a worthwhile film to go and see but I was left surprised at the critical acclaim the film had received. It wasn't that special.<br/><br/>I have never been a huge follower of the Coen brothers work. I love Fargo but that's really it. Their films are usually a little abstract. This story follow a retired welder Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin), who whilst deer hunter in the Texas desert stumbles across half a dozen corpses in what seems a drug-deal gone wrong. He also comes across $2 million in cash in a brief case and decides to keep it. The rightful owners of the money (Mexicans) find out the identity of Llewellyn, whose truck was found at the scene and they send a ruthless hit-man Anton Chigarr (Javier Berdum) to recover the money. Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is on a mission to try and protect Moss and in doing so, catch the elusive Chigarr.<br/><br/>The performance of Bardum as the villain Chigarr, is what makes this film worthwhile watching. It is one of the most chilling characters on the big screen for years and any scene he was in makes you sit up and take notice.<br/><br/>Sadly, the same cannot be said for other characters, particularly Tommy Lee Jones' role as the Sheriff who I found progressively more uninteresting throughout. **SPOILERS*** And this is my major criticism of the film (and I know I'm not alone here) because the Sheriff's character deliver a couple of monologues in the film that were crucial in conveying the themes in the film, particularly the last scene. But by the last scene monologue, I had tuned out because the Sheriff's character was so boring. Upon watching the film again, some obscure dream described in a monotone monologue is not the way to conclude a film or make a definitive point. The fact that many were looking around confused when the credits rolled is never a sign of concise film-making. Not having an ending shouldn't always be applauded. Sometimes it is lazy storytelling and I have to think that this was the case here. ***SPOILERS END***** <br/><br/>To be honest, it is hard to see what themes in the film haven't been explored before. There is nothing groundbreaking here. If the film was a good old fashion, lone ranger versus a ruthless Drug-lord - fine. In the sense the film is more than satisfactory. But the film purports to be so much more. And the attempt by the film to get these points across to the viewer was disappointing and lacked imagination. Cinematography was great and some of the action scenes were terrific. But at the end of the day, I'd only class this film as worthwhile, nothing more."
"soleil3339","5","3","5","4 January 2008"," Bespectacled Coen brothers are myopic in their vision of this story.
","After reading the wiki on the movie I understand that it is faithful to the book, which I have not read. But based on it's own merit I believe the movie fails. I am a great fan of the Coen brothers, and since Blood Simple I have seen every one of their films and loved each one. Therefore I was sorely disappointed and felt a bit ripped off by this movie, esp. the ending.<br/><br/>It has it's redeeming parts, to be sure, including fascinating and humorous character development. However, several parts of the storyline gave me pause, and were inconsistent with the morality of itself. For example when Chigurh is having his sit-down talk with the widow, and she refuses to call heads or tails, he says ""I arrived here the same way the quarter did."" Which contradicts his earlier statement to her saying it was because of a 'deal' gone bad with her husband. I realize Chigurh is portrayed as insane, but he is also intelligent which doesn't jive with this conversation.<br/><br/>I'm sad to see the Coen brothers fell victim to a fairly common fault with inexperienced directors in that they failed to consider how the movie would be understood and experienced by the viewer. In that respect they had a myopic vision of the story. As I say I have not read the book, perhaps the author dealt with the story in a similar way, I don't know.<br/><br/>The flow of the movie is interrupted in the ending when the sheriff is suddenly retired out of the blue with no lead up or lead in. This left me feeling frustrated and ripped-off.<br/><br/>I like a movie that makes me think and analyze things, but this interpretation went to far and left too much out."
"crushtv-1","5","3","5","28 December 2007"," Rarely will you see a good story SAVAGED to bits with such skill and cleverness
","The woman three rows behind me gave the most pithy review of this movie I ever heard as the credits began to roll: She said ""Ugh!!"" The theme of this movie is that life is not a movie. There is no justice (poetic or otherwise) that ensures every bad act will be repaid in kind. Life does not foreshadow: Just because a revolver is placed on a table, does not mean it will ever be fired, and a villain declaring that a bag will be placed under his feet or a protagonist declaring that he will kill a villain does not mean those things ever happen. In life, stories are not solved. They go on and on become part of other stories.<br/><br/>Okay. But ""No Country For Old Men"" is not Life. It is a movie. The screenwriter is supposed to imitate life. But he must ride heard over that imitation to ensure that he produces a satisfying work of art. He must play a lawman. He cannot, as Tommy Lee Jones does, retire from his job and say ""It's just too much for me."" We get used to narratives making promises to the audience. In this movie, the only character that ""keeps his promises"" that way is a madman. Everyone in the movie recognizes him immediately as a madman. But that only proves that the SCREENWRITER was a madman. It does not mean that is madness for a storyteller to keep his narrative promises.<br/><br/>All these little references show that the Coen Brothers knew what they were doing. They knew darn well that they were committing a dirty little murder against this story. That is why they killed the protagonist off screen...it kept the audience ""on the hook"", waiting for the movie to reveal ""the turn"" where the protagonist was shown NOT to be dead and all the promises were actually kept. Had they killed him on screen, they knew most of the audience would have given up on the story entirely.<br/><br/>This movie shows the skill of the Coen Brothers as storytellers. That is what makes this profoundly *unsatisfying* movie, so frustrating. They didn't destroy the end of this movie as bumbling hacks.

","It seems that every single Coen brothers movie is going to be well-received by critics...have they ever been rated poorly? Accordingly, I go to the movies, but I know I may not like it very much. I respect the Coens, and I admire that they try to make so many different kinds of films. This is a very well-crafted film, and at this point, I think Bardem deserves the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. That being said, the film was excruciatingly slow at many points, and simply lacked any soul.<br/><br/>I tend to like their movies with humor, such as Fargo and Raisin' Arizona, but even that doesn't guarantee a good film (I hated O'Brother and Ladykillers). Their more serious films are technically very well-done, but usually lack any soul."

Well, I would not be surprised if most of those reviews are bogus, possibly written by out-of-work writers hired to promote the movie.

","The first half of 'No Country for Old Men' comes off something like 'The Terminator goes to West Texas'. All the elements are there: an unstoppable, determined, and soulless killing machine set against a hopelessly outmatched protagonist who is simply trying to stay alive another day. Derivativeness aside, this part of the movie is still quite gripping, though, which is more than I can say for the second half of the film. As things dragged on, I couldn't help feeling a little bored as Tommy Lee Jones' pseudo-philosophical and somewhat redundant sheriff increasingly wandered in and out of the story. Near the end of the movie, the story seems completely lost. The abrupt ending especially feels like the filmmakers ran out of gas and tried to pass it off as authenticness and artistry. It's too bad, because this movie could have easily been a 9 or a 10 based on the first hour or so."

","This was a bad movie! No climax, long and boring. Good acting but other than that this movie is not worth anyones time. I felt no feelings towards any protagonist good or bad. Javier Bardem plays the antagonist, and plays it well. He is intense and fully deserves the best supporting actor. Tommy Lee Jones, plays the cop trying to track down Bardmen's character, but seems somehow uninterested in tracking him down and more interested in drinking coffee and talking. Josh Borlin plays the protagonist, and is being pursued by everyone, unfortunately when everyone catches up to him we don't get to see it why because there is no climax, just the end result which I won't disclose. I felt no feelings towards Borlin's character, in other words I didn't care if he died, lived, or became the holy ghost. The Oscars are starting pick the best picture not for the contents of the story but the stile in which it's told. This in my opinion is a big flaw and why a lot of people will be disappointed in this movie."

"badlands-bill","1","4","8","14 May 2009"," Can't believe this won Best Picture
","OK, the actors were excellent, especially the leads, and including Woody Harrelson in a supporting role. But in general, I found this movie to be a stinker. It takes a while to get started, picks up in the middle, only because there was a little action to go along with a dragging storyline, and the film's ending may have been intended as a metaphor, but it was just as bad as the movie overall.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes seem like important parts ended up on the cutting room floor, or perhaps the entire scenes should have! The whole concept of dragging around a suitcase of money, which happens to have a transponder in it, as opposed to dumping it in a duffel bag or something so you would be less conspicuous to the person searching for the case was a bit silly. As was the motel scene of going to the trouble to hide the case in an HVAC vent only to pull it out through another vent - what was the point of that? What did it achieve or help him elude. <br/><br/>I cannot believe someone actually put their name to this movie."
"suburbannightmare","10","4","8","1 May 2009"," No Country For Sane Men...
","The Coen Brothers are, truly, one of the finest the quintessences of awesome film-making. No Country For Old Men demonstrates this perfectly. OK, it's an adaptation of a book. And we all know how many times that concept results in cringeworthy failures and the loss of important factors. Like plot. But, the Coens make good on their turn. Very good.<br/><br/>Cormac McCarthy's book is as desolate and sparse as the harsh, dusty, barren South-American desertlands it sets itself in, but it's highly descriptive and powerfully jarring. McCarthy's ability to convey pages and pages in one sentence is brilliant, and it makes it a very direct and jolting reading experience, whilst at the same time being slow-burning and steady. The story is a classic deadly cat-and-mouse-style intrigue, but it's not a story that's wrapped up in a neat little bow with all the bad guys in prison and the all the good guys sipping margaritas in a Mexican sun-trap! The ending to say the least is ambiguous (which is personally why I think a lot of people disliked the movie version) and the pace is sharp but slow.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin is excellently cast as Llewellyn Moss, (although it was the lighting courtesy of Robert Rodriguez in his audition tape that caught the Bros' eyes as opposed to his acting. Oops.) the grizzled Vietnam-Vet-Turned-Welder-Turned-Hunter who stumbles across a fortune in heroin and a satchel of cold, hard cash in the outback open country of Texas. Cue: Moss is plunged into a chase with a madman - all hell breaks loose. Brolin's performance is amazing, he's baffled, disbelieving, cynical, yet sets about his surreal situation with grim determination. And a large shotgun. Whilst I suspect millions of dollars would be a sturdy motivator for most people to go head-to-head with a psychotic, weird-haircut-wearing hit-man, Moss still has more grit than a fleet of ice-trucks.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurgh is the first time since Darth Vader that a film character has truly disturbed me. Just like Darth, I had the inescapable feeling that bad things were imminent and people were surely going to expire horribly whenever this guy coolly sauntered on screen. His complete cold detachement is chilling - he is a complete dyed-in-the-woool killing machine, and his menace is only further enhanced by his truly strange 'do, his love of pneumatic weapons, and his complete trust in that fickle master of horrors himself, Fate. A man who thinks nothing of flipping coins to determine a person's survival is a man who is monumentally insane. Or just sociopathically ambivalent towards human life. Look out for the self-surgery scene, which is a testament to Chigurgh's overall inhuman detachment. Amazing.<br/><br/>Tommy Lee Jones is also fantastic as always, he's a perfect old school Texan Sheriff, who is truly appalled at the carnage exploding around him, and having a murderous ghost like Chigurgh around, the body count soon mounts up. Sheriff Bell is one of the most human elements of the film - he does his grim duty and tries gallantly to put a stop to the killing and general decline of society, but he's a man sensing his battle is a lost cause. It's all he can do to keep his head above water and he finally retreats, world-weary and battle-drawn into retirement, longing for the days of old where sheriffs never wore guns and hit men never used cattle bolts to kill people.<br/><br/>Kelly Macdonld isn't bad as Carla Jean either, Moss' southern-belle young wife. Her accent's good (she's a Scot! Cool!) and she's the only character who gives Chigurgh what for - admittedly she's like a scared rabbit caught in headlights when she finally meets him, but she still stops him in his tracks a bit. Which is a great juxtaposition, as he puts paid to burley fellow hit men, hard-ass mexicans with a well-stocked cache of very large guns and scores of poh-lice with great ease. Not to say Carla Jean escapes unscathed, but she's still somewhat victorious! This movie is understated excellence, the script remains respectfully true to it's source material, the characters are well-defined and explored (enhanced by fabulous acting, which is always a plus) and it deserves recognition as a stand-alone film, not just an adaptation. The whole film also looks beautiful, with stunning, epic sun-baked desert-esquire vistas, and claustrophobic, dusty, edge-of-Mexico motels. The violence is just like McCarthy's writing style - pared-down, to the point and jolting, without ever crossing the line into gratuitous, Tarantino-like caricature (which is not a bad thing, but would be completely at odds with the slow, almost delicately paced story and the careful dialogue). This is a class film, well-acted, gorgeously shot and faithfully reproduced from a fantastic source material. It's an amazing movie, but I would suggest a read of the book, because for me, it made the film's ending sit much better. Although the amount of fellow movie-goers who were vociferously deflated with the lack of conclusion would disagree with me. And probably hit me with a pressurised cattle bolt or something."
"millerman378","10","4","8","16 March 2009"," No cineastic apogee for nihilistic bottom feeders....
","The Coen brothers have raised their own unique bar yet again. NCFOM is a poetically languid, yet ultimately profound commentary on the utter futility of avaristic greed. What many contributors to this forum seem to have overlooked, is that the ""protagonist"" of this film is NOT the hackneyed Hollywood hero so prevalent in today's adolescent-geared, nihilistic cinema. His is not a noble cause. There are no CGI battlegrounds or macho catchphrases. There is only the bleakness of human desperation and the brutal randomness of violence as essayed by the evil incarnate that is Anton Chigur. His character is an ever-present reminder of the vapid emptiness of wanton ambition, and it's ultimate blood-stained price. Timeless."
"jghbrown","3","4","8","16 November 2008"," Grafik violence - with subtlety
","My mother came in while I was watching this movie and she said for shame I ought to turn it off right away. Which of course I didn't.<br/><br/>Later I explained to her that it wasn't all violent. No sir, not by a long shot (if you'll pardon the expression). I mean you had this scary looking fellow going round killing people with a cattle bolt gun (or a shotgun, depending on his mood at the time). Every occasion you saw that thing with its long shiny cylinder you knew someone was going to get their chips and end up with their ass a lot further underground than when they started. I have to admit I was beginning to wonder if there would be anyone left alive in the State of Texas if they didn't catch him pretty damn quick.<br/><br/>But in between the killings there were these downright interesting conversations where they talked about the way things were and the way they are now and how things went from father to son and stuff like that. Must admit I've forgotten some of it now but it had my full attention at the time.<br/><br/>If the movie had a slight flaw it was that you didn't see the moment when Carla Jean got hers. I mean you'd spent the better part of two hours witnessing what that old bolt gun could do both to the human flesh and even to more than a few doors (and some of those looked pretty solid to my eye). And while the scary fellow was sitting there tossing that coin and trying to make her call I couldn't help wondering when he was going to get that thing out and start making a few holes in her. I even went through all the extra stuff on the DVD (though by this time my mother was hollering for me to come down to supper - she's been trying to get me to find a place of my own ever since I turned forty) to see if I could find it, but it looks like they cut it out for some reason.<br/><br/>Well, I guess that's about it - have to get on down to the drugstore to buy a few more shells for my pump-action Beretta shotgun. I like to keep it under my bed in case my mother turns bad on me."
"HalGuentert","6","4","8","14 October 2008"," Good, as far as it goes... No ending.
","I liked ""Fargo"", liked this title, and am very familiar with west Texas. I also liked the the beginning, middle, and the acting and directing was excellent to a point. The point was the Act 3 ending.<br/><br/>I have to agree with the reviewers who are disappointed with this movie, and awards given to movies with poor endings. I went back and had to review the last scenes to see if I missed something on the DVD, but unfortunately I hadn't missed anything significant in this movie. There was no real ending, no reasoning that tied the story together except a string of murder and gore. Almost any writer could create a multitude of better endings, but that didn't happen.<br/><br/>Basically, if you can imagine ""Fargo"" (with or without snow) with Tommy Lee Jones playing a male version of ""Margie"" who is ready to retire, and retires at the end of the movie after driving right by the kidnappers' ""safe house"" on Moose Lake, never seeing the ""burnt ember Cierra"", you have a very similar plot. How satisfying is that?<br/><br/>It is disappointing that people can crank out stories with poor, confusing, truncated endings and pretend they are something great. It is far too great a ""cheat"", and I have to agree that politics seems to drive a lot of awards for poor writing, because it seems to be common now. <br/><br/>If you remember the 80/20 rule, where the last 20% of a project takes 80% of the effort, there is a lot of effort missing on this one."
"Boba_Fett1138","7","4","8","8 September 2008"," This unfortunately ain't not ""Fargo"".
","This movie always has been compared a lot to ""Fargo"", not just because its from the same directors but also the story and just the movie as a whole show lots of similarities. To be honest, I wouldn't exactly say that this movie is like ""Fargo"" at all. I wish it would had been though, since that probably would had meant that I would had liked and enjoyed the movie much better.<br/><br/>My main problem I had with this movie was that the story and foremost its storytelling got unnecessarily complicated at times. The movie has all the right ingredients in it to make a good and typical Coen brother's movie with but some of the ingredients are not present good enough and not mixed in well enough with all of the other ingredients. It doesn't make ""No Country for Old Men"" as tasty as I would had hoped and also expected. After all, this movie was the big winner of the 2008 80th Annual Academy Awards, where it won Oscar's for best movie and directing. <br/><br/>It mainly lacks some witty and subtle comedy. Yes, ""No Country for Old Men"" does obviously still feature this all but the movie just gives you the feeling if it all had been a tad bit more comical and not as serious, the movie would had been a way better one.<br/><br/>It's still a superior shot and made movie though from the obvious talented Coen Brothers. It foremost also really shows how acting can really make a movie. Coen brother movie characters are of course always something unusual and unforgettable and ""No Country for Old Men"" also truly features some unforgettable and unusual characters in it.<br/><br/>Of course most memorable is Javier Bardem as a serial killer with some odd weapons as choice. He deserved his Oscar. He plays his character chilling, as well as with a sense of comedy, despite the fact that his character doesn't ever show some emotion. A real great achievement from Spanish born actor Javier Bardem. But the entire movie is basically well cast with some big names such as Tommy Lee Jones and Woody Harrelson in it, as well as some unexpected choices, such as Josh Brolin and Kelly Macdonald in some roles I had never ever seen them in before but they fit and play their roles surprisingly well.<br/><br/>The movie is slowly build up with some long shots. It makes ""No Country for Old Men"" also a real beautiful movie to watch, also not in the least of course thanks to Roger Deakins Oscar nominated camera-work.<br/><br/>I would say; beware not to expect another ""Fargo"" and you'll probably end up liking this movie but if it had been a bit more entertaining all it really truly would had been one of the movies of the year.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

"raypdaley182","1","4","8","20 July 2008"," Very poorly written film
","I'd like to rank this amongst some of the worst films I've ever seen. Imagine a 3 hour long film with no introduction or ending, in other words your only watching the middle of a film.<br/><br/>The film is very difficult to follow, characters are never really established enough for you to get to know them or feel any affinity for them. The only real known names in the film are Tommy Lee Jones playing Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (who you hardly ever see) & Woody Harrelson playing Carson Wells (who is in no more than 5 scenes). The main characters are Javier Bardem playing Anton Chigurh (who I've never heard of) & Josh Brolin (playing Llewelyn Moss) who is only famous for being the son of James Brolin.<br/><br/>Some how this pile of rubbish managed to win 4 Academy Awards (Best Picture which made me laugh - it must have been up against some right utter trash, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay which is also laughable because essentially all they did was film the book this movie is based on & it also won best supporting actor for Javier Bardem) and I wondered if the Acedmy were watching the same movie I was.<br/><br/>If the book is the same as the film then I'm surprised it was ever made into a movie as it's a very poor story indeed. The basic idea is good enough, that a man accidentally finds money & drugs after a drug sale goes wrong & everyone involved gets killed. Moss doesn't want the drugs but he does take the money but the people who were behind buying the drugs want their money back.<br/><br/>Basically the rest of the film is a chase movie from that point onwards with Moss & everyone close to his life being pursued by the man hired to retrieve the money by the people who were buying the drugs who is killing anyone in his way on the journey.<br/><br/>Ed Tom Bell is the local sheriff from the town near where the drug sale went wrong & he is tracking Chigurh who is searching for the money stolen by Moss. The pursuit is long & violent, pretty mindless and quite boring. You can't just expect a movie to be good because 1 guy is killing a lot of people, it has to have an actual story or protagonists you know & care about.<br/><br/>And thats where the movie suffers, never knowing enough about Moss's character. With Bell we at least get a bit of insight into who he is from his voice-overs & scenes with his wife & employees but he's not the lead or even the 2nd lead character & we never get told enough about either of them. We learn almost nothing about Chigurh's character, only a short scene where Wells is hired to find & stop Chigurh (even the reasons behind this are never fully explained).<br/><br/>The ending of the movie is also very weak & difficult to understand. Apparently Moss is killed (I didn't even realise this, thats how hard the film is to follow!), we never know if Moss's wife lives or what happens to the money. We never know how Moss's mother in law dies, who hit Chigurh's car & why.<br/><br/>The film ends very badly, Chigurh walking away from a car accident & Bell wondering how he'll pass the time now he has retired.<br/><br/>Not recommended as there is no start or actual end to the movie."

","""No Country for Old Men"" is a one of the best movies of Coen Brothers. It is still very different than their other movies.<br/><br/>Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) finds a briefcase including a blood money from a drug deal. Moss gets a ruthless hit-man, Anton Chigurh (absolutely brilliant Javier Bardem) hunting him down. Also a sheriff, Ed Tom Bell (fantastic Tommy Lee Jones) is interested of finding Moss. Moss is on the run but how long does it take our killer to find him...<br/><br/>Joel and Ethan Coen have used great ways to tell the story imaginatively. The direction for each actor is flawless and the characters are well written. The brothers have a creative way to show us what has happened without showing everything concrete. The minimalism of Coen's is very present. The three leading characters represents a different sides of the matter and form a working triangle. ""No Country for Old Men"" is one of the most powerful stories, indeed.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem gives without a doubt his careers yet best performance as a merciless killer whose only weakness is that sometimes he gives his victims a choice by calling a coin. Tommy Lee Jones is at his best as sheriff Bell. Josh Brolin fits fantastically to the role of Llewelyn Moss.<br/><br/>""No Country for Old Men"" is one of the most serious creation of Coen's but still their flourishing sarcasm flows. There is no wonder why the movie was noticed by the Academy of Oscars. High recommends!"
"rlnutt","1","4","8","13 March 2008"," Not sure what movie everyone else was seeing here!
","Alright, so, I waited until AFTER the Oscars to see this movie. I am a fan of every actor in this movie from previous work excluding the psycho killer played by Javier Bardem. I've just never heard of him before this. I'll never forget him now! <br/><br/>The actors deliver in spades and the creepiness of Bardem's maniacal killer is impressive. We rented this movie out for a dollar and I was pleased it was available. Especially since I only wasted a buck! <br/><br/>The killer gets started early with the strangling of a deputy sheriff which is a scene we've all seen on the previews. At this moment, I lost my wife, she got up and left to play on the computer! <br/><br/>The movie was strange and scary throughout the first half. Josh Brolin is smart and wily as the poor man that happened on a scene where he found 2 million dollars. His character knew he was in trouble from the start he proved his smarts by out thinking everyone following him. That's what made his demise so strange... his character seemed to have known what was going to happen next until that moment. Not consistent at all.<br/><br/>Anyhow, Tommy Lee Jones, Barry Corbin, Josh Brolin, Woody Harrelson and Javier Bardem put in good minimalist performances but the ending of the movie is weak. I needed to watch the bonus sections of the DVD to somewhat understand the sheriff and his motivation.<br/><br/>I'm losing faith in Hollywood's ability to really make a good movie... the writers seem to have decided that they want endings where the movie goer can infer his own... that is not why I spend my money, I'm looking for escapism and some fulfillment. Don't expect that with this movie!<br/><br/>So, maybe I'm too obtuse to fully grasp what in the heck the Coen brothers were trying to say here... with Hollywood's propensity to copy what works (again, in their eyes), then expect more unfilled endings to movies in the immediate future! <br/><br/>With ticket prices down, you'd think Hollywood would get the message and start catering to the masses and not their pretentious and narcissistic ways! Completely disappointed here... the cinematography and acting highs was overshadowed by such a weak ending... I wish I could give this movie a ""0""!"
"michael_the_nermal","4","4","8","10 March 2008"," Clunky Script leaves Many Unanswered Questions
","Major spoilers ahead!<br/><br/>I know it may be trendy to have an ambiguous and incomprehensible ending, but in a film like this, it leaves a very unsatisfying taste in one's mouth. There were too many questions, which I will lazily and tritely list..right now:<br/><br/>The killer walks free? Why? What of the money that was the catalyst for the plot? Where did it go? What is the true reason behind Javier Bardem's character's moral ambiguity? Why deny his own free will in deciding to commit the murders? And what is with his decision to allow his victims to choose their fate with a plot device ripped straight out of DC Comics (hint: watch another big movie with Tommy Lee Jones to find out what I'm talking about)? Why was Josh Brolin (the eldest male Goonie) killed in so unceremonious a fashion, without so much as a satisfying showdown with the killer? And, finally, what is with Hollywood's love affair with ultra-violence? <br/><br/>The plot and themes were a little unclear as conveyed through the two main characters, those being The Eldest Male Goonie, now some crusty old cowpoke who decides to take the money and run, and some soulless, murderous hit-man. The movie was revving me up for some ""Falling Down""-like showdown between Tommy Lee Jones and Javier Bardem, but the Coens purposefully bummed out the audience with a completely unsatisfying ending, where the bad guy escapes, and there is no real climax. I mean that in the strict literary sense: there is no climax to either the plot of the cat-and-mouse chase between Brolin and Bardem, or the pursuit by Jones of Bardem. The movie just...ends. Critics may call this a masterful twist ending, but many viewers might simply perceive this as poor writing. <br/><br/>I must also protest the extensive gore and guts splattered through this film. It is very gratuitous and unnecessary to show such graphic carnage in order to further the plot or develop the characters. Even Bardem's evil character did not need to be shown strangling, then severing the jugular of a deputy in such graphic detail in order to convey his character's amoral, antisocial nature. What was with the slow death of the drug lord, showing him gurgling up his own blood as Bardem shot him? This is violence for its own sake, without any discussion of its moral implications to complement it. The pain and suffering of the characters killed is never explored or analyzed; it's just a superfluous scene in and of itself. The Coens are not the only ones responsible in Hollywood, but they do the audience no favors by relishing in the use of ultra-violence as an artistic motif. It is a disturbing trend that should be limited in so-called serious movies, as opposed to slasher horror movies where this is to be expected.<br/><br/>The excessive, gratuitous violence and choppy script make this a difficult movie to enjoy, or even analyze. The storyline simply leaves too many unanswered questions for a regular moviegoer. As a result, ""No Country for Old Men"" is a half-finished, unsatisfying movie without a real climax or conclusion."
"longrush","3","4","8","9 March 2008"," Too many problems
","I realize that this movie is supposed to be very artsy, but it just doesn't work--at least, not for me. This is what I find unsupportable:<br/><br/>(1) There is no resolution. A novel, a movie, or a TV drama has to go somewhere with a definite change. The movie doesn't have this.<br/><br/>(2) There are too many unexplained occurrences, e.g., the final scene. I could go into this in more detail, but I don't want to give too much away.<br/><br/>(3) The villain is completely one dimensional, which is probably the fault of the directors. The scariest villains are those with redeeming qualities, some ability to function in society. Nurse Ratchet in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" and Hal in ""2001"" are examples of what I mean. One look at or one word from the villain in ""No Country"" and it is obvious that he is completely and dangerously crazy. Even Charlie Manson is more presentable. Or Jeffrey Daumer. Or John Wayne Gacy. Or, or, or... I realize the actor received an Academy Award for this role, but I wouldn't have voted for him.<br/><br/>(4) I didn't keep count of the killings in this movie, but it has to be somewhere between 15 and 20, Maybe more. killings by the cruelest methods. If one man, in real life, accounted for that many killings in such a short period, he would be featured nightly on Nancy Grace, even on the front page of the New York Times. And no killer could just walk away from it. No, I don't think so.<br/><br/>(5) I couldn't always understand the dialogue, and I didn't always understand where we were. No, I'm not retarded. I paid attention. In understand other movies. I didn't have any problem with ""Fargo."" In short, I'm no longer much entertained by violence and bloodshed when there's no point made by the film makers. I prefer a better story with better acting."

","This movie stunk!! I'm a huge Coen Brothers fan; love Fargo, Oh Brother.., Raising Arizona, Lady Killers, even the Man Who Wasn't There, but DON""T BOTHER GOING TO SEE THIS STINKER! I was eagerly anticipating the kind of gratuitous violence the Coen brothers are known for but found these killings just plain stupid, not funny, not frightening, just stupid. I was looking forward to well developed West Texas characters and found that the ultimate fate of each character had nothing to do with all the boring details we had to sit through: Llewelyn Moss was a tough hard nosed vet. His wife says he won't back down to anyone. He gets really scared and really paranoid through the course of the film. After the psycho threatens his wife, he says he's got something in store for the psycho. So what does he do? He stands around by the pool in broad daylight, with NO GUN, waiting for his wife. WHAT? They don't even show him being killed??? With Carla Jean Moss' character I thought the Coen's would dive into the ""redneck wife"" character like they did with ""Minnesota mom"", Marge Gunderson in Fargo, but no. They dabble around and show some interesting glimpses but all for not. They don't even show her fate. The only clue was the psycho checking his boots for blood. It wasn't funny or ironic or significant or anything of substance. It was just stupid. Carson Wells is some kind of drug lord's clean up guy, super tough and ultra street savvy. He's so smart he knows that Moss is in the Mexican hospital. BUT, knowing the psycho is in town he stupidly walks through the hotel lobby and lets the psycho get the jump on him???? Sheriff Ed Tom Bell is a wise old redneck (literally) sheriff who's seen it all. He figures out that the psycho likes to use an air-gun to knock out locks. He's giving Carla Jean advice and you would think he would know how Moss would behave enough to find and help him. BUT NO. The closest his character comes to actually DOING something is when he searches the blood soaked hotel room AFTER the psycho has left. And that old technique of the bad guy waiting in ambush, but not in the same location, is way over used and way too cheap for the Coen brothers. As with Carla Jean's character, they failed to make use of all the time spent developing the sheriff. The genius of the Coen Brothers is, or was to develop a local character, in part making fun of it, but in the end showing how some aspect of the character plays out. In this film the local twists in the characters were TOTALLY WASTED. It might as well have been set in the Bronx. As for the psycho himself he was the best developed character, much more typical of the Coen brothers. His apparent demise, signaled by the green traffic signal, very ""Coen-esque"", was even screwed-up. To any hard-core Coen brother's fan Chigurh was SUPPOSE to die in the random traffic accident, HOW IRRONIC. (If you don't believe me go watch Lady Killers, it's hysterical) BUT NO!! They even screwed this up. I have never been to a movie before where everyone, I mean everyone in the theater got up at the end of the move and said: ""That stunk! I can't believe THAT won best picture!"" The Academy giving this huge disappointment ""Best Picture"" tells me one of two things; either they're rewarding the Coen brothers for sinking to their level or there just weren't ANY other films made in 2007."
"timothy-100","2","4","8","1 March 2008"," Simply boring
","I am just puzzled by the high ratings, the Oscars etc. Many of the critics on this site who have given this film a poor rating have pointed out the pointlessness and implausibility of it all; the plot inconsistencies; the fact that one of the two main characters just disappears (and his wife - well what happens to her?); the way the whole thing just dies on its feet at the end (if anything that was never alive can be said to die); the fact that the Tommy Lee Jones character hardly interacts with the plot at all. Even Javier Bardem, while striking in a way, is simply an unexplained psychopath with no apparent character, motivation, past or - for that matter - purpose. Lacking these he's not interesting. But overall the film is simply boring. It's slow and pretentious. Watched on DVD at home you'd probably give up, or at least get on with other things with it on in the background, occasionally popping into the room to ask 'has anything happened yet?'. Trapped in the cinema you might not actually walk out, but at the end you'll wonder why not."
"mukava991","6","4","8","17 February 2008"," half brilliant, half silly
","This film seems to have the same central flaw as almost every other Coen Brothers film I've seen Â– it builds up fascinatingly and meticulously with great visual flair and originality, and then abandons the plot in favor of silly or wispy resolutions that aren't worth the time spent getting to them. The Man Who Wasn't There and Barton Fink come to mind. Secondly, these brothers are still writing ""quirky"" dialogue that calls attention to itself. I suppose it's ""clever"" but what else? Or is ""clever"" enough? I guess so, if the critical praise for this effort is any indication. I am reminded of some of David Lynch's villains who talk in cryptic riddles Â–but Lynch deals with dreamscapes and the Coen Brothers are supposed to be in reality. And finally, here we have yet another serial killer / slasher / scary monster genre movie in which violent and explosive scenes of murder and mayhem occur in populated environments (a motel, a hotel, an office building in broad daylight, etc.) but no one except the central players are seen, no one calls the cops, no one intervenes, no one is around at the crucial moment Â– too easy and way too common as filmmakers seem to feel a need to maintain a high body count to keep the audience interested. The overall effect is cartoonish. After a while I was squirming in my seat from boredom, less and less concerned with the fates of the main characters. <br/><br/>I was glad to see Kelly Macdonald (so memorable as Maggie Smith's long suffering and noble maid in Gosford Park) play a Texan, especially late in the story when out of the blue she shows some insight and intelligence. Josh Brolin as her rough but gentle Viet Nam vet husband matched her all the way Â– fine actor. Javier Bardem as the unstoppable Frankensteinish killer is truly frightening. But there is little substance beneath the cleverness and I am wondering if the strong points of this film come from the novel upon which it is said to be closely based. If any message is to be derived, it is that as time passes our society gets more and more violent and therefore this is ""no country for old men,"" but hasn't the old ""what's the world coming to?"" idea been around since the beginning of civilization?"

","SPOILERS ALERT! Read no further if you haven't seen the film!!!<br/><br/>I am getting tired of seeing nothing by 10 star ratings for this film. Was nobody else as disappointed as I was by the ending? The story was brilliant from the opening until the point where Woody Harrelson visits Josh Brolin in the hospital. This is where the story just sort of trickles out and...stops. We never get the showdown that we so badly want to see between Brolin and Bardem.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes in this film were terrifying, true edge of your seat suspense. This movie starts off so well and keeps delivering genuine thrill after genuine thrill, but after abruptly killing off the hero and then trickling away into nothingness, I felt cheated, disappointed, and stupid for having sat through the entire film. The Coens failed to tie it up whatsoever. Instead they tried some stupid film school/David Lynch BS, and the movie suffers as a result. The book may have been disjointed and open-ended, but this is a movie and should have been better adapted for the screen. <br/><br/>If Jaws the movie had been given the same ending as Jaws the book, it would have been a monstrosity of an ending, and that is just what the Coens have produced here..."
"jamesnicolay","10","4","8","11 February 2008"," Ambitious yet Haunting
","Immediately after the last scene, my friend called up--and I almost jumped out of my seat. I struggled to listen to what she was saying, but I couldn't take my mind off the strange ending of the latest offering from the guys who gave us the contemporary classic Fargo, the Coen brothers. My friend warned me about the UP Fair--and in my mind, I was still speechless about the turn-out of the thrilling cat-and-mouse chase of the hunter and the psycho in the film. And the lame yet excusable sheriff. Then, inexplicably, the phone conversation I was struggling to keep was disconnected. I thought of calling my friend back, but I have to pause... and digest what the film No Country For Old Men just did to me. <br/><br/>The story is deliriously simple: (Spoilers alert!) Guy A, a hunter, discovers money from a drug-trafficking/ambush scene where people are dead or mostly goners; Guy B, a murderer, looks for the money and hunts down Guy A; Guy C, a sheriff, hunts down Guy B; Guy A gets away from Guy B but is unwittingly murdered by the latter's companions; Guy B gets the money and kills everyone who stops him; suddenly, Guy B had an accident but is able to escape; Guy C, the poor sheriff, fails in his mission, tells us about his 2 dreams and ends by saying he woke up.<br/><br/>And together, let's say: What?! That's it?!<br/><br/>It has been more than an hour, and still I am with my second nightly bottle while I could not just contain my thoughts about the film. I'll focus on four things.<br/><br/>First, the acting is the first thing that tattoos upon the audience's conscious mind while and after watching the film. Particularly, Javier Bardem's performance will live on for decades to come. His character will definitely earn its rightful place among the most evil and frightening villain ever seen on film. There was not a scene in the film where his presence will leave you comfortable in your seat. When he speaks, you struggle to listen while holding your breath, afraid that you will be one of his victims if you misunderstand a word he is saying. When he doesn't speak, he reminds you of that black hooded figure with a sickle. <br/><br/>Next, the use, or rather, the absence of musical score or background is employed masterly, creating an aura of haunting silence while the tension reaches its boiling point and the members of the audience are at the edge of their seats while struggling not to have a heart attack. <br/><br/>Thirdly, more of technical stuff: the editing is so succinct that a second viewing of the film is necessary if one has a short attention span and is not keen on details. And to be honest, I had to rewind and go back at some certain parts of the films to see what I missed. But other than that, the composition of the pictures are brilliant. And breathtaking--and that can be taken literally, too.<br/><br/>The last and the most important aspect of the film is its uncompromising mode--the utter sophistication and the bitter pessimistic take on the fate of man--how our chances stand against the unexplainable evil forces in real life. The film poses to us one of the perennial challenges of man on surviving on earth: how do we survive knowing that human malevolence, wickedness, and immorality are fundamentally present and overwhelmingly unpredictable and immutable? <br/><br/>Combine this with the dark humor and ambitious yet haunting style that only the Coen brothers can deliver, this film is an instant classic."

","This film makes Cormac MacCarthy's style ten times more powerful because it provides the words and metaphors with images that are slowly unwrapped and disentangled from the unbearable reality of life. The USA have reached a point when history is the only master of the game, master of ceremonies. The USA have produced a situation that will resolve itself by using its own contradictions till the whole world is destroyed if necessary. This world is dominated by money that has to be easy and does not have to be clean, even would I say that is to be dirty: that gives it more taste and flavor. The world is dominated by the hunger of overstuffed men for anything that will satiate this hunger with something unreal, surreal, over-real: let it be a powder, an injection or whatever but let it erase the darkness of the night, even in the middle of the day, and cultivate some kind of visionary illusion. Then add the third dimension of this world seen through the distorting glass of the USA: violence not for the sake of making anyone suffer. That is no longer funny. Torturing is the pleasure of the simple minded. We are dealing here with a totally psychotic and asocial schizophrenic who can only find his satisfaction, his fun, his pleasure in imposing death in the cleanest way possible. And if a bullet does not suffice let's have a second to prevent any useless suffering. The USA in their immense hunger for money and drugs, speculation and hunger, accumulation and greed, have attracted on to themselves the worst killers ever, the worst predators ever, the worst rotten-meat-eaters you can imagine. They prosper on manure that they distillate in their speculative bank practices. They thrive on human garbage they concentrate in their appropriative confiscation of all they see and cannot accept not to have. Some try to play cat and mouse with them but these are not the cat and the cat knows it and the cat cannot accept any escape. The sheriff though will survive because he will realize the vulture is wounded less than two yards from him and he the lawman will walk away without confronting him. He will resign due to his cowardice and he will dream his father in a typical posture of the Trail of Tears celebrating the end of the Indian genocide, but carrying a horn full of fire as if Satan did not have any matches. No hope for the average American who wishes to have eternal life in this world without death and perfect innocence in a time when even new-born babies are soiled with the grossest crimes and desires imaginable. A hairless teenager at the end will find five hundred dollars kind of not enough for a five dollar Wal Mart shirt sold to the hyena who disappears when no survivor is any longer blocking his way. Pure darkness in which black finds darker shades of black to even make the absence of any light seem to be too light still to be realistic.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines"

The action is unique and gives you the feeling that its real not like your typical Hollywood action flick.<br/><br/>So not only is it entertaining its actually a great movie. The direction is some of the best iv ever seen, every aspect of the movie if perfect from the acting to the cinematography to the lack of a score.not one second of this movie is done poorly and not one second it pointless, everything means something whether you know what it is or not( which is another reason your going to want to watch it more than once). So in other words the second reason I loved it is because its perfect.<br/><br/>IMDb says the movie has a 122 min runtime thats 122 min of perfection. One of the big draw backs of the movie from what I hear other people say is about the abrupt ending. Personally for about 5 min after it was over I was disappointed, but after sleeping on it I realized I loved the ending. This movie has been on my mind every day since I've seen it.<br/><br/>Not since probably ""Donnie Darko"" have I pondered about a movie so much after watching it, the Coens put so much into this movie its imposable to pick everything up. <br/><br/>So though you may not understand what happened or like what happened for that matter it could not have been made any better than it was. Like the movie or not there's no denying that it was made with the highest level of skill."
"ernesty","10","4","8","7 January 2008"," one of the great movies
","One of the great movies, a profound movie--a Buddhist/Taoist movie. The ending is entirely appropriate, for this is not an action movie. The movie is about death--death as the overwhelming fact of life, so that any life is basically a meaningless failure. Faced with the overwhelming fact of death, all of us humans--especially the characters in this movie--find meaning only by making up their own spiritual codes, their Tao, their Way. The murderer's code, the good old boy's code, the sheriff's code, the wife's code--they are all equally meaningless, equally inadequate in the face of death, but they are all perfectly legitimate responses to the fact of universal death. (In the world of the movie they are perfectly legitimate responses--i, for one, would like to believe that in the real world it's better not to make up a murderer's code.) Given this world view, if redemption is possible, the movie makes clear that it could come in two forms: 1.) The made-up codes come into conflict, and those conflicts arouse interest, they have entertainment value. 2.) Helpless in the face of death, all people have a natural recourse available to them if they choose to take it--to take pity on, to nurture and care for their own even more helpless young; hence the parental theme in the movie, the father-son theme that is most prominent at the very end.<br/><br/>The movie is beautiful in execution, in every respect--in acting, in film editing, in camera work, in script. I've seen it twice and hope to see it again."
"Monotreme02","10","4","8","4 January 2008"," A masterpiece if I've ever seen one; the Coens are back in form, their best film yet
","The film represents a downright uncanny application of cinematic craft on the Coen's part. They deliver storytelling in its most flawless, raw, visceral form, and indeed the film has quite the incredible story to tell, based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy (which I have intentionally put off reading in order to enjoy the film to the fullest, although I fully intend to seek it out now  by the way, if anybody hasn't read McCarthy's Pulitzer-Prize winning novel ""The Road"", do so now). But the Coens have long before transcended telling a mere plot. The film provides its best storytelling when there is no dialogue. Notice with what utter grace and absolute perfection the Coens create tension and drama. From the first moment he appears on screen, we are scared petrified of the Anton Chigurh character, and the Coens have calculated the introduction of his appearance and mannerisms so that every time he merely walks onto the screen, we get chills down our spine. Behold probably the most amazingly directed sequence of any film this year, which involves Llewelyn Moss sitting in his motel room and hearing what are clearly Chigurh's footsteps coming down the hall, until his shadow appears under the crack of the door. But if only that were all  Chigurh continues to turn off the light, drenching the scene in pitch-darkness. No other scene in any other film this year has more effortlessly created tension and true, primal fear within me as a viewer. And the scene continues, as Llewelyn apprehends a vehicle, immediately after which the windshield begins to shatter from Chigurh's shots that are being fired from who knows where, which further elevates the pressure. One of the scariest scenes in any film this year cannot be found in The Mist, or in 1408, or in any of the shock-horror pictures put out, but rather can be found right near the beginning of No Country, as the Chigurh character enters a small gas station shop and manages, without doing much at all besides playing an almost-too-calm word game with the teller, to obstinately petrify and terrorize us. I don't think a screen character has ever been depicted as more nervous than that of the store clerk in the scene in question. It is precisely these characters, such as that of the store clerk or the overweight landlady at the trailer park, that make this film so unmistakably Coen. Their mannerisms and way of talking, while not meant to be comic, are presented in an almost comic fashion. It is that unique Coen sense of humour, in which they turn the nerve-racking edginess and anxiety in the gas station scene with Chigurh into a comic moment. The Coens have an uncanny ability to create comedy simply out of the absurdity of the situation. Not a word is wasted, and every strand of dialogue, every line and passage, is absolutely and entirely pitch-perfect; it is an incredible, extraordinary screenplay.<br/><br/>The Coens had previously reached a creative peak with Fargo, but No Country for Old Men serves as a new high for the directorial duo, and if Michelangelo can have both the Sistine Chapel and his statue of David, then surely the Coens are entitled to their two masterpieces; the classic Fargo and the modern No Country. The pieces can be further viewed as companions due to their striking similarities in terms of themes, setting and visuals; both featuring stark, horizon-reaching landscapes, regular-guy characters who get mixed up with the very wrong people, and police officers as the moral cores of the film and ultimately the central subject matter. But if Fargo delivered a more uplifting moral closure with the story of Marge Gunderson, No Country for Old Men is far more pessimistic, delivering a scathing life lesson in the depressing closure to Ed Tom Bell's tale. As in all of their films, No Country also features that very specifically Coen brothers sense of humour, which can turn even a dark and menacing dramatic thriller into a comedy by playing off the ridiculousness of the characters and the situations they get themselves into. The film also serves as a stunning, remarkable application of cinematic craft, featuring absolutely stupefying direction, cinematography, editing, production value and everything in between. Working from an utterly brilliant screenplay from the Coens, the actors deliver unnerving, compelling, show-stealing performances, in particular Tommy Lee Jones as the scarred old timer for whom this violent country is certainly no place; Josh Brolin in a brilliant lead-role debut as the naive average Joe who gets mixed in way over his head with unstoppable forces of nature; and Javier Bardem, as the ruthless, terrifying, primeval villain and embodiment of pure evil. It is a striking, epic, complex, many-leveled work of seething bleakness and stunning desolation, delivering an all-around depressing moral and human outcome. It is a movie that lives and breathes through its fascinating characters, its visceral settings, its striking visuals. It is the best film of the year, and an astounding, incredible cinematic achievement on all possible planes. The Coens have truly outdone themselves and have finally sealed their spot as one of if not the most important modern-day cinematic auteurs.

How is this so different from A Simple Plan, or Shallow Grave, to name just two? This really wasn't anything new. <br/><br/>But it keeps being talked about as one of the year's best by all the critics. To be a great film, at least for me, it has to say something new or or say it so much better than it has been said before. I don't think this reaches that level. <br/><br/>Maybe people have lost their sense of imagination and are happy to see the same thing over and over again. Not I.<br/><br/>So I'm giving it a 5."

","I loved Fargo. It's on my own, personal Top 10. So I was very interested in No Country.<br/><br/>The film starts out really promising. Local hick (Josh Brolin) stumbles upon the bloody remnants of a drug turf war, and slinks away with a satchel of cash. Creepy hit man (Javier Bardem) hops on his trail. Long-in-the-tooth sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) tries to head them off before carnage ensues.<br/><br/>For about the first half, the film has great promise. Some of the sneak, counter-sneak scenes between Brolin & Bardem (like the give-and-take around the cheap motel) are suspenseful and tense. The Coen brothers start to build intrigue upon intrigue within the drug gangs themselves, leading to some real promising encounters at the end of the film.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the Coens let this film fall apart. For some reason, they take the focus off the criminal suspense and on to Jones' Sad Sack character. All we end up hearing is his moaning about how ""it's so hard to be a sheriff these days"". They then let the interesting hit man plot die abruptly, suck all the energy out of the film, and it dies a quiet death. I actually fell asleep during the last ten minutes or so waking up during the closing credits.<br/><br/>The Coens really lost their way on this one. It almost looks like they got bored with the film and wanted to wrap it up quickly or something. Why they drone on about retirement, I don't know.<br/><br/>All in all, a poor attempt from otherwise capable filmmakers. 4 out of 10."

","First of all, I do have to say that the actors were cast really well. Second of all, it was an entertaining story. However, the reason I only give it one star is this is a movie of convenience. Either there wasn't enough time to tell the whole story, or the writers just didn't know what to do so they just don't explain some important points in the movie.<br/><br/>It sure is convenient that the Mexicans show up at the murder scene right after Llewelyn.<br/><br/>Next it sure is convenient that Anton finds Llewelyn the second time. I get it, he has a transponder in the money case. But from what I saw the first time it didn't have that big of a range. Llewelyn seems to crash in a hotel in a pretty big city. It just seems too convenient that he finds him the second time.<br/><br/>Next it sure is convenient that Carson Wells finds Llewelyn. Apparently he has super-powers, because that is all that we are given about how he is able to find him. All he says is that it just took him three hours. Well how exactly did he do it???<br/><br/>And then how convenient is it that Anton finds Carson? Again, I just have to assume he has super-powers. The transponder is gone by this point.<br/><br/>Lastly, it sure is convenient that Llewelyn is stupid enough to not check for a transponder with the money. Of course if he did, there would be no movie."

","I had no idea just how dark this film would be. I knew that the Coen Brothers could do dark, but nothing quite like this. But perhaps what separates this film from so many of their other great films, is how detailed and symbolic this movie is from start to finish. Every scene has a symbolic message. trust me, you will be thinking about this film for sometime after you leave the theater. Everybody saw the Bardem character in the ads, including his Prince Valiant haircut and odd weapon of choice, and were drawn to the film. Well, Bardem does not disappoint, he is incredible. Bardem's character is a principled killer with a code. Yes, he is insane, but he has rules he lives by and this is what keeps him going in an otherwise cruel and pointless world. He detests those that refuse to take life by the horns and instead settle for what is in store for them. To Bardem's character, everything is for a reason, because if it is not, what is the point. The good guys in the film are perhaps not as structured as Bardem, or are they as goal oriented. Brolin is incredible as a good ol' boy who has no idea what he has stepped into. Jones is his incredible self, playing an aging Sheriff that has hoped that God would have revealed himself to him already, but sadly, has not. He has trouble grasping the changes that he is seeing as he approaches retirement. You spend your whole life trying to create a sane and civilized society, and then you see, things are worse off than when you started. Jones has a terrific quote when he is talking to another aging Sheriff that is dumbfounded by this new generation, Jones says that ""when you stop hearing Sir and Mam and the end of sentences, trouble cannot be far behind."" Well, trouble is coming, and the times are changing, for the worse, and nothing gets better, and this is not a country for old men."

"gologo112","1","5","11","16 January 2009"," Greatly overrated
","I had so big expectations about ""No country for old men"" but having watched it, I was greatly disappointed. At first glance it seems that the movie has a lot to say and you can learn a lot from it, the acting was good and the story was kinda interesting but that's all. Actually the movie is just rather pretentious and it feels cheep and unfinished and full of pseudo truths about life.<br/><br/>So what do we have here? A psycho serial killer with state-of-the art principles teaches us the philosophy of life and how and why we should make our choices.If some people really think that this moron said a single item of useful information or wisdom, or that there is something in his deeds worth remembering, then they need a doctor. Of course such characters (deranged murderers with bright ideas or deeds) exist but you won't meet them in this movie. <br/><br/>SPOILERS: The sheriff's character was catastrophically developed (if such a verb can be used here) - he looked like living in a fifth dimension due to smoking too much pot, his police work was less than nothing, he looked and acted more like a weird preacher than a cop, and I was about to fall asleep every time he started his long conversations. Another philosopher - so we got two of them: a psycho and a melancholic cop. Many things and events are quite naive and defeat any logic like why did Josh Brolin get back to the wounded man after so many hours in the first place? He didn't expect to find him still alive, did he? And the way he understood that he was followed by just one man seems a little bit ""magical"" to me. Not to mention him staying in front of the motel room wooden door without taking any cover. The cops couldn't figure that the man on the road wasn't killed with a gun-firing device? Well, I'm not an expert but this sounds ridiculous to me. And many other details also made the movie far from realistic. Oh, yes, the bad guy got away, wounded but enjoying the help of two kids. How sweet, original and thoughtful !!! To cut the long story short, I was happy when this movie finally came to an end, because I know I won't watch it again. It left nothing in me worth remembering."
"theycallmemrglass","4","5","11","17 September 2008"," Criminally unsatisfying
","The thing is, I get what this film is saying. I get the message. I can read the expressions on Tommy Lee Jones increasingly craggy face. I get that he looks lost. I get that a Josh Brolin who finds a million pounds which belongs to gangsters is playing with fire as he tries to run with it which most of the film dwells on. I get that the contractor pursuing him is a psycho with twisted principles. The film has brilliantly executed moments of tension. The acting is delightfully subtle and passive except for, justifiably, Javier, who plays the psychotic pursuer with such frightening menace that whenever he appears on screen, you will shiver with dread at what he will do next. So why am I giving this 4/10? Simple. The ending was unsatisfying. I get the message of the film. Fine. I value a good ending to a story. If an ending does not satisfy me, morally, I take away a couple of marks. If an ending is too pretentious, I take away even more marks. If you are not fussed with endings, then you will enjoy the film. However, I do not understand why this is rated as Oscar worthy (regardless of what I think of the ending). Its technically accomplished but ultimately shallow save for some great moments of tension. But for a Coen Brothers film this is a major disappointment."
"bray_rules","1","5","11","7 June 2008"," Its probably worth watching, but terribly anticlimactic
","I live on a small island. The local cinema screens one movie a week. Last week it was There Will Be Blood. After the open ending, half the audience was upset and deemed the movie 'bad'. This week it was No Country For Old Men. And this time, the audience actually booed. That's saying a lot for a place where cinema is a luxury.<br/><br/>There's not much I can add, or say better than anyone else who has written negative reviews for this movie. I'm not giving this movie a bad review simply because I don't like the Coen brothers (as some appear to have), and nor do I blame them specifically for the plot, since it is apparently remarkably faithful to the novel. However, the story was frustrating, a lot of what little dialog there was was pointless, and the ending made me even angrier than the conclusion of There Will Be Blood.<br/><br/>That said, the first half of the movie - where the majority of the suspense lay - was quite enjoyable. The vast arid landscapes were stunning and the initial suspense was genuinely masterful. Unfortunately, beyond the first half, what little suspense was left became formulaic, the beautiful desert vistas gave way to suburbia and the plot holes became ever larger. Some liken this movie to Donnie Darko and Eternal Sunshine On A Spotless Mind, saying you need to watch it several times to get its full value. Personally, I don't think I'd be able to watch it a second time.<br/><br/>But I guess that my biggest gripe lies with the so-call critics. All the official reviews I've come across paint this movie as something brilliant that simply MUST be seen. Yet countless online reviews tell of people storming out of the cinemas, and my own experience has proved (to me at least) the same thing: what may be a wet dream to enlightened cinema critics is not necessarily something that an ordinary audience will find entertaining.<br/><br/>My verdict: proceed with caution. It may be worth watching, but don't expect anything in the way of plot resolution, or any satisfaction in the conclusion."

","No Country for Old Men (2007) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>A hunter (Josh Brolin) comes across a group of trucks with dead bodies everywhere and discovers $2 million in cash, which he takes. Soon a psychotic killer (Javier Bardem) is after him while a local sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) tries to figure out what's going on. I'll start off by saying that I'm not a big fan of the Coen brothers. With that out of the way, this is certainly the best movie I've seen from them but it goes downhill very quickly in the final thirty-minutes, which are quite horrid to be honest. However, everything before that is masterfully done with a beautiful craft that makes this familiar story come off very original, dark and at times funny. I really enjoyed the slow pace that the film carries but I'm not sure if that's how I should describe it. The movie has plenty of graphic violence and action and what makes it so shocking is that it usually comes out of no where or happens when you don't expect it. The pace of the film is slow but this helps when the violence breaks out. The performances are all terrific with Bardem stealing the show as the psychotic killer. Whenever he's on screen you can't take your eyes off of him and his silent performance speaks more than any words could. I was also very impressed with Brolin who I'm usually hit and miss on. Woody Harrelson has a few nice scenes and Tommy Lee Jones is the old Tommy Lee Jones we all love. The film was a lot of fun until the conclusion, which I thought was quite awful."

What?! I'm no idiot, i figured out the story, but why not show it? Honestly, i expected that they would at least show the scene at the motel at the end where he's killed! How can people think this movie is so good when so much is left out that should have been in and so much bull**** is added to waste your time and divert your attention from the fact that this is either lazy or plain bad film making. i hate this movie. i give this a 4 on the basis that it had my attention for the whole movie making me think that something was actually going to happen that would be worth my time to watch and that there would be a visual and audio resolution to the story. wow."

","I'm an enormous fan of Blood Simple and not much else from the Coens. I consider The Big Lebowski, and The Ladykillers two of the dumbest films ever made. This movie is much better than the Coen's last 8 genre ripoffs. Its structure is very forthright; it's a pleasure to watch the Coens make plot points and connections with something other than dialog; you have to pay attention (but really not even that much) to understand/anticipate the motivation of the next scene. Even respected directors (Scorcese) have become dependent on actors explaining things to make plot points; and been filming talky scripts with little invention. It's just better when it's done in a filmic manner. The wordless connections here reminded me of the silent sequences where plot develops in Antonioni's Blowup.<br/><br/>The real problem with the movie begins about the time Jones who has been an internalized man of few words for the whole movie, meets up with his brother and suddenly becomes effusive. Everything that was underplayed, or in the subtext, becomes hideously direct and clumsy. Jones had already been heading for a best actor nom, but the Coens apparently wanted to give him a hammy scene or two to pump the Oscar-consideration process, in the media hype that leads up to that free-for-all. These scenes are leaden.<br/><br/>It's generally very economical. All the questions I wondered about were answered with a little thought except one; How the hell do Jones and Bardem not encounter each other in the hotel room? Also the title is so dumb it almost prevented me from seeing it; telegraphing the theme, the ending, the final score, etc. I can imagine about a thousand better titles. And changing it from the book may have grated them the freedom to scrap some bookish scenes. You could toss everything away that occurs after Bardem exits the family household and looks at his boots. In these places it begins to look like their meandering, pointless Man who Wasn't There. It has about 4 endings too many.<br/><br/>I've recently revised this review downward after a suitable amount of time has passed. I am utterly neutral (no interest) about seeing this movie a 2nd time, so it failed there for me. It also doesn't make me contemplate a thing, not even film technique."

I am 27 years old and could not sleep that night without a night light simply because the single thing in a movie that will scare me the most is if it makes no sense. This movie tries to pass itself off as making sense by throwing in pseudo-intellectual nonsequitors, but fails miserably as no certain message sticks as the ""main"" message of the movie.<br/><br/>I basically believe this movie to be bad because it failed to communicate anything to me.

When I say this, I don't mean that the acting started sucking or the budget was cut. THIS is what I mean. You know that guy that accidentally found that case of money? That guy we were rooting for the whole time? That guy that we all just sat down for two straight hours to watch fight the odds of survival and use quick thinking and strategy to avoid the bad guys and get his wife safely out of harm's way? Yeah, he died. Oh, and his wife died too. Yeah and maybe I'm not appreciating it for what it is. Maybe I'm not seeing the bigger picture. But they didn't even have AUDACITY to kill them on camera! That's right. They didn't die trying to defend themselves in one last final fight for the right to live. They got killed off camera like background characters that nobody cared for. Only we DID. Do you think I spent two hours watching this guy beat the odds just so the cameras could cut to something else for a while and then cut back to his dead body for less than 5 seconds and then never even show THAT again? Imagine Stranger Things being canceled midway through a season. Imagine someone dangling a big juicy steak in front of your face and then setting it on fire until nothing remained but ashes. That's what it felt like. And here's the thing about the wife. We don't even see a body. Hell, we don't even hear a gunshot. It's only implied that she's dead. Oh and here's one last pointless detail. At the very end of the movie when the bad guy's driving away, somebody slams into him. No, this wasn't karma coming to claim what was obviously rightfully his. This was the writer saying ""This ending is too boring, we need to spice things up a bit with a random crash scene that doesn't add to the plot whatsoever."" And if you feel like refuting that, listen to this. The bad guy doesn't die. He's only injured, and the scene ends with him walking off with a broken arm held in a shirt that's really not gonna do much for him. What did that do? RIP arm? I guess now at least he won't be able to carry that big ol' air tank thing for a while.<br/><br/>I'm guessing you already watched the movie and are just here to see why I hate it so much.

The opening twenty minutes or so, in which Brolin, who is out hunting antelopes (?) and discovers the crime scene, are simply mesmerizing. Bardem's relentless chase to find and kill Brolin and recover the money is what the film primarily focuses on, and it brings out both his and Brolin's characters, which are both fantastically well- acted.

","For going on four decades, the Coen Brothers have produced films which lie slightly outside mainstream American films. Their offerings are more akin to the lower-budget film noir of the 1930s' to 1950's than the higher-budget franchise films financed by the larger corporations. Coen Brothers' trademarks include amoral, immoral and fringe-of-society characters, less-than-ideal settings, moody atmosphere, and of course violence. You could never imagine someone like Steven Spielberg directing any of the subjects chosen by the Coen Brothers. For many years, their films were generally dismissed by the Hollywood mainstream establishment as being low budget fair only for shock value, until they made ""Fargo"" whose female lead won the Academy Award for Best Actress. Ten years later, they made their modern noir masterpiece: ""No Country for Old Men"" based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy.<br/><br/>The artistic fusion of a Cormac McCarthy novel with the filmmaking of the Coen Brothers was a perfect match. McCarthy is an unconventional novelist whose books simultaneously straddle and challenge conventional genre fiction and high literature. Like the Coen Brothers, McCarthy subjects are not for the feint-of-heart: drug rings, the slaughter of Native Americans, and other un-Disney-type subjects. ""No Country for Old Men"" may be McCarthy's best use of genre fiction conventions in a literary novel. Since the Coen Brothers style is similar to McCarthy, both adhering to and breaking genre conventions, the natural pairing of these parties almost seems a bit late! However, the novel was published in 2005, and the film was released in 2007. No question, this was the perfect novel for the Coen's to produce.<br/><br/>""No Country for Old Men"" is a combination modern western, film noir, and suspense thriller. The story unfolds rather non-linearly. Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) decides to do some game hunting in an isolated area of West Texas. While pursuing pronghorn (a kind of deer-like animal), he happens upon the remains of a massacre. Dead bodies and debris are everywhere. Like a detective, he examines the remains, the cars, the bullet-holes, and the debris. This was some kind of illegal drug transaction gone awry. He also finds a Mexican dying of thirst and wounds in a pick-up truck and a case full of millions in cash. He returns that night only to find the Mexican dead and some out-for-blood baddies after him. They seem to know he took the money.<br/><br/>After a long chase, he finally returns home. But soon he realizes he's being stalked by perhaps the most ruthless and monstrous baddie in film history: Anton Chigurh, played with understated menace by Javier Bardem in an Academy Award-winning performance. Chigurh makes the likes of the Joker, Darth Vader and Hannibal Lecter seem closer to cultured gentlemen. What makes Chigurh and his performance by Bardem so simultaneously compelling and terrifying is his calculated coolness. He even politely asks his victims to do seeming mundane things in order to do them in. Occasionally he offers his victims a 50-50 chance of surviving with the toss of a coin. Sometimes they live, more often they die. The film becomes a terrifying cat-and-mouse game, where Chigurh is more like a serial killer cat and Moss is a mouse with millions of dollars but not the know-how to evade Chigurh. Investigating the case is Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) who finds bits and pieces of the puzzle, trying desperately to put it all together.<br/><br/>A masterpiece of modern film noir but definitely not for all tastes. In true Coen Brothers/McCarthy style, nothing is as it seems. Just when you believe all may be right with the world, the story throws a curve, and you're on another cinematic wild goose chase. You can tell the story is moving to a cataclysmic end."

","I'll do my best to explain why I think the movie was 'perfect' without any spoilers.<br/><br/>Given the nature of each person and their back story, (you can only get their back stories when they mention very quick and subtle details amidst the chaos) the actors play each role in a ridiculously amazing way. The characters you see and learn about act and react exactly as their character types would given their circumstances. <br/><br/>This movie allows you to feel both anger and sympathy for every single person for almost any choice they make.<br/><br/>The movie will play games with your head, and you won't even realize what has happened until the scene is long over.<br/><br/>A movie I watched twice and then deleted the download.

"powermandan","10","2","3","27 November 2014"," A Little Overrated, But Still Awesome.
","I just want to say that Fargo is Joel and Ethan's best. No Country For Old Men does not even come close to it. All that say this is 2007's best, I might agree with. I actually thought that there wasn't many great flicks that came out that year. This would not have been so well-received if it came out ten years earlier. However, I did like this lots. The Coen brothers never let me down. Like the other movies they've done, No Country For Old Men features cool characters, intriguing dialogue, and loads of suspense. This follows a redneck (Brolin) who finds a suitcase of money from a drug deal gone wrong. He is followed by a nutcase (Bardem) that escapes from prison and is after the money. A sheriff (Jones) may be the only one that can bring peace to the bloodshed that soon happens. As I said earlier, all characters are awesome. Bardem is probably the best one as he plays a stone-cold killer that is as evil as can be. Brolin is the character that everybody roots for and Jones plays a great sheriff with a troubled past. The first little bit contains very little dialogue. Little dialogue during a cat-and-mouse game adds lots of suspense. You are interested with what diabolical move Bardem is going to do and how Brolin will keep the money. How can characters be developed well with little dialogue? Watch and see. Eventually, more dialogue does come in, along with more of Jones, while still trying to stay the same noir-western style as earlier. Nothing is wrong with that, it just needs to be as clever as before, if not more. The movie is still exciting and fun, but it eventually just gets stale as the plot slows down, so the suspense decreases. The movie changes from a thriller to a drama. If a movie is a thriller, keep it a thriller, but add drama to it. Or is a movie is a drama, make it an exciting one. I didn't mind the Coen brother changing the genre the way they did, I just thought the movie lost something when it happened.<br/><br/>4/4"

","I don't give a damn whether the Coens did this flick or somebody else. <br/><br/>For me, all that matters is: does it work? And hell yes, it does. <br/><br/>The story is gripping and grim, thrilling from the very beginning. Brilliantly written dialogs and amazing cinematography. But what this really is about is the triangle Brolin/Bardem/Jones, who interact perfectly without ever(!) encounter face-to-face.<br/><br/>Above all, Bardem delivers the best performance of a serial killer I've seen in donkey's years. His Character stays entirely mystical throughout the movie. In one scene, someone says he resembles an impalpable ""ghost"", which, wherever it looms, makes your blood run cold. <br/><br/>Otherwise he appeared to be a man who seems utterly on edge, frustrated and latently bored to death of the narrowness and stupidity of human race. He condones them as a cursed malady of mother nature, but he gives a f*** to kill them when they haphazardly cross his route. But he has his ways with the ""zombies"" when he makes them call the coin. No more said.<br/><br/>Brolin and Jones are absolutely brilliant in portraying their characters too, no offense. But Bardem clearly is the big player. <br/><br/>This bloody tale of three extreme different characters and what drives them to to do what they do makes this one of the best movies I've ever seen.<br/><br/>10 stars"

","For No Country For Old Men is one of the films that have been talking about. It seems to be an action movie, but at the end the audience would get what is the message that the creators wanted to convey through the movie. Every elements of the film are pure perfection and sticking in my memory. Especially the chased scene, the director can control my emotion obviously. On the other hand, the director of photography can captures the violence scene to be a hurt but beautiful one. The way that narrative is 'not told' left to the imagination and giving not a happy ending are such a perfection for me. The story talks about Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), he finds two million dollars in the pocket at the midst of the desert, he takes it back into the house and his life is then changed. The skilled man named Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), he gives the show that is not only for wanting the Oscar reward, but also plays it as the important role that earned him a reputation for a long time in the character of crazy murderer. He opens himself to make people recognize in a scene of killing a police officer, shot through the forehead. That is what I like about the presentation of the exotic or has not been made. Then he plays a coin toss with his principle declaration that he holds, which is linked to the character. His duty is to hunt Moss and take the money back. Even the main story of Moss and Chigurh are the most important roles that serve to movie but there's still having another character, Late sixties Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee. Jones). He does not want to be involved for this issue. He must stand between struggling to maintain the honor of the family Sheriff that hold for three generations or accept that his own era ended while the era that runs and he can not catch it up."

"blakelogsdon1","9","2","3","3 September 2014"," We Should Make a Country for the Elderly
","The film No Country for Old Men had been on my watchlist for a long,long time. I had been on a Coen brothers movies binge for the past few days, and I had already seen Fargo, Barton Fink, and Burn After Reading. The Coen brothers have a signature witty style that continues in this film. This movie was great,and it treats the audience intelligently, which is something that is rare to experience in most modern movies. Javier Bardem plays an intimidating villain that will give you chills with every scene. My favorite film by this pair of movie makers is still Barton Fink, but this film was a close second for me.<br/><br/>The topic I would like to talk about today, though, is an idea that the title of this movie gave me. It is true that there is no country for old men. This is a young man's world. There is no room for the elderly of today, man or woman. Yeah that's right, women. You thought you were getting out of this one, but you know what I say to that? ""No way, José."" This idea isn't gender specific. <br/><br/>Okay, so my thought is that since there is no country for the elderly, we should create one! We need to designate a plot of land and send all of the old people to it. Don't worry. We'll fill it with bingo parlors,bowling alleys, and craft shops. It will be totally humane. They will be free to roam the land and graze where they please. We can also create life-like mannequins that look like young people for the elderly to bore with their talk of the good ol' days. They'll never notice with their vision in the bad condition that it's in.<br/><br/>And I already know a place that we can put them. I say we clear out Australia and put them there. Australians need to get back in touch with the world anyway. I mean, c'mon, it's time for you guys to get into some wars.<br/><br/>We'll put the old people on this island continent and keep them there so they can't hold back our emerging generation and bother us. We can occasionally send PBS down there to interview them, so we can stay educated on history and all that bologna. And they'll love the chance to get attention again after years of being ignored and never called by their relatives.<br/><br/>I don't want to hear crap like ""No! We love Grandma, and we don't want her to leave us!"". This is for the greater good. Get with the program. If you aren't with me, then by definition you are against me. And you don't want to be against me. Ask my date to the junior prom. If you want, you can send her a laptop, and you two can skype each other if she can figure out how to use the dagnabbed robot contraption.<br/><br/>To conclude, I would highly suggest seeing this witty, intelligent, and intense film, and if you like my idea to create an all-youth international society, call your local representative. Thank you.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Fellow IMDb user blakelogsdon1"

","With its fatalistic resonance, the quote, used by the Coen brothers in ""Raising Arizona"" and borrowed from ""The Night of the Hunter"" could almost work as a subtitle for ""No Country for Old Men""<br/><br/>And any critic toward 2007' Best Picture Winner, is irremediably confronted to that opening ""No"" summarizing everything the film stands for: nothing. The Coens brothers made fun of nihilists in ""The Big Lebowsky"" gave the word an entire new dimension here, thrilling like a dream and haunting like a nightmare. Indeed, in this film, it's not the night, but the ""Nightmare of the Hunter"".<br/><br/>But I'll be honest, I didn't get it the first time I saw it, but I give myself the benefit of the doubt since I was 25 at that time, and I think I was intelligent enough to grasp the film's concept. And indeed, I saw it again yesterday, 5 days before my 32nd birthday, and I didn't get it more than the first time; except that I started looking at the so-called flaws with more comprehensive eyes<br/><br/>I remembered the words I choose to title my review of ""Shane"", an old-fashioned and traditional Western classic, ""the unseen and the unspoken elevate it to its iconic status"". This description also works for ""No Country for Old Men"", except that the unseen is what divided opinions the most, it's for what we didn't see that some believed this movie had more a lot to say than what its first acts presented, but it's also why the rest felt betrayed and dismissed it as a pretentious attempt of making art for the sake of it.<br/><br/>But let's get back to the film. There are three men that fate reunited (although they'll never meet), each one is in one side of what we, humble mortals, call morality. There's Sheriff Bell, played by Tommy Lee Jones, an old timer contemplating the degeneration of humanity through the peaks of barbarity crimes had reached. But we can't be fooled, surely he belongs to a time where lynching, rapes and horrific crimes prevailed, he's not too old but too good and goodness and strength don't form quite an efficient pair.<br/><br/>On the other side, there's the one who elevated the film to its iconic status, Anton Chigurh (Oscar-winning Javier Bardem) the most impacting movie villain since Hannibal Lecter. He's dark, tall, looking even bigger thanks to a meticulous camera work, has a deep authoritative voice and an ominous aura above his shoulder, like a real-life Darth Vader. He would indeed look like Darth Vader from behind with his weird haircut. And there's his inseparable oxygen tank hiding under an everyday banality, a spectacularly deadly weapon. Anyway, in vileness department, Anton means business. <br/><br/>And in the course of his morbid odyssey, he'll meet friendly people from the American side of Rio Grande, and many of them will pay the biggest price to their encounter, a price that can be worth a quarter sometimes. Anton reminded me of a story about a king who was so cruel that when he surprised one of his slaves mocking him in public, he then told him the worse punishment had to come. What did he do? Nothing, and that was even worse, because the poor man died out of fearful stress. This is what we, what the poor gas station attendant understand, life can hang on nothing, a simple call, a coin, two millions, whatever.<br/><br/>Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin) is a hunter who found two million dollars in the middle of the desert, only trophy from a drug deal that left many Mexican cadavers and a dog rotting in the desert, the crime scene is magnificently rendered by Roger Deakins' cinematography, like a still-life painting. There's still life indeed, Moss takes the money and run, but out of principles, gets back to the crime scene to give some poor man's water. Wrong move, he puts himself on the track and worse, gets Chigurh on his footsteps. Moss is in the crossroads, bad enough to steal and endanger his sweet and caring wife Carla Jean (Kelly MacDonald) but good enough to care. You know at that time that either him or Anton will survive.<br/><br/>We have a sadistic killer, whose use of violence is random, remorseless and even more chilling when you try to give it a meaning. Then, you have a fatalistic journey where despite all of Moss' efforts, you feel like there's no way he'll get through it, because there's a movement incarnated by Chiugurh' slow walk in the middle of a motel, from nowhere to someone, this is the Great Reaper coming, you can't escape from it, you can only postpone the delay. And there's the main protagonist, a defeatist sheriff who can't face the facts that he's not cut for the job anymore, and spends most of his time desperately static, the's the nihilistic, he's the ""No"" in the title. He's the main character, the key of the story.<br/><br/>That might explain the narrative liberties the Coens took  both Moss and Chigurh are neatly drawn characters, they're mysterious but not their motives, and the movie's intelligence shall rise above obviousness. Bell, in his last courageous attempt to listen to Carla Jean's pleas, to save Moss and get Anton, comes too late, he didn't see what happened, neither did we. Why insisting on so many details, so many on-screen deaths, why making Woody Harrelson introduced as a bad-ass bounty hunter and killed as mercilessly as you stamp on a cockroach?<br/><br/>Because it's the unseen that best expresses life's futility, things either guided by God or the devil's hand, and there's no guarantee that goodness will be rewarded and that's what scares the most. The film has style, yes, but it's not about being deep, depth is nothing when nothingness can be deeper<br/><br/>So, don't blame the Coens brothers for what you didn't see, blame Sheriff Bell."

There are so many themes and philosophy to interpret that you couldn't even notice a half of them during the first time of watching. Personally I'm watching this piece the 3rd time and still finding a lot of new ideas to contemplate, that's the aspect i like the most in this movie.<br/><br/>Worth to mention that this masterful work couldn't be done without perfectly developed characters and flawless dialogs.

","Joel and Ethan Coen's No Country for Old Men is kind of similar to a film that was directed by Quentin Tarantino but more thrilling. The movie tells the story about a hunter named Llewelyn Moss (played by Josh Brolin) who steps in the middle of a gone wrong drug deal and more than $2,000,000 in cash near the Rio Grande. The reason why I consider this to be similar to Tarantino's movies is because of the gory violence that goes on in this movie by Javier Bardem's character Anton Chigurh. also there was a special somebody who had an important part of this movie and that is the main character Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (played by Tommy Lee Jones) the man who investigates this whole thing. Throughout this movie there were a lot of great performances from Jones, Bardem, Brolin, and especially Woody Harrelson as one of Llewelyn's friends. This was a great movie to begin with and also the best movie of 2007."
"barryrd","9","2","3","6 June 2014"," Dark Masterpiece
","Joel and Ethan Coen have made something of a dark masterpiece in this movie, shot in the American southwest with desert landscapes and one-on-one encounters that are grim, chilling and sometimes strangely amusing. The time is 1978 and two of the characters are Vietnam veterans. The acting is outstanding, particularly Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones. Woody Harrelson is a droll and cynical investigator in a supporting role. The directors use pauses, muted soundtracks, silent gunshots and chase scenes, often shot in darkness inside and out. Tommy Lee Jones, the sheriff, is the most stable character and the man most aware of his own faults and the evils he sees in the world. Times are changing with crime more widespread and he takes solace in the past. Kelly MacDonald is outstanding as the wife of Josh Brolin. A downbeat but utterly fascinating movie, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen."
"Mr-Fusion","7","2","3","17 April 2014"," Makes an indelible mark. Not to be soon forgotten.
","It doesn't tend to come up when I think of crime movies, but ""No Country for Old Men"" is a great one. It's got that slow and methodical predator-stalking-his-prey tempo, and the movie's populated with some great characters. Anton Chigurh is surely one of the creepiest bad guys I've ever laid eyes on (the cattle gun is novel, and the sound of that shotgun!); Bardem ratchets the creepiness of that guy to unbelievable heights. Conversely, Brolin's outlaw has got to be one of the dumbest. He proves himself a wily criminal, but drug money always has someone coming for it. Not bright.<br/><br/>But even in a movie full of well-drawn characters, Tommy Lee Jones is still the highlight for me. He vividly brings to life the sardonic world-weary lawman and I found myself looking forward to his next scene and hearing his dialogue. Dude's just got that gift. Harrelson's equally gifted here. <br/><br/>But I was also floored on a technical level. There's great atmosphere; those arid deserts are not a place I want to find myself lost in (that howling wind is its own brand of unnerving). But just how much of this movie played out with no score. The sound design here is amazing; more often than not, it's just he background noise of a ticking clock, beeping transponder or footsteps providing us with any sound at all. It's haunting, really.<br/><br/>7/10"
"willcundallreview","8","2","3","15 April 2014"," A fine and excellent thriller
","Rating-8/10<br/><br/>No Country for Old Men is a film which manages to mix Drama, Crime and Thrilling moments to create a film with no boundaries and is not afraid to be slow and cautious to be good drama. Yet another film created by a brotherly duo who it is safe to say are some of the best around in the film industry Directing and Writing wise and never seem to make films that are not at the very least good films. I personally felt that this film was firmly an excellent film and here below is why.<br/><br/>The story is as I say slow but with it's plot slowly seeping through to us the viewer, we are left with a thrilling film that can put us on the edge of our seats but at the same time leave us feeling something different for each and every character. With this movie you also get the scary personality of the basic villain but with no main character either it leaves us thinking who in the end won the game in this movie, and who lost, I think to be fair, that is for you to decide because no clear indications are ever given.<br/><br/>The real star of this is of course Javier Bardem who's hauntingly brilliant portrayal of hit man Chigurgh is both well acted and well written in, and with even his hair style making him seem more evil, Bardem controls all aspects of this film. Josh Brolin as the character we could possibly consider the main character does a good job and seems courageous but slightly scared in this dark role Brolin takes on. The rest of the follow up cast such as Tommy Lee Jones do a good job and Jones in particular although I would have like to have seen more of him, he manages to create a man who just understands all to well about human nature.<br/><br/>The Coen Brothers are of the course the main men behind this excellent production and direct and write this as well if the best they have ever done in there movie career. With a script that delves right into the heart of the characters, I felt that was one of the biggest positivity's in this film and created a film you couldn't not listen too. Even when the film gets slow the Brothers somehow manage to make this entertaining and bring to the party all there skills they have learnt previously in film, with a dabble of even comedy in certain parts which make the films characters almost insane.<br/><br/>I felt although very little criticism should be aimed at this, the film never reaches the heights of being superb or anywhere near sublime as the story is a good one but I did feel it wasn't that smart and the Coen Brothers can make stories much more complex than this. The film is at parts very slow and with so much dialogue used at certain times, I would forgive people who disliked this because of that point, the film also lacks a climatic kind of feel and it ends with you thinking possibly, just possibly ""is that it"".<br/><br/>Those who love the brothers work should love this too as although it may lack the smart angle I was saying about, it still boats magnificent acting and a thrilling plot which is also very good drama too. People who like basic dramas should also like this but the same goes for those looking for big loud film, stay away, people in this aren't killed just to entertain you they are part of the intricate plot and no one is deemed safe at all. I would also say if any people like watching films that did well at the Oscars this is one and it is a good mix of what all Oscar movies seem to have in them.<br/><br/>Overall I give it an 8/10, a Firmly Great movie which although doesn't warrant a moving up in rating, can I feel from you the audience be loved even more so than my rating and review. With the Coen Brothers they have made film that are brilliant, and after watching this I just thought ""keep making more exquisite films guys"" and so should you as I really do believe there are so many films they have made, it would be impossible for everyone to at least like one of them."
"rawiri42","8","2","3","12 April 2014"," At last, a movie where people behave like people really behave!
","What does one say about ""No Country For Old Men"" that hasn't already been said except, perhaps, that, in what seems most unusual for movies, the characters behave as you would expect them to behave and not in some totally ridiculous way? Well, almost!<br/><br/>For example, when Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) happens upon a drug deal gone wrong whilst out hunting in the desert and finds the bag of money - over 2 million bucks - meant to pay for the drugs, I was saying to myself, ""Grab it and get the hell out of there."" and that's just what he did - EXCEPT that, after going home to his wife, Carla (beautifully portrayed by Scottish actress, Kelly Macdonald), he decides to take water to the one member of the drug gang who wasn't quite dead when he was there earlier (even though there was about a 99% chance he wouldn't still be alive when he got back). But then I suppose he had to do that, firstly to show that he had a heart and also so that the film actually had a plot!<br/><br/>Then later, when Llewelyn knows that Chigurh (Javier Bardem), the apparently emotionless, cold-blooded thug hired by the drug boss to recover his money, is coming to his hotel room, rather than rush out, guns blazing, to meet him, he does exactly what I'm sure every viewer would do in the same circumstance and turns off the light and waits, gun at the ready, for Chigurh to open the door - EXCEPT that, instead of waiting 'til he can see him, shoots through the still-closed door and, of course, only wings him. But then I suppose it had to be that way so that the film didn't end somewhat lamely right there.<br/><br/>Actually, Chigurh, is a much more believable evil villain that Freddy Kreuger (Nightmare on Elm Street) or Jason Voorhees (Friday the 13th) because, whilst he seems almost indestructible - sewing himself up where he's been shot and making a makeshift sling and walking away with his bone poking out of his arm - it isn't taken to a totally ridiculous level as in so many thriller suspense movies. Bardem's work was well- deserving of his Oscar because he was very convincing as having absolutely no respect for human life even though he tried to give the impression that he did by tossing coins for his victims to decide whether they would die or not - even though he killed them anyway!<br/><br/>One thing I learned from NCFOM was that, if ever I find a bag full of money, I'll check it thoroughly for homing devices before taking it anywhere recognisable. I should be so lucky!<br/><br/>The film stops where Cormack McCarthy's book doesn't and so I'm surprised that there hasn't been a sequel movie where we find out what Chigurh does after seemingly walking away leaving just about everyone (including his own associates - giving the impression that he just wants the money all to himself) except Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) dead. Maybe there will be one eventually. I kinda hope so because, until we see his demise, I'll be wondering where he is!<br/><br/>You'll need to read the book to find out - or, of course wait for the sequel."

But I was really, really surprised and quite content with what I got out of this. <br/><br/>The first time I watched this was very late at night and I just thought I would check out this movie everyone was talking about before bed. Next thing I know it's the early hours of the morning and I had just been taken on a journey that very few movies have done for me before. <br/><br/>A few days later and this movie was all I could think about. The story is one of those that will stick in your mind even well after the credits roll. <br/><br/>With the impact this movie made on me I would be lying to myself if I didn't call it one of my favourites. <br/><br/>10/10 Thank you for reading."
"mike3386","10","2","3","9 January 2014"," The Very Definition of Movie Making
","I try to reserve a ""10"" vote for the best of the best, the classics, movies impossible to forget, scenes that play over and over in the mind. By way of preface, it is acknowledged that the good and bad ratings for this movie fall generally into two camps, i.e., men love it, women hate it. Women search for meaning in everything, a message, a story, an outcome that ""says something"", and for that and many similar reasons this movie disappoints them. Why? Because this movie just ""is"" . . . it is there, you can't explain it any more than Sheriff Bell can explain the violence he sees in Texas . . . the real violence we see all around us every day.<br/><br/>There are so many riveting scenes in ""No Country for Old Men"" it's impossible to pick one favorite. The breath-taking violence in the movie is eclipsed by the fine acting by every single actor in the movie. It is a well known fact that when Tommy Lee Jones appears in a movie ALL actors step up their performances, and this movie is a perfect example of that. Pick one (you could pick EVERY one) - Stephen Root. An actor perhaps best recognized for his previous goofy portrayal of a total nerd in ""Office Space"". But in this movie, in just a small part, he gives us a character so obviously vile that it oozes out with every word he utters.<br/><br/>It's difficult to be objective about a movie that will live on for ages as a classic, a movie that should be used to teach actors how to act. A movie that can entertain me again and again, no matter whether I watch it all or just three minutes. It defines movie making."
"fabrydiego96","7","2","3","5 September 2013"," Well made and linear
","Very good the Javier Bardem's interpretation and the way in which identifies himself with the part, maybe sometimes the movie is too much bloody but all in all is a good cinematic representation of the book. This is, in fact, one of the best book-to-film adaptations I've ever seen, both in terms of a close following of the text, and in terms of playing out the author's intentions rather than undermining or erasing them. But the book instead, it's more thematically consistent, thanks to the Bell interludes, which open, close, and space out the book, making it more clearly about him and his conviction that America is falling apart, becoming the kind of place where fellows like him just don't belong."
"Typ33","8","2","3","27 July 2013"," I have to agree that Thematically, Visually, and Auditorily, the movie is stunning.
","No Country is best described as a modern-day Western - taking place in the Tex-Mex area, it is focuses on three characters and their actions in relation to a huge drug deal gone horribly wrong. Josh Brolin's Llewellyn is ostensibly the lead character, a regular Joe whose discovery of the deal (and subsequent theft of $2 million worth of drug money) drives the story. Also after the money is psychotic murderer Chigurh (a brilliant turn by Javier Bardem), who leaves a thick and bloody trail of bodies as he pursues Llewellyn. Rounding out the trio is Tommy Lee Jones as Bell, the world-weary sheriff whose presence in the film is best likened to a Greek chorus as he is very loosely involved in the movie's action.<br/><br/>From now on it gets tough to write about No Country - my expectations were very high for this (after all the five-star reviews I'd heard about). Not only were my expectations met, they were defied. I honestly was not ready for the movie - not because it was more than I'd hoped for, but because it was less. No Country is deceptively simple - the best aspect of it is that it does not try to be overly dramatic. Unlike a large number of thrillers, mood-building music is practically non-existent; what little there is goes largely unnoticed. The suspense is built extraordinarily well - even in some of the more clichÃ©d scenarios on offer. You'll probably spend at least two-thirds of the movie on the edge of your seat. I know I did.<br/><br/>If I had to find any fault with the film, I'd consider it a trifling one but I will say this - the other third of the movie. If Brolin and Bardem's cat-and-mouse arc is responsible for the more intense parts of the film, then Jones' part is responsible for the more quiet (and I may even say, slightly boring) moments. I don't see the breaks in the suspense as much of a problem - rather, Jones' philosophical musings provide much-needed breathers and, if anything, the true heart of the film - how his life as a modern-day sheriff is very different to the ways of his lawmaking ancestors, and how things now are not necessarily for the better.<br/><br/>There's a reason No Country for Old Men has been getting fantastic reviews everywhere you look. It's a tense affair that really does suck you in right from the very beginning and doesn't let go, hitting you with surprise after surprise after surprise. This is the breath of fresh air I've been looking for."

","Joel and Ethan Cohen brought home the Academy Award for Best Picture of 2007 with NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, a dark and chilling suspense thriller which takes the classic cat and mouse chase genre to an entirely new level. <br/><br/>The film stars Josh Brolin, in his finest performance to date, as a schnook who happens upon the remains of a brutal crime scene, where he finds several dead bodies, a huge shipment of heroine, and a case containing two million dollars and the consequences of his fatalistic decision to take off with the money, prompting his being hunted by a cold-blooded assassin (Jarvier Bardem), who will stop at nothing to get his money back. Throw in a laid back Texan sheriff (played to perfection by Tommy Lee Jones)assigned to the case and you have all the ingredients of a first class thriller. <br/><br/>This gritty and uncompromising drama pulls no punches and offers no easy solutions to a myriad of questions it raises, most notably, ""Did this guy really think he could get away with stealing two million dollars?"" <br/><br/>The film is dark and atmospheric, creating such a height of suspense that there is virtually no music score and you really don't miss it. The suspense created by the story propels the film itself. <br/><br/>Jarvier Bardem won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his bone-chilling performance as Chagur, the deadly and apparently conscience-free killer chasing Brolin. Bardem creates one of the most terrifying cinematic villains ever, whose brutality is only surpassed by his unpredictability. <br/><br/>The Cohens have crafted an intricate story that does peter out toward the end, but for the majority of its running time, will have you literally holding your breath. Not quite up the standards of their classic FARGO, the film is still practically a classic that improves upon repeat viewings and reinforces Joel and Ethan Cohen as filmmakers to be reckoned with."

","I have no doubt that the Coen brothers, despite being somewhat irregular, have talent. Following their work wonders such as ""Miller's Crossing,"" ""The Big Lebowski"", ""Barton Fink"" and ""Fargo"", they are now hogging all the awards with a Western-like thriller that features a not too original story though really exciting.<br/><br/>The game of cats and dogs or cats and mice (call it what you want) is the basis of the plot, simple, nothing new but please note how the Coen brothers packed the story into a good film. We can almost all say that ""No Country for Old Men"" has all it takes to be a great film.<br/><br/>Let's start from its hypnotic photography. It's really brutal with near- desert landscapes that reminds us of the glorious days of classic western films. Next, we continue with its amazing soundtrack, or the awesome script, full of goodies and other nice treats.<br/><br/>The cast is also well-chosen, the indescribable chemistry between the cool Josh Brolin and pure evil Javier Bardem is simply spectacular. We should also remember Tommy Lee Jones and Woody Harrelson (in a short but flawless performance) as supporting casts.<br/><br/>Another best thing about this film would be its perfectly measured pace. The script is just beautifully structured. I love how Joel and Ethan Coen alternate the situations through some clever film direction and editing, slowing down and speeding up at times. I also adore the visualized violence, brutal but still not gory.<br/><br/>In conclusion, ""No Country For Old Men"" offers us a realistic approach and meticulous details so that beneath a classic Western action format so that not only do they revitalize the Western genre, but also making it a raw and unique experience."
"Stretfordian","10","2","3","10 February 2013"," The directing, acting and cinematography is outstanding, but that really is a gross understatement.
","'No Country For Old Men' film review.<br/><br/>Having spent a lot of my summer watching films from the top 250 list on IMDb, I finally made my way down to No Country For Old Men. A film I'd heard ravenously positive reviews for, when it was released in 2007 and one I had never got round to watching. And the first film that I concluded was well worth my time producing a review for. I chose to dive into this film without viewing the trailer, so I was totally oblivious as to what I would be exposed to. All I knew was the brief plot line; that there was 'a drug deal gone wrong.' <br/><br/>No Country For Old Men directed by the Coen brothers and based on the critically acclaimed novel by Cormac McCarthy, began with stunning scenes of the Rio Grande overlaid with a strong opening voice-over by Tommy Lee Jones, who effortlessly plays an intelligent and compassionate police Sheriff. A Sheriff who subtly adds a voice of sanity and slight humour in a world where evil and corruption is at its peak. He stumbles upon a drug deal that had certainly 'gone wrong.' His callow young deputy remarks, plaintively: ""It's a mess, ain't it, Sheriff?"" And he replies, concisely: ""If it ain't, it'll do until the mess gets here."" Suggesting the overpowering, current criminal situation of western America. <br/><br/>The second introduction is where we meet Javier Bardem, who plays Anton Chigur. Probably being the most ruthless and inhumane villain I have ever had the pleasure of watching. At first viewing, his appalling hairstyle and serious wit is completely overshadowed by his thirst for murder, using an air gun that is familiar in the cattle industry for killing livestock, where he mindlessly kills his victims just as if they too were cattle ready for slaughter. With multiple viewings, I was then able to fully appreciate his performance and embrace the moments when they were so cruel it was funny. Anton Chigur was a hit man who was given the job of retrieving the lost $2 million dollars from the botched drug deal. The very first scene in which we meet Anton and really see what he is capable of is where he mimics a police officer and orders an innocent man out of his car, which unsurprisingly sees the man to his death. A very striking scene that immediately indicated to me I was in for a roller-coaster of a ride. <br/><br/>The next and final main character is Josh Brolin, who plays a cowboy-type called Llewellyn Moss. He carries the majority of the film with his powerhouse performance of a calculated and intelligent man in hot pursuit with the cash, right up until his inevitable death nearer the end. The grueling journey we see, with the utterly psychopathic Anton right on Llewellyn's heels is as tense as anything I'd seen before and the absolute definition of 'thrill ride.' To be genuinely terrified throughout a film has never happened to me before, but in many scenes I really was holding my breath because I had no idea what was going to happen next. The absence of music added to the ever growing suspense and the severe reality of this film. <br/><br/>The tone of the film is evidently apocalyptic; I felt, at times, that the characters were in ghost towns and that they were completely on their own in this severely dangerous world. The battle between good and evil is intensified by the Sheriffs need for redemption. The seriousness mixed in with comical elements is recognisably Coen's work. But here they manage to heighten and deepen their identity as filmmakers with a film that I would only describe as perfect. The directing, acting and cinematography is outstanding, but that really is a gross understatement."

"sideshowanthony","9","2","3","25 February 2012"," Unstoppable
","Excellent film. This was my favourite for a good while.<br/><br/>Central to the film is the killer's self control, deliberation in planning, and unstoppable unemotional drive to gain the suitcase of money. Javier plays a blinder. He has just the right face and build for it.<br/><br/>Other characters trying to catch the killer, were shown as not up to he job of catching this killing machine. I found bounty hunter Woody Harrelson to be out of place in the film, playing the kind of arrogant 'best in the business' character seen in many blockbuster type films. But ""No Country"" reassured me when Javier made short work of him.<br/><br/>Like the ending of some other films, there are lots of questions left unanswered. But for me this film was no disappointment. The killer left his crashed car, and limped off with a broken arm, bone sticking out. The point being, he wasn't caught and he didn't stop."

","Violence and mayhem ensue after a hunter stumbles upon some dead bodies, a stash of heroin and more than $2 million in cash near the Rio Grande.<br/><br/>I've never seen much of Ethen and Joel Cohen's work but this was a pretty good example of what they can do. No country for old men would sound like a pretty weird title for a movie like this, but there's an explanation by the end of the movie. I really enjoyed the cat-and-mouse chase between the two and the tension was pretty real (especially the almost no score and almost silent.) The villain in the movie got a bunch of awards for being the most intimidating next to Joker, which he is a pretty menacing, crazy guy. The whole drug war thing is very real and by the end of the movie, it feels like you have just ran because of the real tension. I'm also a fan of the fade-to-black endings where it has no real direction to it, but that in my case, it's near brilliant. But anyways, if you want to see a thrilling cat-and-mouse chase throughout the western drug war, see this. It is a pretty damn-good movie and kept me at the edge of my seat throughout. 9/10."
"wie_ein_wilder_stier","9","2","3","21 August 2011"," Three men in the desert and some guys wonder why
","Many people did complain about the sudden ending of the movie or wondered about the question about what it is all about. In fact, ""No Country for Old Men"" is this kind of motion picture you cannot change anything without ruining everything.<br/><br/>The film begins with the desert landscape and the voice of Sheriff Bell/Tommy Lee Jones. Sometimes it reminds me to the great works of writer William Faulkner and I never thought that a movie witch such an ""simple"" beginning could raise such an epic feeling from its first phrase. But maybe that is the best way to describe this Coen brothers picture with just one word: epic.<br/><br/>The story is well known and it is not the job of this review to tell it one more time and for all who know what is going to happen: Did you recognize that the three actors are never ever at the same moment in a shot? Brolin, Bardem and Jones? We never see them together, although one man is hunting the other. That is a fine aspect of the suspense and I do not remember right now any other film with the same situation. A movie about a man-hunt and no one can get away, while still no one gets the other one. Different than in the Hitchcock movies, the hunted is not an innocent person, who is totally over strained. Moss is a war veteran and although he has probably no idea about all this, no idea in what kind of s..t is getting into, he seems to know how tu survive or in better words: How to fight. <br/><br/>The way the Coens are showing us the faces of their characters is quit astonishing. Chigurgh is some kind of nobody. We do not know anything about him, but for all that we get introduced to his moral codex or his view of the world. Javier Bardem's acting performance and his presence is as schocking and haunting as Anthony Hopkin's Hannibal Lecter in ""Silence of the Lambs"" or Robert Mitchum in ""Night of the Hunter"". Make way for this guy or rent a grave.<br/><br/>The directing job of the Coen brothers is truly amazing. Suspense and tension have not been so fine since Jonathan Demme's ""Silence of the Lambs"" or Hitchcock's ""Psycho"". Exspecially the scene, when Moss is awaiting Chigurgh's attack in his motel room. We do not need to see how the killer is arriving. We saw it once before in this first motel, when Chigurgh killed all the Mexicans, while Moss escaped. The second attack is more thrilling, because we know that Chigurgh is in the house, we can almost feel him. We feel him and his presence. It is surrounded by danger and death. In his near you have always the fear that the guy, who is talking to him says something wrong, like the proprietor. Did he know how near he was to be murdered? Definitely not, but we know it and during the whole scene we await Chigurgh's attack and the final mistake. But the coin decided against Chigurgh and we can stop to held our breath.<br/><br/>I have always been a loyal fan of the Coen brothers. They are individualists and I like and honor that, because filmmakers need to be unique in their directing style. Joel and Ethan Coen always fill up their movies with some ""crazy stuff"" like the two gangster characters in ""Fargo"". I loved ""Fargo"" since the first time I watched and I never thought that the Coen brothers could do something better than ""Fargo"". You know, Quentin Tarantino never did something better than ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""Reservoir Dogs"". He never reached this high level again, although he is still making great movies. The Coens improved themselves. They created an epic and won three Oscars in one night. Now I wonder, if ""No Country for Old Men"" is the ultimate Coen brothers movie. Oui ou no? Heads or tails?<br/><br/>Finally, ""No Country for Old Men"" is as fine as a motion picture can be. The work of the crew is fabulous and it is exactly this kind of motion picture the business needs today. Creativ, astonishing, baffling and haunting and moving. And if you want to interpret it, you can fill a whole book."

","Nominated for eight Academy Awards, No Country For Old Men is one of the two front runners for this year's Oscars along with Paul Thomas Anderson's There Will Be Blood. Head-to-head, the latter emerges the victor. However, No Country For Old Men is by no means a pushover, giving Anderson's film a genuine run for its money. Directed and written for the screen by the immensely gifted Oscar-winning filmmakers The Coen Brothers (Fargo, The Big Lebowski) and based on the Cormac McCarthy novel of the same name, this motion picture is made to win awards in mind. <br/><br/>For their latest masterpiece, The Coen Brothers make the decision to stay with their tried-and-tested route, using conservative storytelling and filming techniques that serve the plot well although it lacks the scope and inventiveness of Anderson's direction in There Will Be Blood. The thing I love about the Coen Brothers is their ability to crank up the suspense to immensely unbearable levels with absolutely minimal use of sound or music. The material here presents them with many opportunities to perfect their blend of silent suspense.<br/><br/>There are three main characters played by Josh Brolin, Spanish actor Javier Bardem, and the evergreen Tommy Lee Jones. All give sterling performances with the standout being Bardem whose character, Anton Chigurh, is perhaps the most frightening ever, since Anthony Hopkins' cannibalistic Hannibal Lecter in Silence Of The Lambs. Armed with a high-pressure gas canister as a murderous weapon and wearing a mop-like hairstyle, Chigurh is a villain who does not know the meaning of mercy. You wouldn't want to run into him in a crowded shopping mall, let alone in a dark alley at night. <br/><br/>No Country For Old Men can be said to be a modern Western, an update for the next generation of movie-goers. The unexpected ending may be a sore point for some, but it will be highly appreciated by discerning viewers who demand something more though-provoking than what current movies can offer. The Coen Brothers' comeback film will be likely to dominate during Oscar night. There's no doubt that No Country For Old Men is one of the top ten films of 2007. <br/><br/>SCORE: A- (8.5/10 or 4 stars)<br/><br/>(www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com)<br/><br/>All rights reserved."
"snookies1224","9","2","3","13 January 2010"," Watch it and then watch it again - it is near perfect
","For all you people bagging it out: I have read a selection of bad and good reviews. The people who have written the bad reviews simply don't get it and it's not that deep, nor difficult to understand. It would be interesting to know the demographics of those people. This movie is based on a book. You would be best served to have a look at the background of that before watching the movie. <br/><br/>I watched this movie some time ago and may have agreed with comments about it being a fancy kill fest BUT, I have just watched it again and can clearly see it's intention and how flawless the execution of it is. There is so much in it that it is easy to get lost in the first viewing. Spectacular that it was, the second viewing highlights the nuts and bolts and nothing has been left out that I can see - much UNlike the MESS of Inglourious Basterds. Nothing is left undone in this movie. Every part is there for a reason.<br/><br/>It is a statement of OUR time - as Ellis says ""You can't stop what's coming."" It is indeed no country for old men. It leaves you with a lot to think about.<br/><br/>**Spoilers follow**: The whole movie is a reflection of our society today. Moss' (Brolin) conscience gets the better of him and he shows compassion and goes back to give the dying Mexican water, albeit a stupid decision. This compassion will mean his death. Chigurh (Bardem) kills because he simply does not care and wants what is his and will do anything to get it. We see his total and complete ruthlessness demonstrated with the killing of deputy, the taking of the first car and the execution of his helpers. He has killed his enemy, an innocent and colleagues - nicely rounded to include everyone.<br/><br/>It is not implausible that the deputy turns his back on Chigurh. We are in Texas, not a Mensa based university.<br/><br/>Chigurh was the guy collecting the drugs for the money. The transmitter was put in the bag because he was always going to get the money back later - in keeping with his character. Via Wells' character (Harrelson) we are introduced to the brokers of the drug deal. The guys that hire Harrelson have given the mexicans a transmitter as well. They send Harrelson to find the cash before Chigurh. Without Harrelson, there is only one side to the organisation. The mexicans brought the drugs and wanted the money. Typical bad guy/ good guy drugs and greed scenario.<br/><br/>There are people doing this to other people every day and seriously - who of you cares? Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is tired. He is sick of what people are doing to each other, where we are headed. He doesn't need to constantly be visiting the same crime scenes for information he already has or what someone else with more skill can/will inevitably tell him, if they can. There is no point. He knows that even he is getting out of his depth. The younger cops have no idea. What will happen to them? <br/><br/>The mexicans get to Moss before Chigurh but Chigurh gets the money - hidden like the first time in the air conditioning vent.<br/><br/>The end of the movie: Bell has realised that he is past it and can't do it anymore. He can't protect anyone. It is isn't the same as it was. Remember to the beginning of the movie when he was talking about cops not even carrying guns. He decides to quit. <br/><br/>Ellis was a cop who is in a wheelchair because he was shot. The guy who shot him died in jail. Ellis lives in squalor. <br/><br/>Sheriff Bell always wanted to be a cop. His father was a cop who died 20 years before the age he (Bell) is now. So now he has retired because he can't do it and probably doesn't want to die like others he has known and yet he has still died because he has served no purpose and has now has no life left anyway. <br/><br/>the players in the game don't need any depth of character. They are not there for that. They aren't important at all. It is a simple story, a statement of OUR time - again, as Ellis says ""You can't stop what's coming."" It is No Country For Old Men."

This is a stretch for me because I am really tired of gratuitous violence. The scenes here are so graphic and fast paced, deaths of innocents and perhaps, the deserving. I guess I should read the book for some insights. The grim reaper is around the corner and he has an air compressor not a scythe. I'm curious to see what other things Bardem has done. He is certainly a presence. Of all the scenes that will stay with me, the one at the hole in the wall gas station when the first coin is flipped is the most intense. There has been so much commentary. All I can say is it was like watching an accident; you can't take your eyes off it."

There is so much violence in Texas, that modern lawmen are at a loss to explain it all. Clint Eastwood states in one film, ""We keep plugging the dike but the hole keeps getting bigger."" That is most certainly true for this movie. An unemployed welder Llewelyn Moss, Josh Brolin) is out hunting antelope, stumbles upon a drug deal gone wrong. Everyone involved in the massacre is dead leaving a couple of million dollars at the scene. Llewelyn takes the cash and heads for home, unaware the Mexican Mafia and American businessmen want it back. Moss soon learns Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) a Phychopathetic hit man is after him and on his trail is Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson) a troubleshooter trying to recover the money. Sheriff Ed Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) and his deputy arrive at the drug massacre and try and piece the murders together and discover so many people are killed the whole crime makes little sense. The movie itself is strange as there doesn't seems to be the standard Hero vs bad guy as all involved are creating the mayhem.

He happens to stumble upon a busted drug deal and he finds a satchel full of money which he decides to keep to himself. Little he knows, that a psychotic killer Anton Cigurh (Javier Bardem) is also after the money, while sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is trying to figure out crime, he no longer understands.<br/><br/>No Country could have turned out to be yet another a typical action film, in which everything travels steady as a train towards anti-climatic ending, which can be guessed straight from the opening scene. This would be the case, if the movie would have been done anyone else, than the Coen's. They manage to do a story, that manages to be quite surprising, despite oh so familiar elements.<br/><br/>All in all, No Country is a good, solid film. Personally, as I stated in the beginning, I didn't like it as much I did like of some of the earlier Coen movies, but I still can recommend it, if you like their movies, as it really is a solid piece of cinema."

Bardem represents insane feminism (ism's in general) looking for power and any justification in it's pursuit (justification being violence as an empty statement). Manhood must endure the gauntlet of yin gone wild, that was easy. Now why do twenty-year-old coeds enter college to study the roots of violence (and how to turkey-baste manhood into non-existence).

This gritty and uncompromising drama pulls no punches and offers no easy solutions to a myriad of questions it raises, most notably, ""Did this guy really think he could get away with stealing two million dollars?"" The film is dark and atmospheric, creating such a height of suspense that there is virtually no music score and you really don't miss it. The suspense created by the story propels the film itself. Jarvier Bardem won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his bone-chilling performance as Chagur, the deadly and apparently conscience-free killer chasing Brolin. Bardem creates one of the most terrifying cinematic villains ever, whose brutality is only surpassed by his unpredictability. The Cohens have crafted an intricate story that does peter out toward the end, but for the majority of its running time, will have you literally holding your breath. Not quite up the standards of their classic FARGO, the film is still practically a classic that improves upon repeat viewings and reinforces Joel and Ethan Cohen as filmmakers to be reckoned with."

","The key to getting at the meaning of this story is understanding that the film is essentially a classic western set in 1980. And what a western it is, one of the finest, as well as one of the finest films of any genre put up on the screen. A classic, a future AFI's 100 greatest.<br/><br/>While hunting somewhere in Southwest Texas near the border, Llewlyn Moss (Josh Brolin) stumbles upon a drug deal gone bad and over two million dollars in cash. Everyone's dead or as good as. A dying man asks Moss for water, but Moss doesn't have any water. He discerns that there's a load of cash somewhere and inquires about the last man standing. He finds him a few hundred yards away, shot up and dead. He takes the satchel of cash and determines to keep it to make a better life for his wife Carla Jean and himself. As the story progresses we see that the two love each other a great deal. Moss--a Vietnam veteran, a rough and ready man--is gentle with Carla Jean, a sweet, loving, obedient sort who trusts Moss and admires his courage and his sense of right. Hence, the hero and the virtuous heroine.<br/><br/>We later learn that a businessman in Houston or Dallas (it doesn't matter) is behind the buy, the owner of the money. He hires Chigurh--a cold, pitiless psychopathic killer--to track the money down, but he doesn't know Chigurh, has no idea what he's hired. Chigurh turns on the businessman's agents, coolly shoots them both dead after getting his hands on the receiver linked to a transponder hidden among the bills in the satchel that Moss is still unwittingly carrying along with the cash. Chigurh aims to find and keep the money for himself. Hence, the classic western villain, but also an archetype of evil. But not just any evil. Bardem's character personifies the human Evil that so often seems to prevail in the world.<br/><br/>We have Woody Harrelson's character Carson Wells, a sympathetic bounty hunter and apparently a spook during the war, also hired by the businessman to deal with Chigurh, find Moss and retrieve the money. (The Coens imply that Chigurh was some kind of operative himself during the war; perhaps that's how Wells, who compares Chigurh to the bubonic plague, knows of him.) Wells has no intention of harming Moss, just do the job he was hired to do and kill Chigurh, which Wells already knows is necessary. Wells is not a cruel man. In addition to Wells and unknown to him, the businessman has hired two independent teams of Mexican gunmen, a matter of increasing the odds.<br/><br/>Sheriff Bell, Tommy Lee Jones' character, surmises that Moss, a man he knows and likes, has got the drug money and is on the run from Chigurh, whom he wants to stop, but increasingly feels that he's simply outmatched by Chigurh's sheer relentlessness as he contemplates the maniac's trail of mayhem. Jones' character is the personification of Despair.<br/><br/>And finally, surprisingly, Kelly Macdonald's character Carla Jean is the personification of resolute Courage in the face of Evil.<br/><br/>This is a dark film, mostly conveying a sense of hopelessness. The locations and set designs are intended to be as stark and as barren, as the film's thematic terrain. The Coens did not make a stylized shoot 'em up. I suspect from their work in this film and from that of previous films that the brothers frown on that sort of sensationalism. I'm with them on that one.<br/><br/>The Coens typically go for a slightly warped realism, filled with quirky characters and ironic dialogue. This is a western; these are men of few words. But when they do speak in this film, the dialogue and the delivering are brilliant. Nevertheless, being a Coen film, the dialogue is much more extensive than your typical western. As ""cowboys"" go, these could be rather talkative and eloquent while still conveying the tight-lipped, square-chin aurora. That's some magic the Coens wielded there.<br/><br/>Sheriff Bell's despair is heartbreakingly conveyed by Jones. This tough, brave character, one which absolutely believes in protecting and serving, a sincere throwback, has a tender heart. And as it turns out, too tender in its dotage to stand up anymore. Hence, the title, ""No Country for Old Men"". <br/><br/>Moving onto the last movement of the film. . . .<br/><br/>But Moss is not too old. Tough and ready, he lets Chigurh know that he's not about to fold.<br/><br/>""I'm going to make you my special project."" <br/><br/>Hence, Moss comes to realize, now fully cognizant of the danger Bardem's character poses, that he cannot simply evade this madmen, he must turn the tables and hunt him down. And, apparently, since he's the only man who has ever faced Chigurh, once already, even wounding him, and is still alive to talk about it, we believe he can and will defeat him.<br/><br/>Finally, Bardem's perfectly controlled performance is pure, understated menace, palpable, riveting--the merciless evil of a character utterly unaware of his own banality. His is one of the finest screen performances ever."

","i've read the book before i saw the movie and although upon my first viewing of the film i i was pleasantly surprised that the coen brothers kept close to the plot only to add action to the story (the second shoot out- with chighur getting hurt), i later thought that this movie oversimplified the ideas present in the book and flat out got rid of most of the themes, thus making it a really cool meaningless movie with elaborate structure that...well, doesn't stand without the meaning that Cormack McCarthy put into the book. McCarthy masterfully set up a story for 2/3 of the book and tied it up, and the last 1/3 of the film used the story as a metaphor for some for America's biggest virtues ,vices, fears, traditions and history. but none for that was present in the film. cinematography is great, acting is superb (although i think Wilkinson deserved best supporting actor nomination along with Michael Clayton for best picture, or there will be blood a second for me and viggo mortensen for best actor....blah blah blah). so the film was well made, but compared to the book, it was, politely speaking, shallow."

","Sure, maybe No Country For Old Men did deserve Best Picture in 2007, but the movie is no instant classic or cinematic masterpiece. It's a entertaining modern action with interesting and unique characters. An enjoyable movie to watch. Many argue how can they see this as a best picture? For some it felt like, a villain, the good guy, the ordinary action and a mild ending. My input on the movie is sort of similar, instead the villain was truly bad-ass, there was doses of suspenseful scenes and a good ending. It's no masterpiece, it won't be looked back at as one of the best movies of the decade, just a fine action with some in-depth characters and a informative villain. Defiantly one to see for everyone, a fine adventure of trust, violence, expositions and suspense."

","No Country for Old Men is a very good movie, better than I expected it to be. I was disappointed because I expected more action instead of drama. But, I still believe that this movie is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>This film is about a guy named Llewyln. He accidentally stumbles upon two million dollars. He decides to take it with him and that is unfortunate. Now he has a bloodthirsty villain with killing as his favorite sport after him. Also, the sheriff's department has to get to the bottom of the mystery.<br/><br/>The acting is great. Tommy Lee Jones is still a great actor in these kind of movies. Josh Brolin is wonderful as Llewyln. Javier Bardem is the best, though. He delivers a brilliant performance of the most ruthless villain I have ever seen.<br/><br/>This movie is full of suspense and mystery. The Coen brothers captivated most movie audiences with this thrilling drama. In fact, this movie won an Oscar. Does this movie really deserve an Oscar? It's up to you, the reader to decide. I rate this film 9/10."

","Moss (Brolin) finds $2 million at a crime scene and takes off, sending his wife away, unaware that a man is following his every move.<br/><br/>Whether it's the Dude Lebowski or dim trainer Chad, the Coens seem to create memorable characters and stories with apparent ease, whatever genre they tackle.<br/><br/>This adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel tells almost a silent tale of a man running away with a heap load of cash from an unbelievable loony with a bizarre weapon. The slowest of openings the Coens have ever created again surprises and the lack of dialogue is more of a tale in the grand scheme of the picture. The sweeping shots of the west are vintage Coens and once again, die hard fans of the brother's will be surprised by their artistic direction and significantly their depiction of crime story telling.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem's stalker is a cruel and articulate approach to a psycho, if you can call his character that. His Oscar winning turn as Chigurh is memorably haunting. He has the look, and the cold hearted attitude towards life is exceptionally freaky. Though the coin tossing element is too much Two Face, the darkness behind his character feels strongly realistic and is the stand out protagonist of the film.<br/><br/>The narrative is consistent. Having never read the book I feel compelled to do so after being engrossed into a silent but underlining quick story that is always sharp and consistently intriguing on a number of levels. Though consistent I was completely lost come the ending but no doubt re-watching the film will be a joy and there is something to work out come the climax.<br/><br/>There are twists and turns all the way from start to finish and what I personally like about the Coens is their courage. They are never afraid to hold anything back and write whatever they want, which usually makes their films unconventional, exciting and diverse, an important element in today's modern trend of ordinary releases. This is different from any conventional taking off with money and finding it kind of film.<br/><br/>Perhaps not as interesting and sharp as the Big Lebowski or Burn after Reading, No Country still has that element to shock and surprise.<br/><br/>No Country for Old Men is a silent crime western that will engross anyone with its sharp but silent story that is both shocking and entertaining."

","The winner of 2007 Best Picture from the Academy Awards. This marked the 4th consecutive year the Oscars would put a film from modern times in the winning position. This film was from Walt Disney Co.'s Miramax and Viacom Inc.'s Paramount Vantage. This was also the Coen Brothers' 12th film, the violent thriller-drama and contemporary western chase movie No Country for Old Men (with eight nominations, including four wins for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor), an adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel about a hunter (Josh Brolin) who stole cash from a bad drug deal and then was relentlessly pursued. It was the Coen's first film based entirely on a novel.<br/><br/>The Coen brothers always turn out a quality film even when sections of their films are hit and miss. For the most part the Coens have taken stories and moved in any direction that they wanted. This is the first film that has followed a novel where they were bound by the story. Every bit of this movie works and the mark of both Joel and Ethan are not lost. Even though the violence level is high, it is always to propel the story. Josh Brolin is excellent but the real talent here is the adaptation of the story in the screenplay and the direction. ****/****."

","It seems sometimes IMDb reviews are all or nothing. 1 if you don't like it or 10 if it was good. I think that this movie is a perfect ""6"". I give it the points because of the superb acting and the staging and cinematography are staggering at times. I will admit there was tension, and I cared about the people while I was watching. I was entertained. However, the story borders on ludicrous at times and there is no payoff. There are plot items that make no sense. The deputy turns his back on the person he just arrested and makes a phone call? Dozens of people are murdered and there is no manhunt for our psychopath? (in fact a certain disinterest) Josh Brolin, who was so careful earlier in the story, all of a sudden calls his wife and asks her to meet him. Even WE know that his wife will spill the location (Duhhh!). And what the heck was up with the random car accident? ...and many more. The moral of this movie is that the bad guy that wants to kill you WILL! and a lot of other nice people on the way. I think the dream story at the end is saying to us that the killer is going to get Tommy Lee Jones too, but the movie mercifully end before we see that! I guess if we had have seen that, then Javier Bardem could point his gun (or air gun) at the camera and kill us too!"

If you want a realistic and slyly humorous portrayal of the crooked, violent and rapacious animals that humans are, then Coen brothers movie is what you want to watch.<br/><br/>I have not read McCarthy's book so the opening scenes of the movie were a great treat. Though I had guessed how the hunt for the money was going to end soon after Llewellyn found it, the movie kept me guessing with the many unpredictable turns and twists. It was like a river flowing down a crooked mountain. You knew the water was surely flowing down but at each turn you could only see as far as the next turn and the next turn, when it came, was always a surprise. All the characters were extremely well played by the wonderful cast. Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones all did a wonderful job.

"rmax304823","8","2","3","26 June 2008"," It Don't Do No Good To Be Fast on the Draw No More.
","It's hard to know exactly what to make of this film because it doesn't follow the usual narrative structure. Bad things happen to people, whether they are good, bad, or indifferent. And the soft-spoken but menacing murdering man in black who simply kills anyone who gets in his way, and even a couple who don't, walks away into the sunset. And the hero, Tommy Lee Jones as the aging Texas sheriff, isn't on screen for very long and, in his climactic scene, merely relates to Tess Harper an unilluminating dream he had last night.<br/><br/>But, although I didn't always know what was going on, what OUGHT to come next, I will assume that the Coen brothers did and accept the film as projecting some kind of coherent philosophy about life -- even if that philosophy goes something like: ""Chance, the fall of a coin, plays such an important role in life that any coherent philosophy about it is impossible."" Very briefly, a young Texan (Josh Brolin) hunting deer stumbles on the aftermath of a drug double-cross. The ground is strewn with bodies. Ignoring the pleas of a wounded man for water, Brolin pokes around and finds a bag filled with half a million or so dollars and makes off with the satchel. He packs off his wife and mother-in-law to safety, but a transponder is concealed in the satchel, allowing Javier Bardem to follow him around and engage in the occasional shoot out. Bardem, with his incongruously saintly eyes, is one of those killers who is impossible to stop. He's like Schwarzenegger's robot in ""Terminator"" or any one of a dozen other stereotypes. Tommy Lee Jones is Tom Bell, the disillusioned sheriff who tracks Brolin in an attempt to save him, and fails. Barry Corbin makes a brief appearance as an ex-lawman with even less optimism than Jones, who lives in a dump even messier and more thoroughly debauched than my own.<br/><br/>There are other familiar faces in the cast (Tess Harper, Woody Harrelson) but what sticks in the mind are the bit parts -- the elderly Texan in the isolated gas station, for instance, whose life apparently depends on whether a tossed quarter falls heads up. He seems to have been plucked at random from the streets of Alpine. Or Brolin's mother-in-law, Beth Grant, a garrulous woman with terminal cancer. When a man offers to carry her luggage to the station, she comments, ""Well, there's at least one gentleman left in west Texas."" But then she adds, ""You don't often see a Mexican wearing a suit."" This is a darker story than the Coen's ""Fargo."" ""Fargo"" had one psychopath and one low-level thug, and the rest were ordinary characters with weaknesses. In this film, the greedy and murderous outnumber the good. But, I suppose, following the novel, the blame isn't pinned on regional character. One frazzled sheriff tells Jones that it's all the drug money and the kids with green hair. Jones replies with ambiguous insincerity that he gave up hope when kids stopped using ""sir"" and ""ma'am"" as terms of address. The story certainly STARTS with drug money but then it seems to move on inexorably from there, turning into a contest of wills mediated by accident. A flirtatious young woman at a motel pool asks Brolin why he's always looking out the window. ""Oh, just to see what's comin'."" And she says, ""You never see what's comin'."" How right she is. A car running a stop sign when you're not paying attention can ruin your life.<br/><br/>At any rate, the Coens have done for the values, people, and landscape of southwest Texas what they did for snowbound Minnesota in ""Fargo."" In Texas, if you want a gun you walk in and buy it. The majority of folks are given to categorical thinking but aren't unkind. And the landscape is raw and arid, no country for old men, not anymore.<br/><br/>It's a pretty good film. The Coens are among the most original writers and directors working today."

He makes the mistake of returning to the scene of the crime and the hunter becomes the hunted: by Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), the police led by Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson) and the Mexican mafia.<br/><br/>Bardem deserves his Best Supporting Actor Oscar. You will think twice about laughing at a guy with a bowl cut again, nor someone that seems to innocently be holding a gas tank with a hose. He will also come to mind the next time you encounter a coin toss. In fact, his character steals so much from the rest of the movie that his face is all this movie's poster has to fill.<br/><br/>Not that the rest of the cast don't deliver. It's just that it unravels so slowly, it's only in scenes where he appears that you sit up and really watch. Jones surprisingly plays a weak character here, and Harrelson has a small part, too (but apparently a personal one). Kelly Macdonald is a revelation as Llewelyn's wife, Carla Jean, who stands her own against Anton in their fateful meeting.<br/><br/>The ending begs another discussion altogether."

Music is by Carter Burwell and cinematography by Roger Deakins.<br/><br/>When a hunter stumbles upon the bloody aftermath of a drug deal gone wrong, he decides to make off with cash left at the scene, that violence and life threat will follow from here on in...<br/><br/>Not quite the genius masterpiece some would have you believe, this is however and decidedly dark, sombre, gothic type thriller with noir shadings. The ultimate message slowly pulsing away is one of how making a fateful decision can shape the course of many people's lives, with fate ready at various junctures to trip you up.<br/><br/>The Coen's and McCarthy are not in it to offer hope for a better world, this really is a life stinks and is evil narrative, none more so than portrayed by Bardem's chilling psycopath. The unpredictable nature of the story keeps things on the high heat, even as Deakins brings beauty via his colour photography, his teaming with the Coen's brings visual smarts.<br/><br/>The screenplay is tightly formed, giving the actors something great to work with, and as they respond in kind, while we the audience are drawn in close to the slow burning madness. It definitely finds the brothers Coen returning to their best, as they take McCarthy's melancholic machismo and drip their self aware irony over proceedings.<br/><br/>The finale lacks a punch, and in fact it's a little boorish, while this narrative has been done well before in film noirs of the original wave - so it's not as fresh and exciting to us more mature film lovers.

","While Llewelyn Moss was hunting, he came across a drug deal gone back where he found a dead man hidden behind a tree with a suitcase full of cash. Soon after and throughout the movie you find an insane character named Anton Chigurh who was part of this bad deal trying to find the suitcase and doing whatever it takes to get a hold of that case.
The film takes on a cat and mouse chase, with sly ways to try to hide and spy. I perceived a hint of Jack Reacher vibes from this film when the chasing and hiding was going on. I feel the film did a great job with the western-noir look without overdoing it to make it seem completely overbearing.
The lighting was outstanding in this film. They seemed to use that eerie dark lighting throughout, which really gives an immersive feeling for me when watching suspenseful films. The lighting really stoodout to me in the scene at the hotel with Llewelyn. It was dark out, you can hardly see anything besides the lights around the hotel and the sign for the hotel. In the hotel rooms, it seemed spot on with how the lighting appeared on the walls and even in the vents.
Another element I was thoroughly impressed with was the camera angles. Throughout the chase, the angles seem to hit perfect in every way for me. There is a lot of variety to keep each scene fresh and appealing. The scene that stood out for me most is at the beginning when Llewelyn finds the drug deal gone bad while hunting. You can see first person, third person, and even vantage points-of-view during this scene. It really creates a disturbing scene with the angles constantly switching like that.
Overall, I think this film was great. The Coen brother again did an amazing job with the film. The only problem with the film for me is that I have a hard time understanding deeper meanings in films if they don't lay them out. The Coen brothers are known for doing this and are popular for their deeper themes. This did not ruin the film for me because I was continually entertained for pretty much the whole film. However, I was upset with how the film wrapped up at the end. I felt like there would be a better ending or climax, the film lacked that a little for me. All in all, I would recommend anyone who likes a good suspenseful action film to see this; it's a must-watch movie!"

No Country For Old Men explains the whole story with it's title. There's no surviving for the old. There's no surviving for the weak. This tough remarkable motion picture deserves more than an award. It is beyond Masterpiece. No Country for Old Men has given the audience the real taste of cinema with an incredible cast. In this exceptional movie Coen Brothers have shown their astonishing talent in film making.<br/><br/>With the violent murder at the very beginning, the directors have succeeded to the catch the eyes of the audience in the first few minutes. The movie gets hotter and hotter until the suprising ending.<br/><br/>The amazing cinematography of this movie always reminds me of the legendary west storyteller, Clint Eastwood. Without the aide of Mr. Eastwood, Coens reached to top in the old west defeating him.<br/><br/>Absurdity in Life is the only thing I learned from school. I wake up in the morning, don't know where I'm going everyday, think I'm going to the same place all the time but actually I'm going nowhere. Texas is the place where I wanted to grow up. As hollywood tells us, one has to think it's a hell with drug dealers, guns, slaughter and violence. But I think it's a heaven. Coens and Eastwood were my favorite directors since I was 17. Their nihilistic views about life, are what I enjoyed most in their works. And they were highlighted throughout this movie. Their is no fate, there is no god, It's only us and we're alone in this ruthless planet. Coen brothers' humor in religion are not some other common things that you can find in a typical movie. But like a typical West movie, there are two hunters in No Country For Old Men. One hunts deer, one hunts men.<br/><br/>I wanted to read the novel first before watching the movie and now I don't think I want to anymore. There's always much to see in Coens' works. They're beyond comparison.<br/><br/>We always try to find mistakes in movies. Plot holes, bad writing, poor shooting, unsatisfactory endings, poor acting, unacceptable deaths, imperfect camera angles. And when we failed to find one, we get confused, aren't we? Then we start to think about that particular movie over and over again. And that is how "" No Country For Old Men "" became one of my favorites. I always fail to find mistakes in Coens' works. They're geniuses."

It's about a feeling that most of the humans generally face at some point in their lives when they read or encounter unbelievable violence and ask a question in silence - What is a human turning into? The message is quite clear in the way it has been narrated..<br/><br/>Other than this, for me, another big take away from the movie was - What a brilliant actor Javier Bardem is!

"PCT1970","9","1","1","10 May 2019"," Ambiguity And The Dreams
","While reviewing a movie on IMDb I couldn't remember if I had reviewed this film. I clicked on audience reviews and was shocked by the number of reviews panning the film almost entirely because of the ambiguity of the ending. Which is fine. Everyone is entitled to an opinion. I never suggest whether to view a movie or not. This applies even when I believe a bravura film has been made. I leave it up to the reader whether they choose to view it or not. Of the four movies adapted from McCarthy's novels, which this viewer has read every one of, this film follows the novel almost to a tee. This film won Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Screenplay. I'll admit I was ambivalent about the ending, but this is a virtuous film. The Coens have ended films cryptically before. In ""Raising Arizona"" H.I. is laying in bed awake and part of his monologue is, "" This whole dream, was it wishful thinking? Was I just fleeing reality like I know I'm liable to do. But me and Ed, we can be good too. And it seemed real"". It leaves the ending open for interpretation. I'll review the plot direct, I won't provide analysis, I won't address all of the symbolism and I won't examine it as thoroughly as I normally would. The ending is what I'd like to offer an opinion on. This film has astounding direction, cinematography, screenplay, settings, score and acting. The storyline follows Llewelyn finding a case full of cash from a drug deal gone awry and stealing it. This ignites a pursuit of Llewelyn being hunted by the cartel, a psychopathic bounty hunter named Chigurh who embodies evil, another bounty hunter named Carson and Sheriff Bell. During the entire film Llewelyn is able prove to be a worthy adversary for his main pursuer Chigurh. We find out Llewelyn served two tours in Vietnam which might be indicative of his survival skills. We learn from Carson that Chigurh always gets his man and that Chigurh has principles that transcend money or drugs or anything else. Bell is in pursuit to save Llewelyn from death. With Chigurh, a person's life hangs in the balance by the toss of a coin. The toss of the coin has modeled Chigurh as a force of random death. The pursuit is full of action, duplicity and killings. In the end it is only Chigurh and Bell left. To address the ending I do have to spoil one part of the film which I never do in a review. So be warned. Llewelyn is found dead in a motel room and the cash is gone. All we see is a group of men speeding out of the parking lot. We don't know who killed Llewelyn, but we do know it wasn't Chigurh. Llewelyn wasn't a classic western hero. He stole the cash. The point is that the odds caught up with him. In old westerns the hero always strolls off into the sunset. The Coens are known for a pessimistic world view. Chigurh visits Llewelyn's wife Carla Jean to fulfill his promise to kill her. After a brief exchange he explains the best he can do is offer a toss of the coin. We see him leave. Does it matter if Carla Jean is killed? Whether Chigurh has free will or not, the coin was tossed. Chigurh is sideswiped and severely injured in the crash but walks away. This is symbolic of his very own coin toss. The coin represents forces beyond our control. My interpretation of the dreams. Bell is having breakfast with his wife Loretta explaining dreams he had the previous night. In the first dream Bell's father gives him money, but he can't remember what he did with it. This symbolizes youth living in the moment and not thinking about the future. In the second dream his father is carrying a flame in a horn like people used to do. The flame symbolizes the values and integrity of the old west and old sheriffs. Bell then says, ""And then I woke up"". Cut to black. This symbolizes the world he believed in probably never existed, it was an illusion and he just realizes it. He understands that today's world is no country for old men. No matter what one's interpretation of the ending and the dreams this film is sublime, ingenious and an avant-garde modern day western. It's yet to be surpassed."

","I think No Country For Old Men is one of the better films by the Coen Bros. The performance by Javier Bardem is genuinely terrifying as the villain. Josh Brolin pulls off a pretty understated, intense performance as well as the man who finds a bag full of cash and doesn't won't give the money back. The film had me pulled in from beginning to end. There are a lot of good twists, and I find that the film is a mix of thriller and western in a pretty excellent way. The only beef I had with the movie was the ending was a bit awkward, but that doesn't hurt the film's overall quality in my opinion. Definitely a movie to check out if you like the Coen films or thrillers in general. A classic of its type. 8/10."

"ipiccone","10","1","1","18 September 2018"," One of my Personal Favorites
","This movie isn't for everyone. It's dark, moody, and rather depressing. It's a stunning meditation of crime, and in so doing, doesn't pull any punches. It also might be the Coen Brother's most serious film to date.<br/><br/>I love this film, as do many others, but it holds a special place in my heart for being one of the first films I discovered myself. When I turned 18, and was finally granted cinematic freedom, I started burning through all the R rated films I could think of, namely Tarantino's filmography. However, somewhere along the way, I stumbled across No Country. I watched it during my Teacher's Aid period in High School, (much to the teacher's chagrin) and was blown away. It was unlike anything I'd ever seen, and probably the what sparked my interest in ""film"" in the first place. This spark may have happened during Chigur's visit to the gas station. <br/><br/>I realize now I haven't said much about the film itself, and to be frank, I'm not sure what to say. It's just one of those movies that resonates with me. The themes, the intensity, the gruff but honorable characters. ""No Country for Old Men."" What a damned fine title."
"cristianofisch","10","1","1","19 August 2018"," Amazing movie, even better story.
","If you are putting down this movie because ""there is no point, there is no ending"", you should try to read between the lines. Understand the dialogues before criticizing.

"Marwan-Bob","9","1","1","11 February 2017"," Anton Chigurh is one of the greatest evils in cinema - ever
","The film is set in rural West Texas, with the main character a welder and hunter named Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) discovers the remains of several drug runners who have managed to kill each other in an exchange gone violently wrong. Rather than report the discovery to the sheriff Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), He decides to simply to pocket the 2 million dollars for himself. The result of that decision puts a psychopathic killer, Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), on his trail by the drug cartel. This killer is a dispassionate murderer of nearly every rival, bystander and even his employer in his pursuit of Moss. As Moss desperately attempts to keep one step ahead, the blood from this hunt begins to flow behind him with relentlessly growing intensity as Chigurh closes in. Meanwhile, the laconic Sheriff Ed Tom Bell blithely oversees the investigation even as he struggles to face the sheer enormity of the crimes he is attempting to thwart. This is a Coen brothers' team of direction and production that is beautifully terse and very intense. The film provides ""edge of your seat"" and these quickly paced action scenes are tightly constructed and presented like a Hitchcock film with its almost morbid silence in the showing of the act of murder. Any lesser movie would seemingly dissolve into cat and mouse territory, by the middle of the film, but here there are more shoot outs and standoffs galore and the viewer begs to anticipate what is happening next, but cannot. Nothing is ever quite what it seems in this bleak but mesmerizing country, as Tommy Lee Jones shows up as a soon to be retired sheriff, and commands the screen by pumping the drama with morality and reality versus the mayhem preceding him. It is a very unique film that begs watching again and again."
"peefyn","9","1","1","15 January 2017"," The silence and the talking
","This movie does two contradicting things perfectly. It uses silence really well, and communicates a lot using other means that dialogue. Even in scenes with conversations, it feels like more is being communicated by what you see than what you hear. But at the same time, the dialogue is some of the best you'll see in film. The way people talk, both the accents and what they say, makes it feel like you're immersed in a really good novel (which the movie obviously is based on), while at the same time it feels real. Together, it makes for a movie that says a lot when it's not saying anything, and is stunning even when the characters are talking.<br/><br/>It's also a movie that can take many re-watches. Partly because there are so many good moments, and it's visuals being so good. But also because it has an ending that might surprise you the first time around, but that you'll get a more understanding for when you know what's coming."
"CinematicInceptions","7","1","1","30 December 2016"," Imperfect, but undeniably well crafted.
","This is an excellent piece of visual story telling, but it does fall short in places. Some of the characters' motives, goals, and roles in the story did not feel well developed. Chigurh obviously does not behave according to the conventions of most characters because that's the kind of character he is. But Ed Tom Bell and especially Carson Wells did not seem to have a solid purpose. Part of the reason I think this may be that the dialogue was a bit hard to hear because of how quiet it often is and the way the actors employ the southern accents. Perhaps it's also because I didn't care to know very much about Wells and Bell. Still, many of the characters did not stick with me enough for me to remember who died and how they died.<br/><br/>That aside, it was a pretty good story that was told in a way that fit the story. The non- dialogue scenes were, in my opinion, the best. The introduction of Llewelyn and his journey to the briefcase was done well, and the scenes within the hotel rooms were all fabulous. They created genuine suspense, something that is rarely found anymore. It felt suspenseful, because there was no assurance that any one character would or would not die, which creates true mystery and consequently true suspense.<br/><br/>However, these great scenes come at the sacrifice of the overall story. There is an overall plot, but many of the most notable scenes are not actually that necessary to the larger story. The coin flip scene at the gas station, while it was very intense and engaging, served little purpose. It did not reveal anything about Chigurh that had not already been revealed and did nothing to advance the plot. It only served in establishing the coin flip device, which did not call for a four-minute scene. Bell's description of his dream at the end seemed similarly unimportant, not adding any evident coherence to the story or the overall theme.<br/><br/>Most of the problems I have outlined are preferential. The script and directing are exceptional and should be used as a model for anyone who wants to write or direct movies. It creates a villain that is intimidating and memorable. There may be a theme here if one is willing to look hard enough, but I couldn't tell you what it is.<br/><br/>This is not a pleasant movie, but it is a good one. I don't recommend it if you only watch movies for entertainment. It isn't boring, but it is meant to be a work of art rather than a movie for the audience to have fun watching. The four Oscars that the film won are deserved, but do not watch it because of the Oscars; they will not make you like it more. If you do decide to watch it, I would recommend that you try to engage yourself in it. The more you put in, the more you'll get out. Overall Rating: 8.1/10."

"cdjh-81125","10","1","1","1 October 2016"," This is The Most The Coen Brothers Ever Gained On A Coin Toss
","I've never been the biggest fan of Joel and Ethan Coen when it comes to comedies I don't like their sense of humour and style but when they go dark and gritty they are amazing and No Country For Old Men is proof of this because this is one of my all time favourite movies. One reason this works for me as a Coen brothers movie is its relatively simple story a cat and mouse chase between a merciless assassin and a former Vietnam War Veteran with over 2 Million Dollars in stolen drug money. This creates for a constant sense of tension and bleakness that keeps me riveted every time I watch this movie and a lot of this can be attributed to Javier Bardems incredible, Oscar Winning Performance as the film antagonist Anton Chigurh. He just perfectly captures his characters mysterious and terrifying qualities that just get the audience begging for him to get back on screen and this truly is one of the greatest performances ever given in a movie. Thought Bardem steals this movie that does not take away from both Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones. I Legitimately could not imagine anyone else playing Llewelyn Moss, Brolin is perfect in this movie he just gets the characters he's playing, portraying him as a morally schizophrenic character who you can never lock down as a person. The action scenes are few in this film but that works here as it makes them more satisfying named more real adding to the constant sense of tension. I can't quite explain why but I love the fact that this movie has no score it just works for this and couldn't imagine them doing it any other way. The cinematography of course is stunning but you can expect nothing less from Roger Deakins. The Coen Brothers best film truly did win at the Oscars it's truly one of the best pictures to win best picture and it's and incredible ride that makes me wish that The Coen Brothers would reach this quality more often. 100%-A+"
"ethansanders-40501","10","1","1","5 September 2016"," Haunting and mesmerising
","No country for old men is a film that, upon first viewing, will annoy and aggregate you. It seems boring, the ending drags on too long and then ends abruptly and there's random scenes that don't seem to have much bearing on the plot. However it will stay with you to the point you will feel compelled to watch it again. This is exactly what happened with me and on second viewing I loved it. I admired the risks the film took, the excellent performances(especially jabber bardem), the tense and taught film making and the scenes that annoyed me the most upon first viewing became my favourites. That final scene where Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) tells his wife of the two dreams he had punctuated by complete silence except for the ticking of a clock as the film cuts to black is a scene that will stay with me for a long time. The film is brimming with complexity as it explores the ideas of the criminal mind and how warped it has become and the good men of the world like Ed Tom become outmatched and feel the need to give up. It's depressing yet always compelling thanks to the coems marvellous writing and directing as no scene, no matter how slow, is boring or dull. Even when I first saw it and disliked it I was still stuck to the screen, there was something about it that always hooked my attention even when I wasn't enjoying it, that must be a sign of a truly great film. The Oscars defiantly made the right choice in 2008 when they awarded this film best picture and the coens there long overdue best director Oscar."
"please_stand_by","10","1","1","31 August 2016"," Dark, Relentless Intensity in its Purest Form
","No Country for Old Men is an intensely unforgiving film experience, one which is built on the back of six things: 1. Intense, often darkly humorous writing. 2. Beautiful, evocative cinematography. 3. Slow but relentless pacing. 4. Stark, disturbing violence. 5. A deeply cynical, yet resolute worldview. 6. An unstoppable antagonist, more force of nature than man.<br/><br/>It's rare to find a film that is as beautiful as it is cynical, as intense as it is slowly paced, or as humorous as it violent. As one might expect, this odd combination of attributes does not work for everyone, and some of the most prominent user reviews on this site certainly confirm this to be the case. However, if you can get past the discomforting nature of the film and you aren't already someone with a dislike for the Cohen brothers' style, you will almost certainly be impressed. You are in for what many consider to be a masterpiece, myself included.<br/><br/>But why, specifically, should No Country for Old Men be deserving of the title of ""masterpiece""? As with almost every Cohen brothers film, the answer isn't easily summarized. While I can't speak for others, I think there is brilliance in the way that the six elements above are synthesized into a grim but vibrant story, one that explores the human components of evil, the inhuman components of human actions, and the innate longing to return to a better past that may have never actually existed.<br/><br/>But ultimately that question, ""why?"", is the same one that the Sheriff character is left trying to answer throughout the film in the wake of various seemingly pointless acts of violence. Instead of answering that question, the writers leave it up to the viewer to contemplate, just as it is up to the viewer to decide whether such a conclusion is brilliant, empty, or both."

","I read the book that this movie was based on a few months back, and I'd been meaning to see it ever sense. At first, I was befuddled by the ending. Llewelyn is murdered by drug dealers, and his innocent young wife (she's 19 in the book) is killed at the hands of Chigurh. I figured it was strange, seeing the bad guy lose. But then I understood that it was just McCarthy's grim picture of a violent world. A violent place which is NOT FOR OLD MEN. The film surpassed my expectation, with Bardem playing the strangely principled human terminator Chigurh and Tommy Lee Jones playing the nihilistically minded sheriff Ed Tom Bell. The acting was brilliant, the writing and direction were brilliant. All of it was absolutely brilliant.

","It was interesting how this film provided a modern take on the classic Western. It was also a really good one at that. Many scenes had a lot of tension to them, and it had a ton of unexpected moments. Then, at the 90 minute mark, the movie pulls the rug out from under the viewer, and it becomes a lot more interesting. This is the finest Coen brother film I've seen yet. In my opinion, it's even better than ""The Big Lebowski"" - another masterpiece.<br/><br/>After a hunter named Llewelyn Moss accidentally stumbles across a drug deal gone horribly wrong, and nearly 2 million dollars in a briefcase, a serial killer named Anton Chigurh follows him in and attempts to get it back, killing anyone who gets in his way. A bounty hunter named Carson Wells is also hired to recover the money. In the meantime, Sheriff Ed Tom Bell oversees the investigation. Violence and mayhem results.<br/><br/>What I loved about Chigurh was that he was able to accomplish all of his tasks without ever showing much pain or effort. He did gruesome murders like it was no big deal. Since he never showed much emotions throughout the movie, this gave me the idea that he knew exactly what he was doing and he wasn't afraid of dying whatsoever. This made his appearance seem very threatening. Also, it was very hard to escape him. Very few people he encountered in the film made it out alive. Most of his victims stood no chance when he killed him. Also, his character was made a lot better by Javier Bardem's amazing performance. Without showing too much emotion, he was able to send a chill down the viewer's spine every time he enters the screen. He has an ominous feeling to him which makes his appearance look unnerving. Bardem terrifies the viewer somewhat in the same way that Anthony Hopkins' from ""The Silence of the Lambs"" does. I don't think that many actors could do the same as him. What he did is very difficult to do, yet he nailed it perfectly. His Oscar for ""Best Actor"" was well deserved. Also, many other actors such as Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones gave great performances as well.<br/><br/>Also, this movie has several of the most suspenseful scenes I've ever seen in a film. For example, the coin toss near the middle is, by far, the best one in the film. Chigurh constantly stops all attempts the man in the convenient store does to escape. When he throws the coin, the viewer is left on the edge of their seats to see what will happen. Also, you probably didn't notice the gentle push-in from the camera which raises the tension even more. Another great scene is when Moss is in a hotel, and he suspects that Chigurh is right outside the door. Moss turns the lights out and points his gun at the door to prepare. The calm moments the viewer experiences keeps them on the edge of their seats, because anything can happen at any second. There are many other scenes where the Coen brothers add background noises which inform the viewer that something bad might happen. It could simply be the sound of footsteps, someone flushing a toilet, or a loud phone ring. It could also be when the viewer knows something that a character in the film doesn't. If a character is walking into a room, it could show you a shot to see Chigurh waited for him/her. This is another highly effective technique which works very well too. I can't think of a single movie I've ever watched which made me feel as much suspense as I did in this one.<br/><br/>Around the 90 minute mark, the Coen brothers pull the rug out from under you, and they make a choice which makes the film a whole lot better. It is so unexpected, and it opens the film up to a whole new layer of pros after it leaves a few loose ends in its storyline, making it ambiguous. I am a real enthusiast for ambiguity. I think that it's great to have in films as it gives them more staying power, and it can lead me to discover new things every time I re-watch them. The ambiguous ending in this film seems simple at first. It doesn't seem too impressive at first glance. However, after thinking about it for a little while, I was slowly able to realize how impressive it actually was. It makes you see the film in an entirely new way, and it makes simple action scenes that we witnessed earlier in the film become much deeper. It was interesting how the Coens were able to provide a somewhat unique take on ambiguity. People who criticize its ending and call it disappointing are missing the point. This is a film which has a deeper meaning. It requires you to think. Just because it leaves a couple plot points up to interpretation doesn't make it a weaker film. Ambiguity isn't necessarily a bad thing.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this was a perfect movie. Chigurh was an amazing villain. I feel like he's one of the best modern villains ever, because Javier Bardem knocked it out of the park with him. Also, his calm expressions were terrifying. Chigurh was reminiscent of Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Also, I've felt more tension in this film than any other film I can think of off the top of my head. To top the film off, once the ambiguity is introduced, it allows the viewer to appreciate the film in entirely new ways, and the film becomes very different on re-watches. This is, quite possibly, the best Coen film to date."
"Schwag09","9","1","1","26 June 2016"," A modern western masterpiece
","No Country for Old Men is a crime action film with distinct characteristics of classical western and film noir. The Coen brothers manage to blend these seemingly disparate styles into another masterfully done American story. Much of the film was aptly shot in West Texas, which makes for beautiful cinematographic shots of the barren landscape. The storyline is not a complicated one, which allows the actors to truly drive the film and plot forward.<br/><br/>The film primarily follows three men and the paths they weave through one another's lives. This triumvirate always seems to be just out of reach of one another despite their best efforts. Tension is built around the hunt and anticipation of a clash.<br/><br/>Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is the sheriff of a sleepy, blue-collar town in West Texas, as were his Father and Grandfather. His casual and judicious demeanor is contrasted with that of his deputy, whom we can only assume is fresh out of high school or the academy, whichever came first. Over the course of the movie Bell's eyes are opened to a remarkably brutal case, and a decline, or at least shift in, American morals.<br/><br/>Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) leads a more lawfully neutral life, but is still portrayed as an upstanding, hardworking member of society. He's simply a man trying to capitalize on a situation that could provide a better life for him and his family. We see him as a capable, strong- willed protagonist that fears no man.<br/><br/>Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) is merciless, cold, and calculating. His lawless nature is not reckless, he's a man of principle, and if he believes in anything at all, it's destiny. Chigurh's background is left to the imagination of the viewer, which only furthers his air of mystery. His weapon of choice throughout the film is a cattle gun, unconventional, yet effective, much like his demeanor. Bardem truly steals the show in this film, taking home a Best Supporting Actor for his performance.<br/><br/>The Coen brothers paint another unique perspective of Americana. After taking home Best Picture and Best Director, their chemistry together is undeniable. They are quickly taking their cult-like following to the next level and gaining a broader respect within the film community."

Too tense, one of the best of the Coen brothers if not the best, No Country for Old Man is a great movie, the cast is already great, we Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, Tommy Lee Jones, Woody Harrelson and etc, Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones are fine, most who steals the show is Javier Bardem that is amazing, he is a psychopathic character and cold, the film has no soundtrack out, what makes even more tense, the Coen makes a great direction, film is violent, and is also full of pursuit of Javier Bardem's character by Josh Brolin, and the end is very shocking, Josh Brolin's character simply turns up dead, the film does not show anyone killing him, was it the same Chigurn ?, the film a few holes, such as the character of Josh Brolin takes guy a water was injured in the car after 10 hours, who would do that in real life? Apart from that No Country for Old Man's great, has one of the best villains in the movies with Fantastic performance of Javier Bardem. Note 10"
"LiamJBlair","10","1","1","12 April 2016"," Absolutely amazing subtlety. A sophisticated and thrilling story
","I went into this with no idea what was going to happen because I hadn't seen the trailer, but I loved Burn After Reading so I had high hopes for another Coen brothers film. However this is not a comedy, it's still an amazing addition to the Coen brothers collection. <br/><br/>The film follows a hunter who comes across a drug deal gone wrong and a case of cash. His attempts to defend the cash lead to an epic chase that is well paced and suitably action packed. <br/><br/>The choice of little score was very fitting for the way the film is paced. It's a really good example of when you don't have to use music and shows how much music can be overused. <br/><br/>There are small details that are subtly shown in parts of the film that are then referred to later, to explain something that has happened. I'm not going to explain an example because I don't want to spoil a plot point, but the movie compliments viewers who have payed attention. <br/><br/>Overall, this is one of my favourite films of all time and I do not find it difficult to give this a ten out of ten."

","If you like the novel than you're in for a treat. This is by far one of my all time favorites. This movie teaches you a very important lesson and leaves you speechless. If you haven't seen the movie go and watch it with high expectations, you will not be disappointed. I watched this with my family and then i showed it to my friends. They all loved it so much that i decided to suggest it for my local theater to air it on a Friday night. The theater was almost full and at the end i felt like a hero for showing them this movie. There's not much left to say about this unbelievable masterpiece. This really shows that the coen brothers are among the greatest directors of all time"
"brittany-smillie","9","1","1","29 March 2016"," Beautiful, elegant and chilling
","If you hadn't told me this was a Coen brother's film I never would have been able to guess it. The trademark banter is gone, music somber and entire scenery set to a sepia tone. One of the most charismatic actors (Javier Bardem) takes a leap and succeeds exponentially on scaring the absolute crap out of his audience. This film succeeds on every level, where I usually find myself losing focus and checking the time I was glued to the screen to find out what happened next, literally upset that it was over when it was, I just wanted more. I don't think I would change almost anything about this film, it's beautiful but haunting and exceptionally shot and acted with the story playing out almost second to the scenery and actors."
"Hazibo","9","1","1","18 March 2016"," One of the best Coen films to date
","It's hard to beat such a genius duo like the Coen Brothers, and this film really solidifies that fact. Next to Inside Llewyn Davis, No Country for Old Men is possibly my favourite Coen brothers film to date.<br/><br/>Now to give a little context on the Coens, they've made some great films, and they've made some not so great films *cough* *cough* Ladykillers *cough* *cough*. And No Country is one of the best. But, No Country is the most drastically separate film in the entire filmography, if you are not familiar with the Coens and want to start someone then I highly suggest checking something else out first.<br/><br/>The impressive use of little to no music combined with some of the most intense action scenes is more than enough proof that this film was nothing short of genius. Sounds such as shells from shotguns hitting the floor, the whistle of the wind through the leaves of a tree, the shutting of a door becomes the music.<br/><br/>All of the acting is fantastic. Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem are two of the most watchable enemy duos cinema has ever given us. The pacing is also fantastic; many people say that the lack of music rendered the film somewhat boring, but I'd say it made it all the more thrilling.<br/><br/>The Coens and Roger Deakins are also two of the best cinematic duos working today. In all fairness this whole film was just a film showing off some of the best cinematic duos.<br/><br/>aside from a few noticeable dubs this film was practically flawless and I highly recommend checking this film out as soon as you can."

","I am a Coen brothers fan so be aware of that if you're looking for a review from someone less inclined to like the movie than me. The movie has everything I like. Great characters, memorable scenes and lines. In a jazz sort of way what I actually like best is what isn't said.<br/><br/>The movie is set in rural west Texas. It does an excellent job creating the remote, slow pace of the area with silence. In dialogue and in settings there's more empty space than you might expect in a movie. To me that captures the culture of west Texas.<br/><br/>Great performances up and down the cast from people who aren't Texans but sound like it to a lifetime native resident like me. This is a movie I'll stop down for any time I roll through the guide and see it on. If you like the Coen brothers or somehow haven't seen any of their work give it a look."
"baberchik","9","1","1","8 January 2016"," gritty, slow-paced stab in the guts
","This is what more cinema should strive to be. Instead of a singular storyline and a set goal (classic example: show a hero's rise to power and ultimate battle against evil) this is a kind of casual, slow - but very detailed - look at a set of events. No ultimate decisive ending, no final victory for the good or bad, no climax. The closest thing one can compare this movie are some very few people who can manage to tell a story without raising their voices, without any added drama, and with a calm and steady storytelling still manage to raise every single hair on your back. This is the exact same thing, done with trough a movie. Both the storyline and the actors and the camera manage to calmly but surely portray this with great skill."
"michal-kasztelewicz","8","1","1","6 December 2015"," What's the most you ever lost on a coin toss?
","Known primarily for their black comedies and farcical crime films, the Coen brothers decided to tackle a new genre: western. After making a couple of films which haven't been received as well as their previous work, the Coens are back. Brothers known for writing and directing their films are adapting Cormac McCarthy's book 'No Country For Old Men'. This is their first proper adaptation of a novel (1990's Miller's Crossing uses some characters, dialogue and plot points of Dashiell Hammet's prohibition-era novels). The plot of this film kicks into gear when Llewellyn Moss (played superbly by Josh Brolin), a simple welder from Texas, finds a case with $2m in it after a drug deal went horribly wrong. His and his family's lives are in danger, inevitably, other people start looking for the money as well. The man playing cat-and-mouse with him is Anton Chigurh, exquisitely portrayed by Javier Bardem. He is introduced in film's first scene; while it doesn't influence the plot a great deal, it establishes his character's insanity excellently. The grotesque grimace he makes when strangling a man would be guaranteed to stay with the viewers for a long time, if the events which follow weren't even more unflinchingly brutal. When on his own with people he doesn't have to kill, Chigurh uses a coin toss to decide their fate. This might sound childish, but it creates some incredibly well-crafted points of tension, boosted by Bardem's emotionless delivery of the dialogue. This film has certain dark comic elements, like when Llewellyn sleeps on a public bench and is woken up by a mariachi band, whose expressions turn from joyous to comically horrified when they see that Llewellyn's clothes are soaked with blood. Also, the film portrays America (and humanity in general) in a very grim way – most characters turn out to be cynical, greedy and ruthless. This isn't the first Coen film to make such statement on society, but this one has elements rarely seen in their films. For example, music and dialogue are very sparse – Carter Burwell's score is only 16 minutes long (out of a 122 minute runtime). This is a superb film; a very faithful adaptation of an acclaimed novel. However, it is not flawless. The biggest problem is Tommy Lee Jones' character; he simply isn't interesting enough or influential in terms of plot to merit the amount of screen time he gets, which bogs the film down slightly."
"joshuafagan-64214","10","1","1","14 November 2015"," A Film That Stays with You For a Long Time
","Note: this is one of the new films that takes place twenty-thirty years before it was released that is not a desperate play for the audience's nostalgia and dollars. In fact, there is not much explicitly commercial about this film. This is not to say it's some avant-garde European film; even if you can't take in all that's at play, you can appreciate it for being a gritty, action-packed, well-paced adventure through the wilds of Texas.<br/><br/>The people who made The Last of Us were inspired by this film. I can certainly see why and how. In both that and this, there is an undercurrent of somberness and loss even as the full-throated action scenes pull out. Neither bonk you over the head with objective calls of 'This isn't going to end well,' but in both, you can feel a sort of flowing misery in the air. The sort of misery that reduces the world's players to mere shadows at sunset, left to wonder to who knows where for who knows what time.<br/><br/>2007 had a lot of good movies. That it also was the year that jumpstarted Michael Bay's spleen-splitting Transformers franchise does not dampen it. You had this film, There Will Be Blood, Ratatouille, Juno, The Bourne Ultimatum, Atonement, and so on. But I do feel confident in saying that this was the correct choice for Best Picture. It is the best movie the Coens have ever made, and that is saying something. It pierces deep into issues of time and age and obsolescence while never stopping being an entertaining and gripping thriller.<br/><br/>Based on a 2005 novel of the same name by one of the greatest novelists alive today, Cormac McCarthy (82 years old and still writing, something that makes me wonder what else the Fitzgeralds and the Hemingways could have done if their lives weren't so short), this movie takes place in a small region of Texas borderland, where an old sheriff, played by Tommy Lee Jones in the best performance of his career, sees himself unable to do much of anything when a serial killer chases a 'Nam vet and welder, Llewelyn (I am never going to forget that name from here on out, though I'm likely never going to be able spell it right without checking first) Moss across the rolling, isolated wastelands of Texas.<br/><br/>Though it takes place on the border, this movie is not about the Drug Wars or anything of that sort. If you wanted that, I recommend Traffic. Even if you're not, go check out Traffic; it is one of the best films I've seen. This film is different; this film is more intimate and cold. Whereas Traffic goes all around, this film stays in one place and deals with trying to keep out the miserable winds of the world around. The air is terse and tense. No one talks about how much despair is in the air, but it can be felt. There are a lot of shadows and dark tones.<br/><br/>If I had to file a complain, it would be about the characters, which are helped out by some strong writing but are not as complex as they could have been, not that such is a major issue. If I had a second issue, it would be that the film seems a bit trapped between two ways of going; the whisper-on-the-wind's breath way, and the grand epic masterpiece. I never have liked the two-hour length for a film, but there are some films that can transcend it. This is not one of them. Even as I listen in awe to Tommy Lee Jones' ending monologue and bask in the swatches of contemplative emptiness it leaves in my heart, I am left to wonder if the film earned it length-wise.<br/><br/>But again, these are just minor nitpicks to a film that deserves to be loved and appreciated by the generations to come. The cinematography is some of the best in any movie, and showcases the landscape of the film, both literally and metaphorically. Even the little details are exceptional; as I take a bath, I wonder how anyone can make washing off a wound look so artful. Mr. Deakins, possibly the greatest man at his job that the world has ever seen, makes his camera sing.<br/><br/>The tone of the film seems to be halfway between a Clint Eastwood Western and something like a Mad Max movie. It is evocative and entertaining, knowing when to rush ahead and when to lean back. And also how to betray your expectations About thirty minutes from the end, when you most expect the climax, the action just abruptly stops. I won't spoil what happens, but it makes you rewind your Blu-Ray players and check if your eyes did not deserve you. From there, the film embarks on a Scouring of the Shire-style wind-down that involves the retirement of Tommy Lee Jones' characters, who claims that what he has seen is too much for them.<br/><br/>At the very end, he talks about two dreams he had last night. This deserves close examination, but it basically comes down to him talking about how the world needs more younger men, like his father was, in this world. And then the credits roll. It takes time to absorb. After letting it gesticulate in me, I decided that it was kind of like Princess Mononoke in one fundamental way; you roll down a raucous river for the majority of the film, then, in the last twenty minutes, the film's truest thematic colors emerge and you are left to absorb.<br/><br/>I make all these comparisons, but they are all only sort of accurate. This is a unique film, and one that needs to be taken it. I suggest that you do so."

I didn't think it was that good.<br/><br/>So I watched it again recently – I have to agree with a lot of people, the story really doesn't feel finished, if anything its all a little rushed, I would have loved to have seen more of Woody, its seems like a load of his scenes were left on the cutting room floor. Surely they could have padded the story out more and did it have to be so doom and gloom, so anti Hollywood?<br/><br/>But hold on a second. That's the point, it's what I believe after the second watch is what really makes this film great. The story is not so important, the money, drugs, Mexicans, third party, scary hit-man, Hero, Hero's wife, integral to the story but not the whole point.<br/><br/>Its Ed Toms story – his disillusionment with the world, how its change, how cold and bad it can be and of course the realisation that its always been like that and always will be. You just have to do your best and make a small difference where you can. Its not a country for old or young men!<br/><br/>Its still not my favourite film ever, but its up there and it's a thinker with a refreshing anti Hollywood ending."

","The Coen Brothers never cease to amaze me. They also paired up with my favorite cinematographer, Roger Deakins to bring one of my favorite movies.<br/><br/>My only complaints about the film are that it feels long at points. The suspense keeps you sucked in and I feel that the length was needed to tell the whole story, but during some of the scenes I felt like the movie just kept going. Also there was one bad performance in the whole movie, and it was Garret Dillahunt, he was overacting in almost every scene he is in, while surrounded by good actors.<br/><br/>The plot is simple and easy to follow, but is truly brought to life by the two main characters. Javier Bardem's character Anton Chigurh was the silent killer, every scene he was in felt intense, you never knew what he was going to do. Even on a second viewing the scenes with Javier Bardem were still very intense. Josh Brolin's character Llewelyn Moss was the man running away. I felt for him every step of the way, I wanted him to succeed and that is good.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is great. The acting is great despite that one actor and the story is great and is filled with intense scenes. The cinematography is great with so many great shots, but what else can you expect from the master Roger Deakins. You won't be disappointed watching this movie."
"jamiewilliamhart","10","1","1","12 July 2015"," Gripping from start to finish
","The beginning of the film contains a voice over from Tommy Lee Jones which instantly catches your attention. It's an example of a scene where sometimes less is more. The scenery as Jones describes his background is stunning and the words that Jones uses exactly describe his view throughout the film of what is happening to the town he's a sheriff of. The picture, directing, script and acting is superb and its a film that is a favorite of mine that I could watch over and over again. It is a film that could appeal to a wide audience due to the action scenes mixed with a sharp script. Bardem is great as the bad guy in the film. He has a strange haircut which only adds to his menace. To sum it up, this film is exactly why I love going to the cinema because every so often a gem like this comes along."
"bowmanblue","8","1","1","15 June 2015"," Slow and steady wins the race
","I normally hate slow films. If I say that a film is 'slow' then I normally mean that I'm completely bored with it. Or, if it's deliberately slow then it's probably just being pretentious with ideas above its station. 'No Country For Old Men' is slow. And I really enjoyed it.<br/><br/>It's a little hard to describe. I guess the basic plot is that Josh Brolin finds a suitcase of money in the middle of a drug deal gone wrong and decides to keep it. The only problem is that there's a complete psychopath on his trail who will stop at nothing to recover what is his (think 'The Terminator' but with a worse haircut). Tommy Lee Jones plays the local Sheriff on both their trails and, using the Terminator analogy, it's just a question of which one gets to Brolin first.<br/><br/>It's quite a long film with minimal dialogue. A lot of the time you're just watching the character as he goes about his (ill-gotten) business. When there is dialogue it's that kind of 'Tarantino-esque' rambling monologue which makes you wonder where it's going and is supposed to heighten the tension and show us important information regarding the character talking. This can sometimes get annoying, but, again, it works here.<br/><br/>Yes, it's slow, but it's brilliant (and nasty). Be prepared for some pretty grim and dark moments thrown in there and it certainly isn't a 'feel good' epic, but if you're in the mood for something a little less 'action-packed' than your average Hollywood blockbuster (and a lot nastier) then definitely give this one a go. It won't be for everyone and your current mood will probably dictate how you feel towards it afterwards."

A psychopathic hit-man relentlessly pursues him killing anyone who stands on his way. Now the film has some good ideas and themes in it. It shows us how greed can bring us no good. Lots of people died during Chigurh's pursuit of Moss like that poor driver who got killed because Moss attempted to flee in the guy's truck. The film was also suspenseful especially when Chigurh is around. The shootout scene was pretty good with no music in the background just pure suspense. The whole film barely has music giving us that bleak feeling. Javier Bardem gave a good performance. He was terrifying in almost every scene hoping he won't kill that poor person he meets. However, the film suffers for being quite confusing. I unfortunately didn't understand some of the dialogue and those Mexicans came out of nowhere and I didn't realize they killed Moss until going to Wikipedia (thought it was Anton).

","(Warning: also contains spoilers for Gone Girl, Nightcrawler and season 4 of Game of Thrones)<br/><br/>This is the third movie in a row I've seen where the antagonist (or at least an unsympathetic protagonist) wins. That's rapidly climbing up the list of my least favourite tropes in fiction, but I can look past it here. My stepfather's theory is that I have a strong sense of justice that it offends, but I think a more accurate reason is that it's just hard to pull off a satisfying conclusion where that happens. The previous two (Gone Girl and Nightcrawler) are movies I have made no secret that I hate, in spite of their critical acclaim. I would compare those characters to Joffrey from Game of Thrones. They're made out to be so awful in every respect that seeing them die (or at least arrested) would be the most satisfying thing that the movies could've done. But, unlike Joffrey, you don't get that satisfaction, and when you don't, the movie ends with you angry for it. I'm a film student, and I would jump at the chance to write a paper on the importance of satisfying endings. I can forgive a lot of things in a movie, but an ending that you want to boo is not one of them.<br/><br/>With that said, I think this movie deserves credit for not having that happen. Like I said, it's hard to pull off a satisfying conclusion where an unlikeable character comes out on top. This movie does it. And other than that, it's well written, well directed, well acted, has a few great lines in it, it's an all-around solid movie. I'd compare it to a more serious Fargo (another great movie), so I wasn't too surprised to find out this is also a Coen bros. movie.<br/><br/>If I had one gripe with it, it's that the main character dies off-screen and ostensibly not at the hands of the antagonist. Not sure I agree with that creative decision, but it may be faithful to the novel it's adapted from."

All the movie plotting is in the empty desert which growing ugly of the human heart. The scene that the antagonist talking with the old man in gas station was so impressive and show how cruel is the human is without much action. And the places that the protagonist and antagonist went was a same place but they can direct the mood of this two character very differently and making the cat and the rat feeling but the result of the hunting in this film was always miss your expectation even the ending of it. Unlike other western film that the protagonist always be the hero but for the ""No country for old man"" the villain win the game."

It's different from the Western Style movie. We can see by the ability of protagonist that everyone won. And the sheriff lose, if you can remember, it's 1 scene that the sheriff said he can not won because he's too tired. I can warn you that you can sleep while you watching because its silence but the actor that has a good play can make us feel fresh. It's show out a lot about the reflection of life in the social.

As the story sequences The movie is the story of bandits psychotic Anton Chigurh in first, followed by the Men's unfortunate Llewelyn Moss and culminating with Sheriff Ed Tom Bell, which would match the movie name No Country for Old Men, which means Tom can not do anything with any other character. In the past he understand the thief, but today he is the only man in uniform who can not pursue anything unlike the thief , and the young man seemed nervous glance we can see that the sheriff is always one step behind.

At first i didn't expect it to be this good. From the concept of the story and the cast that they picked to play the role in the movie, i will say that it is a very excellent choices. The setting of the movie is amazing which very represent the western principle, higher laws and fate of the movie.<br/><br/>The three main characters of this movie is well played by the actors, this make the character very alive and believable.<br/><br/>The lighting and sound effect of this movie are amazing. While you are watching it, it is like you are in the movie because of the light and sound that this movie provide. <br/><br/>The movie give a very thoughtful lesson in real life unlike other movie that ended with a happy ending but this movie is different.

","Very very good film, best l've seen in months.on par with Shawshank Redemption.a film were you don't want to get out of your seat. but one flaw that bugged me when I'm staring at the credit roll is that despite excellent cinematography and a strong cast, the film's plot meanders to a very unsatisfying end. While it's understood that Good doesn't always triumphant over Evil, the requisite show down between Livilin and Anton doesn't happen. This film had an abrupt ending that left many loose ends and frayed edges. The violence was mindless and not tasteful. Nevertheless violence aside, this movie has one of the greatest plot line I've ever seen. The Main protagonist represent a struggling man really well while showing a cold and mellow style which adds to the Thriller tone of the movie.<br/><br/>Western Frontier and Neo Noir genre is always my favorite, and this film blended both style of action like no other movie can.<br/><br/>This movie is a Classic and everyone should watch it at least once in their life"

But my friends and my professor were recommended me to watch it. After that, I felt very thankful to them for recommended this great movie.<br/><br/>No country for old men is beginning with the narrator, Ed Tom Bell; he became a sheriff in west Texas in 1980 just like his father and grandfather. Llewelyn Moss was hunting in the dessert and accidentally met with the dead of drug dealers and dogs. He found two million dollars in a satchel so he took the money home with him. Anton Chigurh is a hit-man who has been hired to recover the money, so he tracked the satchel by a transponder that concealed inside the satchel. Then this was a beginning of a violent chasing of Anton Chigurh.<br/><br/>I really like the special effect of wound because it is looks so real. Moreover, I really impress the main character, Javier Bardem that acts as Anton Chigurh. He could scare me by the way he act and express the feeling thought his eyes. It is looks very cold and heartless. However, I was a little bit disappointed in the story when Josh Brolin that acts as Llewelyn Moss who was very smart. He always survived from Anton Chigurh but the result wasn't what I am expected."

","""No Country for Old Men"" is a crime, drama, and thriller film that has three main characters which are Ed Tom Bell, Anton Chigurh, and Llewelyn Moss. This movie is a totally open-minded film because there are many conversations that deliver meaningful messages. The story progresses very slowly in order to make the viewers to get into the movie a little by little. Brief the plot: While Llewelyn Moss was hunting for animals, he found out that drug deal gone wrong and many people were dead. The only things left are drugs but no cash to be found. He then searched for the man who was supposed to be responsible for this and found out that that man died under the tree nearby with 2 million dollars in cash. Moss took the money; resulting in Anton Chigurh chasing Moss to get the money back while Ed Tom Bell was trailing Anton Chigurh to arrest him for his drug dealing crime. Finally, Moss was killed by a band of Mexicans to get their cash and Chigurh went to Carla, Moss' wife, to kill her. In the end, Chigurh was car crashed but he survived. The highlight of this movie is when Chigurh hunted Moss, on the way he killed many people with serenity and ruthless. The story drives slowly and there was no sound in the scene that Chigurh hunted Moss but it excited me by Chigurh's professional performance. In conclusion, the plot was not quite complex and the acting was excellent. Overall, this film is worth the time to see and is recommended by me."

This might be because it is far a lot more exciting and alert me throughout the whole film. Also the film consists many great actors so I pay more attention for it. I found the movie was just as I expected that it is going to be cowboy kinda look according to Coen brothers styles of directing. This is my first time watching Coen's movie I am impressed. The cowboy look and the tone of the movie makes me think it looks cool and very man kinda feeling from the characters. The plot was good, the character plays good, but I think it is because I'm not a fan of thriller movies so I would't say it is my favorite one.

Just when the audience sees Chigurh(Javier barden) before holding his gun to look for Moss. It make us almost breathless. Movies can make a dramatic thrill to the audience and that's incredible to watch. This is probably because of background story of the fundamental character of Chigurh is good so that people who watch could the blood splatter every time, when Chigurh appeared. The plot of the film was very distinguished. Movies do not have to have someone to talk to so many different situations.

But it turns out to very different direction at the end, so some may feel disappoint. Like me for example first I was very disappointed but when I think of it me it leaves audiences to know for more and for my opinions it leads to alternate endings according to individuals.<br/><br/>So yes, I would recommend friends and others to watch it and interpret in their own ways, I might say even the plot is quite confusing but it doesn't over power the suspense and intelligently in this movie.

Javier Bardem is the creepiest of villains by his deliberate attitude towards the truth embodied by the coin flip scene at the gas station. James Brolin is the man convinced he can beat evil, but it's coming from all over and Tommy Lee Jones is the conscience of the film with the epiphany that there is no stopping such evil.The West Texas community comes across as good folk, predictable but blind to what's coming.

Javier Bardem is memorable as a menacing killer Anton Chigurh who's after Josh Brolin (also great). The third main character is sheriff Tommy Lee Jones, who can't understand the brutality of an ever-changing world. The film is at times dense, with many issues subtly raised.

Maybe thats what the Coens wanted,maybe they got the film into the editing suite and thought, this is way too mainstream , lets put some random scenes of pointless drifting dialogue to make it look different. Which ever way you slice it,most of Jones' scenes could and should have been trimmed. Otherwise this film is great and i encourage you to see it if not only for Javier Bardem."

It could ensure that since 1989 I have not lost a movie that has been in billboard in my country. In high school I worked on a blockbuster and god, take the five free rentals plus some colleagues rentals to see more and more movies that I was messing. Today I can say that I see 50% of the film quality at the time they are in billboard and the rest in the red and cinema entertainment wait for the DVD. Well, I thought that everything y said before would need to be able to say this explanation: While this movie actually is so far the most perfect piece that the Cohen brothers have built and also, the fact of seeing the performance as bad from Javier Bardem is a good experience, I must add the idea that is truly desperate what is happening. Apparently many of the critics and spectators have or have omitted the masterly performance of Josh Brolin, personally analyzed this: every time that comes to table Brolin fills the screen. While the appearance of Bardem and the characterization absorb you a bit, the reality is that the performance of Brolin is much more in line with the perfection of the tables. In addition to this the character of Tommy Lee Jones is a character generator of balance an archetype that still can not describe.

","10 out of 10... most of the time when I see a review with 10 out of 10 I disregard it as a disingenuous momentary grandeur. However, No Country for Old Men is a fantastic movie. But why? Why is this movie so great... it's been out merely 1 week and it's already the 55th best movie ever made as of 11/21. To follow the same outline as the plot, the answer to that question is complicated.<br/><br/>No Country for Old Men follows a lucky middle aged welder who happens to be in the right place at the right time (or wrong time). Throughout the movie, you follow protagonists and antagonists - the lines between them are blurred, and you never quite know who to keep sympathy for, and who to feel animosity towards. The real gem of this movie is how realistic each character is portrayed. The viewer will feel a deep connection with every single character that is introduced. The movie is filled with emotion, surprises, twists, and momentary quips of humor. The atmosphere created by the director is truly something to cherish, this movie hits the perfect pitch when it comes to this - a true rarity in todays motion picture industry.<br/><br/>If you find my review a bit ambiguous, then I've prepared you well. A good movie makes the viewer feel insignificant and truly a spectator - and you will not be disappointed in the least by this movie. I can best compare No Country for Old Men with other fantastic gems such as Pulp Fiction, and Kill Bill. But, the action, story telling, and character development is far superior. There is a reason this movie is rated so highly, it truly is a timeless instant classic - I'm still amazed by the film. One of the most important things this movie conveys is a message... but what you take from the movie is on your own accord."

","Similar to the comments made by many others here who like the body of work by the brothers Coen, No Country for Old Men is an excellent addition. It is one of those rare movies that I dwell on for days, thinking back on the movie and further contemplating what I experienced: the breath taking imagery, the dialog, the way the scene was filmed, etc. It was a movie that dazzled the senses and engrossed the intellect. <br/><br/>There are ample areas that could be discussed as to why this is flick is getting such high ratings here on the IMDb (I give it 10 out of 10, and there are very few movies that I would rate as such). As I have read the comments, many of them seem to be for all the right reasons. In summary: -TLJ certainly provided probably his best work ever as a supporting actor -Javier Bardem (who?) portrayed a most vile yet mesmerizing and memorable psychopath -Josh Brolin gave a solid performance as a man who only wanted to improve his lot in the world -Sensational supporting cast -The score (or lack thereof) was brilliantly woven into the story that unfolded -The imagery that we all come to expect from the Coen's -Oscar nominations for both Coen brothers<br/><br/>However, one thing that I keep dwelling upon that I have not yet seen comments about is the randomness that permeated every aspect of this movie. True, the violence certainly had an in your face random quality throughout, but many parts of life seemed to have a random quality to it as well. One is left to wonder just how much of life is random, ranging from the joys and positive experiences we all encounter to the absolute horror that would possibly be experienced if such violence were to be thrust upon us. <br/><br/>Certainly No Country For Old Men will also stand the test of time, it will for me at any rate. That translates into making the short list of Must See Classics; which means I'll buy it and watch many more times for many years to come."

To summarize the beginning for those who want to look at this miserable movie: You have 1 guy in the desert for a day on the sun with no water!! He crosses path with some death bodies and trucks. He finds money and returns in the evening home. Nothing scary in that.

","A sheriff in West Texas stumbles across a drug deal gone wrong. He is left hunting an innocent man who has taken the money from the deal (two million dollars) and the hit-man who killed the dealers and is trying his best to kill the man with the money. Throw in gun fights, secret stashes and border-crossing and you've got yourself the Coen Brothers' best film in years.<br/><br/>What makes this film great (aside from the gorgeous cinematography) is also what makes it confusing for many people. The film is a bait and switch: we think we are watching a film about shoot-outs and men trying to escape the law with the loot (the same as any other Western or gangster story out there). And, to some degree, we are. But more importantly we are being told a lesson about fate and chance: we can live or die in any instance, either because we are destined to do so or merely by chance. While it's not common to accept both possibilities, this film makes a convincing case.<br/><br/>The Coen Brothers love having the ""unstoppable evil"" character. Take, for example, John Goodman in ""Barton Fink"". And they definitely deliver with the hit-man Chigurh (who also carries the burden of fate and chance with him). Many great scenes exist in this film, but one that stood out the most for me was early in the film when Chigurh confronts a gas station attendant. I don't know if even a knife could cut that tension. The suspense was strong, and I was literally on the edge of my seat (which happens to be a futon in this case).<br/><br/>This film is tied with ""There Will Be Blood"" for most Oscar nominations in 2007 (and at the time of this writing has not yet been judged). The tally is eight, and I can't agree more with this. 2007 was a good year for films (I also loved ""Juno"") and this ranks as one of the best, if not the very best. Even if you don't ""get it"" (I didn't at first and maybe still don't fully), you'll like this movie. Tommy Lee Jones, playing a cop for the 100th time, has perfected it. And Josh Brolin comes hot off of ""Planet Terror"" to show us he's ready to be a headliner. Show him some support."

Being directed by the Coen brothers I assumed that this movie was going to be one of a kind.<br/><br/>From the trailer I saw nothing but good things, my kind of movie, lots of action, lots of suspense, a thriller if you must. The first half of the movie or so is an absolute masterpiece, I was on the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next. Tommy Lee Jones adds a good comic effect while Javier Bardem,the bad guy, was perfect in this movie, the sense of darkness he brings to the film is spectacular.<br/><br/>But that is where it stops. After leaving the movie I was upset to say the least that I could barely discuss the movie with my friends. It felt like the Coen brothers were like well we are done, the first half of the movie we made is awesome so lets just not do anything for the second half of the movie just to tick people off. There is little to say about the end of the movie other than the fact that there is really no end to it at all and just leaves you mad enough you could rip your hair out.<br/><br/>The bad guy gets away, Tommy Lee Jones Retires, and the main character, they don't even really show how he dies. The second half of this movie I much rather would have been doing something more productive with my life than to watch that attempt of a movie. I was so mad that I spent a lousy 5 dollars on it. Do not go see this movie in theaters. Wait for the DVD and even then I would be spectacle about watching it.<br/><br/>Coen brothers really messed this one up and possibly could have made one of the best movies of all times if they decided to show up for the second half."
"agmuradov","10","5","12","22 November 2007"," The Coen's best film to date
","Ever since Fargo and The Big Lebowski, the Coen brothers seem to have gone down hill. The Ladykillers and Intolerable Cruelty are very much below what these two are capable of creating. However, they're back and better than ever. No Country for Old Men isn't one of their best films, it is their best film by far.<br/><br/>No Country for Old Men opens with a narration from Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones). ""I always knew you had to be willing to die to even do this job - not to be glorious. But I don't want to push my chips forward and go out and meet something I don't understand."" Within the next five minutes, we know exactly what he means by that. The first time Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) is introduced, he has been arrested and taken to the police station. While the officer is making a phone call, Chigurh quietly maneuvers to get his handcuffs from behind his back to the front of his body. After the officer finishes the call, Chigurh walks from behind and chokes the officer to death using his handcuffs. Using the deputy's car, he pulls over a motorist, kills him with a cattle gun and swaps cars.<br/><br/>Out in the desert, Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin), a Vietnam veteran and welder, hunts for antelope. After failing to kill his target, he stumbles upon the bloody aftermath of a drug deal gone wrong. Everyone is dead except for one man pleading for water. Moss finds the drugs and knows that there could be money around. He turns out to be correct. Pondering on the situation for a while, he decides to take it. Later that night, his conscience gets the better of him. He fills a jug of water and drives back to the scene of the crime. Unfortunately for Llewellyn, the man appears to be dead and two men in a pickup truck park next to his car (which he parked far away) and slash his tires. The men spot Moss and send him on a chase, even using their dog to attack. Moss escapes and tells his wife to pack so she can stay with her mother while he devises a plan to outsmart the men who are after him. One of those men is Chigurh.<br/><br/>Moving at a methodical pace, No Country for Old Men builds it tension to a level rarely, if ever, seen in a film. There's one scene involving Moss and Chigurh in a hotel that scared me shitless. Chigurh, using a transponder, locates the room Moss is staying in. For about a minute or two, nothing happens, as each man braces himself for the confrontation. A similar situation happens between Chigurh and another character later.<br/><br/>The acting is nothing short of exceptional. The main and supporting actors are on top of their game. Josh Brolin is having a breakout year, acting in In the Valley of Ellah, Grindhouse, American Gangster, and now this. Tommy Lee Jones played a similar role in his own movie, The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, but his emotional range appears to be much greater here. Although these two actors are great here, Javier Bardem steals the show.<br/><br/>Anton Chigurh might be as frightening of a villain as Hannibal Lector, if not more so. His stiff posture, menacing stare, calculated word usage, emotionless expressions, unorthodox principles and remorseless killings make him appear to be not human. In some ways he is human and other ways more of an idea, like the embodiment of violence. He views his himself as a person carrying out fate and thus has a detachment from his victims. His background is a mystery because anyone who knows something about him is dead.<br/><br/>Artistically, the film is superb. Seeing the vast emptiness of the desert in the first few scenes recalls similar images in Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns. The minimalist music score heightens the tension and allows every sound to be heard.<br/><br/>The film's transition from an impressive thriller into philosophical territory elevates its lasting effect. All of the complaints from people about the third act are bullshit. The supposed ""plot holes"" some mention are a result of their lack of attention to details. Also, people expecting non-stop nonsensical violence are going to be disappointed. There's a lot more to this than just the thriller elements.<br/><br/>Just as No Country for Old Men opens with a narration from Bell, he ends the film with one too. He describes a dream he has about him and his father. It may be the only optimistic scene in this very bleak film."
"ElijahCSkuggs","10","5","12","18 November 2007"," The Embodiment of Evil
","NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is the Coen brothers best and most violent work to date, and arguably, has the best ensemble of actors this year.<br/><br/>Set in New Mexico, the story begins with a local hunter/welder named Llewelyn Moss stumbling across a rotting group of pickups and corpses. He carefully makes his way through the bodies, picking up spare guns and ammo, and eventually comes across a case of two million dollars, the lone key to an early retirement for him and his wife, Carla Jean. He goes home for a short while, then due to certain earlier events, Moss returns to the scene of the crime to hopefully clear his conscience. From there on out, NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN roars off into the realm of classic cat and mouse cinema, and the villain Anton Chigurh is introduced.<br/><br/>Void of music, NC4OM relies on the sound of boots and bullets in a way that I've never experienced. Every sound, however minute, brings forth an air of tension not commonly seen in films; from the soft clang of Chigurh's cannister to the empty wind that circulates the barren wasteland of the southwest, sound is used perfectly in this film.<br/><br/>The cinematography is exceptional; the wide open spaces and blue skies encompass the screen with such a majesty that one feels tempted to flee the confines of the theater and walk among the desert and shrubs. As long as Anton is far from sight.<br/><br/>NC4OM is really pretty flawless film making, and despite the perfect score there were a couple very minor questions that remained unanswered(I'm sure the book will clarify), but all in all, from the direction to the acting, from the sound to the cinematography, and then everything in between, this film was great.<br/><br/>The film's most lasting impression however is the character of Anton Chigurh, Moss' inexorable assailant whose personal philosophy and moral weight instantly catapults him to judge, jury and executioner. He is evil in every form of the word, and could very well be interpreted as a walking Armageddon or perhaps even Satan. Javier Bardem is great in this role, and will most likely have to battle Casey Affleck /Ed Harris/Steve Zahn for any best supporting actor nominations this year. Though of course, there would be little deliberation if Anton Chigurh had anything to do with it."

","What else is there to say? I was really excited to see this movie as I've heard it's supposed to be a very adequate portrayal of a true psychopath. And that must lead to something interesting. Right. <br/><br/>But there is no depth what so ever to the storytelling. The characters are anonymous to the point that it's just frustrating, and the killing spree is not even one bit exciting cause there is too little background story of the characters. No soul. No feelings. <br/><br/>It could've been a great movie if they added background stories to the main characters to avoid the disturbing anonymousness. And to actually create a story more than man finds money, money leads to trouble, leading to anonymous people getting shot. And also there are motels. That's basically it. <br/><br/>I felt nothing more during this movie than hope for it to get exciting and dark. Then left ending up with just frustration, disappointment, confusion. <br/><br/>It's not a good movie. And to make it a good movie they'd have to create something completely different. With a plot. With soul. Something to grasp. Something that makes one feel. <br/><br/>The scenery and quality of filming appears pretty authentic though."

","A most implausible movie. Events occur in a world in which no one seems to notice anything. (1) Opening: man lugging gas cylinder walks out of substation, drives off in police car.

Driver politely waits. No other cars pass during this scene. (3) For the rest of the movie, no APB is ever sent out for the assassin. (4) In the seedy hotel scene, (a) desk clerk killed - no one notices; (b) two characters exchange volleys of shots for about five minutes - no police cars ever appear. (5) Tommy Lee Jones character apparently drives his pick-up from Del Rio to El Paso - about 450 miles - rather than just telephone a warning. (6) In hotel, shotgun-wielding assassin approaches PI. No one notices. And PI, knowing assassin is an assassin, politely goes with him to hotel room, where he (the PI) can quietly get shotgunned. (7) End of movie: (a) woman returns home, there's assassin, sitting in chair, Rather than turning around and running out, she apparently stays to chat (and die). (b) assassin leaves; another car hits him. No one notices. No one calls police. He talks with two boys, buys a shirt to wrap his broken arm and walks away.

"restin_him","3","4","9","28 November 2008"," Weakness comes in the lack of meaning
","No Country for Old Men is a sad indicator of films today. There are many great actors but they move around in a shallow story doing their best.<br/><br/>The story is supposed to follow a Texas man who comes across the remains of a drug deal gone bad. He soon finds two million in cash and in a series of poor choices ends up being hunted by a psychotic killer. An old sheriff is the lone law man who seems to understand what is happening making the final connections between the bloody drug deal, other murders, and the Texans running from town.<br/><br/>In all the actors did a good job which helps to elevate the gross flaws in this film. We get a rich and psychotic man, a lone Texan trying to survive, and on older sheriff seeking his dreams of what the past was. The problem comes that there is no depth to the story or to the characters beyond a few words and poorly written scenes.<br/><br/>The story shows us no meaning behind anything we see in the film. It is like watching a poorly done newscast. I see people and know of events but they are so distant from us the viewers. Why do I care about this man running from the killer? Who is he? What is his life like? What is this sheriffs desire for seeking the old times? Where is the wisdom he seems to have grounded in? What is the sheriffs desire in combating the evil he sees growing in the world he lives in? What is this killers hidden code? What is his role in this entire thing? These empty characters move around on the screen in bloody shot outs and fights giving us little to care about. No emotion is felt through out the film and when characters do die they are easily shrugged off as simple objects.<br/><br/>Beyond the character issues we have a poorly executed story. We know nothing of what is taking place beyond, man hunts man and kills others. Several ""major"" players are introduced to fill us in but their scenes fills nothing in and is to short to make us care about the story as a whole. We also meet smaller players who are supposed to give us insight into the story and other characters but once again their actions and involvement amounts to nothing.<br/><br/>This film points out how shallow the movie industry has become. No one cares about growth and story, they simply wish to see stuff move around, things to blow up, and people to get shot. With a few exceptions shallow stories like this and others will continue to dominate the theaters with wild applause while quality is ignored."

"cranberry-1","4","4","9","24 March 2008"," Lack of continuity spoiled the film
","While the film got my attention, its ""pulp fiction"" level of violence and extreme evilness made it difficult to find of high cinematic achievement. Its lack of continuity and requirement of reading between scenes also made it difficult to watch. For example the near encounter of Sheriff Bell and Chigur at the motel was as unrealistic as Chigur being hired to find the money. The lack of an ending with Chigur seems intentional so that a sequel of more gratuitous violence and gore will be pushed on to the public. While film makers should have the creative license to make the movies they want, members of the audience also have the right to not see films of extreme violence and evil that have little cinematic value. I will not pay to see the sequel."
"Mighty_sheman","4","4","9","8 March 2008"," Oh dear, another pointless film from the Coens.
","Oh lord, yesterday I made a grave error, having gone months without watching a film that irked me enough to rant on IMDb I went and watched 2 Oscar winning stinkers in one fateful night - No Country for Old Men and There Will be Blood. I still can't decide which one was worse. I do still have a faint hope that the supposed great white 'saviours' of American cinema, the brothers Coen and PT Anderson, will one day create a film that has a point and will therefor finally elevate their work above the level of stylish, pseudo intellectual nihilism, however that slim hope is dying fast, much like the cast in the sorry excuse for a film that presented itself to me last night.<br/><br/>So, here we have NCFOM (for short) an adaptation of the Cormac McCarthy novel of the same name, set in the (beautifully captured) dusty deserts of Texas. I have never seen such a pointless waste of film since I saw yawner flick Factotum at Christmas :)<br/><br/>So what's the deal? Well we have a drugs deal that got a little messy and a sad loser (Brolin) stumbles upon said mess and eventually a satchel full of cash under the arm of a dead Mexican, so he takes it home. Great. Then, after struggling to get to sleep that night, he goes back to the scene to give water to some thirsty drug baddie he heartlessly left on death's door earlier in the day. Much to his surprise there is someone there looking for their missing millions! Why on earth did he go back to the scene of the crime you ask? Pah, don't go looking for logic here, this is a metaphorical piece.<br/><br/>So Mr.Loser now has the angry baddies on his case, after a chase scene involving a river and a pit bull (which of course he dispatches right at the last possible moment) he makes it back to his trailer and tells his wife (Mcdonald) he is in trouble and she should get her purty little ass to her mother's and wait until it all blows over. Here begins the cat and mouse game, a rapidly downward spiral which runs out of tension just after the hour mark. Our loser soon has the baddest bad ass of all on his trail in the form of Anton Chigurh (Bardem), the very personification of relentless evil who is on the war path and looking for the stolen cash to keep all to himself (he shoots the guys who hired him). Added to this we have a world weary old cop (Tommy Lee Jones) musing about the hopeless state of the world, his dreary monologues (which may require subtitles for those outside the U.S) act as the commentary for this crazy caper. So you get the drift, it's a story about greed, human weakness and chance. As one character states, 'you can't stop what's coming'. How very profound...<br/><br/>From the start Bardem's maniac killer, admittedly played to perfection by a great actor, just blasts his way through whoever is in front of him, at times even deciding their fate on the flip of a coin (great use of symbolism, eh?). So what does this monster represent? Death, fate, evil itself? Who really cares. By the end of the first half hour I knew fine well where this film was heading and that this emotionless cipher would indeed prove to be unstoppable. It's a depressingly predictable film, perhaps that was part of the 'point', even if that is the case it doesn't make the film any better. That is the big problem with No Country For Old Men, it's so uninspired and worn out, we've seen it all before. It's nothing new, clever, bold or even entertaining. The themes it tries to examine might be relevant to the times we live in but when presented in the form of a one note package like NCFOM does it make an interesting nights viewing? Not in my book, not even close.<br/><br/>Technically it is well executed of course but who really wants to watch a guy clean his bloody wounds or blast nameless characters in the head with a bolt gun? Or is this what people consider great cinema now? The Coen's are nothing but spiritually empty show offs and this film is the perfect illustration of that fact. They don't have much to express worth seeing or hearing. I don't have a problem with show offs if they can back up their extravagance with substance. Take James Joyce for example, he was also an unapologetic show off but his work was more than just a showcase for his technical brilliance with prose, it offered entertaining and humorous insights into the nature of humanity and existence. That is something the Coens and many other so called 'artists' can only ever dream of achieving. It is what separates the true artists from the wannabes.<br/><br/>So to sum up, for some viewers No Country For Old Men may be a gripping tale of the ascension of evil over good, for me it's nothing more than a rather uninspired example of the ascension of style over substance. 2 Stars for Bardem's disturbing turn, 1 star for a few moments of early tension and 1 for photography, 0 for the script."

"jemmytee","5","4","9","18 February 2008"," I don't get the hype over this movie.
","Talk about a movie not living up to its promise. I finally went to see ""No Country For Old Men"" because so many people were waxing eloquently about how wonderful it is and how deep and meaningful, I felt like I had to see it for myself. And while it's well-made, it's not the Coen Brothers' best or even most meaningful film. Not by a long shot.<br/><br/>The story is simple -- a man stumbles onto a pile of loot and decides to keep it, and all hell breaks loose, with bodies racking up left, right and sideways. And that's all there is to it. Yes, this story has wide open ""Texas"" landscapes (mostly shot in New Mexico) and taciturn heroes (a sheriff who's seen too much and a cowboy who thinks he's smarter than he is) and a ""really nasty"" villain who somehow manages to wander around with this huge cow-killer thing but not get caught by the Texas Rangers (preposterous) or even get noticed by the locals or chased or anything, even though he starts the story off by strangling a deputy fool enough to turn his back on him. Granted, this is set in 1980 and they didn't have the insta-communication we have today...but the casualness people in this movie have towards a COP BEING KILLED? In Texas?! Puh-lease! But that's just the beginning. From that point on, we're treated to a non-stop series of incidents where absurdity is piled onto ludicrous blindness and stupidity is mixed in, all in the name of making some ""grand statement"" about the sadness of violence and evil and Latino-devils. I sat there numbly watching this movie just keep going and going like some EveryReady Bunny ignoring its illogical storyline...and finally all I could wonder is, ""Why do people think this is so damn good?"" Seriously, the Coen brothers did a ten-times better version of the story in ""Fargo,"" and nailed every point they wanted to make about violence and greed.<br/><br/>On the good side, Josh Brolin, Tommy Lee Jones and Kelly Macdonald did wonders with barely written roles (especially seeing as how Kelly's Scottish). The cinematography was fantastic. The sound brilliant. But I don't get the wild praise for Javier Bardem's killer, Chigurh; it seemed very one-note to me. However...I did find it interesting he's the most honorable man in the group, the only one you can count on to keep his word. Woody Harrelson and Tess Harper were wasted. As for the ending that people seem to think is a let-down or just trails off into ""huh,"" to me it made perfect sense...considering how I feel about the rest of this meaningless movie.<br/><br/>Of course, it'll probably win the Oscar, thanks to all the hype. But if you want to see a well-done film about money and violence and good men making horrible decisions that have disastrous consequences and the evil man chasing them, check out Sam Rami's ""A Simple Plan"" (which must be where Cormac McCarthy got his idea for his book). You get a LOT more meaning and none of the hype."
"jdkraus","9","4","9","11 February 2008"," Well done...except for the ending
","If I can sum up ""No Country for Old Men"" in a few words I would call it a movie of violent consequences. Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin) stumbles upon an aftermath of a drug deal gone wrong. Amidst the dead bodies and heroin, he steals a suitcase that has over $2 million in it. Little does he know what lies ahead of him and what kind of people are after him, including Mexican drug dealers and a psychopathic hit man named Anton Chigurh who likes leaving a trail of dead bodies. With this in motion, the town's sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) discovers the drug deal aftermath and later comes to realize the players behind the slaughter as well as Llewellyn. Can he save Llewellyn and stop the bloody trail?<br/><br/>By far, on Javier Bardem's acting as Anton Chigurh, he performs among the most monstrous and frightening villains I have seen on the big screen. He's not like a hit man in a Quentin Tarantino film who smiles, smokes, and dances, wears flashy clothes and is often predictable in his actions. Instead, Javier as Anton is more along the lines of Norman Bates. He's quiet, at most unpredictable, smart, cunning, and emotionless. There is no doubt he will get the Oscar for actor in supporting. If he doesn't, that would be a real shame. <br/><br/>In addition, the screenplay by the Coen brothers is brilliant as is their directing talents of making suspense, thrills, and drama. I was on the edge of seat throughout the film. What was nice about this movie is that it does not rely on music to build a suspenseful moment like an M. Night Shyamalan film. Instead, the camera angles and the actors' talents made it intense. The only music I remember hearing in the film was for the ending credits. <br/><br/>Josh Brolin is a pretty good protagonist. He's does not play superman-like character, but a man who is just like anyone else, but in a situation that no one would ever want to be in. Woody Harrelson was only in the movie for about a half hour; he still holds to his sense of humor and charm. <br/><br/>But the weak line I felt in this film was Tommy Lee Jones. He starts the film with an introduction and for the first ninety minutes of the film is a supporting character. With the last half hour of the film, after the unexpected death of the protagonist, Tommy Lee Jones jumps in as the new good guy. He figures everything out at the end, but doesn't try to track down the bad guys, leaving them to escape Scott free. I almost felt like I was watching a totally different film in the last thirty minutes. The suspense diminishes and it drags with Tommy Lee Jones looking tired and depressed. He then closes the film by mumbling some lines about a couple of dreams he had, which reflects his failures of protecting Llewellyn Moss and his wife, and then the film fades to black.<br/><br/>There was quite a few murmurs of disappointment in the theater that I was in. There's no resolution at the end. Maybe this was the directors' doing or if that's how the book ended. Either way, I wanted to know what would happen next. However, the ending gives the implication that the world is full of wicked and crazy people like Anton, but there are also people out there who try to track them down. Unfortunately the hero doesn't get him in this film. <br/><br/>As I said in the first paragraph, this film is about violence. It was every as bad as Martin Scorsese's The Departed if not worse in some scenes. There's nothing pleasant or stylish about it like in 300. In fact, several people in the theater with me gasped by the graphic depiction of the violence. When it means ""rated R for strong graphic violence"", it means it. <br/><br/>I will say this was a very well done movie, but not the best film of the year. I won't be surprised if this wins picture and director at the Oscars, but my vote is for There Will Be Blood over this one. There's a more solid story there. 9/10"

","I walked into No Country For Old Men expecting a boring ""artsy"" movie with little action or moral merit. I left the theatre contemplating the intricate messege the film coveys, and am still, weeks later, trying to understands its overall meaning.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie Tommy Lee Jone's character Ed Tom Bell says many things that allude to the ending of the film in which evil prevails. When Sugar in the end of the movie escapes from the car crash and Ed retires, a monologue is given by Ed Tom Bell in which alludes to a dark and yet ever relevant concept. <br/><br/>The book and the movie both convey the idea that evil has been around forever, and that no matter what good men do, evil will evolve to prevent it. This concept can be observed as a common theme through the movie, and even in the speeches given by Ed Tom Bell. <br/><br/>In the middle of the film he tells the story of a kid who murdered a fourteen year old girl, and knew that he was going to hell. Bell then says that men who do not understand something should not attempt to confront it because it will over come them, hence the title ""No Country For Old Men"". That no matter who you are and what you do evil will still be around.<br/><br/>This is truly one of the greatest movies I have ever seen."
"indianajones7895","10","4","9","5 January 2008"," The definition of a perfect film.
","I haven't seen a film since The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King that can be called, in the truest sense of the word, a masterpiece. No Country for Old Men is exactly that, a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Aside from the aforementioned Lord of the Rings trilogy, there has never been a happier marriage of book to film. If you were looking for someone to translate the already cinematic prose of Cormac McCarthy's brilliant novel, the Coen brothers would be the ones for the job. The first ting I found so particularly striking was the way in which the film made you believe that each of the cast members seem as if they've been steeped for years in McCarthy-ite atmosphere. To make matters even more stunning, through as the high tension throughout the film there is no super-charged cathartic climax. Instead, I find myself feeling that the way in which it ends keeps the story truly tied to the heart of the novel.<br/><br/>The film succeeds on every level and delivers in spades. The directing, acting, script, editing, cinematography, editing, and everything else is beyond superb. What made the film even more unique and terrifying was the complete lack of any music throughout the entirety of it. It's a brilliant and bold move by the Coen brothers that only adds more depth to the tension and terror felt throughout the story. Unlike most recent releases, this film easily finds itself in my top list of favorites with only one viewing. It was just that brilliant. I find myself at a loss for more words to describe the greatness of this film, mostly because I find it incredibly difficult to describe perfection. This film will find its place in American cinema for years to come and will be one of my favorites for a very long time."

It isn't the contrived answer to all of what is wrong or what is expected to give finality for the sake of finality.<br/><br/>The conventional movie goer would probably not appreciate this film as much as I did, more to be enjoyed by the non-conformist spirit."
"evanston_dad","9","4","9","2 December 2007"," A Minor American Classic, Friendo
","""No Country for Old Men,"" the Coen brothers' screen adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's nailbiter of a novel, is doggedly faithful to its source, which will please fans of the book, but which is also what limits it from achieving greatness. As it is, the movie will probably and deservedly be remembered as a minor classic, but that's due more to its execution than it is its subject matter. It's as accomplished as ""Fargo,"" still the Coens' best movie in my opinion, but it doesn't carry a powerful message the way that film did, or have any characters who make a lasting impression.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin plays a Vietnam veteran living in Texas sometime in the early 1980s who comes across a satchel of money ($2 million to be exact) at the scene of a drug deal gone bad. He takes off with it, his arrogance leading him to believe that he will be able to outsmart whoever comes looking for it. Who comes looking for it is Anton Chigurgh, a relentless psycho who's as untraceable as he is unstoppable (played by Javier Bardem). Tommy Lee Jones plays sheriff Ed Tom Bell, who provides the film with a voice over narration in which he laments the state of the world and the awful nature of crime in his day as compared to those of his dad and granddad, both sheriffs before him. In McCarthy's novel, all of this is told in clipped and deadly serious language, and it all feels more full of philosophical import than it is; it's not until you've put the book down and start thinking about it that you realize how lightweight it is. I was interested to see if the Coens would bring any depth to the material that wasn't inherently there. They don't. Therefore, the movie is supremely engrossing and suspenseful, and I hung on every scene and image they put on the screen, but it didn't feel like an important movie to me. On the other hand, who says that every movie has to be important? <br/><br/>The Coens bring some of their trademark ghoulish humor to the film, which was welcome, because I thought McCarthy could have lightened up a bit himself in the novel. The film feels oddly unemotional, mostly because all of the principal action revolves around characters who aren't remotely sympathetic (including Brolin's, who's a bit of a jerk really, when you think about it). The warmest character in the film is Brolin's wife, played in a lovely performance by the Scottish actress Kelly McDonald, but her part is tiny, and the character herself has little to do other than look perplexed or suspicious. I thought Bardem lacked the menace necessary to pull off Chigurgh, who's more of a supernatural representation of evil than a real character; I couldn't help but think what Benicio Del Toro could have done with the role. And Woody Harrelson pops up miscast as a hit-man, in a role as pointless in the movie as it is in the book.<br/><br/>But again, all of these weaknesses were things the Coens inherited from the source material. They've made the best movie possible of McCarthy's novel, and ""No Country for Old Men"" easily joins ""Fargo,"" ""Blood Simple,"" ""Miller's Crossing,"" and ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" at the top of their canon.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

"Cosmoeticadotcom","5","3","6","1 September 2010"," Mediocre
","The film, as shown above, is often called a thriller or Gothic, but neither term really applies. It's not Gothic because it is too tied to the earthen landscape, and it's barely a thriller, because, well, it's so predictable. It's simply a monster movie- a bit more realistic than the Hannibal Lecter/Freddy Krueger sort, but not much. One wonders what the film would have been like if the assassin Chigurh had been more like the hit-man character played by Forest Whitaker in Ghost Dog: The Way Of The Samurai, Jim Jarmusch's underrated film about an assassin, which is also one of the most realistic depictions of organized crime on film. R, perhaps he could be more erratically real, like Johnny Boy, Robert De Niro's psychotic character from Martin Scorsese's Mean Streets, another realistic depiction of organized crime. Instead, what does Chigurh offer besides The Terminator and The Joker? Yes, another Batman foe, Two-Face's obsession with coin flipping to decide whether or not he commits murder. Perhaps in his construction of the novel, McCarthy thought that this device was somehow deep or profound, that it lent Chigurh the status of cosmic force of nature, but what it really did was explicitly tie the character down to a comic book level realism. And, incidentally, Two-Face was played by Jones in 1995's Batman Forever.<br/><br/>But, to get back to the point I raised, the film is SO predictable. Do we not know how Chigurh's victims will end up? Do we not know that he will escape at the end, despite the bone of the car crash tossed in to make it seem like cosmic justice will out? Do we not know Moss is a dead man? That is wife is also a walking corpse? That Sheriff Bell will prove as incompetent as he is apathetic? And, I earlier mentioned the overrated Thomas Paul Anderson film, There Will Be Blood, but since both films so posture themselves on 'depth' in dealing with their amoral characters, it's a wonder why so few critics took these films to task for never truly delving into that amorality. Great, amoral characters- see Films, Slasher (20th Century). Yawn. Yet, of the two films, and even laden with its own considerable flaws, it still has some occasionally interesting moments wrought by the acting abilities of Daniel Day-Lewis (although that film's lead character is not amongst his best). Is there a single character in this film with a fifth of the complexity of Lewis's Daniel Plainview, even considering how thin that character is developed? No. Simple. No. And that is the same answer to give to the query over whether this film is worth rewatching.<br/><br/>On to the DVD features. There are three disks- one to download a digital copy onto one's PC (thanks, I'll pass), then the disk with the film. Unfortunately, it lacks an audio commentary. One of the prime things a DVD has in its favor, as a mode of visual art, is the ability to feature commentaries on films, and barring a Woody Allen-like decision yo always forego such, it is incumbent upon DVD companies to include such, especially to supplement mediocre films like this. The disk also has a good making of featurette, a film on working with the Coen Brothers, and a small piece on Tommy Lee Jones' character. The final disk has a bevy of features: a tongue in cheek featurette shot by Josh Brolin, and a slew of clips regarding the promotion of the film over several months- from interviews to book store appearances to radio interviews. All in all, a decent bonus features package. But, the lack of audio commentary is glaring.<br/><br/>As for the film itself, on the technical side, the cinematography by Roger Deakins is solid to good. At times the views of West Texas are very Antonionian, whereas, at others, little is made of perspective, framing, and editing. Carter Burwell's scoring leaves no impression, one way or the other. The acting is rather pedestrian- from the stilted Bardem to the so laid back he's barely acting Jones to the solid Brolin. And, as I opened this essay by stating, some things are better excerpted. This film's trailer is proof, for it is engaging, unlike the film. The last 15 or so minutes of the film, after Moss's death, are utterly superfluous, for they add nothing to the plot, which is the primum mobile of the film. The film would have been much better had its rather incisive portrayals of small town Texans and their quirks been given more screen time, and then a reduced scenario of the drug chase, with more realistic characters, were added to that brew. But, alack, this might require work, and thought, and too often, in Hollywood (including the vaunted Coen Brothers) these sorts of things simply cannot be bothered with. Instead, the small time characters flit in and out of this film with such rapidity that they are lucky that a few of them rise above stereotypes. Fair enough, I guess, if you consider film a business first. I consider it an art first, so be equally fair and give the Coens the same in return as they gave to their screenplay: don't bother with their film. After all, your time and money are as precious as any film investor's. No?"
"johnnyboyz","10","3","6","2 December 2009"," Brilliantly woven and perfectly executed, No Country for Old Men will surely be a film that etches itself into modern movie folklore.
","The Coen Brothers' late 2007, early 2008 film No Country for Old Men has very, very quickly embedded itself as one of my favourites of the contemporary age of film-making. I've seen it a number of times now, two times of which have been in recent months alone – here is a film I get odd chills in just contemplating watching it or not. If there was a film released in Britain in the calendar year of 2008, that was better than this and wasn't Steven McQueen's Hunger, then I either haven't seen it or it doesn't exist. The film is a burning, brilliantly observed piece, encompassing the horror of the world; morality and plain pure old fashioned film making techniques such as the ability to build suspense and execute action. Once just isn't enough with No Country for Old Men.<br/><br/>The film is a crime-infused, MacGuffin driven tale between two predominant sides playing cat-and-mouse with one another in the wide open playground that is the state of Texas in a dusty June, circa 1980. The two warring sides are Josh Brolin's downbeat and somewhat cynical Llewelyn Moss, and he's in direct competition with Spanish actor Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh; a cold and seemingly emotionless killer who appears to have gone rouge from his employers and is now on Moss' tail. Thrown in amidst these two are the elements of innocent bystanders; hide and seek games at road side motels; shop, trailer and toll booth workers; an angry group of Mexican gangsters whom show up in fits and starts with their own prerogative and the law themselves, this time in the shape of Tommy Lee Jones' sheriff, named Ed Tom Bell.<br/><br/>The chaos is ignited when Moss, having accidentally shot a wild animal in the leg whilst trying to score a body shot, notices a trail of blood left by a pit-bull terrier. Moss observes the dog, who eerily looks back at him with a sort of knowing sense of what bloodshed and chaos comes with what he's just run away from: ""Trust me, it's not worth it"" seems to be the exclamation. At the site, made more shocking by the presence of bullet ridden mutts, Moss waltz's through a barren patch of land inhabited by dead drug dealers, automatic weaponry and shot-up trucks. A few hundred yards off is a few million dollars in cash, which he swipes after appearing to confront himself with the question. A distant storm begins to break, with feint cracks of thunder – the bag that contained the money is beginning to double up as Pandora's box.<br/><br/>The film's immediate opening is a voice over uttered by a man that has seen better days. His comments, recollections and opinions on life and the world is juxtaposed by some fantastic Texas scenery. Bell talks of the old times, and how some sheriffs in the past barely drew their gun as there was so little crime – just 35 minutes in sees Bell's deputy, who's just a kid in comparison, drawing his gun to enter a potentially dangerous property. Bell's reaction to this is fascinating. The beauty of the locale shooting suggests that the man still loves his home area and the place in which he has spent his whole life, but looks on with concern; that times change and people have to change with them otherwise they'll be left behind. What follows this knowing observation, the film's central theme of making sense of it all, is a brutal murder - the first of many Chigurh will commit. The Coen's thrust you into the centre of Chigurh's world with this killing, setting up the white-knuckle ride and getting across this guy's cold efficiency; something that is put in contrast with Moss' earlier inability to take his time, take aim and shoot a nonthreatening wild animal.<br/><br/>While widely accepted as one of the greatest screen villains from recent years, Chigurh is a collection of very basic but very effective things. Predominantly, his uncanniness is born out of his weapons of choice; those being a stun gun later established to exist so as to kill livestock painlessly as well as a standard pump action shotgun that comes complete with a silencer, thus creating an odd metallic whooshing noise when fired. His sly and sporadic use of ambiguous quotes and metaphors combine with his ruthless ability to play games and con those around him, out of methods of transportation or whatever. The scene in mind that sticks out most is the initial ""call it"" exchange at a petrol station, during which odd shaped pieces of material are lined up behind the supposed victim; all of which are in the shape of a crude noose suggesting impending death, doom or execution.<br/><br/>The film is violent, but the attention to the repercussions of violence are what makes it seem more gruesome than it is. When characters get injured later on, they need to treat themselves and this focus is ten times more nasty and more effective than, for instance, lining up nothing characters in a Saw sequel and lopping their limbs off. The film is so very visceral in its attention to sound; the build ups to two motel exchanges between certain characters is arguably more exciting than the following action sequences with light switches, floor boards, cocked guns and distant telephone tones all playing their part. With a sense of humour running throughout that is as dry as those rough, dusty early desert scenes and a fantastically structured narrative revolving around this man Moss; the decisions he makes and how they affect those around him and who he loves, No Country for Old Men is a stunning film and one of the best of recent times."

","The first film I saw from the Coen brothers was Fargo, since then I watched more of their films. I was very excited when I was given No country for old men as a present on DVD. I had heard a lot about it and was aware of it's success at the Oscars. I had very high expectations for this film.<br/><br/>The film revolves three characters who are never seen together on the screen. The first character we see is Anton Chigurh ( Javier Bardem )he is arrested at the start but soon escapes killing one police officer and a pedestrian, then steals the pedestrian's car. Sheriff Ed Tom Bell ( Tommy Lee Jones ) is an old sheriff who is trying to find Anton Chigurh for the killings. Llewelyn Moss ( Josh Brolin ) has come across a drugs deal gone wrong in the middle of nowhere. He finds a bag full of money and takes it. Unfortunately this money was meant to be collected by Anton Chigurh and he intends on getting the money back. Llewelyn Moss is forced to go on the run from Anton Chigurh who is ruthlessly killing all who stand in his way of him and his money. Sheriff Ed Tom Bell becomes aware of Llewelyn Moss and his situation and so a deadly cat and mouse chase starts. Sheriff Ed Tom Bell is trying to convince Llewelyn Moss, through his wife played by Kelly Macdonald, that he should hand over the money before Anton Chigurh comes for his wife. Meanwhile, the businessman who hired Chigurh (Stephen Root) is worried about the violence and deaths involved in returning the money. He hires Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson)to reason with Chigurh and get the money back.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin is a fantastic in his performance and so is Tommy Lee Jones, although Javier Bardem takes up the spot light by giving us an outstanding performance as one the most ruthless villains in the last decade. The film has no music apart from in the closing credits. This is very good as you get a sense of how empty and silent a place is, meaning anything could happen and no one would know.The scenery in this film is amazing and visually beautiful.<br/><br/>Now,I loved Fargo and thought The Coen brothers could not top it. Well I was wrong. No country for old men is better then Fargo. A very well made movie, which I can not find any faults with. 10 out of 10. A modern classic."

","I kept meaning to see this when it was in the theaters because I'd heard so many great things about it. When it was praised at the Academy Awards and even got a Best Picture Oscar, I tried a little harder, but bad scheduling kept interfering. Now that I've seen it (not once, but twice -- more on that later) I've come to think the man upstairs might have been trying to spare me several dollars. First off, with such expectations going in, this will have to rank as one of the most overrated movies I've ever seen. My **1/2 rating wouldn't have changed a bit had I never heard of its reputation; it's just that I wouldn't have used the term ""overrated"" to describe it.<br/><br/>The Bad: I'll skip with the storyline here, but just say that there are some plot holes and bits of business that just never made much sense to me (like having the suitcase transferred through the vents in the different hotel rooms). None of its characters are likable (not that this in itself is a deal breaker if a movie works), the pacing is lethargic and sleep-inducing, and the ending is terrible and inconclusive. Tommy Lee Jones is interesting as an ineffective Texas sheriff who can't deal with the escalating new brand of random violence, yet he's underused. All he does is offer up endless musings about how things have changed, but one wonders why they'd give a badge to such a disinterested lawman. And not only is Jones not interested; does anyone else in this state ever hear or react to all the endless shootings, car explosions and crashes going on everywhere?<br/><br/>The Good: nice direction and cinematography, and good performances from Jones, Josh Brolin, and -- of course -- Javier Bardem, who makes one of the screen's most memorable villains with his ominous portrayal of a crazed and indifferent psychopathic killer. That said, do I think Bardem's performance was worthy of the coveted Oscar which he received? No, I wouldn't go quite that far. But as of this time I haven't seen the other best supporting actors' work in the other films they were nominated for along with Bardem.<br/><br/>In the end this is just an Above Average chase movie with elements of western, horror, slash-and-stalk, and melodrama. It's well-acted, shot nicely, benefits from not using any music score. But I'm not sure of the point to any of the ugliness that's going on, and some things were incomprehensible, including the unsatisfying conclusion. I actually made sure to watch it two times... first last night where its pacing made my head nod a few times... and then again bright-eyed and bushy-tailed the next morning, just to make sure I gave it a fair chance. My rating stayed the same both times. **1/2 out of ****"

","The best movies are the ones you can watch over and over and learn something new from every time. It empowers us as viewers to play an active creative role -- the movie becomes an organic form, shifting under different lights, constantly assuming new shape. Kubrick is the best at this. The Coens are up there too.<br/><br/>The narrative model here is like Fargo. A tangential crime is committed, but is part of something bigger. The cop picks up that trail and pieces things together, going slowly from tangent to body. The cop is always one step behind us (the viewer), but he's wiser, because he knows the world. He's our Virgil, and our conscience, and this is a very clever narrative device. The sheriff's voice carries us through the action, sets it up with his voice over, seals it at the end, and dots the arc with milestone tales which weave their way into the fabric of the master tale.<br/><br/>The visuals. The expansive landscape shots are beautiful, but beauty isn't enough. They reinforce the contrast between heaven and earth (or hell, depending on your cosmology). The camera moves slowly, contemplatively in all directions, probing. Jackson Pollack is everywhere -- the granular landscape dotted with shrubs; the deer's blood spattered on the dirt plain; Chigur's blood on the sidewalk; blood sprayed on the wall, shower curtain; even the buckshot in Llewlyn's shoulder and Chigur's leg. There's an affinity here with the amorality of modern art, and Pollack's notion of chance (let the paint fall where it may).<br/><br/>Chance. Brutality and love are two sides of the same coin, and our lives can be defined by either. But the chance here isn't arbitrary -- Llewelyn makes a decision to go bring the Mexican water (if he didn't, he would have lived happily ever after). The choices we make establish the chances we encounter. Life is not a blind road. ""Ed Tom"" and ""Anton"" are aurally indistinguishable (good/bad, cop/killer, two sides of the same coin)... they both drink from the same milk bottle. Their TV reflections are similarly vague. What is it that makes a cop and cop, a killer a killer? What brings us to those states? Tommy Lee Jones only plays one role, but this is one of its best incarnations. Javier may go down as one of the greats. Brolin has come a long way since Goonies."

","This film is certainly not for everyone. I personally feel it is a return to a root that they tried to explore with the Big Lebowski and the man who wasn't there. The point of it, to me at least, would seem to be a post-modern exploration of violence and greed. In an attempt to understand why the serial killer is violent we invariably ultimately fail. He is not like Hannibal Lectre he is not explained and ultimately this is the case for a lot of truly insane people out there. It is not that they have no motivation but that there motivation is not as easily explainable as certain directors would like us to think. That is why the money is irrelevant, it initiates the film but it is not the focal point. That is why no one ends up with the money because this film is simply not about telling a story.<br/><br/>When I say this film is not aiming to tell a story I do not mean that it is boring. The action sequences are thrilling and frequently terrifying, the acting is utterly gripping and the dialogue is quite literally genius. <br/><br/>The flaw of any review would be to talk about a film like the Shawshank Redemption within the same space as this. It would be much more fitting to consider the cinematographers other film the Assassination of Jesse James. That was a film where people did not sit down and, in a time honoured clichéd tradition, explain their intentions and the same happened here. It was a film where you could never truly grasp the intentions or the depths of character's dialogue and this film is much the same.<br/><br/>It may not be to everyone's taste that much I agree. If you want a film that focuses on the story rather than an intellectual exploration detached from the plot then avoid this at all costs. However, if you are a particular fan of more postmodern works then I would highly recommend this film if only for the dialogue alone."

The beauty with the ending is that it's leaving you with questions, what happened to Anton Chiurgh after the car crash and did he kill Carla Jean Moss? We don't need to know that.<br/><br/>You can make your own ending in the head but you know that the good guy(Ed Tom Bell) lives which you can compare to Fargo in which it ends with seeing Marge and Norm Gunderson sitting in the bed watching TV after Carl Showalter, Jean Lundeegard and those people in Brainard is dead and Jerry Lundeegard and Gaer Grimsrud is arrested.

Javier Bardem is so good, when he makes his uncomfortable smile, talks with a low voice which is almost whisperings and walks around with his injured leg, just brilliant. The Cinematography is beautiful and the directing is so F#%#ing perfect.

"sixbells99","10","3","6","29 August 2008"," A very special film
","This film pulls and teases at its audience ; At times it appears to be a linear heist / chase movie, turning into a serial killer film, to an instruction film on how to hide a suitcase full of money in a motel. As soon as you think you are comfortable with the story arch the film takes another twist always one step ahead never to be caught, not even at the end.<br/><br/>This is a thought provoking film with some of the best dialogue I've seen for decades with perhaps one of the best villains in movie history. The films operates in netherland between reality and the inconceivable, sculpted flawlessly by the Coen brothers into something very special a world alien but familiar.<br/><br/>This is definitely NOT a film made by pre screening and focus groups, it's all the more fresh and unique for never selling out. It goes against the Hollywood convention and doesn't give its audience what they want. In many ways this is a very brave film as with such an incredible performance by super bad guy Javier Bardem they could have made a much more commercial linear film in the editing suit but then again Javier would have never have agreed to be in the film if the Coen's pandered to commercialism. Instead it throws away the film map turns off the how to make a Hollywood movie script software and embarks on an uncomfortable reality not everyone is ready to see. Life doesn't tie up loose ends or always give us answers to perplexing questions nor do people always get what they deserve, I'm sure these elements of the film will frustrate those expecting a conventional script using linear plots.<br/><br/>If you are Coen fan you will love this film and it will stand as one of their best. If you looking for a formula layered beginning middle and end script then this will disappoint. No country for old men is focused on the journey rather than the destination and what a journey!!!"

So, good start.<br/><br/>However, as the film progressed it started to deteriorate. Firstly, I failed to see the point or relevance of Tommy Lee-Jones' character in the film. He had no influence on the plot whatsoever (and I know a lot of people will say that that was the point - I mean the film was NAMED after his character!) - BUT, his character was so uncompelling and character-less that I really couldn't have cared less about him.<br/><br/>The ending of the film was a complete travesty! I won't spoil it for those who are yet to see it - but it is completely unfulfilling and is a 'non-ending.' Anyway, my conclusion is that there were some great scenes, some good bits of acting, the killer had good dialogue, and there was some intrigue - but it was boring and over drawn-out in places, Tommy Lee-Jones' character was a completely uninspiring and unnecessary third wheel, and the ending was so diabolically unfulfilling that it turned what could have been a great film into and bang-average film to me.<br/><br/>6/10"

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning<br/><br/>Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) stumbles across some dead Mexicans, a huge stash of heroin and a load of cash. He gives in to temptation, and takes the cash, vaguely aware there may be some payback for it. He finds himself being pursued by the psychotic Chigurh (Javier Bardem) who leaves a trail of blood and destruction behind him. On both their trails is Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) and his deputy. On the verge of retirement, Bell really is starting to lose his faith with people and the world.<br/><br/>Although they're regarded as gold by film lovers in general, I can only remember one film of the Coens I thought was great, and that was the snow drenched Fargo. I'm sure there are many others, I've just not bothered to see them, but I have just seen this new one that makes me further of the persuasion that maybe I should see some more of their older ones. The brothers have crafted a film based around atmosphere, mood and tension, where such little things as a sweet wrapper unfolding, a tracking device beeping or a telephone ringing are given new dimensions. Some, less refined, viewers might find the film 'boring' but quite simply they don't know enough about film or what makes it an art form.<br/><br/>Getting the style and substance of the film so right, the Coens are also treated to some brilliant performances. Bardem (could have fooled me, I thought he was Robert Downey Jr.???) is the star of the show, as a genuinely scary and unpleasant guy, who takes no nonsense, leaves bloodbaths not bodies and even has to creep people out when he's apparently just joking with them. Jones also shines as the world weary cop, who really does feel like he's about to lose his faith in human will and nature. Rising star Brolin is sadly left to basque in their greatness, alongside supporting stars Woody Harrelson and Kelly Macdonald.<br/><br/>Not one for those with the attention span of a knat, then, but for those who truly appreciate films and what makes them an art form, this is highly recommended. *****"

","Are there any superlatives left for this film? The Coen Brothers take mighty risks in adapting McCarthy's nihilistic novel for the screen. Those of us who are Beginning-Middle-End type film-goers will be slapped around the head by the iconoclastic narrative structure of this film. And yet there are two types of film that deserve the mantle of greatness; those that have you leave the theatre asking questions, and those, not unrelated, that make you want to watch again. No Country is both.<br/><br/>Historians, with the benefit of hindsight, will look back and tell us that unforgiving wars, peak oil, and/or economic uncertainty gave rise to such bleak visions. Locked in the present, we can only gaze upon such images and think, ""Yes, this is how it is is."" I hated the ending. I invested so much in Llewelyn Moss, and felt cheated. I did not want to spend time beyond his demise with Chigurh. But I am open to the thought that my investment may have been misguided. The Coens clearly invite you to look again. I will. <br/><br/>It is a privilege to be there when artists take their work to the next level. No Country has pushed the boundaries of film-making. A product of its time, or timeless? Future generations will decide."
"anthony-burton","8","3","6","6 July 2008"," Brilliant but flawed. The stunning tension peters out before the end
","Whilst watching NCFOM, James Cameron's 'The Terminator' kept popping into my mind. On the surface, they have little in common, but the underlying themes are the same. Kyle Reese's character is replaced with Josh Brolin's; an out-gunned, but gritty and resilient fighter, resourceful but always on the back foot. Sarah Connor is played by a briefcase full of drug money; to be protected at all costs and Javier Bardem is the Terminator; the unstoppable juggernaut, a killing machine which can't be stopped or reasoned with; as we are often reminded by auxiliary characters in NCFOM.<br/><br/>Both films play out in much the same way, as the killer slowly closes in, the suspense mounts. And it's here that the Coen brothers excel themselves in creating an unfathomable amount of tension, delivering a master-class in direction and helped by superb performances from their two leads.<br/><br/>Two thirds of the way in, my heart was racing every time Bardem stepped onto screen, i was hanging on his every word and hoping that somehow - against all the obvious odds - our hero would prevail. And then it happens, the reason so many people voted this film a 1/10. Not because it's worth 1/10, but because they were totally unprepared for what happened next, and can't shake the bitter taste of such unconventional story telling from their mouths: We see Brolin's character dead, on the floor of a motel room, the Coen brothers take their lunch break and (i suspect) draft in David Lynch to finish the film off. It ambles its way to an underwhelming climax with abstract scenes and dialogue which you won't take in, because you'll be wondering what happened and when you get to see it. The answer is never.<br/><br/>I've heard the film is loyal to the book, but with a book, you imagine everything anyway, so it's a better medium to find your lead character already dead. Not so in films, i've paid my money, show me your vision, paint the story on the screen for my lazy brain. Had The Terminator ended with Sarah and Kyle dying off-screen and the terminator walking off into the distance i don't think we'd be talking about it nearly 25 years on. And we won't be talking about NCFOM in 25 years either. But it's worth a viewing if only to witness the greatest enactment of a psychopath since Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lector. 8/10"

","The plot of No Country for Old Men is basic and relentless. A hunter, Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), stumbles upon a drug deal gone bad in the Texas desert. He finds 2 million dollars in cash stashed in a briefcase and, of course, makes the poor decision of taking it.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem plays Anton Chigurh, the rightful owner of the money who wants it back very badly. Well, actually Chigurh is a psychopath and doesn't really care all that much about the money. He just wants to make a very violent point based on his own twisted sense of right and wrong.<br/><br/>Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is a worn out small town sheriff. He's concerned about all the violence going on in his jurisdiction, but he's a little too intimidated to really do much about it. He sort of hopes the drug dealers will all kill each other, so he can just sit back and clean up the mess.<br/><br/>The movie takes off from there at a breakneck pace. Chigurh is one of the most frightening psychopaths to grace the big screen in years. His pursuit of Moss is relentless, with him killing anything and anyone that gets in his path. His unique array of deadly weapons is memorable and unsettling. He's really more of a serial killer who got into the drug business as an excuse to pursue his hobby. He has a bizarre set of morals and sometimes lets victims decide their fate based on a coin toss.<br/><br/>While the movie works as a crime thriller, it also works as a bit of an allegory. Moss represents the failings of the average man. He's filled with hubris and greed, sure he can find a way out of any situation, even certain death. Chigurh is Death. Relentlessly approaching, sometimes taking random victims, unstoppable. This is a story about a man trying to literally ""cheat death"". Sheriff Bell is a philosopher, sitting on the sideline, trying to make sense of all the violence in a rapidly changing world. <br/><br/>The conclusion of the film will be controversial for some. All along we anticipate some sort of a showdown between Chigurh, Moss and Bell. This never happens. It's a very anti-climactic ending, yet it speaks volumes. It speaks of a reality where there are no villains or heroes. There is no cowboy riding off into the sunset with justice done. Just real people drawn into dangerous situations by their own flawed motivations and psychology. Chigurh's murder of Moss' innocent wife reinforces his own insanity, but also reinforces the senselessness of everything that has just occurred. Perhaps this senselessness is what leads Sheriff Bell into retirement at the conclusion of the story. He can't even begin to understand what motivates the younger generation toward the lives of violence they have chosen."

","Shrewd, resourceful Vietnam veteran Llewelyn Moss (the excellent Josh Brolin) stumbles across a bunch of dead bodies, a pick-up full of heroin, and a bag with two million bucks worth of drug money in it. Moss decides to take the bag. This in turn makes Moss the target of vicious and remorseless psychopath Anton Chigurh (a splendidly chilling performance by Javier Bardem), who engages in a lethal game of cat and mouse with Moss. Meanwhile, cagey, weary Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (the always fine Tommy Lee Jones) investigates and tries to find Moss before it's too late. Joel and Ethan Coen have expertly crafted a tense, gripping and understated crime thriller that for the most part works like gangbusters: the sterling performances from a sturdy cast, the bleak, fatalistic tone, Roger Deakins' crisp, striking cinematography, the startling outbursts of shockingly brutal violence, several inspired moments of pitch black humor (the scene between Chigurh and a befuddled gas station proprietor is an amusingly edgy little gem), Carter Burwell's spare, moody score, the vivid evocation of the dusty, desolate rural terrain and the everyday folks who inhabit the region, the provocative central theme about a dying code of honor and decency, and a few well-staged action set pieces (a protracted shoot-out between Moss and Chugurh in the empty dark streets of a small town rates as a definite exciting highlight) are all uniformly spot-on. Brolin, Bardem, and Jones all shine in their meaty parts, with Barden especially memorable as one seriously scary and nasty villain. Moreover, there are nice supporting turns by Woody Harrelson as cocky, amiable hoodlum Carson Wells, Kelly McDonald as Moss' sweet, concerned wife Carla Jean, Garret Dillahunt as the eager Deputy Wendell, Tess Harper as Bell's sassy wife Loretta, and Barry Corbin as crusty, crippled old coot Ellis. WARNING: Possible *SPOILERS* ahead. However, the film really falters in the annoyingly vague and meandering last third. Moreover, Moss gets abruptly bumped off in a most frustrating and dissatisfying way. That criticism aside, this is still a highly impressive and engrossing winner."

What exactly happens to the guy who takes his money? etc.? The ending is abrupt and makes absolutely no sense. It ends with the old sheriff talking about a dream he had. What's the significance of the dream? Is this an ultra-cerebral movie with the meaning so abstract that it requires you to pay close attention and strain your brain to uncover the hidden meaning.

Josh Brolin seems to be not so resourceful, he makes serious mistakes as the accidental cowboy who finds the money near Rio Grande in an area where the fight between drug gangs occurred. Existentialism can be proud as a theory that found ground in these characters. This movie is major thriller, different from regular westerns, pure antihollywood stuff.

Probably the biggest metaphor in this movie are the two coin toss scenes.<br/><br/>This being said, many people dislike these kinds of movies and enjoy mindless, meaningless violence and humor that give them a few chuckles or awes.

"TxMike","Null","3","6","12 April 2008"," Typical Coen film in that nothing is typical. Compelling character study.
","I figure that I really like about two-thirds of the Coen Brothers movies. 'Fargo' and 'The Man Who Wasn't There' are a couple of my favorites. They seem to do best in movies where good and evil, serious and funny, are juxtaposed. This one is very interesting, but has a sort of open-ended finish that may upset some viewers.<br/><br/>The movie starts with a narration by Tommy Lee Jones who plays small county sheriff Ed Tom Bell, not too far away from retirement. As in 'The Valley of Elah', he is superb here. His part of this story begins when they find a bunch of bodies out in the scrub land, apparently a drug deal gone bad.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin is Llewelyn Moss, a laborer type of man who happens upon the dead bodies while he is out hunting for Antelope with a high-powered rifle. He finds the bodies, and the drugs, and wonders where the money is. When he finds it, in the large briefcase, it is two $$Million in $100 bill packages. He isn't wealthy and decides his best course of action is to keep it. However, since the bad guys end up with his personal information when in a change of heart he goes back to give water to a dying man, and he almost gets killed himself, he decides that he and his wife need to leave their trailer and run.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem is the very menacing man with no moral compass, Anton Chigurh. He is out to get the money back and doesn't have any qualms about killing anyone he encounters, even if they do nothing to him. He chases Llewelyn across Texas and into Mexico and back.<br/><br/>Woody Harrelson is excellent in a small role as Carson Wells who also chases Chigurh. Kelly Macdonald, who was so good as a teenager in 'Trainspotting', is Llewelyn's simple wife, Carla Jean Moss.<br/><br/>One of my all-time favorites, Barry Corbin of 'Northern Exposure' fame, plays Sheriff Bell's older brother Ellis. It was 10 years ago that I was an extra in a movie, and had the chance to sit with Corbin and have a pleasant conversation as we waited for the sound guy to get ready.<br/><br/>MAJOR SPOILERS: Llewelyn's end comes at a cheap motel, and Chigurh ends up recovering a good portion of the money. As he is driving, he is distracted and gets into a severe crash at an intersection, but he manages to limp away. Sheriff Bell retires and muses over there not being a place for old men in our country."

It's not that it's a bad movie in and of itself, and it's better than the other recent Coen Brothers movies I've seen, but it seems strange that these guys only seem to get the correct amount of attention when they make a relatively meaningless crime movie as opposed to their satirical masterpieces.<br/><br/>At any rate, I read a few reviews before seeing the movie (skipping past the plot summary because I didn't want it to be spoiled) and some of the reviewers said that the Coen Brothers had finally ""grown up"" in this movie. The reviewer for ""Newsweek"" (David Ansen?) commented on how the film had seemed to drop the Coens' reliance on humor even in their ""serious"" films. I didn't see this at all. The best parts of the movie for me were the typically off-beat and morbid humor scenes, like Ed Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) drinking the killer's (Javier Bardem) milk and telling his clueless deputy that drinking milk isn't a sufficient description of a suspect to put out an APB on. I like the vernacular of the script, and I like Jones' and Josh Brolin's performances very much. But I didn't quite see what the fuss was all about Javier Bardem's performance, it was pretty simple work I thought compared to what Brolin had to do. He just had the juicier role, that's all.<br/><br/>The story here is pretty gripping, but ultimately goes nowhere. Probably the thing that impressed the critics the most and made them say the Coens ""grew up"" (as if this movie compares on an intellectual level to their best films, which as far as I can tell on a first viewing it does not) was that the film had an ambiguous ending. But it's not ambiguous in an interesting way like ""Barton Fink"", it's just ambiguous as if they didn't know how else to end it. There's no real idea here to justify the violence. The violence is done in a very exaggerated way to make Bardem's character more impressive. It's not much more subtle than your average action movie if truth be told. I guess we're just supposed to walk away remembering the scene with Jones and the older man, we're supposed to think about how Jones feels like he's over-matched by the criminals but it's actually the same kind of thing that people had to deal with back in the old west days. That's hardly a good idea to pin a whole movie on.<br/><br/>Another problem I had with the movie is a whole host of uninteresting characters. The Woody Harrelson character has nothing important to do and seems to be here just a a link between the killer and his corporate employers. He does a half-assed version of the same character M. Emmett Walsh played much better in ""Blood Simple."" Poor Kelly McDonald seems like a good actress but had absolutely nothing to work with until her final scene with Bardem. You can see the seams of the plotting of the story showing through. Some of the scenarios are just ridiculous. The bag of money is supposed to have this tracking device in it, one that makes a loud beeping noise when it's taken out of the bag and which is quite large but which for some reason Brolin never hears or thinks to look for until he's already been tracked down twice. If the movie wasn't so well made technically speaking, these things could just be dismissed as action movie conventions, but this film should be so much better.<br/><br/>I can't rate the film as a bad film because the suspense is pretty gripping and the action scenes are well done. Josh Brolin's character is very well done. I really liked the early parts of the film, Deakins' photography of the animals on the plains, the suspense of Brolin encountering the scene of the drug battle. The movie starts going downhill immediately when he goes back to try to give the guy water, a boneheaded move that pushes the movie into ridiculous territory almost right away. It's not a bad thrill ride but I think people are reading things into it that aren't there."

","Having watched the two Oscar heavyweights ""No country for old men"" and ""There will be blood"" within one week, I can't help noticing the sharp contrast in audio style: while ""Blood"" came with background music so overwhelming that it threatens to take over foreground, ""Old men"" had only silence, natural sound and dialogue, with no music at all. There is no right or wrong: each style serves its particular purpose. Imagine the scene in ""Old men"" with Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) in the middle of the night in a sunken hollow strewn with a few abandoned vehicles and dead bodies. As the menacing headlight of an ominous looking vehicle at the top of a slope threatens to approach, any kind of music would do more harm than good to the blood-chilling atmosphere.<br/><br/>Let me back up a little. In their inimitable fashion, the Coen Brothers crafted this adopted story through a mesmerizing plot line that is ever elusive, giving you the slip every time you feel that you have got the hang of things. The plot line looks simple: a common young man who stumbles across two million dollars becomes the prey of a serial killer who is after the money (and his life), while a season sheriff comes after both  an almost standard cat-and-mouse story. But there are more than initially meets the eye.<br/><br/>But first, the three main characters. Moss is not your ordinary reckless young man next door. Seasoned Vietnam veteran, he shows his stuff when chased by a ferocious killing bloodhound, hurriedly loading his pistol but never losing control, and firing it when the canine's deadly teeth is within three feet of his throat. He is undoubtedly the prey, but not one that rolls over and play dead. But this is really the hunter's show. Javier Bardem (""The sea inside"") who has won every Best Supporting Actor in sight is good enough to give Daniel Day-Lewis a run for his money had he been put in the contest for Best Actor, to which he has every right. The most amazing thing is that while his physical appearance is at times even comical (mainly due to the ridiculous hair style), his mere presence is so chilling that it makes Jason Voorhees, Norman Bates and Hannibal Lecter look like fairy godmothers in Disney tales. I'll come to Tommy Lee Jones later.<br/><br/>As the movie follows the standard cat-and-mouse crime thriller development, the audience may be so hung to the edge of their seats that they forget temporarily that this is Coen Brothers. The climatic showdown that they tricked you into expecting never comes. Everything seems to fall apart in the last third of the movie. Not only that it is such an anticlimax, but you are not even allowed to see what actually happens. And that one last climax (which is standard for thrillers) is also a flop, and also one with an ambiguous, open ending. ""What the hell is going on"", you can hear some in the audience groan.<br/><br/>But while the audience is still hot on the trail with agitated expectation of a Hollywood style showdown, the Coen Brothers have all but concluded this plot line and moved off to an even more important theme, the development of sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), whose involvement in this crime case is merely incidental. The cat-and-mouse game ended almost as an afterthought, with none of the excitement the audience thought they have been promised. The focus has long since shifted to depiction of Bell as one of the ""old men"" in the title. If you think back, most of the small roles (starting with the attendant of the now famous ""gas station scene"" at the beginning of the movie) are old men. While the audience might have forgotten, the directors/screen writers have not, that this movie is trying to show why this desolate Taxes country is ""no country for old men"". Added to this is the final touch (the accident) showing how bazaar life and reality can be.<br/><br/>For those who still complain that they are not told/shown properly how Moss was hunted down, remember the pool side scene when a woman who is trying to seduce Moss. He tells her that he is married and is now out here keeping half an eye on his wife who is coming to join him and another half on something else so that he will not be caught unprepared, (something to that effect). The woman replies that this may not always be possible. There you have it, as clear as daylight, the directors' account of Moss's end, if you'd only pay attention."

","...since everybody says what a great film this is. The acting is great but that's the only redeeming thing about it, IMO, and the only reason I rated it as high as I did.<br/><br/>For me it was a total waste of time, and I went in expecting to love it because of critical reviews. Believe me, I know good does not always win, but the bleakness of this film was overwhelming, or should I say underwhelming.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I don't believe I've ever seen another Coen film, so I wasn't aware of how ""quirky"" their films really are, outside of knowing their reputations. <br/><br/>I disliked it so much that I seriously doubt I would ever consider seeing another film produced by the Coens. On the other hand, they're rich from doing stuff like this, so I must be wrong. Right?<br/><br/>PS -- I will add that I am offended by some of the pseudo-intellectual comments by some which insinuate that if you don't love this movie it proves you're really not very bright, not as bright as the people who feel this is one of the classics in film-making. Right. The texture and sub-plot layers got right past me. PPS -- In the interest of fairness I will say I read an interesting IMDb review about the allegories of this movie. Certainly others have alluded to that, but this reviewer did a masterful job of explaining the allegories as he understood them. I'm broad-minded enough to admit that the allegories he detailed escaped me, but could have been legitimate. Still, I feel a movie should entertain, and to entertain it has to follow enough of the normal conventions to make it enjoyable. NCFOM failed to do this."

","I can't believe it, Coen Bros. did it just again ! I have seen this movie in a screening in Germany (thankfully it was not dubbed) and I can't believe there was actually some people being disappointed by the end (won't go too much into it as I don't wanna spoil any of it). Imho, those people simply didn't pay attention enough to the movie to actually understand why it ends like that, or they simply had way too different expectations.<br/><br/>This movie is just simply put : a masterpiece. Acting? unbelievably good. The actors really stand out in this one. Javier Bardem is simply the perfect choice for this character. He looks great, goes really deep into character, and just makes you feel like you can, in some weird way, fully understand the role he plays. Josh Brolin? Heck, you'd think he's actually REALLY such a redneck ;-) And Woody Harrelson, well it's actually sad his role is more like a supporting character, as it's really done well and I think the movie would be way different without his role.<br/><br/>The camera, the directing, the silent moments throughout the whole movie are just simply breathtaking ... It's been an incredibly long time since any major commerce-supported movie like that had been released (I know there's lots of such material in the independent scene, but remember, this actually is a Hollywood movie with true artistic quality ! A true rarity these days =P ).<br/><br/>I wish I could buy the movie already, because I would really like to watch it over and over again ... and I am certainly not going to do the mistake and watch it in any dubbed language. If you, by any chance, live in a non-English speaking country, really try your best at seeing it in English ! The actors work is so huge, watching it in a dubbed language just simply would ruin it !"

","I watched this movie because it was the pick to win the Oscar for Best Picture this year. I don't get it. I did not like it. It was very long and episodic. While there well-shot individual scenes, yet with no coherence in its totality. It seemed to be about this guy Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) who stumbled into a bag containing two million dollars, and how this money turns his life topsy-turvy (I know, we've seen that before). But somewhere down the line, it lost me as to what it was really all about.<br/><br/>The violence is too brash and in-your-face, yet numbing and gratuitous. These scenes are largely due to one man, Anton, played by Javier Bardem, who really very creepy in his crazed killer role. He went to town with it, and is considered a lock for the Best Supporting Actor prize. While I was very distracted with his weird hairstyle, he was successful in developing tension in every scene he was in. He was especially effective in the quiet scenes like that with the gas station owner, the wife of Moss, and even that with a miscast Woody Harrelson. The question always comes up in your head--will he shoot them or not?<br/><br/>The Texas accents are too thick for me to understand the dialogues clearly, and that further reduced my full understanding. That entire mumbling monologue of Tommy Lee Jones at the end was such a major anti-climactic let-down for me.<br/><br/>I liked the Coen brothers' work with ""Fargo,"" that actually succeeds despite its unusual premise. But this one is very disorganized in its direction. This was exemplified was that strange decision was having a main character die off-camera. Why? It felt like you just wasted your time following his actions and decisions, just to have his character snuffed out so suddenly and anonymously.<br/><br/>In general, I was very disappointed with this one. Maybe too much high expectations led to my reduced appreciation. Definitely, this was not how I felt after watching ""The Departed"" the other year. I knew right away that film was a winner. This one, I don't think I would even have the patience to watch again."
"lotus_chief","3","3","6","31 January 2008"," Grossly overrated..unbelievably bland
","**SPOILERS!** <br/><br/>Naturally I watched this due to all of the hype and praises surrounding it. I just don't get it. Although, seeing the Coen Brothers' name attached to this film, I should have known better. The first film I saw by them was Miller's Crossing.hated it. Finally rented Fargo from Netflix a month ago, watched it, wasn't impressed at allin fact I was annoyed by it. Third time's a charm, maybe? Not by a long shot.<br/><br/>The Coens always have a high level of quirkiness to their films. Everything from the characters to the plot is a little off-kilter. This does NOT always translate into a great, intelligent film. Tarantino also possess this quality with his films and, a lot more so than not, it works. Not the case with the Coens, as their attempts always come off as forced. Stripped of any fluff, 'No Country For Old Men' is a film full of killing and rambling. First there's the hit-man, (Javier Bardem) who barely talks (and when he does, talks about coin tosses and other mundane things), walks around with a oxygen tank and a shotgun with a silencer (didn't know it was possible, but I must admit its kinda cool), blowing locks off doors and killing cops and honest citizens wherever he deems fit with no consequence to his actions from authorities, etc. There's the aging sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) who's becoming more detached from the world every day, due to its increasing insanity. Supposedly the movie is titled around this character, but he's only in about a third of the film, if that. Last but not least, there's the 'good-bad guy' (Josh Brolin), the silhouette you see in the movie's poster with the bag of money & rifle. He's another wanderer who happens to stumble on $2 million and a truckload of drugs, swipes the money and spends the rest of his time AROUND TOWN eluding the aforementioned hit-man who is after him. This is a guy who, while swiping the money, blows off the only remaining survivor's request for water; only to get up out of bed hours later in the middle of the night, fill a container of water and go BACK there with hopes of seeing that same survivor still clinging on to dear life. Needless to say, his hopes were squashed, and his problems multiplied tenfold when the people whose money/drugs were unaccounted for show up. We get an elongated cameo from another character (Woody Harrelson) who has a decent amount of screen time but whose character serves ABSOLUTELY NO PURPOSE to the story. As soon as we're introduced to him, he's done away with. The audience is forced to identify with Brolin's character because we follow him throughout his quest to make out with the money. Only problem is, he meets his fate in the most uninspiring, anti-climatic way possible. We see him alive, *cut*, we hear sirens, *cut*, we see him dead. We can only assume the hit-man got him.<br/><br/>You'll also hear a lot about the ending to this film, if anyone can call it such. In a nutshell, hit-man gets to Brolin's wife, rambles on again about a coin toss (which she fails to participate in), cut to hit-man in a car leaving the scene when a horrible accident occurshe gives a kid $100 for his shirt and he walks away limping and bloody with a bone sticking out his arm. Cut to the aging sheriff again, who is now retired, talking to his wife about a dream he had about his father, black screen, the end. What a bunch of wannabe artsy NONSENSE! If you're going to tell a story, TELL IT! Enough of the spaced-out dialog and characters who do nothing to further the telling of the story. There must be something I'm not getting; 'Fargo' reeked of these attempts at this kind of humor and failed miserably; between beyond-annoying accents and a ho-hum approach to everything by everyone made it one of the most overrated films of the past 10 years. 'NCFOM' suffers from the same affliction. They go above and beyond to make things as 'weirdly fascinating', only covering up the lack of a coherent script and plot. I can suspend my disbelief to a point, depending on what type of film it is. But please, DON'T pass yourself off as a ""serious, intelligent crime drama"".only to have all these occurrences in your movie that makes absolutely no sense! You mean to tell me NO one gets wind of the hit-man walking around town as obvious as can be.even after he kills a policeman at the police station? I'm not even going to mention how he gets out of the handcuffs. You bring in Woody Harrelson's character whose led out to be some sort of bad ass who's eliminated ever so easilyhe minus well have played the idiot cop who turned his back on a prisoner and was strangled with handcuffs. Brolin waking up and going BACK to the crime scene that HE stole drug money from, taking water with him hoping the Mexican (or whatever he was) is still alive? HOURS later?? Beyond silly, over-pretentious crap, this movie is. I was seriously considering watching it again to see what I missed.but what's the point? The movie is flat-out garbage. How the Coens continue to get over on critics is beyond me.<br/><br/>This will probably win a bunch at the Oscars, and it'll be yet another slap in the face to anyone who goes about life with sense. Then again, the Oscars really don't mean much of anything nowadays.Cuba Gooding Jr. now does Hanes commercials screaming about wearing other guys' underwear, 'Shawshank Redemption' to this day is better than 'Forrest Gump', and no one's heard from Roberto Benigni since 'Life Is Beautiful'. Want to see one of the truly great films of 2007 snubbed by the Academy? Watch 'Gone Baby Gone'. Stay away from this trash by all means.<br/><br/>3/10"

","West Texas is a perfect setting for a movie like this -- no trees, just desolate land for miles around. The chicken farmer (Richard Jackson) was from Alpine -a place in the middle of nowhere with a long long stretch of road that literally - I kid you not - has turkey buzzards on the fence posts along the way. Annie Proulx (Brokeback Mountain) described it perfectly in her 2002 book, ""That Old Ace in the Hole."" I've been gone from there for five years, but it hadn't changed much from the 1980 setting in the film, an I suspect it hasn't changed much more.<br/><br/>Llewelyn Moss, played brilliantly by Josh Brolin (Grindhouse, Hollow Man) thought he hit the jackpot. But, he didn't account for Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem). Chigurh was methodical, intelligent and psychotic. He is the human equivalent of the terminator robot after John Conner. Those who believe in souls would not say that Chigurg has one.<br/><br/>Tommy Lee Jones (The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, U.S. Marshals) is a tired sheriff that comes from a long line of lawmen. He knows that he is no match for Chigurg. It's not Richard Kimble or Mark Sheridan he's chasing, but a man who has no match.<br/><br/>The dialog is dry and things are not always explained. There is constant tension knowing what may lie on the other side of the door.<br/><br/>Jones' buddy Ellis had it down: Whatcha got ain't nothing new.

","Plot:<br/><br/>Texas, 1980. Hunting in the desert, Llewellyn Moss (Brolin) comes across the wreckage of a drug deal gone wrong and takes the cash  without counting on the man sent after him, an implacable killer (Bardem) intent on recovering the loot at any cost.<br/><br/>My Review:<br/><br/>The Coens have been off their game, they have been off their rocker with a short number of okay flicks. This time, the genre they tackle changes format completely. The Coens have rediscovered their mojo; with added humanity and Viagra.<br/><br/>A from Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Cormac McCarthy's violent neo-Western, No Country For Old Men encompasses blood, guts, gun galore, sharply and tense woven plot with a lusciously written script. It's got Blood and lots of Balls, sense of death lurking in the barren dry Texan landscape that has some flamboyant cinematography. And being a knotted tale of crime innately wrapped in circumstantial regards. <br/><br/>Surprisingly foremost is how the film remains both recognisably to McCarthy's allegory, all the while being soaked in oil-black humour. With the entire jazzy corollary that the Coen's use at their detriment, with witty deadpan comebacks. ""If I don't come back, tell my mother I love her,"" Josh Brolin's anti-hero Llewellyn Moss tells his wary discerning wife Carla Jean (Kelly Macdonald) before he faces hell. ""Your mother's dead,"" she retorts. ""Then I'll tell her myself,"" he sighs.<br/><br/>Sweltering corpses cook in the thirty-plus degree desert sun, even a dead dog, and a trail of blood, with the same splinter of the recent ' The Assassination of Jess James by the coward Robert Ford' indomitable likeness, splattered like ink along the parched ground, leads Moss to a case containing two million dollars. He takes to the money and runs. We consequentially start eyeing the tremulous determination of Moss, a local hunter who happens upon the remains of a drug deal gone badly wrong. The plot is triple-headed, with the narrative shifting focus whenever one of the leads seems to be taking centre stage, some more than others.<br/><br/>The clean-up guy is Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), who is totally underestimated throughout. A killer with the implacable dedication and blend of a Cylon from 'Battlestar Galactica' and Terminator; with a haircut to match, with a psychopathic sense of hypocrisy, irony and striking intelligence. Even Carter Burwell's score is defined by its candid  made up only of groans and eerie whistles. Course with that being said, the score only builds up at the roll of the credits. Bardem's is the role with a unbelievable amount of possibilities  a stone-cold killer obsessed, leaving to fate and chance to decide the lives of the ones he holds to the flip of a random toss of a quarter. He is blank force made breathtakingly plausible.<br/><br/>A startling chase set of events leads to shootings shot to perfect, brutal and tense graphical scenes that really make that +18 or R rating stand out in a dry soaked red. Always two steps behind is the old man of the tale, Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), a lawman up for retirement, facing an evil that he can no longer decode. <br/><br/>It is true to the book, even when the end is like a downplay and ambiguous laden message instead of a crescendo-ed glorified good guy v.s bad guy. <br/><br/>Verdict:<br/><br/>Colourfully and visually beguiling; as tense, sharp and brutal as some Western depictions. One of the best of 2007. 9/10. Watch for the coin toss scene with Bardem and a shopkeeper."

","No Country For Old Men<br/><br/>No Country for Old Men is mesmerising. It pulls you in and doesn't let go. It's basically a moral cat and mouse story, about the repercussion of people's decisions and actions. The acting is top notch, Josh Brolin is an actor that has never been too memorable on-screen, that all changes here. He plays Texan everyman Llewellyn Moss. This could well be a career-changing performance for him. Javier Bardem is pure evil personified, and burns with menace. Every time he appears, you expect bad things to happen. The scene where he mercilessly picks on a gas station owner is uncomfortable brilliance. The Coen brothers script is sharp and witty, and plays so real, you always feel like you are eves-dropping on someone else's conversations, or spying on their actions, rather than hearing words said for your benefit. <br/><br/>"" If I don't come back, tell mother I love her"". "" Your mother's dead, Llewelyn"". "" Well then I'll tell her myself"". <br/><br/>I'm saving the best for last here, Tommy Lee Jones is just wonderful. Im shocked he didn't get nominated Best Actor for this performance, because when all is said and done, this is his film he is the leading man. He bookends the film with thought provoking narratives on the frailty of the human condition, which have been lifted straight from the pages of the novel. These are the most important pieces of dialogue in the whole film and are delivered with such pathos, heart and regret by Tommy Lee Jones' character.

The editing was awful, leaving the main character lying dead in a scene where you couldn't tell it was him. People all over the theater were whispering to each other about where that character went.

","Just recently my enthusiasm for contemporary cinema has been waning. Clever, but formulaic scripts, contrived plots, and painting by number incidents. Then something comes along which shakes all that up -and ""No Country For Old Men"" does that.<br/><br/>The cinematography is lush, the desert settings evocative, and the key characters get a very welcome chance to breathe for once.Its style pays homage to the great westerns, and Tommy Lee Jones as veteran Sheriff, Ed Tom Bell lends an elegiac, ""fin de siecle"" feel to proceedings.<br/><br/>The violence is graphic and bloody,the script wordy,reflective and wry,but the Coen brothers show a discipline throughout which Tarrantino would do well to note.The gruesome slaughter which pervades this film is shown in a wholly amoral manner. Life and death a matter of chance - won or lost on the toss of a coin, both metaphorically and literally.<br/><br/>When required, the set piece action scenes never fail to disappoint.

After doing all of my homework, I'm now pretty much convinced that here Cohen Brothers playing with us (the audience). They must have thought ""let's make another movie, it doesn't need to be sound or logical, hey wait it must not be, this way people can argue about it, talk about and it and it shall be hell of a success"".<br/><br/>This movie gets it's story from a book which I did not read. Some say they've followed the book very closely, I doubt that actually. Because I think the book must be more deep and well structured, and reader find the meaning in the book which is not in the movie. I'm sure the book's author created more imaginative universe where the reader can relate Chigurh with devil, Moss with regular greedy man and Sheriff is in the middle of the story and old man fed up with life and sort of not pursuing things as he used to do.. So, all the story flows like a charm therefore the reader is satisfied, found some pieces going with his heart and everything is well done (I hope the book is like as I reckon). But the movie doesn't make you feel like this. It didn't for me! <br/><br/>First part of the movie is very well paced, I even did forgive the stupidness of Moss going back to desert to give the man some water. But beginning of the second part everything starts to fall apart. There are so many illogical, unexplainable (even lovers of the movie can't) parts in this movie, most of them are written in the message board and in other comments. What I want to point out here is if you really try hard to put some meaning into it go ahead, but if you're searching anything in it, don't bother yourself because it's empty.<br/><br/>It strangely feels as if Sheriff Bell is actually partnering with Chigurh as at many points Sheriff is avoiding to catch him. He's not going with other investigators, he mentions the cattle gun but doesn't get the trick and pursue it. Sheriff is like no one, he hasn't done anything actually.<br/><br/>Having all this considered, I'm still suspicious if I'm missing anything, but I think it's more like lovers of the movie are the ones who is afraid of saying ""the king is naked""."

(ie a dead giveaway as far as they would have been concerned).<br/><br/>2) Zero out of ten for the deputy placing an arrestee behind him, whilst he's on the phone. The fact that he got strangled was one of the good points of this film. - Such stupid deputies should not be allowed to achieve sexual maturity and (horror of horrors) possibly pass such stupid genes on to subsequent generations.<br/><br/>3) People in this film seemed to end up horribly injured and bounce back in minutes or hours. Hardly manifesting any signs of pain or incapacity either at the time of the trauma or subsequently.<br/><br/>4) Chiguhr seems to have a supernatural ability to track people down. The US military should offer him $5 million to find Bin Laden. - That way, we'll save billions in Iraq and Chigurh will murder all Bin Laden's lieutenants along the way. (Unless they win the occasional coin toss).<br/><br/>Yes - it is honorable to make an ending that doesn't work out like the stupid duel in ""Heat"" but the ending WAS badly constructed, unsatisfying and showed a lack of inventiveness or intelligence. If anyone ever saw the final episode of ""The Prisoner"", the ending of No Country for Old Men was almost in the same category of no-talent stupidity. Moss - a man who'd been a soldier in 'Nam, had talents as a survivor somehow got located by the Mexicans in no time flat. A film has a duty to be entertaining - that is their raison d'etre. This film stopped entertaining in the final 15 minutes. The Coen brothers have demonstrated much greater skill in many other films. Having said all of this, the sound was superb and the photography pretty good. The characters were very wooden. Listening to Tommy Lee Jones drone on with his homespun, fake Texan drawl, philosophy bored the balls off me. They could have removed him from the film entirely and the result would have been a much more interesting film. Ugh! PS - message for the Federal Authorities, local police forces, DEA, ATF, etc etc etc - There are a load of dead bodies to be dealt with......"

","I'm going to have to think about this film a while. I watched the new Cohen Brothers film because of all the best picture nods its gotten in the last couple of days. Clearly my thoughts on the film have been colored by the high esteem the film has.<br/><br/>I like it I don't don't love it. Deeply Philosophical and existential western chase film seems to have been put on the screen to win awards. The film seems more allegory than real with a few twists (the late night move by Josh Brolin that makes everything come together is clearly deus ex machina- actually it makes it Greek tragedy since that one act is the weakness that brings down the wrath of the god(s).) and its drive to be about something deeper helped keep the film at arms length for me. Actually the real problem was I never liked Josh Brolin's character. He is marginally better than his pursuer and I never really felt I knew him enough to care. Brolin's Moss' every man in conflict with force of nature/hand of malevolent God Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh isn't someone I could identify with except as a literary notion of a flawed Gary Cooperesque character. These are archetypes not real people. Its so arch and over the top-at least to me- that I wanted to laugh at the silliness of the machismo (though Anton Chigurh is probably one of the five most malevolent characters ever to walk across the screen). I'm curious what the film would be if the Greek chorus bits with Tommy Lee Jones and Woody Harrelson were removed since I think its these often oblique passages, while genuinely thought provoking, are the reason that everyone feels the film is something more than a good western tale. (What if we had a Greek chorus commenting on the events in the James Brolin film Night of the Juggler, would that have made it more than a chase film?) I really DO like the film, I just can't believe that the film has been so invested with such deep meaning (Things thought of while watching the movie: The end of Greed; the failed Cohen brother's attempt at filming James Dickey's To the White Sea; any number of 1930's or 40's westerns;Zane Grey and Louis L Amour Westerns; Mindwalk;Frankensteins pursuit of his creation into the wastes; ...and a few other things-several other bleak chase films- that have started to fade with the lateness of the hour) Oh yea and as for the off screen events that people have complained about...I think they're crazy.

","I'm going to go against the grain here. Everyone's gushing about No Country for Old Men. A new or mediocre director would've earned high praise from me. The problem with this movie is, it was made by a couple guys who've been behind some of the most creative movies and characters American cinema has produced in the last...well, period.<br/><br/>By many metrics No Country for Old Men is very strong. Suspense, tension, cinematography, editing, lighting, and so on. Acting? Well yeah, it's strong -- starting of course with excellent actors. And the Coen Brothers are great at eking wonderful performances out of actors and creating amazing little moments with quirky regional characters. Fargo, Raising Arizona, The Big Lebowski, et al. rate among my favorite movies.<br/><br/>But the characters in this movie didn't particularly develop or evolve. They seemed pat, and ended as they started. It's true, the twisted, truncated ending was refreshing of sorts (no ribbon bows here). But besides that, and death by captive bolt gun, I felt I'd seen nothing new. Nor is the viewer challenged to figure anything out. The story is actually pretty thin. Competent? Yes. Inspired? Sadly, no. The C Bros have raised the bar so much in the past, I should let them get away with making a solid, basic thriller. But people are raving about the genius of this movie and I sure didn't see it."

","I didn't really know anything about this movie walking into it. At first, it started out slowly, though suspensefully, but began to pick up later on, only to finish its last one-third on another slow and ambiguous note.<br/><br/>One of the main problems with this movie is most of the characters' actions are unexplained, we know nothing about these characters and as such, have no reason to care for them. And because of this, I couldn't even begin to explain the story to myself and believe it for the life of me. And that's not even touching the often-bad dialogue. There is zero character development - these characters are all exactly the same in the beginning of the movie as they are at the end.<br/><br/>The first two-thirds of this movie were awesome - if it finished on that tone, I would be completely satisfied. But ""No Country for Old Men"" finishes on just as slow and boring of a note as it began on. I won't remember it a year from now."

I wish that I could say that the sadism is enough to disgust the sadistic, or that the whole thing would turn people against what it depicts. The reasons it won't are: that is is very suspenseful without much plot (or point), that it poses somber pontificating as profundity, that it depicts human struggle, and fear, and suffering as irrelevant to any theme, i.e. as moral non-sequiturs.

The Coen's have been going downhill since Blood Simple. This is better than their last few attempts but nothing special. The critics are of full of it as usual.

","I can't see why this movie was held in such high regard by critics. I think it has to do with the fact that the Cohen brothers wrote the script, immediately launching the movie into an over-hyped bandwagon effect that ended with a couple of academy awards and a lot of four stars reviews. Personally, I felt the movie was the worst thing the Cohen brothers have ever put out. It had a crappy script, one-dimensional characters (Anton could have been developed into much more than just another bloodthirsty, greedy psychopath), and a cliffhanger ending that RESOLVED NOTHING. And don't tell me I didn't understand the movie.<br/><br/>As to charges by fanboys that I ""didn't understand the movie,"" I understand No Country for Old Men quite well - that it is completely devoid of any deeper meaning whatsoever except the depiction of gratuitous violence and other primordial emotions. No Country for Old Men was an excuse to show a guy getting shot in the head with a cattle gun, imho.

","I love this movie because I love arguments about movies. Being the elitist that I am, I have come to use this as my polarising stick when seeing what others' taste is like. If you don't find No Country for Old Men fascinating, I'll prescribe you some sedatives and send you to bed. If you do, you're allowed inside. I've found it hilarious to listen to people complain about how boring it was, how long-winded and stale it was. How they thought American Gangster was the best movie they've ever seen, and why No Country for Old Men should have been more like it.<br/><br/>I could both write and read essay upon review or even a PhD or two about this film given the time. I can't think of any other film I have seen that balances philosophy and plot so well without having a shade of pretentiousness about it. You can talk about the moral decay of America. The pervasive and relentless evil and how that is realised today in society or like Anton Chigurh, in people. You can talk about fate and destiny. What Anton's coin means for his victims. Whether fault lies in chaos, the flip of the coin. Or whether fault is in the person, Anton. You can grab any piece of history, religion or philosophy and see what this film has to say. It's fascinating. A film like this is one that you can't ""look too far"" into, because the way that it is crafted invites its viewers to do exactly so in as invasive fashion as its main antagonist. I think to come away satisfied and content you will need to.<br/><br/>Beware to all, though. This has also become a movie that people who think they are pro cinema have taken to be one of theirs. If someone professes their love for it, ask why. If they do nothing but outpour their love for the Coen brothers, they are your enemy. This is one movie that anyone can put some thought into and have a perspective on. If they don't, they're full of crap.<br/><br/>I read in a news article recently that this Australian film critic thought that 2007 was the beginning of another golden age in cinema. He talked about the 40s and the 70s. The relatively short time periods that consistently produce incredible films. While he did write like an essay by Kevin Smith about Magnolia, I am beginning to agree. 2007 had two American films that everyone is talking about. They're not films that we'll talk about, buy on DVD and forget about. Time will tell, but I am confident that this is a landmark in the nearing 100 odd year tradition of cinema,"

"mOVIemAN56","10","5","13","26 November 2007"," The greatest villain since Hannibal Lecter, the best film of the new millennium, the Coen's deliver again
","No Country for Old Men may quite possibly be the best Coen brothers film to date. From the two men who brought you The Big Lebowski (one of the best comedies of the 90's) Fargo (one of the best drama's of the 90's) and O Brother Where Art Thou? (one of the most beautifully crafted films of 2000) comes this film. If you thought nothing could ever top those three films you are in for a big surprise, No Country for Old Men is not only the best film of 2007 but also one of the best films of the new millennium. It is the nearest to perfection one can get. It is, simply, a modern masterpiece.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Llewelyn Moss, a retired worker who hunts antelope in the deserts of Texas. One day Moss stumbles upon a drug deal gone wrong and also $2 million in cash. Moss takes it and flees only to have a Mexican gang and a sinister assassin by the name of Anton Chigurh. Along the way several men become part of the fray including a sheriff about to retire and a rival assassin of Chigurh's. The story follows that of Llewelyn mostly but Tommy Lee Jones as Sheriff Bell also plays a significant role. In the end it is more then a battle of wits between Moss and Chigurh, it is a battle of good and evil.<br/><br/>First off the acting in the film is among the best I've seen since American Beauty. Brolin, Jones, and Bardem are all Oscar worthy in my opinion. Brolin delivers the perfect portrayal of a man on the run who knows how to use his brain. We don't see Brolin running around shooting at everything that moves, instead the Coens' let us view Moss using his brain which makes the film way more interesting. Brolin's mild manner mix perfectly for the mold of Llewelyn Moss. Overall a great protagonist created by the Coens' and a great portrayal by Josh Brolin, a man we don't see too much of these days.<br/><br/>By far the best acting I've seen by a person this decade comes from that of Spanish actor Javier Bardem as the cold hearted Anton Chigurh. Chigurh sent shivers down my spine every time he spoke and every time he moved. His calm demeanor, mixed with his sociopathic mind makes him simply haunting. What made him the most frightening is that he is so believable. He is smart and deadly but also very much believable and very unique. Instead of the cast mold for villains in cinema (kill, kill, kill), McCarthy makes Chigurh more of like the Angel of Death, deciding who dies by the flip of a coin. His weapon of choice is unique, even how he talks is quite different from most villains of the day. I could easily see a story about a murder like this guy appearing in a paper. While Chigurh is silent and many would portray him as a one-dimensional antagonist, Bardem brings life and soul to the character. This is not the Coen's or McCarthy's work but Bardem's work that makes Javier Chigurh the greatest villain since Hannibal Lecter and one of the greatest in cinema history. Javier Bardem, to say the least, is simply brilliant.<br/><br/>I have few complaints about the film. Many people found a problem with the ending. I had no problems with it. I was thoroughly satisfied as I walked out of the late show. The Coens' make you think. They don't make everything obvious which most directors do. They make an audience think and that is what they do in No Country for Old Men. The movie takes us into the relationship of good and evil and some beautiful scenes are shown to explain how these two interact everyday. The film will shake you up, make you think, and always have you looking over your shoulder expecting to see the red eyes of Chigurh with his coin ready to decide your fate.<br/><br/>No Country for Old Men had me thinking about it for days after. The symbolic meanings of the characters and the speech at the end, the amazing, three-dimensional characters, the beautiful story that is crafted perfectly by McCarthy and adapted beautifully by the Coen's. I honestly wanted to see this movie again and again. Give the film time and don't cast your thumbs up or thumbs down on it until you have let it sit for a day and you have thought about it. I find it to be the best film since American Beauty and a beautiful film with a haunting villain.<br/><br/>5/5 stars"
"ClaytonDavis","7","5","13","24 November 2007"," This Country is Rough
","Brothers Joel & Ethan Coen, the acclaimed filmmakers that brought us Fargo over ten years ago brings their most vicious film to date, No Country for Old Men. As the film evokes all the Coen brothers artistic qualities as their attention to detail and character study, the narrative disenchants the viewer on many levels.<br/><br/>The performances hold the viewers attention, especially during the final forty minutes or so. Many questions are left unanswered and many issues left not addressed. Javier Bardem as the ferociously frightening Anton gives his most stunning performance of his career. As the psychopathic killer looking for his $2 million case, Bardem not shutters, loses focus, or disengages himself from us. As crazy and psychotic as Anton is, there is a hero in him that the audience just loves to hate. A great character study for the Coen brothers indeed.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin as the eager and reserved Llewelyn Moss brings frustration to the viewer based on narrative choices but Brolin powers through and gives his tantalizing turn yet. He does capture the culture of South Texas and develops it into a full on human being. The sentiment we find in Llewelyn is in his relationship with his wife Carla, a beautiful naïve woman, blindly in love with her husband with some many agendas.<br/><br/>Kelly MacDonald as the beautiful Carla brings a resemblance of Amy Adams in Junebug, and we know how that worked out for her. This dramatic turn as minimal as the screen time is makes a lasting impression on everyone. When you walk out the theater it's her and Bardem that you take with you. That naïve persona, ""twangy"" accent, (we forget that she's Scottish) and that wonderful aura of curiosity and worried factors make it authentic to life.<br/><br/>Tommy Lee Jones as the authoritative Sheriff Ed does an admirable job in his performance however, the first half of the film is the Bardem show which Jones can't overshadow at all. In the finale, the viewer is so frustrated by the story that I don't care that Jones is now bringing the humanity to his performance. The film was lively and authentic for me for the first hour and a half, after that, I started looking at my watch wondering when it was going to end. It does disappoint me that Jones' best work was placed in the weakest narrative points of the film. As people may feel different with that end, my intellect left the building at a point of aggravated feeling towards the things left unanswered. It was as if the Coen brothers started the film on pg. 34 of the novel and left out Chapters 12 and 14 to give us the full story.<br/><br/>Consequently the film does work and has great achievements in cinematography and dialogue and is a threat in the upcoming awards race especially for Javier Bardem and Kelly MacDonald however, I can't foresee the Academy jumping on this for a Best Picture statue. This is so unlike Coens' brothers previous works but the detail and storytelling is pure Coen. A admirable turn for them despite the flaws.<br/><br/>Grade: ***/****"

","I just saw ""No Country for Old Men"", on its opening night at my local art-house theater, in a packed audience. I'm still trying to find words to describe it. Yes, the film is THAT good, everything you've heard about it is true (I was afraid I was going to be disappointed, which often happens when you go see a film that's been almost universally acclaimed). I'm not sure this is the Coen Brothers' masterpiece (only future viewings will tell me that), but it stands with ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" and ""Fargo"" as my favourite piece from Joel & Ethan.<br/><br/>This is one of the scariest films I've ever seen, and I'm not easily scared. I mean, I'm not scared by over the top, teen serial killer flicks; believable characters and palpable situations are what really give me the chills (hence ""Dogville"" and ""Heavenly Creatures"" being some of the scariest films I've seen). ""No Country for Old Men"" could be a male variation of Hitchcock's classic ""Psycho"": substitute the naive young secretary, Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) for a fearless hunter (Josh Brolin, never better), and the introspective motel owner Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), for a brutal killing machine (Javier Bardem), and give it an ""A Simple Plan"" (an underrated gem directed by Sam Raimi in 1998) web of 'hickey' characters, and you've got a devastating tale of moral values, choices - and the price we pay for them. Describing this film in details would spoil the experience (the ending is love-it or hate-it as no other I've seen in a long time, and it'll be an infinite topic for discussion). Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh might be the scariest villain I've ever seen, and I dare to say, it will (or at least should) be ranked alongside other classic names such as the cited Norman Bates, Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins in ""The Silence of the Lambs"") and Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates in ""Misery""). You could hear the entire audience's breathing every time he was on screen. An old lady who was sitting beside me literally jumped a couple of times. This powerful role and incredible performance should give Bardem his much deserved Oscar next year (he also should've won for ""Before Night Falls"" 7 years ago). But everybody in the cast (Brolin, Tommy Lee Jones, Kelly Macdonald and Woody Harrelson) is top-notch, and it would be unfair to give credit only to Bardem. After two disappointing features (""Intolerable Cruelty"" and ""The Ladykillers"", easily the worst of their career), the Coens directed an amusing segment for ""Paris, Je t'Aime"" last year, and had a terrific comeback with this instant classic ""No Country for Old Men"". Welcome back to form, Joel & Ethan! 23 years after ""Blood Simple"", you still got the power to amaze us. 10/10."

But somehow they think that it makes it unreal? Real life isn't neat and tidy, and despite the hyper-real characters the Coen's typically create, the situation and events seem like they real could happen, as could the outcome.<br/><br/>Beyond that, the film-making is superb, the acting (other than woody harrelson crap) is fantastic, the characterizations often chilling.<br/><br/>I've seen better movies in my life, but not so far this year, and based on what's left for the next 6 weeks, this movie might win the Oscar by default. Not that it isn't deserving, but it would be nice if there were some stronger competition out there.

","I am not good at writing reviews, especially movie reviews. I would like to write a brilliant review to explain why I dislike this movie. It would take so much time and I don't have the talent! Let me try to explain in a few words why I dislike this movie. It is said in Germany that when you do not know what to wear to go out, then you have to choose black, because black is always trendy. The Coen brothers are extremely talented, but they have a tendency to forget that they are movie directors. They are very proud to make a movie like this because beyond violence it is quite intellectual. It is a ""black suit"" movie. Fashionable, because of its nihilistic and pessimistic meaning. The problem is that there is no story. It is a collection of situations, totally unrealistic. There is no dialogue. There is no love. It is Terrence Malik, without Nature and beauty. It has the absurdity of Tarantino, but with darker tones and details. It is promising a lot, but does not offer anything. The Sheriff is tired and getting old. He retires in the middle of a criminal investigation to have dreams and breakfast with his wife. The killer kills with the efficiency and mechanical patience of a fumigator. The pseudo-hero is bleeding all the time and running with a dark suitcase in the middle of empty cities. Because this movie is about the passing of ages, and how a world without values is disintegrating. The problem is that the movie is the first victim of this collective disintegration. It is not funny. It is not even boring. It is empty. No country for any man, old or young. No country at all. I hope the Coen brothers can stop making movies like these. They should never forget that it is important to make people happy. It does not need to be a comedy, but something to make your heart beat a little faster. You can have drama and still smile. Something to make life more interesting and enjoyable. This movie is like a drop of semen from a 91 years old man. A lot of effort for nothing. If some people feel rejuvenated with that kind of seminal power, then they must really have a need for it! Please do not waste your time and watch ""Bad Lands"" by Terrence Malik instead."

","Well, the Coens always make ""interesting"" films and I'd have to say this is no exception. They make very good vignettes I think, and some scenes in this film make nice little stand-alone pieces of cinema but, overall, they don't give a damn about the film as a whole. It has been put together clumsily and without feeling. The characters are essentially 2D, the plot has big holes in it and many plot lines, big and small, just peter out or are not resolved. Stupid things like the hero deliberately leaving his car half-a-mile away from the death scene in a pitch-black desert and walking the rest of the way merely so the next scene with the bad guys can take place. The killer seen waiting in the motel room for the sheriff to create tension but then, oh, he isn't because it was, what? a flashback? the sheriff's imagination? a cinematic artifice? The philosophizing of the characters, especially the sheriff, is supposed to be deep and meaningful I guess but is more like Monty Python dialogue. Following the hero intensely and then having his final scene off-camera may be 'clever' film-making but it is deeply unsatisfying. It is very contrived, especially they way they flag-wave it as an 'intellectual' film but not answering any questions the viewer may have such as what happened to the money, what happened to the wife, what happened to the bad guy, etc.. Scene-after-scene, from beginning to end, was deliberately left without a conclusion; it became tiring after a while and you begin to think ""why am I watching this scene? I know there isn't going to be an ending or any kind of resolution or denouement"". Not a good film for popcorn-eaters but an interesting artifice for auteur geeks perhaps"

This film has so many plot holes and ridiculous coincidences, and what is particularly irritating is that the Coen brothers have deliberately set out to wind the audience up: 1) Find a transponder in the money case? Keep it with you of course instead of setting up an ambush. 2) Hang about on the Mexican border for hours waiting to be arrested with a case full of money. 3) Who were the Mexicans in the hotel room, and whose hotel room was it? I simply don't care and I can't be bothered to find out. 4) Ditto for the guy in the skyscraper and Woody from Cheers.<br/><br/>And how about film making skill? 1) Leave out pretty much all background music just so we can hear crunching gravel and tyre noise effects to add atmosphere.

He is accountable to no known human constraint; not logic, not the law, and certainly not compassion.

Namely, that we are constantly being stalked by the angel of death, we have no idea when he will overtake us, but every day we live we are certain he is closer at hand than the day before. We stand by as others are taken, and there seems to be no rhyme or reason to it. The good often die long before they deserve; the bad often die long after they deserve.

"SeussMeTub","10","4","10","10 February 2008"," Superb Adaptation of a Master Storyteller
","For years Cormac McCarthy has been a literary sensation. While never achieving the massive success of Stephen King or Tom Clancy when he first began writing novels in the mid 1960's (perhaps because he churns out so few- NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is only his 9th novel) he has been hailed as the literary successor to William Faulkner. I have read only two of his novels so far: the Appalachian Gothic horror novel OUTER DARK and his seminal masterpiece, the revisionist western BLOOD MERIDIAN. His novels sear into your very soul- they are not easily forgotten- and only the best writers can do that.<br/><br/>If there are any common themes in all of McCarthy's novels, they all point to a message of social Darwinism. His books are regularly downbeat, representing a world full of violence and despair, peopled by the most evil of men and the intertwining of ordinary folks who try their best to live their lives despite the bleak, unrelenting landscape (McCarthy is the only author I know who makes the land feel like a living, breathing person, just like his characters) that surrounds them.<br/><br/>NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is the second adaptation of his works (the first was the pedestrian and forgettable ALL THE PRETTY HORSES which starred Matt Damon) and this time directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, two brothers who have become fixtures in the cult scene (one of their other movies is MILLER'S CROSSING, my favorite gangster movie next to the GODFATHER). While many literary critics regard NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN as one of McCarthy's lesser works, even a lesser McCarthy novel is still light years ahead of most other books in terms of quality. NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is a purely straightforward thriller and in the hands of a lesser director (or in this case, directors) would have been just another movie that would have quietly gone on to the DVD rack (like Matt Damon's movie), but due to the fact that the Coens are great admirers of McCarthy's works, they were able to stay true to the spirit of the book and in a sense, made a masterpiece- this movie should be studied in film schools as to ""How To Make A Proper Book Adaptation To Film And Not Muck It Up 101"".<br/><br/>The plot is exceedingly simple: set in the southwest circa 1980, redneck loser Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin in his best role ever) stumbles upon the aftermath of a drug deal gone bad. He decides to take the drug money, but in a moment of conscience, gets identified by both sides who want the money back. In comes the deadly killer Anton Chigurh (ironically pronounced ""sugar"" and is played to perfection by Xavier Bardem) who goes on an interstate rampage (one of his most inventive weapons is a compressed air canister) as he sets his sights on the fleeing Moss to get the money back, whatever the cost. Not since Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter has there been a superb and deadly villain to ever come on screen, Bardem can scare you just by looking at you, he doesn't even need to utter a word; and if he doesn't win the Oscar it will be a travesty. The cat and mouse game between Moss and Chigurh is further complicated by the investigations of a local sheriff portrayed by Tommy Lee Jones in his usual stoic attire who tries to make some sense amidst all of the mayhem (but ultimately fails). The movie starts haphazardly and ends abruptly, which is just like McCarthy's books (and just like real life)- if you are looking for a formulaic Hollywood movie with a clear beginning and ending then its best to watch a Disney, a Michael Bay movie or ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS- this one's not for you.<br/><br/>The Coen brothers perfectly captures the unrelenting harshness of Cormac McCarthy's world- a world in which the big fish eat the little fish and the bad sleep well at night- McCarthy may be a bit of a downer, but in my view he is right. In the last few years McCarthy has now finally gotten the attention he deserves, his newest novel THE ROAD won the Pulitzer prize and a movie adaptation of it is heading to the big screen soon- let us hope that they get it right just like this one and not make it end up like Matt Damon's movie. Now if only they would also make a faithful literary adaptation of BLOOD MERIDIAN- now that would indeed be a miracle"

It has a very interesting story about a Vietnam veteran who finds a bag with two million dollars, this situation unleashes a persecution between the veteran and a psycho killer looking for the money and a investigation of the local sheriff. The cast is simply wonderful, Josh Brolin gives a perfect acting as Llewelyn Moss, Javier Bardem's flawless performance earned him a Oscar nomination, totally worthy in my opinion. Tommy Lee Jones excellent as always and Woody Harrelson with a brief but very convincing role.

"jon.h.ochiai","9","4","10","10 February 2008"," Great, but what gives?
","At the conclusion of ""No Country for Old Men"" I thought the Coen Brothers gave me and the audience ""the finger"". After 2 hours of mesmerizing storytelling with the brilliant cinematography of Roger Deakins, the movie endswithout a discernible third act. I will cop to being obtuse. Instead of giving ""the finger"" back, I acknowledge the masterpiece at work with Writers and Directors Ethan and Joel Coen. The performances are astounding from Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin, and Javier Bardem. Bardem as the sociopath killer Anton Chigurh is powerful, and deserves to win the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.<br/><br/>""No Country for Old Men"" on the surface glorifies sociopath professional killer Chigurh (Bardem) in his mission to retrieve $2 millionat least on the surface. The Coen Brothers never manufacture any insight into the ruthless and nearly indestructible Chigurh. Tommy Lee Jones's Sheriff Ed Bell's resolution is poignant in keeping with the title, and hinting a possible future, but is completely out of context. Even if the Coens intend this as a great existential treatise, it is overly indulgent and does not work. There is no compelling catharsis to ""No Country for Old Men"". Having a catharsis about either the good or evil in men would have been welcome. Here one just seems missing. Even reflecting upon the ending I kept expecting to see Pam Ewing seeing Bobby in the shower on that infamous episode of ""Dallas"". What happened here? I get that exploration into human darkness and ambiguous endings equate to movie gravitas. However, here I wonder how much of this is the Directors' arrogance? <br/><br/>Set in 1980, ""No Country for Old Men"" opens multi-textured. On a deer hunting trip Lewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) discovers a massacre in the middle of nowhere. The scene is an apparent drug deal gone awry: murdered bodies everywhere, a shipment of heroin, and $2 million. Chigurh brutally escapes local sheriffs' custody and begins a merciless killing rampage. The cold blooded Chigurh is singular in focus, and chillingly displays mastery at what he does. Lewelyn returns to his trailer home and wife Carla Jean (good Kelly Macdonald). Lewelyn does not know what to do next, but he knows that as long as he has the money both he and Carla Jean are in grave danger. Meanwhile in the city, Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson) meets with a mysterious man who wants him to locate Chigurh and the money. Carson confirms that Chigurh is a very bad man. Tommy Lee Jones as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell narrates the story's opening. His voice is tired and resigned, saying ""I always knew you had to be willing to die to even do this job - not to be glorious."" Jones embodies a battle worn weariness, and folksy common sense in Ed Tom. Soon all story threads converge, and Ed Tom must bring to justice the murderous Chigurh.<br/><br/>The Coen brothers chillingly compel in their story of greed, murder, and betrayal. This certainly is no place for old men, who have grown weary of the evil that men can do and no longer have the resolve to do what is necessary. That may be simple speak; however, it may be appropriate for this tale. Given all the passionate and brilliant work, I think the Coens really disappoint in the end. Even if this is their existential masterpiece where both good and evil men survive in the world or that life really means nothing in a profound sense, at least complete a Third Act of a story. After investing 2 hours watching brilliant storytelling, at least have the humility to conclude the story in some recognizable manner."

Oh, wait...

In 1980, near the Rio Grande in Texas, a hunter (Josh Brolin) stumbles on a drug deal gone wrong: dead bodies, and a briefcase full of cash, which he takes. He is then hunted down by a sociopath (Javier Bardem), hired to retrieve the money, while a veteran sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) investigates the crime scene.<br/><br/>No Country For Old Men is a pitch-perfect piece of film-making, all at one with its complex, dark subject matter: a nightmarish scenario of unfettered, unstoppable evil descending on a dry, desolate land, sweeping aside notions of decency as old-fashioned and irrelevant. As is often the case, the Coens twist and bend genre rules to their own ends, and the story crackles with dry humour and surprises: one character meets his end off screen in what, in other hands, would seem anti-climactic. Jones is the voice of decency here, a weary man nearing retirement age and fearful of an impending doom in which evil would become routine. He has good cause: as the relentless Chuigurh, Bardem is utterly terrifying.

I did not read the book, so I was left to guess key pieces of the action, and yes, life is full of mysteries, but I could detect no logic in how the Coen brothers decided what to leave out - these just looked like intentional wholes in the plot, obviously intentional because these guys know too well how to tell a story. The ending which was intended to be symmetrical with the beginning was supposed to give a different perspective to the whole story, but it did not really make me vibrate either. It is maybe because the combination of the genres of violent gangsters conflict, greed and hate motivated pursuits and the western setting do not really rime in my mind with the kind of philosophy Tommy Lee Jones' character was articulating in words at the end.

A lot of people die and it's not always clear why. Tommy Lee Jones plays an ineffectual sheriff-philosopher who fails to stop the carnage. Depending on your viewpoint Anton Chigurh is either a deranged lunatic or an instrument of the devil. Either way, a couple of hours in his company doesn't give you a better understanding of the human condition or what motivates him. The film peters out at the end and you are left wondering about the film's message. It also gives the impression that people in west Texas talk slowly and live in poverty.<br/><br/>Many acclaimed U.S. directors achieve their greatest critical successes making movies about monosyllabic gunmen who kill indiscriminately. Gratuitous violence is starting to seem like a form of pornography, but Tarantino and Scorcese have shown it's an easy way to make an acclaimed movie. You don't need to bother with eloquent speeches or require much of a plot. You just need a creepy killer and some imaginative butchery. One can only speculate wonder how future generations will view the honors heaped on this type of film and our fascination with mindless violence."

","I rated this one 4/10 only due to the ending. For most of the movie, I was absorbed and curious as to where it was going, and what some of the characters were going to amount to.<br/><br/>In the final scene, I found myself drifting off during Tommy Lee Jones' monologue about his dreams. There is nothing more boring than to hear another person talk about a dream they had. Then, cut to black. I can't remember the last time a movie really ticked me off -- maybe Matrix 3.<br/><br/>Some of the characters were downright cartoony. I don't mean the ones like the desk clerk or that cashier -- they were real in their sort of way. The mother was something straight out of The Golden Girls and her act took me right out of the movie.<br/><br/>I like movies where sometimes things are ambiguous, and might require a second viewing to catch what you missed the first time. But since this one has no point, I see no point in ever seeing it again."

","It's hard to believe that I didn't stop the DVD after the first 45 minutes. This was not Tommy Lee Jones best movie by far. I don't like the ending how they leave you hanging wondering if that was the way they were going to end the movie. I didn't like the acting at all. In fact I thought most of the acting was just plain BAD. There are too many time in this movie where I find myself saying ""who was that and why did he go there?"" I don't know maybe I am a conventional movie goer that wants a clear cut protagonist and a clear cut antagonist. Maybe I am movie watcher that wants a clear ending. I don't like the darkness of this movie although I like movies that are dark, but I just didn't like this one. I don't even mind if the bad guy gets away at least there is an ending. Now I know why this movie got all of it's Oscars. I can only think of a small few of movies that win huge Oscars that I actually like. I would have preferred to goto the dentist than watch this movie."
"Mr_Sensitive","8","3","7","17 March 2008"," I Love The Character
","The main reason I went to see this movie was people won’t keep on talking about it. I love good movie. This also got one of the best reviews of the year and nominated for Oscar and BAFTA, so it’s pretty much an assurance. But what I didn’t expect was an instant classic; this will truly be talk about in years to come (unlike those Crash, The Departed, Million Dollars Baby, and Chicago) (I still wonder if people still remember that those movie actually won an Oscar for Best Picture too?)(Yeah, it was fun at that time, but no one talk about it anymore, so what is the point)<br/><br/>What I like about this movie was the driven story with great flow and the character that has been written with so much enthusiasm and characteristic, it very rare nowadays to find things like this in the movie. As much as I don’t really see what happening much in the movie apart from the thrill we get from Anton weather he will decide to kill or not, I find myself extremely enjoying it. It was the character driven story so this is definitely not up for everybody.<br/><br/>The casting and the acting got to be the best part in the movie; boys, those actors sure bring those characters out so beautifully. It was a superb acting – Anton was rough, destructive, outlaw, at the same time can be thoughtful and have his own set of rules. Llewelyn Moss is kind, thoughtful but at the same times a fighter, a survivor. Sheriff was old and doing nothing. Man, that Texas accent is really hard to understand.<br/><br/>I also love the lighting in this movie, I thought it was clever and save the movie from looking too dry with most shot was in the deserted place. Also great cinematography, not this year best but it was awesome. I think it wills more easily if I say everything was awesome. The story also contains the metaphor that is quite hard to understand; specially the ending. <br/><br/>Recommendation: Serious Movie Watcher Should Have It As A Collection. Reason To Watch: One of the best pictures of the year, Very well written characters, Awesome acting.<br/><br/>Reason Not To: Desert, Personal dislike of this genre of movie.<br/><br/>Rating:8.5/10 (Grade: A-)"
"albert-wayne","10","3","7","13 March 2008"," Fantastic Movie...Friendo.
","Joel and Ethan Coen pull off their best work since Fargo, and maybe The Man who Wasn't There, and like in Fargo, they come up with a tour De force of writing, directing, acting and cinematography.<br/><br/>No Country for Old Men is albeit a complex movie, it's certainly not a movie you can fully digest in one sitting, this review is boldly written after just two sittings, yet, that doesn't necessarily mean that it's an over the top art house movie for twelve people. The movie, being a classic Coen brothers movie, it's very entertaining from beginning to end. The story is a grabber from the start, and their narrative, so rich in the small details that make you buy into the action even more.<br/><br/>The performances are all great, there's no main character or anything, I don't think we could really call Tommy Lee Jones the protagonist, this is more of an ensemble piece, and as en ensemble, it's fantastic, there's not a single weak link, all of the actors were extremely effective. Tommy Lee Jones gives a great, subtle, and poignant performance as a Keystone Texas Sheriff, Josh Brolin is great as the laconic Texas loner, Kelly MacDonald is extremely convincing and honest as the Texan trailer housewife, I immediately forgot her original thick Scottish accent and completely bought her uncanny Texan accent, she was an inspired piece of casting. Woody Harrelson was quite effective as usual.<br/><br/>I've been saving however, the best for last, Javier Bardem's chilling performance is the one that shines and stands out the most, his portrayal of Anton Chigurh is one of the most chilling performances since probably Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs. I know the world chilling is tossed rather lightly these days, but trust me, Bardem's really earns the adjective, his cold hearted, yet human and realistic portrayal of Chigurh is memorable, he has created, along with the Coen brothers, a memorable an assassin as The Terminator or Hannibal Lecter.<br/><br/>The film has an impressive look, kudos to the always amazing Roger Deakins for a strong looking cinematography, imposing long shots of the Texan country side, as impressive as North Dakota's white desert looks of Fargo, as well as an extensive use of shadows, very good stuff.<br/><br/>The Coens writing is palpable, as well as their direction, all of the strange and curious details of middle Americans of rural and remote areas, the rather film noir plot the movie deals with, as well as the trials and tribulations of the veteran Sheriff, the riffs between husband's and wives, and the minutia details of crime, they all sum up to a very entertaining, if at times puzzling and challenging film.<br/><br/>This movie is certainly extremely poetic, you do have to pay attention and digest some of the information very carefully, and, well, there's nothing wrong with that.<br/><br/>This movie is easily one of the best of the year, one of the Coens best movies, and, well, just a complete masterpiece. Congratulations all around."
"mefisto222","5","3","7","10 March 2008"," Disappointing movie? Yes, really!!!
","As I read the reviews about this movie, they seemed to me divided into two groups: 0-2 stars rating or 9-10 stars rating. To be honest, I cannot belong to any of these groups. I am giving five stars as a movie worth just your money, but nothing more. I have seen three movies in last 14 days: There Will Be Blood, Vantage Point and NCFOM. Surprisingly, NCFOM was the worst one for me. Why?<br/><br/>After leaving the cinema on Saturday, I was deeply disappointed about this movie. According to reviews, regardless the Oscar, I expected great acting, strong characters, excellent plot and last but not least breathtaking cinematography. Sort of 9-10 movie. IMHO, it went 50:50.<br/><br/>Plot & Cinematography<br/><br/>The good think: Cinematography is great. No cheap studio images or wanna-be thrilling sequences from a chopper.<br/><br/>The bad thing: Plot The beginning itself proves the weakness of the plot. The first-class assassin Chigurh (Javier Bardem) caught by the local young sheriff. After next minutes of the movie watching Chigurgh's attitude to human beings , I realized this rookie sheriff was apparently the toughest guy from all. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, the first hour of the movie is really thrilling, even despite some typical ""action scenes"" man-car chasing or pit-bull shot by the river in very last second, both with Moss (Josh Brolin). In fact, the best part of the movie was clearly the events around hotels and motels during Brolin's getaway.<br/><br/>However, what the first hour promises, the further part cannot keep. Philosophical lectures of sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), although funny, somehow far away from the movie. Apart from lack of the real law enforcement in the story (you cannot always expect super cool FBI or DEA agents), you won't experience who or what was behind the wrong running drug deal or contracting Chigurh. <br/><br/>The last but biggest disappointment is the ending. I do not expect the good guy is the last man standing, however some kind of conclusion would be fine. Everyone is dead, the killer has shown human feeling and did not shoot two teenagers and Jones is drinking coffee<br/><br/>Acting & characters. Undoubtedly Javier Bardem as psycho killer Anton Chigurh is the evil of the season 2007/2008. I have remembered him from Collateral as Felix, small part but great performance. The way he is killing in NCFOM is more than obvious brutality mixed with insanity, although he acts like a killing ET (Predator type). You should not seek a real person behind. Someone may like it, someone not. But I did. <br/><br/>Josh Brolin is usually a quite underrated actor and I do not know why. I think he has proved in this movie his skill to play normal guys being in wrong time at wrong place. However, his character Llewelyn Moss leaves the story like a pit-bull he shot by the river, although he carried probably 50% of the movie. No one is expecting him to be last man standing, but his character required something else as the ending in my opinion.<br/><br/>The biggest disappointment in this movie is part given to Tommy Lee Jones as the old sheriff Ed Tom Bell. I admire this guy truly and his acting is great in NCFOM. Nevertheless, his pseudo-psychological character without being a real part of the story is like cut from other movie with no sense. As soon as Jones was on the screen, I had feeling it is like a commercial break during the sport event. No real involvement or effect on the story. Really wasting him for this role. The same applies for the role of Woody Harrelson.<br/><br/>Finally, when I was leaving the theater I met lot of people thinking: ""Was that a movie, I expected?"" My answer is no, it was not bad but nothing special. Compare to The Will Be Blood very poor"

","Firstly let me start by saying I love Coen brother movies. Fargo was great as was O Brother, where Art Thou. But what happened here? Did the Coen brothers think that the audience would call this a piece of art because it is one of their movies? Did they honestly think that we viewers were going to be all goo goo and awash with pride for them?..HAHA..not me..Coen's what are you doing? Don't get me wrong though. This movie has some merit if you like seeing some bad ass Mexican looking dude going on a killing spree. Just who was he anyway? What did he have to do with the drugs and money? This wasn't fully explained to me in the film. Basically it goes like this: A drug deal has gone bad out in the American desert..bodies everywhere..even the poor dog cops a bullet. White guy hunter/welder Llewelyn Moss played by Josh Brolin comes across the aftermath of this bad deal and comes upon 2 million dollars in cash..He decides to take it. Bad ass Mexican looking dude Anton Chigurh played by Javier Bardem starts to hunt him to get the money back. Bad ass Mexican dude kills everyone in his path using what looks to me to be a gun concocted from a cylinder of compressed air that he carts around with him. White guy hunter/welder runs away and stays in hotels. Bad ass Mexican dude tracks him via a transmitter in the money's bag. Carson Wells played by Woody Harrelson pops into the movie. God knows why and gets killed 5 minutes later. A Sheriff, Ed Tom Bell played by Tommy Lee Jones who is about to retire is kind of on the case but he doesn't really do much except sprout philosophy, read his newspaper and drive around in his Sherrifs car. White guy hunter/welder gets killed...Off camera. White guy hunter/welders wife gets killed...Off camera. Bad ass Mexican dude has a car accident, which probably would have killed or seriously injured any normal person and walks away from it with a broken arm. The Sheriff then tells us of a dream he had. The End...like WHAT THA???? I couldn't believe it. I wanted to see a proper ending to the film not just a sudden stop like that and especially not after enduring 2hrs worth. What a disappointment. The best thing about this movie I thought was the character played by Javier Bardem. He was Baddd Asssss. I've given it 5/10 because of his part."
"jmim-1","1","3","7","1 March 2008"," Fargo rides again
","Almost every review I have read on this movie compares it to Fargo. Now that I have seen it, I know why. It is little more than a remake. They might have named this film Odessa, like the last one was named Fargo, and the next Coen brothers movie will be named after some town in, oh, I don't know, pick a state. And that movie will also explore how innocent people are incapable of comprehending evil, and the moral choices people make, and the two or three other sub-themes that apparently preoccupy the brothers' minds more than they do everyone else's.<br/><br/>Fargo was a great film, and this one might also have been, were it not for the fact that is a rip-off, plain and simple. I have no problem with the way the movie ended, or how it began, or what went on in it. The characters, the setting, the photography were all first rate. It was just so irrelevant. Compounding this major problem were the roles of Woody Harrelson and Tommy Lee Jones. For all the swagger of these two characters, they certainly couldn't have been more ineffectual. What purpose did they serve? One told us how crazy Anton was, and the other told us how senseless he was. Looking back to Fargo, they are reminiscent of the oriental fellow who meets Marge in the Radison coffee shop. An annoying distraction, nothing more.<br/><br/>I was also perturbed by the inconsistency in the nature of the violence. In the beginning of the film, the violence is as graphic as has ever been done. By the end of the film, we are left with the slightest of implications that someone has come to a gruesome demise. Did the filmmakers suddenly develop weak stomachs? Did they run out of novel ways to kill people? Did they run out of fake blood? As for the car accident, well, I think I had stopped trying to understand it by then, so I'll wait to see if someone can clarify that event.<br/><br/>I admire the Coen brothers' talent, but I truly hope they get out of the house between now and their next film, and find a new theme to explore. It wouldn't have to be radically different. Maybe they could look at how innocent people might somehow come to grips with senseless violence, and find a way to deal with it - and not in the usual Hollywood style of heroic vengeance."

","On a detour from my normal way of starting, I like a lot of things. I like ice cream. I like plot. I like good acting. This movie had none of the above. <br/><br/>No Country for Old Men, at least for me, was a bad use of two hours. The only point in the movie seemed to be that Tommy Lee Jones didn't like the direction the country was going. The action, the money, the chasing just didn't fit. <br/><br/>This may be an excellent book, but I didn't go to the theatre to read a book; I go to see movies. I shouldn't have to read the book to understand the plot of a movie.<br/><br/>There has been a lot of tout around Javier Bardem; I simply don't see it. He did a good job, but not Oscar worthy. Jones made me happy with his presence, but it seemed like he was there for his face, not what he added to the screen. Woody and Root - why were they there? They had no place. The guy that ""Sugar"" made choose in the coin toss - he wasn't needed. The chase in the beginning, the dog, the air gun. It's like they took the most random things they could find and threw them into a script. <br/><br/>Overall, this may be the best adaptation of a book ever to grace the silver screen, but if an educated member of your audience is left going ""Huh?"" then you have failed as a movie. Props to Roger Deakins - great shots, but even the cinematography can't pull No Country for Old Men out of the toilet for me. 1 out of 10."

He takes the money and finds he is now the target of others who also want the loot. He is pursued by an especially pathological mass murderer. The drug money often gets lost in this plot as the cat and mouse pursuit becomes the main action. There is a back and forth theme and lots of diversionary subplots. Not only do viewers get lost it is clear the directors lost it too. The ending is inconclusive with the audience disappointed with the impotent anticlimax.

It is a disturbing movie and if you are looking for the normal good guy overcomes baddie ending forget it. The movie gets you in and keeps you there because you simply cannot predict exactly what is going to happen. You are treated to very visual violence and you are teased by potential implied outcomes some you see directly, some in your peripheral vision and some are implied.

"bobsgrock","10","3","7","8 February 2008"," Everything you've heard is true.
","Whatever has been said about this film is completely true. It is one of the best films of the year, it is the best Coen brothers film since 1996's Fargo, and it is a top-notch thriller that keeps you guessing and wondering what could possibly happen next. From the startling beginning to the abrupt ending, we are always left guessing. And that is the way it should be, since none of these characters really know what is going to happen next either. From a technical view, this is perfect film-making. The camera movement is amazing. The cinematography is beautiful to look at amidst all the blood and violence, and the acting is incredibly accurate. Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin, Kelly MacDonald and Woddy Harrelson are all fantastic in their respected parts. However, as it has been reported, the best is Javier Bardem, whose performance as a ruthless, cold-blooded, heartless and ultimately inhuman killing machine is so real and shocking, you might think this is Bardem's job. He deserved every award he got for this role, and he will walk away with Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars on Feb. 24. Overall, this is an amazing production. We aren't quite sure how to react to this, but think about it some more and a solution may come to mind. As for the Oscars, I believe this will win at least Supporting Actor, Director(s), Adapted Screenplay, and Cinematography. As for Best Picture, that is between No Country for Old Men, There Will Be Blood, and the Oscar voters. Let the votes come in."

Woody Haralson could also have been left out of the movie all together and it would have been just as good.<br/><br/>Come on people; let's put our precociousness aside and rate the movie for what it is... a let down.

","I have loved every one of the Coen's dark comedies, and they all have the same great edge to them. However, their latest film, No Country For Old Men, is no such film. The film focuses on three characters. Josh Brolin as Llewellyn, a poor veteran who stumbles upon 2 million dollars, Javier Bardem as Anton Chirguh, a sociopath who is after the money and will let nothing get in his way. Bardem gives the best performance because he is so inhumane but attempts to have mercy. He is one of the scariest villains I have ever seen. Lastly Tommy Lee Jones as Ed Tom Bell, the sheriff who follows their footsteps. The film is mostly told through Jones's character, but all three characters have their own moments where they are telling the story. Every year comes a film that makes you grip your seat. This is the one. The whole movie feels so real as Brolin and Bardem play cat-and-mouse with one another. Part of the reality is that there is no music, and there is no soundtrack playing in the background in real life, and without the music you feel more in the movie, like it is happening to you. The Coen brothers know exactly what they are doing and as a result they make the best movies. 10/10 or A"

Never saw a movie that followed the book as closely as NCFOM. If possible, the book is even bleaker than the film.<br/><br/>There's a scene where Ed Tom Bell pulls up in his car and when he shuts it off, you can hear the car has a pre-ignition problem. Boy could I relate to that, especially when you consider the movie is set in 1980. Little things like that just make the movie so believable. I have to admit the ending did surprise me the first time but after reading the book and seeing the movie again, it fits perfectly. I watched I Am Legend last night and enjoyed it but NCFOM is a classic. For those expecting a typical Hollywood fare, stay home.

","""No Country for Old Men"" is a typical in the good sense Brothers Coens' film. In their new Crime /Drama / Western/Thriller, adapted from Cormac McCarthy's novel of the same title, Coens explore the subject they seem to be very interested in: the crime gone wrong, the temptations it promises, and how it involves and affects the basically good and decent people who suddenly find themselves running for their very lives with death just one step behind or even closer. It is bloody, gripping, extremely atmospheric, darker then dark, with the tension that makes your anticipation of the horrible things to happen even stronger than actually watching these things happen, and with typical for Coens humor that they find in the darkest places. If anything, the movie introduces the evil of such quiet, demented, determined, and meticulously deadly force in the character of Anton Chigurh in the performance of life time by Javier Bardem that it will set the new standards of the screen villain from now on. Bardem plays ruthless, slow speaking, coin tossing hit man who would always finish his job, keep his word, and follow his own twisted code of ethics. His favorite killing weapon is a pneumatic air gun and I am not sure when I was scared more, when Bardem used his weapon or when he politely talked and smiled with that blood freezing smile of his. I will be very surprised if Bardem does not receive the Oscar for his performance.<br/><br/>The film has infuriated almost as many viewers as it has satisfied with the unorthodox road it took somewhere 30 minutes before the ending. I can only say, if you want a nice and neatly wrapped up cool little thriller, go and see a Hollywood movie. ""No Country for Old Men"" is no country for predictable but if you want to see a movie you would not be able to stop thinking about way after it's over and you'd keep playing it in your head over and over, and wouldn't shake off its atmosphere, and couldn't forget its characters, go and see ""No Country for Old Men - you may find yourself at home in that country of film-making."

The villain is worth the ticket price alone, a truly well cast and twisted killer that uses a novel device to eliminate any obstacles. The setting is also fun, set in 1980, you are immersed in the old Texas towns like in the original ""The Getaway"". Tommy Lee Jones, who is a main character, gets very little screen time. Josh Brolin is the archetypical everyguy. He makes (mostly) smart decisions once he discovers a stash of drug money. But it is Chigurh, the villain, that dominates the mood of the piece, and will certainly be talked about in the future. There lots of 'gotchas' that make you jump, and the well crafted sequence of events are fun to watch as they play out. So you are juiced through the 1st and 2nd acts, only to be given a different outcome.<br/><br/>**Minor Spoilers ahead** The 3rd act is definitely unpredictable, so one can be assured that it won't be the same shootout on the rooftop that you've seen a hundred times. What happens instead, without us first realising it, is that basically the end of the 2nd act is the end of the movie, and the subsequent scenes are like ""what ever happened to..."" And again, it is not what you think. Which brings us back to Tommy Lee Jones, a tired old Texas Sheriff who chooses his own happy ending, giving the audience a different closure than they were expecting. Think of the finale of ""The Sopranos"". **End of Spoilers**<br/><br/>So you are guaranteed to be talking about this ending when you walk out of the theatre, it may be a good thing. For some, however, there may be more of reaction that this is an art film disguised as a thriller. My final summation is that it is a some of both, 2 acts of thriller and 1 act of art film. That tips the scale enough to give this a 6 out of 10."
"theLateHarvest","9","3","7","10 November 2007"," three heads make a better film than one
","There is something honorable about a healthy respect for inevitability. Chigurh (Javier Bardem) has that, as does sheriff, Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), however the latter still struggles with it. Chigurh with steady violent logic has embraced the course of inevitability by removing himself from the nature of his affairs outside of their necessity. ""What good is the rule you set for yourself if it has brought you here?"" he asks Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson) before executing him so to turn and answer the phone. The rules that Chigurh has set for himself are a practical response to the land he inhabits and as proof of their effectiveness he moves easily through the violent border zone. The Sheriff knows these lands well and comes to respect Chigurh as he would a Gila monster. ""I wouldn't say he's insane but he has a thick bark on him"". Chigurh's silenced shotgun could not have been more appropriate as his rule to leave no witness of his passage requires a certain degree of reserve, and when the necessity to kill is in question the best he humanly do is to defer judgment to a coin toss. Of course fairness has nothing to do with it, but at least heads or tails is a fighting chance. <br/><br/>All credit for the story and the characters is with McCarthy, and can be found in his novel. That cannot be understated. When a series of brutal events handed over a case of money to Moss (Josh Brolin) he was as good as dead. Dead because of what we consider honorable and human in him- his mercy towards a dying man and the love of his wife. In this story those strengths are a hindrance, and are rolled under by that which the sheriff reluctantly observes and Chigurh obeys. That is McCarthy's work. But that it was delivered to you flawlessly on a movie screen, that was all Cowan.<br/><br/>And what a masterstroke of cinema. Everything was done with surgical precision. Lean acting made defined characters set in cinematography that is both beautiful and deliberate with a simple narrative that fenced in a fierce story with its barb wire dialogue. All make for an incredible film that moves across the screen like molten lead. <br/><br/>That said, the strength of No Country as a cinematic work is to be found in the adaptation. The Cowans know the devices of cinema that function apart from the novel and the manner in which they were used to adapt the story is what made this film a success. Without going into detail I'll name a few examples, the absence of music, the adjusted chase scenes, and the remarkable casting are the most obvious, but the stylistic details are numerous and no less effective, and I suggest that to appreciate the brothers talent in this regard you read the book and watch the film again."

","If it was possible to give negative stars I would. I really don't get what everyone is raving about. I even had a friend recommend this movie - now I'm gonna have to question his taste in movies. Horrible storyline, awful acting (except for Tommy Lee) and just dull. I kept watching, thinking it's got to get better. No such luck. And I couldn't help thinking the ""bad guy"" has the worst hairstyle - I don't care if it is the early 80s, most 80s hair rocks, but not his. Not much else to say.

"lluewhyn","2","4","11","27 December 2010"," Critically acclaimed for breaking conventions, which isn't always good.
","I really was looking forward to seeing this movie due to the critical consensus and even a couple of positive reviews from coworkers.<br/><br/>The movie certainly starts out extraordinarily well with some deft cinematography and storytelling. With barely any dialogue, you can still tell exactly what is happening as Llewelyn Moss discovers a major drug deal gone awry, and how he cautiously explores the devastation and pockets the money. You can tell that the main character is somewhat grizzled, knows his way around weapons, would likely kill a man, but yet isn't a callous killer as he simply disarms a man and offers some rough consolation rather than just filling him full of holes.<br/><br/>Shortly after this part, the movie went downhill for me. Personally, it's like watching the Terminator and having someone snarkily say, ""These final showdowns are so cliché, wouldn't it be much cooler if Reese and Sarah Conner accidentally got hit by a bus offscreen, and the Terminator didn't even know about so even he ends up failing in a way?"" And therein lies the (deliberate)irony for the movie. You have a Terminator style movie with a plucky hero trying to escape from an unstoppable villain, and none of it matters. In fact, it's supposed to be established that the main character of the movie is not in fact the plucky hero, but rather just some old geezer that has no real interaction with any of the main characters and doesn't affect the plot line in any way(for the Terminator metaphor, this is like trying to say the Psychiatrist was the main character).<br/><br/>In most coherent story lines, characters and developments are supposed to exist for a reason but in this one they are mostly superfluous. Tommy Lee Jones appears to have an important role in the movie, but he doesn't. Woody Harrelson shows up in the movie as a supposed learned veteran, but doesn't affect the plot other than to give some minor info about the villain.<br/><br/>Many fans of the movie also find the villain extremely scary and/or creepy, but I found him completely cartoonish. It would be about as subtle as having Darth Vader stroll around Texas, and apart from one scene of him reading a phone bill to track down Moss, doesn't seem particularly skilled as a tracker. For those who like to say the film is more realistic because the good guy doesn't always get away and the bad guy doesn't always get caught, you lose that argument with this character, as the screenplay bends over backwards to accommodate this freak. He seems to have the superpower to make everyone around him drop 20 points in IQ or not raise any fuss about the dozens of people he brutally kills. A character this distinct in appearance and manner and so strongly lacking in people skills shouldn't be that hard to track down.<br/><br/>Finally, to drive the storyline at all the main character has to do some ridiculously stupid things to leave a trail. Once again using the Terminator comparison it's like having Sarah Conner leaving a message on her answering machine or calling her mother so the Terminator has an idea of where to find them. However, those are at least somewhat understandable actions whereas those of Moss are just downright ridiculous: 1. After successfully stealing the money without anyone noticing him, he returns to the scene of the crime to bring a dying man some water. Beyond the fact that this is ridiculously risky, it's also rather pointless, as the guy is probably dead. If anything, why not make an anonymous call to the police to send an ambulance? Even the character admits that this is completely stupid, but shrugs his shoulders as if to say, ""well, we can't just have the story end here, can we?"".<br/><br/>(A lot of the fans like to say that he's obviously stupid for stealing the money knowing that someone would likely come after him, but I'm curious as to how since he's completely off the radar at that point).<br/><br/>2. He never searches the money to find the transponder until it's too late. This is just baffling, as several days have passed and he's already spent a great deal of effort trying to conceal the money by this point. In addition to moving the money to a less conspicuous bag, it's rather odd that he wouldn't, you know, try to count the money to see how much is there or to see if there's anything else like drugs or guns in the bag? For those who like the movie because it has an unconventional story structure- it actually has a relatively conventional structure for the first 75% or so and then subverts it all in the end. For those who think it's more realistic to not have a Hollywood ending, the movie defies realism by letting Chigurh get away with as much as he does, and with the main protagonist committing stupid errors so he can get caught.<br/><br/>In fact, the only thing novel about this storyline is that it mostly follows conventions for the first 75% and then turns it all around in plot twists just to give the viewer the middle finger at the end."
"zstevens2","10","4","11","7 December 2007"," One of a Kind!
","Few can comprehend what they see on screen when they watch a movie like No Country for Old Men. I have read and heard hundreds of comments complaining about the films conclusion or the demise of the main characters. Never have I been more blown away by a film and the message that it carries. There is often no reason for the violence in the world and the fact that many viewers are searching for it leaves me speechless.<br/><br/>No Country for Old Men is takes all the different entities in film-making and weaves them into this masterpiece perfectly. The Coen Bros. could not have done anything else and made this film as well. The soundtrack (or lack there of) in NCFOM sets up the suspenseful moments so well that as an audience member you find yourself jumping constantly throughout the duration. Where music drowns out much of the sounds throughout a film, NCFOM uses little to none and creates the most realistic feeling of terror I have ever seen in a film.<br/><br/>Bardem's character begins as a completely unpredictable psychopath and by the end the viewer gains a twisted understanding of his logic. We become so engulfed with the film's characters that when an unexpected moment comes we forget to view it through the eye's of the character who is discovering what most films show (e.g. Bell comes across Moss at the motel). Bell doesn't know what has happened and we are not meant to either. The viewer simply sees the aftermath and is only offered the explanation given by the film's characters. The film's true main character is meant to be Tommy Lee Jones's Sheriff Bell. He is not able to understand why things such as these happen and therefore feels lost and almost helpless, hence the title No Country for Old Men. I think the lack of explanations for events that occur throughout are part of what makes this film so great.<br/><br/>Don't go into this film with expectations of resolution because there isn't any as is in life. Take it for what it is and give praise to a pair of filmmaker's that have given us this gift that we can watch time and again."

He is a man who finds some money in a drug deal gone bad. The person who apparently wants to get the money back is played by the older brother in Everybody Loves Raymond. He is a psychopath who kills people with some kind of shotgun that has a SILENCER on it. He also uses an AIR COMPRESSOR to murder folks and also removed locks with it. Very strange if you ask me. Again, there is NO MUSIC in this entire movie. Just a lot of good dialogue and character development. I was very impressed.<br/><br/>There was blood. Oh yes, there was indeed blood.

","With so much crap churned out of Hollywood month after month lately it's refreshing to see a movie that actually piques my interest.<br/><br/>Unlike most films I've see lately, where I can see the ending coming miles away like a freight train barreling down the tracks blowing it's horn, this movie's ending completely threw me for a loop and left me feeling a little betrayed. However, any movie that can invoke an emotion other than cheap laughs or ""oohs"" and ""ahs"" at the pretty CG action sequences is impressive.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin plays ""Llewelyn Moss"" who is a simple Texas welder who lives in a trailer with his wife, and stumbles upon a fortune in a botched drug-deal while hunting in the Texas hill country. Although it's ill-begotten gains for Llewelyn you sympathize with his character and you really find yourself hoping they can better their lives with this money and maybe move up to a double-wide trailer or something.<br/><br/>Then comes ""Anton Chigurh"" played by Javier Bardem, who Llewelyn refers to as Sugar, the main antagonist in the movie, a psychopath after Llewelyn and the money. Wielding an oxygen-tank-air-gun-type thing that blows deadbolts and doorknobs off, and a shotgun equipped with a silencer he is easily my favorite character.

"Polaris_DiB","10","4","11","19 November 2007"," A fresh, and somewhat experimental, comeback
","Alright, so here's the deal: The Coens often work with plots involving bungled crimes that are the inevitable conclusion of many different and sometimes perverse personalities' decision making processes. This time the crime happens before the plot occurs, and the story is slightly post-apocalyptic: what has happened has already happened and its up to the characters that manage to survive to pick up the pieces. It's dark (everyone in the movie either dies or gives up), and it's also really good.<br/><br/>This movie I compare to being slowly pressed in the gut with a knife until it ends, at which point you realize you've just been hit by a train you didn't see coming. This approach is uncanny and uncomfortable, and the Coens also risk a lot by leaving many real plot elements up in the air and letting the audience figure stuff out for themselves. This approach, though it's been done many times before, has a fresh use in their movie, but it's still risky because to this day audiences still have problems with it. Lucky for the Coens, they're well used to film-making and have the skill and narrative powers necessary to make it work despite (or perhaps literally in spite of) audience expectations.<br/><br/>This movie is also somewhat philosophical, but I haven't yet really seen that as part of a comment that the Coens are making, but merely a transliteration of McCarthy's book. Apparently the filmmakers stuck very close to the story and dialog of the book, and no matter my tendency to prefer to read texts as singular and separate, my familiarity with the Coen brothers tells me that they took up the adaptation much more as a matter of telling the story and making the characters than keeping with the message of Ed Tom Bell's ruminations. In fact, they use his speech at the beginning and end to lend more understanding to the decisions made than the development of a fate vs. free will theme (one that I think is getting a lot of attention, which may in fact become derogatory to people's enjoyment of this film as it is). To me, it's more important that Javier Bardem's character both bleeds evil and is also pitiable and careworn than that Tommy Lee Jones says Smart Things (tm).<br/><br/>I do think, however, that this is the best film that's been released so far this year, and a great return of the Coen brothers from their slump of the past two films (the worst of which can be said that they were merely pretty good instead of utterly fantastic).<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

","The main thing about this movie I love is the way the Coen brothers use sound, particularly silence, to create tension. There is not a ton of dialogue in the movie, much of the film is just silent. One scene in particular that really stood out to me was the one where Llewelyn was fashioning a hook to retrieve the package of money from the air vents while Chigurh was moving from room to room attempting to locate the case. There was no dialogue at all through that whole sequence of events other than Chigurh talking to the man in the bathtub. But you could feel the tension building slowly, as this monster of a villain made his way toward our average joe protagonist. <br/><br/>That leads me into my next point - Chigurh is an excellent villain, he's not too cliche, but he is also clearly defined as a villain enough to where the audience won't mistake him for a anti-hero type. I believe the decision to use the oxygen tank weapon was incredible. It makes Chigurh an incredibly unique character, and every shot of his heavy boots with the oxygen tank was terrifying and built tension very well. That's what this whole movie is about, suspense and tension. They pull these off very well. <br/><br/>The reason I don't want to give this a 10 is because I feel as if the plot is still a little too cliche for my liking. The actual story telling, filming, and dialogue were all exquisite, but the story was a very predictable one, typical western style stuff.<br/><br/>Overall, the uniqueness of Chigurh's character, the suspense/tension built during Chigurh/Llewelyn's showdowns, and most of Chigurh's dialogue all create a wonderful, gripping, suspenseful film that deserves a good watch."

","No Country For Old Men Review
 
 The 2007 film No Country For Old Men is in my opinion one of the best films ever 
made but also comes with a true to life meaning. Directed by the Coen Brothers,No Country For 
Old Men is based on the 2005 novel written by Cormac Mccarthy.The entire film takes place 
Primarily on the southwest Texas and Mexico border in the 1980's.The story revolves mainly 
around three characters Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin),Sheriff Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones)and 
last but not least Anton Chigurgh (Javier Bardem).The story premise of the film is mainly about 
Moss the cowboy coming across a large sum of money from a Mexican drug deal gone wrong 
and running with it later realizing that there is no clean getaway as he is hunted by Anton 
Chigurgh a psychopathic assassin employed to retrieve the money stopping at nothing to get it 
taking many lives along the way. Sheriff Tom Bell steps into investigate and also keep Moss and 
his wife Carla Jean(Kelly Macdonald)safe realizing the dangers of the situation. The overall tone 
of the movie is dark and suspenseful with a few action scenes and very well done acting and 
dialogue from the characters offering humor and suspense. The film did not include a soundtrack 
which actually added to the suspense and dark tone of the movie especially in action scenes. The 
film ran smoothly between changing scenes and camera angles. The films overall message is up 
for interpretation, in my opinion the message I kept receiving was life and time keeps going and 
you cannot stop what is coming. Sheriff Bell an aging man who comes from a long line of 
Sheriffs is having a difficult time adapting to modern and changing times. Throughout the movie 
he is investigating a crime he has never seen before and is beyond his control and understanding. 
The moral is one day our society could be out of our understanding and that this country really is 
No Country For Old Men."

"thewillt08","9","2","4","19 November 2013"," Confusing Title, Amazing Movie
","People complain about endings way too often. I sat down and watched No Country for Old Men tonight and the entire movie blew me away but the ending is something I will not touch upon in this review but something I am willing to discuss. Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, and Tommy Lee Jones star in a fight for two million dollars. The Coen Brothers directed this masterpiece and it was all over the Oscars. Llewelyn Moss, Josh Brolin, stumbles on a drug deal gone badly in the middle of the desert in west Texas. He also stumbles upon two million dollars. Anton, Javier Bardem, is on a rampage as he wants to find the money. Ed Tom Bell, Tommy Lee Jones, is following the two of them in a battle for the cash.<br/><br/>Movie making is an art form and any good director does everything on purpose. The Coen brothers did everything right in this movie. All three main characters are never seen on screen but are so much alike and connected. If you dig deep into the details in this movie you will notice so many similarities between the three. The directing the two of the brothers do is one of the best I have ever seen in any movie. They choose to have very little music in their movie. That is a very bold and risky move in my opinion, but one that worked out beautifully. Most of the time you hear wind of the desert of a train in the distance. Dogs and children are constantly heard. Its music that makes the movie but also the little things.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem scared me. There I said it and I don't regret it. He is straight up evil in this movie. He is evil but he also has a code of ethics or morals. He is the antagonist, the killer, the bad guy, but he is ""fair"". There are a few scenes where he confronts people. Sometimes he kills them and sometimes he does not. The idea of the coin flip and the person gets to make the call and if he/she is right, they get to live. That idea is terrifying and you can see it on the face of a gas station owner. I was on the edge of my seat as he was on the edge of his life. <br/><br/>Josh Brolin does a great job in this movie but I hated Llewelyn. First of all I can't spell or say his name and I know that's not a good reason not to like somebody, but hey, it's my opinion. Llewelyn is supposed to be the protagonist but the actions he takes and how he acts I didn't really care if he lived or died. Not because his character was boring or unimportant, but because I knew I was supposed to cheer him on but he was a scumbag. His greed got to him as he became a nutcase with the money. He mistreated his wife, in my opinion, and just wasn't that great a guy to begin with. I hated his character but I loved the role he played in the movie. His end result in the movie wasn't disappointing, meaning I was happy with it, but I would have liked to see a little bit more out of it. There was a scene I needed to see with him in it, but it wasn't there.<br/><br/>Tommy Lee Jones is one of those actors who rarely flops and this is not one of them. Ed Tom is the cop trailing behind the two madmen fighting over the money. He has to put the pieces together. His role isn't too major and he kind of pops in and out of the movie, but he is magnificent. I lived his character; he was the real only pure character. This movie needed a guy like Ed Tom. He brought wit and charm to the character and as dark and exciting this movie was, it was also funny. <br/><br/>There is a scene I need to talk about. Llewelyn is at the Mexico border, covered in blood, and he runs into three guys. He tells the guy he will give him $500 for his shirt. The guy asks to see the money first. The other guy asks if he had been in a car accident, twice. Llewelyn gives him the money and then asks the other guy for his beer. The third guy asks how much for the beer. Now earlier I said how the three characters are connected. I mentioned this scene in particular; I'll let you figure out the rest. Think about it. It is the pure brilliance in this movie. <br/><br/>If I want to talk a flaw in this movie I would say its Woody Harrelson's character. I don't understand why he was there, I didn't find him important and he was a petty minor character. I probably didn't understand his importance because I couldn't understand a word he said. When I watch any movie I throw on subtitles but I watched this for a film class and there were no subtitles. The Texan accent annoyed me to pieces and parts of the movie were hard to understand. I give a pass to Tommy Lee Jones because he is like that and every movie. <br/><br/>Overall, No Country for Old Men is an amazing movie. If you are a fan of movies and like a high detailed story than this is for you. If you like good acting and relatable characters than this is for you. If you like wild goose chases tan this is the movie for you. If you like Oscar worthy movies than this is for you. If you like movies that get the WillyT Seal of Approval, than this is the movie for you."

I could see this this film becoming one of the many instant classics that the Cohen brothers have to offer (such as Fargo, The Big Lebowski etc.) The dialog consists of many forms of symbolism and filled with many metaphors. the plot runs smoothly through 1980 Texas until the smooth flow of the plot came to an unnecessary halt when Antoine Chugure(Javiere Bordem) murdered Lewellen(Josh Brolin) whom is the protagonist an hour-and-a-half into the movie. I really appreciate the unique style of film-making the Cohen Brothers use such as ""killing off the protagonist before the resolution of the movie, but in this case you don't even know that Lewellen is dead until fifteen minutes later when Lewellens wife pull up into the crime scene and see the police fishing Lewellens body out of the motel swimming pool. Maybe,twenty five minutes later Lewellens wife walks into the dark living room in her mother house only to find Chugure standing in the corner with the air compressor in which he uses to murder his victims as Lewellens wife is trying to persuade Chugere to not kill her, they pause for a second and you see Chugere walking down the wooden porch stairs and is walking across the street only to be hit by a car. moments later two kids check out the accident and to see if CHugere is OK; not knowing who Chugere is. Chugere then bribes the kids with a hundred dollar bill to not report anything they had seen. Then Chugere simply stands up and stumbles into the horizon to never be seen again. The next and final seen Tommy Lee Jones walks down his stairs to see his wife fixing breakfast and while she does Tommy Lee Jones recalls a dream he had the night before about him catching Chugere and the film ends in mid sentence. why I think the ending was unnecessary was because after all the excitement, and anxiety the film builds up suddenly drops down at a peak by not know if Chugere killed Lewellens wife or not and how the screen went black when Tommy Lee Jones was in Mid-sentence at a peak by Tommy Lee Jones Recalling his dream."

","Being only 16 when I asked my mom if I could see ""No Country For Old Men"", I was instantly shot down, saying it was too violent, bloody, and gruesome for me to watch and that ""it was a bad movie"". I begged and begged and begged, and finally, after weeks, she let me see it. Yes, it was violent. Yes, it was bloody. Yes, it was gruesome. But a bad movie? Did my mom and I watch two separate movies? <br/><br/>Josh Brolin plays Llewelyn Moss, an innocent man (emphasis on innocent) who stumbles upon a drug deal gone bad, leaving him with a case filled with two million dollars. But soon Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a soulless, compassionless killing machine, wants the money too. The story follows Llewelyn's struggle to escape from Anton.<br/><br/>I personally loved the story. While some people complain that it was bad, I thought it was creative, almost always keeping me on the edge of my seat. But inside the story, we have another story: what is the root of evil? Throughout the movie, Tommy Lee Jones, a cop in the town that Llewelyn is from, tells stories about murders and crimes and attempts to explain why people act the way they do. His answer: it's impossible to understand. We will never find the true root of evil, so we shouldn't waste time worrying about it. This adds a whole new layer to the TRUE story/meaning of the film, and I think it was great.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem plays easily the most horryfing villain of all time. I was terrified every time he walked into a room. His conversation with the characters (especially he one in the convenient store) made me sick with suspense. Anton is the epitome of all evil, and Javier Bardem pulls it off perfectly. Josh and Tommy Lee do awesome jobs too, pulling there characters off perfectly, but it's nothing to gawk over.<br/><br/>Many people will watch this movie and say it was pointless and sadistic violence and there was no story. I completely disagree. Every scene of killing added to the darkness of Anton, and I have no clue why people think there isn't a story. If you're looking for a great film to watch, I highly recommend this for you."
"Supachewy","9","2","4","13 September 2010"," A Film That Will Keep You on the Edge of Your Seat
","The suspense, western, drama No Country for Old Men is directed by the Coen brothers and stars Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, and Tommy Lee Jones. The film takes place in 1980 Texas.<br/><br/>The film starts off with a man, Anton Chigurh (Bardem), being arrested. He is then brought to the police station and the officer who arrested him is on the phone. He is able to get his handcuffs under his legs and then brutally strangles the officer to death and frees himself, steals a police car, kills another person and steals their car. Then it cuts to Llewelyn Moss (Brolin) hunting deer. While checking to see if he hits one he notices an arranged of vehicles in a field. He goes over and sees that there has been a large gunfight and finds a lot of drugs in the back of one of the trucks. Soon he finds a satchel that contains two million dollars inside of it. The rest of the film is about how Moss tries to make it away with the money while being chased by Chigurh and while Chigurh is being chased by a local sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Jones).<br/><br/>The screenplay for this film was excellent. It was extremely suspenseful and all the main characters had great depth to them. Anton Chigurh will be a character like Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver that will be remembered for a very long time. Also I thought the ending was very deep, along with the rest of the film. Personally it is my favorite Coen brother film I have seen, but I still have to see a good amount of their films.<br/><br/>The direction of this film was excellent and it well deserved the Oscar for it. To make a film this suspenseful without the use of music is extremely difficult and the Coens pull it off brilliantly. It is an edge of your seat film for the older generation, not just for the teens like most of the suspense films that come out these days. The Coens have proved yet again that they can get brilliant performances out of their actors. Truly an amazing job in the direction department.<br/><br/>The acting for this film was as well brilliant. Josh Brolin played the lead and it truly brought him to now become one of the biggest actors in Hollywood. He was a stubborn Texas man that just wasn't going to quit and he was absolutely perfect. Javier Bardem delivered one of the greatest performances of the decade in his role and will go down in history for it. He deserved that Oscar so much that they shouldn't have even nominated anyone else in the category. Jones played his part fine, it just seems that he is a police officer in every movie and it is pretty annoying. This is an excellently acted film.<br/><br/>Overall I give this film a 9/10, and I have no complaints with it winning the Best Picture Oscar, even though I like There Will be Blood more. I would recommend this one for anyone who likes great suspense films."
"gts-14","10","2","4","18 July 2010"," If only I could hunt the hunter
","It's tough to decide which was better: the writing of the screenplay or the execution and direction of the film. No Country might frustrate viewers that feel dissatisfied while watching credits not preceded by plot closure, but those that are tracking abstract symbolism and creative, subtle camera-work will watch it again and again.<br/><br/>Some animals are trained to kill, and to do it well. This film is a road map of the intersecting paths of those animals, and neither predator nor prey stand still. The frames of reference of hunter and hunted are constantly reversed, and Chigurh's ultimate evil is repeatedly and disturbingly contrasted with the unsuspecting innocence of many of his victims. Both dualities are beautifully mirrored by a manipulation of dark and light that even Kubrick would have appreciated. Almost every scene includes some evidence or mention of the passage of time, from the rotation of the earth into or out of daylight to discussions of various characters' statuses before or after death to simply a clock on the wall. Quite certainly, time and the fear of what it might bring were the most vicious and victorious predators in the story."

","I was very excited about watching this film, especially after reading the reviews the awards it has won and seeing the cast. Although it was a promising start and acted well through the film left me with a feeling of disappointment. I watched the film with my girlfriend and we looked at each other at the end to say 'what was that all about'. the plot was disjointed and farcical and the only good thing about the ending was that it bought an ending to the over two hours of complete nonsense. i appreciated that I must has missed something but this film absolutely nothing for me and I will approach the next Coen brothers movie with extreme caution."

","After stumbling across a case of money among dead bodies, Llewelyn Moss thinks he can keep it quiet, but when silent killer Anton Chigurh locates Moss and his money, Vietnam veteran Moss makes a run for it. With bodies falling everywhere Anton goes, it's only a matter of time before he catches up with Llewelyn. Whilst all this is going on, Sheriff Ed Tom Bell is overseeing the investigation and begins to see the country in a different light than it once was...No Country For Old Man was critically acclaimed, won 4 Oscars and (supposedly) established Joel and Etan Coen as two of the best directors of today, but I fail to see the brilliance in this film. I don't think this is a good film, let alone be considered one of the best movies of all time. I find the film to be extremely pretentious and overrated. Both Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem deliver great performances,specially the last as a blood-cold psychopathic killer with some bad ass weapons but in dire need of an haircut, but if you put that aside, then what do we got here? A simple western-thriller. A chase between a killer and its prey. What's so special about it ? I'll say this; the cinematography is good, but that alone plus two good performances doesn't make a great movie. I mean, what is it, what is seducing the critics and everyone in general? Is the southern accent? Is the tension and the violence caused by Anton? Well, I have no idea but for me No Country For Old Men is below average. There's nothing great about it, there's nothing special about it. Its a pretty straight-forward thriller that happens to take place in Texas.<br/><br/>6/10"
"Red_Identity","Null","2","4","2 October 2009"," A tense and absorbing Masterpiece
","No Country For Old Men was deserving of all the praise and awards it got back in 2007. While I did root for other films of that year to win Best Picture, like Atonement or There Will Be Blood, with a repeat viewing of NCFOM, this is just under those films, if not right on par with them. The screenplay is very meaningful and thought-provoking as it is tense and thrilling. This is a Western thriller, a subtle but very absorbing film. The lack of a soundtrack really adds to the film's tension, and we are more concentrated on all of the little things that happen. The Coen brothers have only made one other film in the past that had really surprised me, and that was Fargo. While I still am not sure which is better, I think both are Masterpieces and deserve to be classics for years to come.<br/><br/>The performances in the film are strong. Most notably, Javier Bardem. His performance won him an Oscar, and very deserved. He gives a creepy and subtly controlled performance, and makes a villain like no other since Anthony Hopkins in The Silence of the Lambs (and since then, Heath Ledger has also joined that list). Kelly Macdonald and Tommy Lee Jones were also pretty amazing, the former giving one of my favorite supporting female performances of 2007. Josh Brolin is strong, but his role requires less of a big acting challenge than Jones or even Macdonald I would think. Woody Harrelson was great in his small screen time, and he made the best of it. The cinematography is perfect, as you would think from the guy who also shot the amazingly beautiful The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford.<br/><br/>What I also love about this film is that simple meaning of violence in this country. The film's opening monologue by Jones, and his closing scene proves that this really was his story, and also the reason for the unresolved plots. While I was one of the few that was frustrated by the final scene in the film, I can truly appreciate it now. No Country For Old Men is a great film, powerful and absorbing!"
"slate_77","Null","2","4","26 September 2009"," Unrealisitc and too Clever equal Lame
","Baloney! The usually entertaining Cohen brothers toss out reason and time frame history in order to add some thrill and detail to this film. In my opinion, the one and two star ratings here at IMDb contain the best reviews of this video. The acting was good.<br/><br/>Aside from just how implausible this whole story is - factual tidbits added often don't follow the true time line of actual history. Many elements included are too rare to have been much seen in 1978.<br/><br/>For example, there really wasn't much green hair or nose bones in 1978 Texas in spite of what the old boy in the film complains of. Additionally, ATM machines were few and far between in the big city let alone found in the Texas wastelands of '78. HBO in rural motels were a great amenity, but also very rare back in the 1970s as I recall.<br/><br/>Those 1970s vehicles in the movie were cool to look at, but I don't remember one vehicle in the film that wasn't well preserved. I remember the roads of those days as being filled with many old early 1960s clunkers (and older autos) still cruising the roads by the late 1970s. In this film, all the vehicles are pristine (unless engulfed in fire).<br/><br/>I won't even touch on the implausibility of the film's plot and narrative. Sorry, it's just not realistic for late 1970s Texas. Because of good acting I rate this film 3 stars."

"diac228","6","2","4","4 December 2008"," This is two movies in one: What to definitely do in film-making, and what NOT to do in film-making. Entertainment (then utter disappointment) at its finest
","No Country For Old Men is an amazing thriller full of tension, suspense, well-directed moments, fantastic imagery, wonderful dialogue, superb acting, and a nice plot to tie it in together. Then the movie decides to end. This film takes one of the biggest quality downfalls I have ever seen in my life, and this is by no means exaggeration. How does a movie do so well for so long and then deliver such utter garbage when we the viewer least needed it? How on earth does a movie full of tension for so long suck out the entertainment and desire to continue watching in a mere matter of moments? The questions continue to linger through my head as I write this; as the Best Picture Oscar winner disappointed me in ways I've never been disappointed before.<br/><br/>The worst part is the hard-hitting potential that was chugging along the fantastic story four-fifths of the way. The Coen Brothers looked like they ran out of ideas or just had no clue how to stop rolling the cameras and finish the gosh-darn story. In a film that liked showing more than telling throughout the first 90 minutes, it was certainly a surprise when the rest of the film was pretty much just narrated to us, as if we were a bunch of idiots. Main characters in the end are whether watered-down, having a serious case of the talkies, or just flat-out disappeared. This is easily one of the weakest films to actually receive a Best Picture nod. Well, at least it ain't Crash but it's certainly a movie that could have been one of the best in decades.<br/><br/>In this film, we follow a hunter (Josh Brolin) becoming hunted down by Mexican criminals, lawmen (Woody Harrelson, Tommy Lee Jones), and a psychotic killer (Javier Bardem) because of a great deal of money he discovered at a crime scene. This is pretty much a tense, violent cat-and-mouse game that has a good deal of followers and supporting players. No Country For Old Men is based off a novel with the same name by Cormac McCarthy; and translates well to the screen with very few changes and subtractions. The Coen Brothers can weave a good script, and their previous work is definite proof of this (Fargo, come on now). The dialogue of the killer Anton was downright scary, and the philosophical views of the cops involved also spark a bit of interest. However, when staying close to the original material, one tends to forget that original material does have its flaws as well. Unfortunately, the Coen Brothers were also very accurate with the weak portions in the book.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast in the film is absolutely wonderful, from the usually awesome Tommy Lee Jones to the decent Josh Brolin to the incredibly scary Javier Bardem. The film has a heavy dosage of cruel realism and the acting is one of the main reasons why this film worked so well for so long. Bardem portrays one of the best movie villains in ages, even surpassing that of Heath Ledger's Joker and Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith. His performance overpowers that of everyone else's by leagues.<br/><br/>Let's discuss what made this film so magnificent for the first two acts. First off, the directing was phenomenal as there were many series of long shots that built up the tension to a point in which you couldn't breathe. Then there's the incredible cinematography that could craft beauty out of dull settings. Last but not least was the quick pacing that kept the story flowing well and maintaining the interest of the viewer involved. While the portrayals of the characters could have used some major work writing-wise (the origins of almost all the main characters were pretty much non-existent) they kept the movie interesting. The lack of a soundtrack allowed for us to truly appreciate the incredible usage of sound involved (even a wrapper made a distinctively realistic noise when placed on a table).<br/><br/>Ending. What ending? The film literally wraps up in the middle of a scene. The film literally has no major climax, doesn't wrap up any loose ends, goes on a philosophical tangent, creates even more questions (which is never good if you are trying to END the movie) than answers. Everything going for this powerhouse flick was thrown away towards the end and instead we get this muddled, disgusting affair of dialogue. First 100 or so minutes: a lot of bark and bite. The last 20 minutes: weak, weak, weak barking and not a single bite. It was as if we were seeing two totally different movies, and neither one of them technically ended. It was as if the last pages of a good book were replaced with unsatisfying and useless Chicken Soup for the Soul quotations. The movie could have ended worse only if it were done in a gigantic musical interlude with hyper fruits flying out of cannons. Other than that random suggestion, you have to dig pretty hard to find the last time a good movie that ended in such a sour note.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: beautiful gem in the beginning, utter trash and garbage by the end of it all. What hurts the most is that with so much potential, the Coen Brothers ripped apart what made the movie work and spiraled it towards heavy disappointment level. The sour taste of the ending still lingers in my mouth as I write this. Best Picture? Sorry, but the entire movie has to deserve it, not just most of it. It's a total shame because there was such good usage of sound, such good cinematography, and grand acting. No Country For Old Men was like a five-star meal with a two-star topping.

But it bothers me when such a successfully straight storytelling frame, unnecessarily changes direction 3/4 through, and so carelessly dispatches one of its main protagonists (and equally ditto with Harrelson's character) which leaves the last 20 minutes or so, needlessly protracted and losing crucial impact... I guess it must be the original story of the book it's based on, but I keep thinking: why, oh why couldn't they have stuck to follow a straight, shorter line to the finish, as in ""Blood simple"", for instance? For me, that would have truly hit the bulls-eye - we GET the contemplative message from Lee Jones' character, anyway...<br/><br/>Still packs one hell of a punch, with scenes never to be forgotten!<br/><br/>7 out of 10 from Ozjeppe"

No special effects, no soundtrack to tell you how to feel, lots of dead people, but only for a few do we see how they die, and the only thing to be learned from it is that nothing goes as you want in real life. It was a bit slow at times, too.

Chigurh is so cold blooded, has no conscience about killing and lets his victims choose their fate by a coin flip. Chigurh is chasing Moss because he stole millions from a drug deal gone bad. Chigurh is able to find him first because there is a tracker with the money. But after Moss barely escapes, I didn't get how Chigurh kept finding him since there was no tracker. Also, a small town sheriff is hot on their trail but is always a step behind.<br/><br/>The ending was a disappointment. The movie never explained how Moss was tracked to the hotel. Also was the money ever found. And how did Chigurh escape the motel room right before the sheriff went in. Too much info was left out.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: It was average. Nothing great.

","""No Country for Old Men"" is very overrated and I think to argue that would be silly. For those of us who have admired the Coens for years, this is standard, if not a little less-than-good, fare.<br/><br/>The characters are thin and not convincing, (aside from Bardem of course, who creeps out even the toughest among us with his callous and merciless, haunting demeanor,) unrealistic and pretentiously written. We are treated to the meaningless philosophical ramblings of a sheriff whom we are never given the chance to know, much less love. The main character is killed off in a manner which is unfair to the viewers; we don't even get to see it happen. It is emotionless and pointless. Throughout the film, we are bombarded with beautiful images of the American west, but unlike in the superior ""Raising Arizona,"" they prove to be nothing more than eye candy, for the story could have really taken place anywhere. And in any time for that matter. Which brings me to my next complaint: when does this story take place? Judging by the cars, clothing and style, I'm thinking early 80's? But it really doesn't matter.<br/><br/>The story never goes anywhere, so much is left unexplained and it's nightmarishly vague. Sorry to say people, it just wasn't that good.

","It's beautiful to look at. It has a lot of intelligence on display. But unfortunately, it just doesn't come together. I have no doubt this is exactly the film the Coens intended to make, and you could certainly mistake this for a profound and complete film, but it has one crucial problem: everything about it is completely disjointed.<br/><br/>The shots themselves are framed so beautifully that each one is a portrait, but the problem is that they don't cut together well at all. There's seldom a sense of place; characters exist largely in vacuums, either occupying a frame whose background is out of focus or is otherwise somehow confined.<br/><br/>Scenes have the same problem, as do character motivations and continuity, and I suspect this all stems from the film being an adaptation of a novel. The people I watched the film with were constantly impressed by the intelligence and cunning shown by the characters in the film, but the problem is that there are so many gaps that their foresight borders on precognition. People are places simply because the script says so. They cross paths because the script says so.<br/><br/>The film ultimately feels like a distillation of all the pieces we really like about films. The Coen brothers have burned away the ""excess,"" leaving us with pure scenes and pure shots. The problem is that in the process, what's been burned away are the threads the connect these things and make an experience feel complete.<br/><br/>The ending is more or less what one would expect from the disjointed film that precedes it, but it feels like an exclamation point placed on the film's central problem: how arbitrary the whole thing feels as a result of its lack of cohesion. The ending is fairly arbitrary but perhaps most damningly, is the kind of hackneyed stuff Academy awards are made of.<br/><br/>It's enjoyable to watch, but like so many Academy sweethearts, ""No Country for Old Men"" falls apart under scrutiny."

","This movie started out promising. It was suspenseful and had interesting characters that I genuinely cared about. The thing that made me hate the movie was how it seemed to build up with the promise of an explosive ending, or at very least an action packed one. I felt it fell 100% short of that promise. The ending was the biggest let down and left me wondering if the directors just ran out of creative ideas or money. Nearly all of the main characters end up dying, and the one who doesn't, the old sheriff, ends the movie by recounting a dream he had to his wife at the breakfast table. That just seems a bit ridiculous, considering the action up until this point. The viewer is left wondering, what will happen? But also, why does it matter?"
"drnrg31","9","2","4","4 July 2008"," Almost Perfect film
","I have a read a lot of reviews for this movie. The mostly say the same thing. I don't need to praise Anton Chigure any more. He is brilliant as the psychopath. The best part is how he either builds up for the kill he is about to commit or leaves you with your heart in your mouth as he decides to spare their life.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin is equally brilliant. He does what any man in his shoes would do. I don't care who you are, if you say you would turn the money to the authorities, you are a stone cold liar. Not even the authorities would turn it in to themselves. That said, he does the best he can at the being the guy on the run. Most of the time guarding the money more than his actual life.<br/><br/>Tommy Lee Jones as Sheriff Ed left a bit to be desired. He seemed like the guy trying to help Llewelyn, but at the same time taking any detour to avoid actually coming face to face with Anton, which ultimately leads to Llewelyn'd demise. He didn't do half as much as he could to protect him.<br/><br/>Woody Harrelson as Carson is a role that many question. I totally understood it's brilliance. He was hire by the Mexican mob to find Anton, kill him and return the money. he was damn good at what he did. He found Llewelyn with no problem at all. The only problem was he didn't count on Chigure finding him first. Once he is caught off guard; he totally loses all angle of his character. The hunter becomes the hunted. It's actually at this point that the viewer realizes that whatever happens , Chigure was never gonna be apprehended.<br/><br/>The biggest flaw and reason I do not give it a perfect score, was not Moss' death. That was a given, but I didn't get the ending with Tommy Lee. It was one of those lame artsy Sopranos endings, that the viewers just despise. So why use it? I think The Coen brothers realized they had created a monster that they just couldn't kill off. I actually thing Anton was meant to die in that car crash, before they decided to rewrite the whole scene. So ultimately there was no real ending to the movie.<br/><br/>If it had been filmed in the 90's; Either Sheriff Ed would have been killed early on , with Anton and Llewelyn shooting it out in the final scene or Anton ultimately killing Sheriff Ed, but in no alternate ending would Anton have been killed. Therefore nothing was left ,but a lame ending done in Sopranos style. Kinda poetic when you think about it."

I'm all for trying to make the audience work, but there were so many loose ends hanging that I had no idea what was what.

"citizenchris","9","2","4","1 July 2008"," NCFOM is one tough nut to crack..but I will give it a shot.
","No Country For Old Men 7-2-08 NCFOM is one tough nut to crack. This is a film with no central character/protagonist but its not exactly what I'd call an ensemble piece. The most memorable character could easily be called the villain, but can you have a villain w/o a ""hero""? Perhaps thats (one of) the point(s) to the film. The over all feeling I'm left with by the time the credits roll (btw love the font used during the credits) is best described by that wonderful line from Natural Born Killers ""The whole world's comin' to an end"". Now of course thats not to meant in a revelations kind of way but more in the curmudgeonly old man complaining about the damn kids and how things were different/better when he was a boy. The film seems like one long version of that...but in the best possible way. Its a film that manages to be several things though not all at once. It's a thriller that is at times pensive. There is no big bang climax though you might be expecting one. I wasn't particularly disappointed by this fact because by the time it got to the logical point where a big bang climax would have gone (if this were another film) I sort of understood that wasn't the point. What is the point though, im certain it has something to do with violence. Has its gotten worse or is it always been this bad? I haven't quite figured it out yet but I'm rather fond of any film that doesn't telegraph its message to the audience. Or maybe I'm just dince and it does. Never the less I'm happy to watch this film many times over and think about it. At the end of the day maybe thats the point."

"faterson","7","2","4","13 April 2008"," Esthetic Emptiness Celebrated by the Coens
","A riveting drama, extremely brutal and at the same time highly artistic. Still, it leaves you with an *empty* feeling; there seems to be no redeeming background to the story, unlike in the Coen Brothers masterpieces _Fargo_ and _O Brother, Where Art Thou?_ -- despite the policeman and wife being *superficially* similar to the policewoman and her husband in _Fargo_ (in reversed mode, so to say).<br/><br/>This movie has superb performances, one of them for the ages: that of Javier Bardem as an insane (or insanely logical and methodical) psychopathic killer. Woody Harrelson gives a great performance, too, however; as do Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin and Kelly Macdonald.<br/><br/>The direction is perfect. Every shot counts; every muscle on the faces of all the actors moves exactly the way it should, following the directors' vision; the actors' enunciation is 100% perfect, and the dialogues, frequently minimalistic, are flawless. This is supreme cinematography in the *technical* sense of the word; the shots are wonderfully composed, with an artistic touch -- no matter the gory subject matter they frequently depict.<br/><br/>The movie's music & sounds are minimalistic; that is exactly right for what the movie strives to convey. The early 1980s period is faithfully and beautifully recreated: dress modes, hair-styles, cars. Although, just as the rest of the movie attempts to avoid genre clichés, so do the film-makers here avoid the usual crutch of playing pop music from the early 1980s in order to set the time period. In fact, the movie is astoundingly minimalistic and effective in its reduced use of non-1980s music and ambient sounds.<br/><br/>Delightful, authentic Texas accent can be heard throughout the movie, remindful of another delightfully dialectal thriller: Billy Bob Thornton's _Sling Blade_ (though the latter's overall quality is superior to the Coen Brothers movie). The accent is believable even though, unlike Lee Jones and Harrelson, Kelly Macdonald is anything but a Texas-born actress, hailing from Scotland! <br/><br/>Just as the Coen Brothers' much earlier _Blood Simple_, _No Country for Old Men_ reminds you of Dashiell Hammett's writings, yet this movie lacks Hammett's ethos of a positive hero (such as the ""Continental Op"") capable of rising above the dreary circumstances of the world surrounding him. _No Country for Old Men_ reminds you of Shakespeare's _Hamlet_, too, and *shares* its emptiness; the meaningless heaping of corpses -- ""I got here the same way as this coin did"", says the killer, and through this the movie suggests as if there were no deeper sense to life, no order, no logic; life is haphazard and meaningless -- that seems to be the film's number 1 message.<br/><br/>This movie may therefore be summed up as ""esthetic emptiness"". _No Country for Old Men_ revels in emptiness, and is a celebration of emptiness. You can see directors having great fun depicting emptiness, always using filmmakers' devices and tools that possess the highest imaginable esthetic value. The question is, however: do we truly watch movies in order to see ugly things depicted beautifully? With *negligible* redeeming value to offset all the ugliness and emptiness? _No Country for Old Men_ will thus appeal primarily to viewers who hold human life to be essentially an ugly, empty, chaotic, and meaningless affair; that should be much the same audience as that applauding Shakespeare's _Hamlet_ and its own heaping of corpses for no apparent reason. In fact, Anton Chigurh in his nonsensical ruminations on life and chance resembles the character of Hamlet, despite Chigurh being a psychopath and Hamlet not. The essential difference between _No Country for Old Men_ and _Hamlet_ is that the former's esthetic values seem incomparably higher; that alone, however, does not render the movie any less empty than it is.<br/><br/>Take away the truly unforgettable character of Anton Chigurh and all scenes involving him -- and you are left with essentially a mediocre thriller with all the other characters that do not seem memorable. Therefore, Anton Chigurh, impeccably portrayed by Javier Bardem, saves the day for the directors and the movie itself. Anton Chigurh makes Hannibal Lecter look like a benign, old-fashioned and *fictional* character, while striking the viewers as chillingly realistic in his perverse logic as displayed in this movie. The moments when various, frequently minor, characters are unfortunate enough to encounter Chigurh, and are just about to get killed -- or not! -- are laden with tension; they are masterfully shot and acted. An effective device of the film-makers is blocking the view to the actual killings more than once, and choosing ellipse, or suggestion, instead of showing every execution Chigurh performs. There are wonderful little scenes: the elderly gas station owner; the middle-aged fat lady with her courageous -- if only she knew that that's what it was -- ""Did - you - not - hear - me, young man?"". In this regard, Woody Harrelson is especially admirable, perfectly capturing his character's final scenes; equally great is Kelly MacDonald's portrayal of emotional upheaval during her encounter with the killer.<br/><br/>Both of the ""coin-flip"" scenes are brilliant; both end with a powerful punchline. The later is, ""I got here the same way this coin did."" -- which, of course, is ultimately difficult to dispute. The first dialogue closes with Chigurh's meaningful and menacing: ""Don't put that coin away with the others... It might make you think it's a coin like any other."" And then, with a wicked smile, he adds: ""Which it is!"" That is a great way of showing to what perverse lengths infallible human logic can be abused; there is nothing human in thinking strictly logically; that is machine-like, and can be abused in any way just as any machine can be manipulated arbitrarily. For human qualities to surface, there needs to be something more than logic; and that is precisely what Chigurh lacks.<br/><br/>The awards heaped on this movie may be understood as belated *full* recognition for _Fargo_ -- a movie superior to this one."

I really understand the philosophical message that, I think, the directors try to tell us (The man have lost his purpose because of the money, and without money, we can't see the meanings), but for that, one book is perfect to tell this message,,, not a movie,,, because a movie needs a climax(even implicit), and this doesn't have one, just something missing,,, ""Hey, we change everything, but we don't tell you how exactly we did it, just assume you find it by paying attention"" and is OK, but frankly, almost sure I am not the only one who felt he saw an incomplete movie,,, not bad: INCOMPLETE."

","It turns out that the movie that won the Academy Award for Best Picture was a movie starring a serial killer. This movie was very entertaining towards the beginning, the suspense, the action, the development of the characters, and more. After that, the movie just got dumb, with the unrealistic dialogue, the killing of an innocent woman, and a car crash that no one would have survived, was survived. One interesting thing in this movie was the weapon used for killing. It just a high pressure air tank, with a thin nozzle used as a gun. In all, the movie had the potential to be good at the beginning, with the beautiful scenery and great action, but the actors lost it as the movie progressed. To finish, I think that this movie would have been better if it wasn't based on a book, considering all the writers had to do was read the book. This movie wasn't worth a Best Picture Award."
"BuckRogersTwentyFifth","6","2","4","17 March 2008"," Take the money and run, it was a simple plan....
","No, really, it was ""A Simple Plan"". Did Cormac McCarthy read that book or see the movie? Guy finds drug money, guy takes drug money, homicidal villain chases guy, loved ones of guy get killed, guy's life is ruined (or ended, as the case may be). The back of the DVD case says ""Flawless"". I think ""Overrated"" would be a better comment. Not a bad movie (although predictable at times and unbelievable at others), but it's been done before. If Gary Cole had a goofier haircut maybe he would have won an Oscar. It's bad enough when Hollywood can't come up with an original idea, or at least make a marked improvement on an old one, but to heap tons of praise and awards on a knock off?!?! The acting and cinematography were very good, but there is more to a movie than that. As for the Coen brothers directing, they could have done a better job in making some of the scenes more realistic. Just how fast can Josh Brolin run anyway? It may be worth renting, but not worth an Oscar."

People are free to make their own interpretations. <br/><br/>The cinematography is spectacular and the Cohen brothers do a great job capturing every aspect of the West Texas setting. Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem give great performances. Brolin looks perfect as the cowboy who just happens to be at the wrong place and wrong time. Bardem is ruthless as a psychotic killer right from the very first scene where he kills a cop.<br/><br/>Did this movie deserve best picture Oscar? Don't think so.

I mean, he was dumb enough once to take drug money once, but when he goes back the second time in the middle of the night, I just started thinking that he was what he was -- a greedy, dumb-a**.<br/><br/>And while I thought Javier Bardem was frightening, I wasn't sure what his deal was -- was it his money? Did he just want it because he couldn't have it? Why was this guy so indestructible? Tommy Lee Jones was really my only saving grace, but much like the other reviews -- what was the deal at the end?

","Another dark and very bloody story by the Coen brothers. But this time it's about symbolism and philosophy. And entertainment.<br/><br/>This is about fighting the devil (Javier Bardem), which here appears as a character from some comic book. It makes him more easy to understand. This movie is about confronting evil by intelligence or by morality. Beside it all stands the sheriff (great work by Tommy Lee Jones) as the commentator and he says what you're mostly miss in these kind of films. Some of the characters are dreadful. It's not, I repeat not, acceptable what they do.<br/><br/>The camera work is sometimes splendid. But the story doesn't hold together and of course this a speculation in violence.

"seaview1","8","2","4","24 February 2008"," A Bold No Country for Old Men
","Starting with the film noir hit, Blood Simple, co-directors and screenwriters, Joel and Ethan Coen have had a productive output of auteur films that range from manic comedies (O Brother, Where Art Thou?, Raising Arizona) to thoughtful crime dramas (Fargo, Millers Crossing). With their latest, No Country for Old Men, they have excelled at personal film-making that just misses the mark by not delivering a more pronounced ending. Under the trappings of a mystery and then chase thriller, this film is an exercise in movie making at its best while taking chances with conventional characters and plot. It also features splendid performances by Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem. <br/><br/>Set in 1980 after the Vietnam War, an aged sheriff, Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), talks of a long line of lawmen in his family. One day, in the desert a welder named Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) comes upon the remnants of a drug deal gone badly and a case of money and decides to take it. It turns out that some Mexicans are on his trail and mean business. So does a mysterious stranger, a clever, psychotic assassin, Anton (Javier Bardem). And the chase is on with Mexicans, the law, and worst of all, Anton, in pursuit. Moss sends his wife Carla to her mom's, and he hightails it to an obscure motel. Apparently a syndicate has hired Anton to get the money and dispatch anyone who gets in the way, but Anton has other ideas and begins to eliminate not just the Mexican competition, but nearly everyone connected with him! Anton's weapons of choice are a lethal air gun and the largest silencer rifle ever. He methodically hunts down Moss through detective work and a tracking device. You know that despite his resourcefulness, Moss is simply overmatched. Meanwhile, the syndicate hires another hit-man, Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson) to recover the money and eliminate Anton. All the while, Bell is adding up the clues and the growing trail of bodies to form an ominous picture of what is happening and what is to become. As much as he tries to help Moss and his wife, he cannot compete with the likes of Anton. By the end, Bell contemplates retirement knowing a killer is on the loose.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin really makes a strong impression as the doomed Moss. His character reminds one of a younger Kris Kristofferson. Not since Michael Madsen in Reservoir Dogs has there been a hideously terrifying character as Bardem's hit-man, Anton. His calm, dispassionate killer is surely inspired by past movie villains as the ones in Point Blank and The Terminator. Yet, in his own strange way, Anton has his code and motivation. He even gives his potential victims a second chance based on random luck. And he is most unforgiving if he is crossed. <br/><br/>There are a number of well constructed scenes to enjoy including a marvelous one at a convenience store which illustrates Anton's manic state, and a moment in a Mexican hotel that is unbearably tense as Moss is cornered in his room by someone who could be Anton.<br/><br/>The cinematography by Roger Deakins (The Shawshank Redemption) is quite effective as it illustrates a desolate, barren landscape in which this cat and mouse game is played out.<br/><br/>There are a couple problems with the films narrative, however. While it is good that the film attempts and mostly succeeds at being unique and offbeat, a few things are confusing like what really happens toward the end at a motel as Moss waits for his wife. What happens to the money? Some killings are off screen or suggested, and you have to make assumptions based on the context of a given scene.<br/><br/>The abrupt conclusion is a bit baffling; it won't work for most audiences, and even the most ardent cinephile may need to digest the last several minutes to make sense of it. Pay attention to the film's underlying theme. Reread the title of the film and understand that it is about the tradition of the lawmen being displaced by a new world order. Jones does a voice over at the beginning and he concludes it with a melancholy lament and recounting of a disturbing dream. If only the structure of the film could convey that more clearly, there would have been a better narrative flow to its finale. Some may call the device brilliant, but it does not work as it may have been intended. But don't let this slip deny the pleasures of a marvelous ensemble of actors and some great camera-work. It could easily be the Coen brothers' best work to date, and that is something to truly appreciate."
"ptallon","8","2","4","19 February 2008"," A slightly flawed work of art
","As always with the Coen brothers a handcrafted, studious effort with acting of the highest order and a no-holds-barred critical view of America, summed up by one character in the film as 'It's a country that's hard on people'. My only reservation was that it was like watching a performance of 'Hamlet' in which Hamlet doesn't turn up for the final duel scene. Frustrating to say the least!<br/><br/>But the Coens are admirable in the Shakespearian way they mix humor with tragedy and scorn recourse to any special incidental music effects to enhance the sense of impending doom. They also take their time telling the story. Though I enjoyed it immensely, I would have liked 'Atonement' to have teased things out a bit more if only to give the characters more depth."
"mjsinclair","9","2","4","18 February 2008"," His killing ways . .
","I once heard Alain Delon give a definition of the difference between ""un comedien"" and ""un acteur"". The former, he said, interprets a character, whereas the latter becomes the character. By this definition, Javier Bardem is a great actor. Others who spring to mind are Daniel Day Lewis and Gary Oldman. This is rarefied company indeed, but yes, Bardem belongs here, as anyone who sees his performance in this film as Anton, the cold-blooded automaton of a killer, who dispenses death indiscriminately and without feeling, can testify.<br/><br/>Bardem turns in a towering, unforgettable performance which will probably win the Oscar in 2008 for best supporting actor. His impact is immediate, and he completely overshadows the rest of the cast. Tommy Lee Jones (Ed Tom Bell) is himself, as he always is, and Josh Brolin (Llewellyn Moss), turns in a professional, but unremarkable performance in the lead role. I liked him better as Detective Trupo in American Gangster.<br/><br/>This is a violent film; chock full of indiscriminate, mindless killings. In Anton's world, human life has no value, to live or die is a random game of chance, decided upon a whim, a chance remark, the flip of a coin. He strides through this world with impunity, invincibility, devoid of the slightest hint of conscience or responsibility for his actions. He really doesn't give a damn, and yet he has his own, personal code of honour. He does take pride in his work, and always gets his man.<br/><br/>But beware, once you have allowed the images of Anton to imprint themselves on the back of your retina, they will be indelible. You will never forget him. The character he creates is that powerful. The haircut, the clothes, the walk, the mannerisms, the voice, and his manner of killing, all combine to create a chilling, soulless, remorseless individual, devoid of saving graces.<br/><br/>True to expectations, with their pedigree, the Cohen brothers have produced a sharp, atmospheric, potent and original film, and there are many surprises in store in this three-way ""catch me if you can"" chase across the USA and Mexico. There is almost no music, but I am sure that hardly anyone will notice, such is the strength and quality of the script, the direction and the sheer momentum of events."
"Poseidon-3","Null","2","4","8 February 2008"," Remarkably divisive film with as many detractors as it has defenders.
","Based on a popular novel of the same name, this suspenseful character study traces the actions of three men tangled in a mess of stolen drug money, vengeance and pursuit. Brolin plays a low-income husband in 1980 Texas who, while hunting, comes upon the remnants of a drug deal gone bad. He discovers $2 million and takes off with it, but makes the mistake of returning to the scene later. Before he can even count the money, he's being pursued by various parties to the crime, primarily the driven, sociopathic and mysterious Bardem as a vicious hired killer. Attempting to sort out the mess, alternately trying to save Brolin and stop Bardem (who leaves a trail of bodies in his wake), is Jones, an aging sheriff who is finding his profession more and more futile. Brolin and Bardem play a very dangerous game of cat and mouse with Bardem stalking him through location after location and carrying one mean weapon, a pneumatic cattle gun that can knock the locks off of doors with one trigger pull. Jones uses Brolin's wife Macdonald to try to get him to give himself up, drawing her into the situation as well. Harrelson appears as another hit man, sent to retrieve the money for his own client Root. Brolin gives a terrific everyman performance, placing himself in a new category in the Hollywood echelon. He's a simple, stoic man with an ironic sense of integrity who makes a few wrong decisions. It's interesting to watch his resourcefulness unfold as his predicament worsens. Jones feels tailor-made for his role and effortlessly slips into the character's skin. It's an interesting counterpoint to the dogged and ferocious agent he portrayed years ago in ""The Fugitive."" Bardem is captivating and quite terrifying. His intensity, which contains just the slightest hint of dark humor, is amazing to behold. This exceedingly handsome actor is made to look almost ridiculous and yet he is a serious force to be reckoned with. His interchanges with various townsfolk and travelers are fascinating and tense to watch. Harrelson has almost a cameo role, but handles it effectively. Macdonald starts out seeming weak, but manages to turn in a memorable portrayal by the time of the dénouement. Harper appears briefly as Jones' supportive wife. They make a believable couple. Cute Dillahunt plays a green deputy, exchanging ideas about criminology with Jones as they investigate. Corbin has a small but effective bit part as a local man with a violent event in his past. Grant, humorously, but almost too cartoonishly, plays Macdonald's crotchety mother. A wondrous collection of actors gives quirky life to a variety of rural store owners, motel clerks and the like. The film has atmosphere and tension throughout. Surprisingly, but refreshingly, there is no music to speak of in the main course of the film. It avoids the traditional use of music which instructs the audience what to feel and when. Destined to be considered slow by some viewers, it takes its time to set the right moods and give full texture to the story and characters. Though many folks have lambasted the film for its inconclusive ending, it follows the book to a remarkable degree, up to and including the ending. Ultimately, it's a movie more memorable for its acting and its imagery rather than its plot line."

What is even the point of the Ed Tom Bell character? Apparently he is simply a red herring.

Nearly all the reviews have been ecstatic and touched on the many qualities of this masterpiece so I really have nothing new to add. But, I just saw it two hours ago and it has left me reeling. So, I really have to get my feelings off my chest and touch on some aspects of the film that immediately come to mind. This is not a plot synopsis.<br/><br/>Its too early for me to collect my thoughts and say this is their best film. I've been a fan of the Coen's since I saw Blood Simple in the early 90's. But, I suspect that this is their best film. Yes, better than Fargo or Lebowski, both of which I loved. The first thing that makes it special is Anton Chigurh, played by Javier Bardem. He is certainly one of the most resourceful, remorseless and evil characters ever committed to celluloid, on a par with Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter. There is a conversation between him and a over-friendly gas station owner towards the beginning of the film thats up there with the most chilling scenes I've ever seen. And they're just talking.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is of a very high caliber, Josh Brolin being a revelation and Tommy Lee Jones playing a role only he could have done justice to. Woody Harrelson has an excellent cameo role. He plays one of many unfortunate souls that cross paths with the deranged Chigurh and can only say ""you don't have to do this"". The way his face turns red, he knows he's going to die and the calm exhibited by the monstrous Chigurh will remain in my mind for a long, long time.<br/><br/>The Coen's have always been strong on the technical aspects of film-making i.e. cinematography, sound, editing etc. but this is by far their best work. The action mostly takes place in motels and a dusty desert near the Mexican border where the drug deal went south. In both cases, the visuals are perfect. That is exactly how you would expect a motel to look and smell. That is the perfect secluded place in the desert to make a drug deal. Both locations/sets stick in the mind. The sound too is really important to this film and perfectly done without having a soundtrack. The editing is extremely taut in the few action scenes between Chigurh and Moss such as when Chigurh comes to visit him in motel #2. The tight editing really gives the action and suspense a greater punch.<br/><br/>While there is much humor in the film, especially in Tommy Lee Jones's banter, you can't relax while watching this. It grips you from the first moment and you're on a horrifying nightmare journey that you hope is going to end well. But it isn't!"

","by Jake Ray<br/><br/>Imagine you are walking through a deserted desert and you happen to come across a bunch of dead Mexicans  the result of a drug deal gone wrong. Trying to escape the scene of this crime, you see a briefcase containing $2 million of dirty money. What do you do? Do you pick it up, or leave it?<br/><br/>This is the emotional quandary put upon cowboy Llewellyn Moss in the new Golden Globe nominated Coen Brothers masterpiece No Country for Old Men.<br/><br/>Based off of the Cormac McCarthy novel of the same name, the film was a gritty breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>The film itself sported a cast that rivaled that of The Departed. Tommy Lee Jones (Batman Forever) gives the performance of his career as Ed Tom Bell, the aging sheriff of a small Texas county. In my humble opinion, Jones was snubbed when his name was not announced at the Golden Globe nomination ceremonies.<br/><br/>Another actor who gave the performance of his relatively unknown career was Josh Brolin (Planet Terror) who played the antagonist Llewellyn Moss. He was scary, but likable, and one of the manliest characters in the history of cinema. <br/><br/>These actors had to take a backseat to a man named Anton Chigurh. Played by Javier Bardem (Before Night Falls) Chigurh was horrifically grotesque. His dialogue was frightening, his actions were shocking, and his weapons were dominating. The role has actually propelled Bardem to a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture. Though that award seems destined for Phillip Seymour Hoffman, for the critically loved and acclaimed Charlie Wilson's War, Bardem would win if I had the vote.<br/><br/>Throw in a short, buy rather funny, performance by Woody Harrelson (Natural Born Killers) and you have the SAG Awards shoe-in for Best Performance by a Cast. <br/><br/>With all of this considered, I still haven't named the most important part of the cast. Silence was the greatest contributor to the overall effect of the film. In fact, the film didn't even have enough background score to qualify for a nomination. The simple sounds of a man breathing, or a door creaking created a painfully tense theatrical experience that was uncomfortable for the viewer, but at the same time strangely rewarding. Most of Brolin's on screen time is unpleasantly silent.<br/><br/>If you couldn't guess already, I am giving No Country for Old Men a 9/10. Such things as killing characters off-screen and not explaining pointless car wrecks keep this movie form a 10. Its mistakes almost improve the film, but they are mistakes nonetheless. <br/><br/>The Coen Brothers are two of the greatest directors of our time, and they have proved it with films like Fargo, O, Brother Where Art Thou?, The Big Lebowski, and Raising Arizona. This film is completely different than any of those. It is gritty and terrifying. You do not leave the theater pumped or excited, but more fulfilled. It may take a minute to even gather an honest reaction to the film. <br/><br/>I will warn you that if you are like me, by that I mean squeamish, there will be scenes that force you to turn your head.<br/><br/>Painfully gorgeous and hard to swallow, the Coen Brothers have again captured the true darkness and loneliness of the west. The tough cat and mouse chase between Moss and Chigurh launched the greatest film released since The Departed. Gathering four Golden Globe Nominations including Picture, Director and Screenplay, this unlovely picture will be the film to watch this award season."

","Does anyone remember a guy named Sam Peckinpah? This movie is a total ripoff of his work, from the camera work to the setting to the acting styles. I liked this movie because I've always loved Peckinpah's films, but the wild, ridiculous amount of praise this so-so film is getting is ludicrous. I think a lot of it is coming from younger viewers who know little or nothing about Peckinpah. If you can tear yourself away from Halo 3 long enough, try renting ""The Wild Bunch"" and, especially, ""Bring Me The Head Of Alfredo Garcia"", to see where the Coens got their ideas. This is probably their homage to Peckinpah, anyway, but it seems he's been unjustly forgotten by the dimwit critics that are falling all over themselves proclaiming this film a masterpiece."
"archiecm","9","2","4","13 December 2007"," Problems with the characters, problems with the ending
","I enjoyed watching this film. I enjoyed the realism and the unique characters of Lewellyn and Chigurh. But I was left rather angry by the way it ended. <br/><br/>Why, after following the moves of the hunter and prey, do we get gypped out of seeing the denouement? Chigurh wins but we don't see it. And what about those other guys jumping into the truck? Why, after watching Lewellyn's wife face the killer, do we not get to see what he does? I'd have settled for a gunshot. No. After hearing her unique approach to the killers ""coin toss"" gambit, we see him walk out without a sound from the house. Did the gambit work? OK, I have to guess, so I guess, no, it didn't. But why, after all the violence so far, do I have to guess on this one? Is it because the movie's almost over? That makes no sense.<br/><br/>How is it that the hunter gets rammed by another vehicle at this particular time? Random chance? What are the odds? Films don't have events in them that are random. So what's the message? Just because it's a shock and I didn't expect it doesn't make it good storytelling. Also, why no ""portrait"" of the other driver? We had scores of other portraits so why no portrait here? How did that driver come to be going so fast? Drugs? Rage? What? If it doesn't matter than why do the other events matter?<br/><br/>Speaking of portraits what purpose does Sheriff Tommy Lee Jones serve? I kept thinking this seasoned old lawman was going to enter the scene at some point but he is terminally peripheral. He doesn't catch anyone. He doesn't even get a description of the killer from the trailer park superintendent because he never interviews her. He's just Falstaff in a Shakespeare play. Another blunder of his seems to be that he was in the same room with the killer and didn't know it (there in that last motel). All he had to do was turn on the rest of the lights. Or did I miss something? (Maybe this is a Patricia Highsmith type story where the villain gets away with it. I hate those kinds of stories.)<br/><br/>How does the Woody Harrelson character add to the film? I get it that his presence fleshes out the ruthlessness of the killer and also the craftiness but that's somewhat undone by the easiness with which he's done away with. Shouldn't he have made his stand on the hotel stairs? Once inside the room he was a goner.<br/><br/>And why, after being so wily up to the last reel, does Lewellyn show his cards to his wife knowing that the killer already has included her in the mix? And why does he not hide the money in a better spot having already used the air vent ploy? If nothing else, it guarantee's his life for a while if he doesn't have the money on him.<br/><br/>Finally, I echo other reviewers at the low end who ask how none of this came to be followed by regular law officials? The killer leaves bodies behind like bread crumbs and no one is assigned to investigate? That's pretty hard to swallow.<br/><br/>Nine years later I feel like changing one point. I understand Chigurh enough now to know he did kill Lewellen's wife. Her only chance, illogical as it was, was to correctly guess the flip of the coin. She didn't so he killed her. Is it a better movie that the Coen's left out the actual scene or sound of her execution? Not to me but I would entertain an opposite point of view. The car crash right after still makes no sense to the story. But now I'm anxious to read the novel from which this all came."
"mrliteral","7","2","4","12 December 2007"," 3/4 great, 1/4 awful
","This movie has received nothing but the most positive, glowing reviews through all the major news outlets. It came highly recommended to me by more than one fellow film student. I'm a big fan of the Coen brothers when they're on their game (Fargo, The Big Lebowski); not so much when they're off (Intolerable Cruelty, The Ladykillers). Sometimes they're brilliant, and sometimes they're simply doing something different. Who knows what that might be; it's whatever they feel like at the time. This film shows both sides. Unfortunately, the brilliance takes place in the first 3/4 of the movie, while the entire third act is so close to pointless that it completely ruins the experience.<br/><br/>So let's talk about the bulk of the movie first: it's incredible to watch, and especially to hear. The use of sound is really, truly wonderful. What you hear, how you hear it, and many times, what you don't hear...it all brings you right into the story, and they make it seem effortless. The performances are solid all around, with the notable exception of Javier Bardem - he is absolutely terrifying. Part of it is what the Coens have him say and do, but much of it comes from his eyes, his voice, his facial expression or lack thereof...his body language. It's quite amazing to see, and very unnerving.<br/><br/>The story is typically Coen-esquire; regular guy Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) finds two million dollars and a bunch of dead guys out in the middle of nowhere. He takes the money, but goes back later with a gallon of water to see if he can't help one of the guys who wasn't quite dead. I give the writing credit here for having Moss tell his wife that he's going out to do something ""dumber than hell, but I'm doin' it anyway."" That gets the script off the hook for the rest of the plot hinging on a character's bad decision. He admits it's a bad idea, so for the story's sake, it works. Naturally, the bad guys find him and come after him, and he's got to be smart enough to stay alive.<br/><br/>At the point in the story when it seems as though a number of these various characters, good and bad, will come together in the form of some type of confrontation...well, nothing else really happens. I can't go into detail without giving away everything that actually does happen, but...the Coens dropped the ball. They just stop telling the story here. What happens to this character? Where is another character at this point? What about that plot point? All dropped. None of these questions are answered. We are left to guess or assume at the outcome of events. I don't know about the rest of you, but when I'm being told a story, I like to actually be told the story. I don't want to guess or assume. I can, but what's the point? It's their story; they should tell it. If I want to tell a story, I will, but that's my own screenplay. I'm watching their movie; I expect them to show me what happens. And they don't.<br/><br/>Some people have argued that it works because it defies convention. Yes, it defies convention; the Coens tend to do that. No, it doesn't work, not simply because it's different. It has to be different and good, not different and wrong. There's nothing wrong with leading an audience to believe events will resolve in a particular manner, then turn it around and do it in a surprising way. But you still have to resolve the story you created, and they don't do that here. It doesn't have to be a ""happy"" ending. It can be anti-climactic. You don't have to end the movie with a big explosion; you can end the movie with a tired old man describing his dream of his father. Subvert expectations; play the downside. I'm all for that. But don't fail to continue the story. Don't leave too many things open to assumption. Tell the story. Show me what happens.<br/><br/>What's so crazy about this is how well they were telling the story, up to the point at which they stopped. It was so good, and so compelling, and so powerful...then it stops. I don't want to say what is happening at the point at which it stops, because I don't want to ruin anything, but I will say this...there is a brief conversation, between a major character and one not seen before, that appears to be meaningless and out of place, and before any meaning of this conversation becomes apparent, the screen fades to black, and I believe that's the first time there's a fade out. After that...well, be prepared not to have any more questions answered from that point on.<br/><br/>The sad thing is, during that scene, and its fade out, I thought to myself: ""Gee, this seems rather pointless, but it's a Coen brothers film, so there's probably some meaning in it that will become clear later."" But it never did. Not much after that was made clear at all. And I'm a big believer in filmmakers making things clear to the audience. They shouldn't spell everything out, but they should make things clear. There's a difference. At the end of Citizen Kane, showing the sled in the fire...that's making it clear. If a guy had seen the sled and told another person ""Rosebud, that's what he said when he died, I guess he wished he'd had a simple happy life instead of the way he grew up and lived..."" That's spelling it out. And nobody wants that. No Country For Old Men could have been truly great, had they only finished the story they began."

""The greatest screen villain of all time""  that, is the only film on the screen, and yet it makes some pretense at being more than that, or even some sort of denouncement of violence. Make your gore films, but don't try to tell others it's more than that. This is a simple formula film with an ambiguous ending.<br/><br/>It was well acted all around."
"cultfilmfan","8","2","4","1 December 2007"," No Country For Old Men
","No Country For Old Men is based upon the novel of the same name by Cormac McCarthy. The film is about a man named Llewelyn Moss who is hunting in the desert and uncovers a crime scene of a drug deal gone wrong. In his findings he also uncovers a briefcase full of money which he takes home with him. Meanwhile a ruthless killer named Anton Chigurh who wants the money that Llewelyn stumbled upon is now after him and Llewelyn has to watch his tracks and do everything to avoid this crafty man who will stop at nothing to get the money and to kill him also. This was a film that really is an effective thriller. The plot and the different twists are all very clever and unpredictable and unless someone read a spoiler filled review of this movie, or read the book then I guarantee you will also not know which direction this film is going to go in and what is going to happen to the characters. The mood and tension is also brilliantly set up by very little dialog and noise from the main characters and in the stalking scenes the shadows, lighting and the fact that there is little to no music in those scenes further sets up a powerful and thrilling mood and keeps you captivated to see what will happen next. This is also a very good looking film and because of the way it was shot it adds to the film's look that it tries to convey with shadows, darkness and isolated places and rooms that because of the way it was filmed really helps with the atmosphere and mood of the film. When there is talking in the film the dialog is often well written and even when we just see the camera following the characters around and seeing what they do next, this is also a great character study and an examination of what one would do in a certain situation type of movie. After I left the film at the theatre, I didn't feel that everyone in the audience was totally impressed by the film, or the way it was done. I personally found a lot to appreciate with this film and even though the plot sounds generic enough, there really is a lot of intelligence and thought behind it and because of the mood and layout of the film it further enhances just what a thrilling story this is. I also liked how the film was unlike a lot of Hollywood films in a way that it didn't use clichés, or try to do a predictable ending, or anything like that. I also admired the film all the more for that. Even though I liked this film a lot I could definitely seeing myself liking it more and more with repeat viewings and will probably grow to like it even more over time and I think the same could be said for others, or maybe even the few who were in the audience with me who I didn't get good vibes from. This is a film that will probably grow on you each time and each time will enhance your appreciation for it."

","Have you ever had the feeling of witnessing something beyond special while watching a film? Well, that is exactly what you are going to feel while watching ""No country for Old Men"". The film is nearly flawless in almost every aspect and manages to capture your attention from the first few fine shots of the movie. The film focuses its attention on 3 main characters and all of them are incredible well built. Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh is one of the best psychopath in the history of cinema, without a doubt. Every single thing about his character is so mesmerizing to watch and although he is the villain, he still manages to reach your heart. Every time he is on screen he inspires nothing but fear and anxiety, which is exactly what a ""perfect"" villain should do. Also, the first scene we have with Bardem's character is one of the best character introduction ever. Josh Brolin is also amazing as Anton Chigurh antagonist, Llewelyn Moss. Then, Tommy Lee Jones did an absolutely fantastic job as the sheriff.
The cinematography in this particular film was unbelievably good. Also, this is one of the best work by the Coen brothers, who managed to deliver such a great story with an impecable directing.

It seems that the sense of evil can also give people a sense of presence, but that may be more repressive of themselves. Perhaps in sunny weather, people and people 's nature Get along, that's the feeling of being<br/><br/>Before killing, you need to find a reason. The reason is the connection between people. When the connection is not found, the movie character will anger the other party, or find an excuse that does not seem to be excuse, and let him complete the next step. Feeling, but that feeling will make him more depressed. Maybe he can only get what he wants from this mode. Just like the child at the end helped him, he thanked the child, the natural connection between the two people is no longer dependent.<br/><br/>And the old sheriff seemed to have nothing to do. Before the huge evil faced, his working identity might have given him a reason to exist. Perhaps he had also chosen the identity of a policeman in order to find a reason. He felt keenly, The other protagonist of the film needs help (the other person in the film is also said that he does not need help, but he helped others at the beginning of the film, and he still cares about his wife) but at the end of his film, his father seems to give him guidance However, he woke up and was unable to achieve it, but on the one hand, the thing that led did not necessarily exist. His father rode a horse but did not speak, and bowed his head to the front to wait for him. That might be his dependence. So at the end of the film, his father told him that even if the person who shot him was released from prison, he would not feel much. But his son couldn't let go, maybe the old sheriff himself regarded this sinful cleansing as his dependence, but in fact his father also told him that he could do little. This is the case itself, but the old sheriff still can't let go, he can't put it down, maybe at the end of the film, his dream, his father does not talk to him, maybe when he was a child, his father talked to him more, just fine Too. Or he and his father would talk more later, and the old sheriff went to find his father, but it seems that they did not communicate much (because he did n't know his father 's habit of drinking coffee), or his father Because she is a sergeant and relatively tough, when she communicates with her son, she often goes straight, denying the most criticism (because his father is also very cruel to himself. The father has a lot of cats in the film, indicating that the father is lonely. The living environment is not very good. At the same time, when the son said that the coffee is all the same, he still drank) His father also showed it at this time, and he was not very dependent.<br/><br/>The old sheriff 's difficulties in his relationship with his father gave him a feeling of being independent, and at the end, his identity was removed (to complete things that would not necessarily be perfectly completed to him The feeling of powerlessness) also brought him back or reminded him that he was still in this state, so he wanted to ride a horse with his wife, or help with housework, with the intention to be so dependent, and then talked about his dream after retirement.<br/><br/>Therefore, perhaps a rough summary is given, both good and evil are tools, and neither can be given to others. Good and evil are not content in themselves, but the real content is dependent, or the word ""depending"" is not used, and What this content is, maybe you can see that if the father is right, he will no longer go forward silently, which is a kind of content."

Llewelyn despite his better judgement uses all of his will, smarts, and knowledge learned from hunting to avoid and escape Chigurh, and we are left wondering and waiting to see if he can escape his impending doom before it's too late. Meanwhile Anton is the hired killer constantly on the trail of Llewelyn, throughout the film the viewer is treated to Antons unique techniques and explanations for who he kills and why?<br/><br/>Also, on the chase is Sheriff Bell. Bell an aging sheriff spends his time split between the decision to pursue Anton and to save Llewelyn.

For obvious reasons, Bell struggles with finding his place in a world with criminals that are all much bigger than this small time Sheriff can truly be capable of understanding<br/><br/>Each character in No Country for Old Men serves a unique purpose to drive the plot, and to always keep you at the edge of your seat wondering what is going to happen next. The camera angles, and drama building scenes (Such as the coin flip scenes) help to make sure the viewer is always paying attention and helps build drama and action in a way that many other films have not. In the end this film uses highly gruesome and old-fashioned violence coupled with artful directing and cinematography to drive the film's final theme home, ""Nobody can ever escape fate or death""."

","This is my favorite movie. There is no flaws in it, and the one movie that can always successfully put me in the mood it demands. Where to start? Javier Bardem creates an amazing, scary, realistic villain in Anton Chigough that takes your breath away at every turn. Josh Brolin, Tommy Lee Jones, and the other actors also have great performances and set realistic characters with real motivations.
Now I have to get into the stuff with the Coen Brothers. These guys are experts in trusting their audience to build suspense. Both the gas station scene and the hotel shootout are perhaps the two most tense and interesting scenes in cinema. The fact that there is no score really does help to build tension to them in a way that's different than most. Not only that but the editing here is top notch, and obviously Rodger Deakins's cinematography is really well done. You can't really have no complaints.
To top it all off you really have an interesting, engaging plot that is hard to get a hand on. Every time you start to get a grip on where the story is going, and realize what is about to happen, the Coen's switch it up and keep you guessing while also still making sense from a character's perspective. All this on top of a relevant, interesting subtext that stays with you after the film.
No film is truly perfect, including this one (the part with Woody Harrison in the Mexican hospital is not quite up to par with the rest of the film) but NCFOM is the closest I've seen."

","The Coen Brothers' 'No Country For Old Men"" is some of the best story telling ever put to film. It isn't afraid to take its time to present its grim and violent world. It keeps you on the edge of your seat with its intense shootouts and brilliant dialogue. Great performances by Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones but I have to give major credit to Javier Bardem who, I would say, gave the performance of his career. Creating one of the best antagonist in any film. The cinematography by Roger Deakins is absolutely stunning and he helps capture the gritty mood the Coen Brothers were going for. Deakins and the Coen Brothers are masterful together due to them working together in the past with Fargo and The Big Lebowski. Overall this is everything a film should be."

","This film is a masterpiece of time, place, character, immorality, human nature and destiny. Photography by Roger Dickens is edited by Cuenne by Carter Burwell. Many of the movie scenes are so impeccably crafted that you want them to simply continue, and the stretch of feelings that are in each scene will attract you to the next scene.
The play of Brother Bardem, one of the most bizarre and scary games in history, should not be over. Coen's director has been very well-placed."

","No Country for Old Men isn't a traditional story by any sense of the word. And it's better to know that going in. If you are looking for a happy ending with character development and a three act structure this movie is not for you. The story follows three main characters: Llewelyn Moss (played by Josh Brolin) who finds a drug deal gone wrong then takes the money then runs, Anton Chigurh (played by Javier Bardem) a psychopath who hunts down Llewelyn and the stolen money and Ed Tom Bell (played by Tommy Lee Jones) a local sherif who try's to catch Chigurh before he catches Llewellyn. The film is essentially a game of cat and mouse with each character trying to stop the other. But by far the most interesting of the lot is Anton Chigurh. He slowly stalks his pray like a horror movie villain out of a slasher. He is cold, emotionless, ruthless and extremely dangerous. In any scene he is in you sense that all the other characters he meets might not be alive by the end of the film. He seems more monster than man, never stopping no matter whats in his way. The Cohen's and legendary cinematographer Roger Deakens film Chigurh as if he were Frankenstein's monster and create some truly brutal and haunting yet beautiful shots. One of the most interesting things about the film is how it handles death and violence. The Coen brothers don't indulge in it and never try to make it seem cool. It is often quick and ruthless and over in seconds or is skipped over entirely and the results and aftermath of the violence is often the only things viewer's see which gives the film a sense of realism. The film is extremely tense and although some will complain about the film's ending looking back and re-watching it you see it couldn't have ended any other way and is actually quite poetic."

But what can I say about No Country for Old Men that hasn't already been said?
This is very very excellent movie, that has the right balance of direction where it gains momentum and holds it there. There are no flat spots in this film, not really. I know some reviews have stated the contrary, but no more than any other film.<br/><br/>The characters all have depth here, and they are perfectly cast. Brolin is our protagonist Llewellyn and he's the typical type of rough neck southerner, but a sort of nice guy at the same time. Whilst out shooting he happens upon a drug deal that went wrong, finds a case full of money and sets about getting out of the country with it.
Whilst all this is happening we are introduced to antagonist, Anton, and we learn that he's been contracted to retrieve the money that Llewellyn has fled with, at any cost. This character is played by Javier Bardem, and never has anybody on screen been so disturbingly scary. Anton is a complete psychopath, he likes hurting people. At times, he bears no facial expression, his eyes look though people, he has no conscience. You might be thinking right now 'sounds like Arnie in Terminator'.. NO, much, much scarier, but, like Terminator, he chases his victim with the same relentless vigilance. But this film is much more than some hunt flick; the characters are clever, and one close call follows another. It's extremely gripping.
Other characters blend in beautifully, there are no throw aways to speak of, and there are some big names with rather minor roles, combined to make this a wonderfully acted thriller.<br/><br/>The atmosphere is perfect. I lust for films which bring this sort of feel to them, I haven't found many, but in truth, I think it's only this film and some Roman Polanski numbers. Films like this, really put you in the moment, you feel uneasy, you feel excited. I actually found myself clenching my fists very tightly throughout this movie, it's that powerful!<br/><br/>Along with the great atmosphere is the delightful and bleak backdrop; this is after all in Texas where the open space and colour is very pleasing to the eye. It's also perfect for a film such as this because as we watch Llewellyn being hunted down by gun wielding drug dealers in the desert, we realise there really is nowhere for him to hide.<br/><br/>I can't recommend this film enough. I'm giving it a 9/10 because, as brilliant as it is, I was a bit disappointed by the ending, but more to the point, it doesn't quite have that 'perfection' like films such as The Godfather, or perhaps, Schindlers List, but on the other hand, I found NCFOM much more enjoyable, and I think, that's the point."

The protagonist is seemingly a good guy, in fact the compassion he displays saves his life ( he brings water to a dying man, which leads him to discover money he has is tracked, and if they track him down, he and his wife would be killed).<br/><br/>So the protagonist gets away with stealing money but soon on his trail is a stone-cold killer; the man on his trail has murdered his previous employers, believing that they are below him in the food chain and this ""displaced"" drug money is his for the taking.<br/><br/>And this killer is correct. The money is in fact his for the taking. He is a ruthless killer, intelligently executing his strategy. Victory is eventually his but in the end ruthlessness and strategy meet luck; and the killer misfortune is that while driving victorious from his endeavors he is struck on the road by a driver that runs a red light, nearly causing the death of this calculated killer by mere chance.<br/><br/>So even though death is assured, for some much earlier then other, we are all subject to cosmic forces that may unwind our destiny and ruin or enhance our plans, no matter how much we think of our selves or of how careful we are about living this life death is just around the corner."

Instead, it does the job by showing and avoid telling, which is exactly what films should do but haven't be done enough.<br/><br/>The story is unconventional and unpredictable.

Javier Bardem certainly is the highlight of the movie, making his character original, unique and classic with his incredible performance as a mad, pathological killer.<br/><br/>Like I said, this movie doesn't tell a story.

","To me, ""No Country for Old Men"" is one of the best films of the Coen brothers in terms of its direction, writing, acting, cinematography, editing - et cetera.<br/><br/>But what truly stands out is the study of the psychopath - acted perfectly by Javier Bardem. The smooth direction hints at this, as several times we don't actually see what happens to the victims of Anton Chigurh, although this is sophistically hinted. The ambiguous clinical psychopathic behavioural traits are all here: impulsivity versus thorough execution, lack of empathy versus sociopathic manipulation, et cetera.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin is excellent as anti-hero Llewelyn Moss, Tommy Lee Jones as fantastic as the worn-out lead detective Ed Tom Bell, and nihilistic Woody Harrelson is doing great in the supporting cast department as Carson Wells.<br/><br/>The moody and eccentric vibe of this film makes it a wonder that it actually won the best picture award at the 2008 Academy Awards.

"adamafrixal","8","0","0","25 September 2018"," No Country for Old Men (2007) : Old Classic Silently stays Golden
","No Country For Old Men (2007) have been regarded as one of the classic western film. The film featuring Tommy Lee Jones and Javier Bardem managed to stays monumental due to its different take on the genre and very interesting acting by the cast. After watching this movie myself, I can say that this is a good movie with so many levels of message. If you like western and unusual take on its storyline, it is a must watch.
The story follow three main standpoint as Violence and mayhem ensue after a hunter or welder accidentally stumbles upon a drug deal gone wrong and more than two million dollars in cash near the Rio Grande. The hunter named Lwellyn Moss (Josh Brolin) then being hunted back for the cash by a hired hitmen Anton Cigurth (Javier Bardem). The story then also switch to the perspective of a local sherriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) who seems reluctant to get involved but still got involved anyway.
Personally, I felt that this movie is somewhat random at times, and event will happen unexpected. The message delivered is also very gray as there is ambiguous message regarding heroes and villains, justice and evil. While the storyline may kind of messy at first and switching back and forth between many characters it still manages to grasp your attention and won't let it go.I believe your attention is already glued to the movie thanks to the strength of each character in the movie especially Anton Cigurth.
Anton Cigurth managed to be one of the most unique villain in the movies that I watched. From the first sight, he already gave a different atmosphere, as he appears to wear all black like a grim reaper with a funny hair (which no one dares to laugh at). Not only his appearance, his character is so much more complex. While he is evil he is much more than that. as he acts based on a set of principles, which is very awesome for a character and especially villain to have, since many villain did not have enough conviction on their belief and can be convinced by heroes at times.
My favorite moment is always when Cigurth takes act and give his victim a chance to decide their fate by calling a flip of coin (similar to Harvey Dent in Dark Knight). I think it manages to create more tension than the gunfight, even though this movie provided some very good gun fighting with a good build up and action.
Another thing that stands out from this movie is that it has no music or soundtrack whatsoever all the time the movie plays. It is very quiet, but I think the silence is being utilized very well by the director the Coen Brothers as tools to elevate tension in every scene and make things more thrilling. Not many movie managed to do this thing very well, the other I know are quiet and mute film like hush and a quiet place.
My worries is that for some people that likes fast action, I will not recommend this as this movie builds up pretty slowly and may need your attention to understand the story and characters motivation. If you just want fun stupid gun action, you will be disappointed and most likely drowsed only to be awaken later with no understanding of what is happening.
I wanted to mention that this movie would let you know that you have limitation, as for the old men in this film and their justice are powerless to the force of nature, law, and chaos. This message can be quite summed up by Ellis's quote below.
Ellis: Whatcha got ain't nothin new. This country's hard on people, you can't stop what's coming, it ain't all waiting on you. That's vanity.
I really recommended this movie and I won't hesitate to give this 8 out of 10. If you like cowboy and western movie I say this is a must watch."

","The Coen Brothers are highly regarded as pioneers of modern movie making, with there own signature style of genre that is easily recognisable and always unforgettable. They've been writing, directing and producing their own projects since the 90s, creating some of cinema's most iconic characters and most compelling, original narratives. It's safe to say, that whenever they release something new, it's an event more than just a viewing. <br/><br/>With No Country for Old Men, Joel and Ethan Coen are on top form, spewing cinematic gold on screen that leaves the audience in pure awe. The story centers around Josh Brolin's Llewelyn Moss, who stumbles upon a drug deal gone wrong and a stash of money in a suit case, the perfect start to any narrative I say? This leads him to take said cash for himself and from there, violence and mayhem ensue in the from of Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh, with Tommy Lee Jones' Ed Tom Bell right behind as the town's sheriff. <br/><br/>The leads deliver indelible performances that drive the movie forward as they chase one another with only a thin gap between them. Javier Bardem completely embodies the personification of a psychopath, leaving us with one of the most classic villains to date and a one-liner to follow suit ""what's the most you ever loss on a coin toss?"" The tension is palpable and almost unbearable, with trademark sequences that will be studied, viewed and enjoyed for the years to come. <br/><br/>Featuring the deserted, blazing landscapes of Texas with its peculiar locals, No Country of Old Men is beautifully shot, creating an emphatic world for it's characters to live and breath in. To put it mildly, No Country for Old Men is a near-masterpiece, serving as a template of the highest calibre of modern American Cinema."

The first half of the film (approximately) feels like a relatively standard getaway story, but I was really loving the atmosphere, direction, performances, and the lack of a score was incredibly fitting for the style. However, the film then takes all its setup and potential conventions and throws them completely out the window. It is jarring, but I think it is what makes it so brilliant. I can see many people watching this film and being completely turned off by it, and I get it. Despite this, I think those people should try to give it another chance. What this film does is create subversion in a very purposeful way. The unpredictability of the story ties in beautifully with the thematic intentions of the story.

Josh Brolin character struggles between being a hero and a man who took something that isnt his. Anton struggles with his perception of letting fate decide his actions or if he's the monster he is told to be. But the true main proponent of the film is Tommy Lee Jones. He starts off the film talking about old sheriffs not needing a weapon, wondering how they would operate these times, and finally through this 2 hour whirlwind of a film, he along with the audience have come to the conclusion that they aren't equipped to fight this world anymore. That they are in way over their head. Same with Josh Brolin. Tommy Lee character a throwback to an old western hero doesn't get to he that anymore.

"jrarichards","8","0","0","28 August 2018"," Huge on atmosphere, shock and style ... but at times lightweight on the details
","The Coen Brothers' 2007 movie, based on a Cormac McCarthy novel, is first and foremost an atmospheric take on life in Texas - as a state bordering Mexico - in 1980 (for some not especially clear reason). In this sense, it is is a bit disappointing that much of the filming is done in New Mexico. Nevertheless, the scenes of wilderness here are amazing, and we are left in no doubt that this is indeed a wild place - beautiful in the natural sense, but hideous and primitive in the sense of what man here is prepared to do to fellow man (or woman).<br/><br/>This is a hard, gory, merciless piece of work, and a show absolutely stolen by its hardest and most merciless character - a sadistic, psychopathic contract killer called Anton Chigurh played with verve by Javier Bardem. He's cold, calculating, clever, literal, polite, dutiful (as he sees it) and more than ready to play games to make his potential or actual victims sweat. He's also got at least two weapons of choice, and that's another of his hallmarks. <br/><br/>Obviously, there's no joy in this Bardem performance, but there is a great deal of brilliance. <br/><br/>Now the absolutely astronomical body count that Chigurh builds up is shocking, but also increasingly unrealistic-looking, and this is is a surprise in such a gritty movie. Likewise, when Llewelyn Moss - a bit of a cardboard-cutout character played by Josh Brolin - first comes across the deadly drug-gang shootout that has the potential to make him fabulously rich if he's got the guts for it - he has no water to offer a rapidly-succumbing but still surviving Mexican victim. He's an experienced hunter and tracker out on foot in tractless Texan desert with no water? <br/><br/>Come off it ! <br/><br/>He then wakes up in the night hours later - and sets off with a huge container of said water out of some feeling of guilt or misplaced sense of duty...<br/><br/>COME OFF IT !!!! <br/><br/>Similarly, the larger-than-life Carson Wells - another character superbly and attractively played by Woody Harrelson - though apparently another experienced and slick killer who mainly differs from Chigurh in having a sense of humour and being rather more merciful - ends up far out of his depth in a way that is surprising ... and thus refreshing in a movie, but also profoundly unlikely. And since the tough-as-old-boots Moss also loses his life when lapsing momentarily into an interest in beer and a woman who is prepared to supply it to him, the merciless and also casual disposal of characters who do or do not put up a fight is a major (interesting and telling) feature of this film, and that's heartless and shocking (and hence good film-making), but maybe not QUITE authentic...<br/><br/>Coming to this a second time now, I was also surprised that the ""Tommy Lee Jones"" movie of my memory actually features the actor playing (VERY well) a rather ineffectual role as Sherrif Ed Tom Bell. He's here to make it clear how everything in the crime prevention and detection world has gone to the dogs - presumably he is one of the Old Men for which this is now no country, and when he says he just does not understand criminal motives any more, we entirely understand him. Interestingly, one of his colleagues tries to persuade him that early 20th-century Texas was just as random and lawless, and we're frankly not convinced by that thesis, even if we recognise that there must have been a period - in the '50s say - when these frontier parts reached a peak of civilisation. But, bright and experienced (and unintentionally funny) though he is, Ed Tom regularly cuts himself out of possibilities for investigation, fails to save key characters, and ends up in docile retirement having either messed up or been passive.<br/><br/>I do really like ""No Country for Old Men"" as a stunning, chilling piece of moviemaking; but it is a kind of an impressionist vision of manmade hell amidst stunning natural beauty. And, like any work of Impressionist art, it's actually just a load of old disordered splodges if looked at from too close up..."

","The contemplative, poetic and visceral vision of the Coen brothers to aging, ""Where the weak have no time"" talks about social degradation, loss of value and defeat against time, you may see only two men hunting and even realizing that The protagonist of the film is Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), a sheriff lost with the advance of crime and murder of good manners, Coen shows us the extreme of the cliché in his contemporary western, but he does it with a masterful beauty. The film tells the story of Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), a Texan sheriff of the 80s who finds himself looking for Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), a typical hunter who comes across and steals a bag full of Scene of a crime, but his bad luck is that the complete psychotic Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) that turns the hunter into prey. The script is confusing to create a plot so sharp and attractive that completely erases us from the real sense and moral of the film, do not get me wrong, I love the hunt and think the way it is ruled magisterial, but maybe even the most Watching the end of the movie with the feeling of being betrayed, and every time the script tries to use metaphor completely from the climate of the film that it creates, apart from being disorganized and disjointed are to create a context that already There are but few realized, that is, the script is so clever and closed in himself, that he has a life of his own to a point that he chooses to tell the story attractive and drown his morale. Among other criticisms contained in the film we are criticizing ethnic diversity, social degradation in favor of violence, gaining the loss of identity, submission for profit, and especially, the loss of strength for the time that with its renewal creates A land where the weak have no turn. The big technical truffle of the film is its cameras, its angles are completely perfect, the film does not need dialogue because the camera constantly talks with the viewer, it guides us, shows us the way, how we should follow, what we should observe, the Coen brothers really make the camera a door to the movies in this movie, although they also have a good picture with a more red palette, a spectacular editing and sound mixing, because the sound in the movie is something very important, the car key beating On the ignition is audible, and this is admirable, and this magnificent sound mix stifles the fact that the soundtrack is hidden. All the performances of the film are very good, but we can not speak of Javier Bardem, who plays a psycho without expressing any feelings, his acting is freezing, unlike all the great acts of psychopaths, Javier is authentic, he is Calm, it transmits terror, fear and insecurity to the viewer, and his acting is what helps, and a lot in the rhythm of the movie. Finally, we have a great movie, which has a great script, that confuses itself, and I think the film transpocición I980 is precarious, and its end is unnecessary, it is not wrong or cruel, it tries to be metaphorical and fails , He gets lost in what he wants to talk about, and 80% of people will feel betrayed by the film when they finish, although it was understandable to me, it's unnecessary, but even with these problems we have what is for me the best contemporary western, Film with great performances, excellent technical resources, attractive, contemplative and beautiful."

","No Country For Old Men is a very unique movie. There are things that every person would feel a movie needs to have that No Country For Old Men does not include. This different style of movie actually worked very well and the directors, Ethan and Joel Coen, did a good job of creating this story for us. The lack of any non-diegetic sound in the movie, including music, made the setting of an empty wild west theme come to life. The movie includes a some of money that is hunted by the cartel and a mysterious man that you don't learn much about the entirety of the film. This man had very well written lines with lots of wit. Even though he had little to no backstory i felt he was a very good character in the movie. What confused me a lot was the death of the main character. the main character dies with about fifteen or so minutes left in the movie. You also do not see him die. He was killed by the cartel as you see them drive away from the scene. This was very strange as most movies do not kill off their main character's in such a way. Overall I felt this movie was very different and unique and even though it was rather slow, it had lots of action and had an interesting plot."

","No Country for Old Men in my opinion, was a movie with intense and thrilling action worked into a very intricate plot. The performance by Javier Bardem as a stone-cold, psychopathic murder or killing machine, if you will, was outstanding. Portraying a heartless man who does not have the inherent ability to comprehend the value of human life is a difficult and daunting task. Props to Bardem on winning an Academy Award for his performance. But back to the plot. Another man in the pursuit of the other man, Llewlynn Moss (Josh Brolin), may seem like a cliché story-line, but with the added philosophical mind of Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) during a time of death, chaos, and senseless killing; it adds a whole new level of meaning to the plot and the film as a whole. <br/><br/>This movie is also outstanding in it's courage by forcing the viewers to not connect with any of the characters as they will soon be taken away from the plot almost inevitably. This action strays away from the basic ideals of a movie goer, which is to be rooting for one single character throughout the entirety of the film. I applaud The Coen Brothers for having the ability to successfully pull that one off on the ""big screen"".<br/><br/>The only negative that I need to add into this review is evidently the cause of this movie only being rated a significant 8. The reason this needs clarity is because in many circumstances this mistake has most likely caused a viewer to be confused just a tad bit from the beginning of the film. That fault is the reason why Javier Bardem's character, Anton Chigurgh, is even one bit worried with the missing two million dollars stolen by Llewelynn. Now you may be thinking to yourself, ""Why is that tiny mishap important to a movie over two hours?"" That detail is pivotal because it is the whole reason why the wild goose chase after Llewelynn began. If only that small error has been washed over with a small detail of explanation then this movie would have certainly received a splendid 10/10."

","The following is a guest post by Jimmy O.: <br/><br/>This film opens up in the Wild West or the outback. You aren't told where they are. It's not a dealbreaker, but it would have been nice to have known. Sure, Tommy Jones and Josh Brolin had Southern accents, but they were fake accents. They could have been Australians using American accents. After some beautiful shots of the scenery, we see Josh Brolin being Josh Brolin in his best role of his acting career. He misses a shot and injures an animal and allows it to remain living and injured. He shrugs it off and then finds a bunch of dead people and a person who was alive. The person begs for water, and Josh says, ""sorry, partner"" and takes off. He then finds a bunch of money and drives back home. This is where the flick kicks off.<br/><br/>We are then introduced to the big bad wolf. He doesn't do a lot of huffing. He's simply big and bad. And a wolf. He's actually a man, but it's an analogy. His name is Javier Bardem. That's the actors name. You don't actually find out what the villains name is until later on in the flick (and it's a lame name). This is beneficial to his mystique; no one lives to tell that they crossed his path. His role in this flick is not to be evil. He is the judge, jury, and executioner (in that order) in the wild west of the outback. Sure, he does a lot of killing, but someone took his money (Josh!) I don't blame the guy. If someone took my money, I'd do the same thing.<br/><br/>As the film drags on, you find yourself rooting for Jar. This poor guy travels so much just to get back his money, and the guy that stole it is running around not even spending it! At least put some in the stock market, maybe even go and leave the country with your wife. This was a major flaw in the film, but if any of this happened there would be no old men chasing each other in the country. This is a film about 2 old men. The third old man is trying to figure out what in tarnation is going on. Tommy Jones plays a seasoned sheriff who just wants to sit back and drink a glass of milk. He can't do that though, there are old men chasing each other. He doesn't step in between them though, because all he does is brainstorm throughout the movie. He added a lot of power to this film with his quiet, but cowboy demeanor. He proved to be the oldest man in the country however, because he was too slow to fix anything.<br/><br/>The message in this film is that we need to own up to our actions, and suffer the consequences.*Cachink!*"

","After settling us into the landscape, the film got into gear as a tense, engaging thriller, with great performances from all concerned, some fantastic characters and dialogue that fit perfectly into the setting. (I particularly enjoyed Tommy Lee Jones's ageing sheriff and Javier Bardem's psychopathic pursuer, but that's merely a selection.) However, I found the editing a little over-indulgent, and beyond a certain point the film meandered more and more until it seemed to be unsure of what the subject was.<br/><br/>If it had lost about 20 minutes and focused more on either one storyline or the other, I feel it would have made a more satisfying experience overall.

However, The details don't match. It might have been the V.O. or the vast acres of barren land or even the sheer anonymity in the murders, anyway Badlands and No Country For Old Men are the twin brothers of heavy silences.

The Coen Brothers have come a long way from Raising Arizona, and return to the Southwest to present a more mature tale of morality and despair, of decent people confronted and consumed by dark forces.<br/><br/>It's a kind of synthesis of John Ford and David Lynch, and yet wholly original: tense, taut, and deceptively simple. Barren landscapes, terse dialog, music used only to punctuate, action that quietly leads one in, then smashes them in the face.<br/><br/>The usual Coen droll, laconic style is still there...but no longer the inside-joke, or the wry social commentary.

The Coen Brothers masterful adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's black tinged novel about Llewelyn Moss, a Texas Marlboro Man type (Brolin, all foolish bravado, in his career best role to date) who stumbles upon a drug deal gone awry, absconds with the illicit $2M, and the vengeful wrath of Anton Chigurh, the psychotic criminal (Bardem sporting a haircut from hell and equally excellent in one of the darkest cinematic villains to come down the pike in years), it belongs to. On the trail of violence and fate is world-weary Ed Tom Bell (Jones in a career high as well), the local peace officer out to stop the bloody trail. The film works on all cylinders at a suspiciously sedate yet suspenseful rate thanks to the skillful two-headed directing team of Joel & Ethan and there ace cinematographer Roger Deakins making hell on earth look beautiful and special kudos to the uniquely on-edge sound design by Craig Berkey whose shrewd use of silences makes for one helluva filmgoing experience.

","No Country For Old Men is a dumb, pointless, purposeless, UBER-overrated, overtly-graphic and mean-spirited movie from very overrated directors (Coen Brothers). The cinematography is, admittedly, great and the movie is at least 'watcheable.' The movie starts out well and seems very compelling for awhile...but goes downhill throughout and the story seems to be half-concocted: Why spoil the movie with the untimely, undramatic, and unimportant death Bardem's primary adversary -Josh Brolin? Why not continue the duel between Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin leading to an epic and exciting showdown between the two at the end of the movie? Tommy Lee Jones looks and seems washed up (not because he seems uninterested) and mumbles throughout the movie. This is easily his worst performance I've ever seen. Javier Bardem is detestable and extremely mean-spirited -whether he was intended to be that way or not. He seems like an extremely dumb person and unlikeable person in real life who's acting skills are extremely-limited. When he speaks dialog in No Country for Old Men he sounds like a quasi-retard with a low I.Q. This is probably the only type of role he could ever play, me-thinks.<br/><br/>The whole movie 'feels' completely devoid of purpose and completely 'dead.' I do enjoy 'violent' movies, perhaps more than I should, but like many modern flics, N.C.F.O.M. seems like nothing more than an engine for an occasional pointless, violent and overtly graphic death of someone. The lack of music throughout movie enhances the 'dead' ambiance of the movie. The fact that the public and 'critics' give a movie like this 'UNANIMOUS' high-ratings shows what an incredibly-stupid society it is that we live in."

","No country for old men? Mo' like No Oscars for crappy films.<br/><br/>I did not even for a second care for any character in this movie. The extremely unsympathetic main, the clichÃ© insane evil mass murderer/serial killer (since this movie is a ripoff of The hitcher, it's fair to say Bardem is no Rutger Hauer), the simpleton wife (with annoying accent), the elderly and in dire-need-of-retirement sheriff. Plus two or three characters who are shown once and then killed off immediately. None of those characters' backstories are explained by the way.<br/><br/>Since I did not care about any of the above-mentioned, sitting through two hours of this flick was tedious beyond belief. The plot is simple, yet manages to be ludicrously convenient and riddled with holes big enough to put even a Transformers film to shame (another way this movie reminds me of The Hitcher btw). I think the IMDb goofs section makes a very interesting read for any defender of this garbage flick, by the way. Anyway, not even a decent ending is provided, most characters are killed off-screen (LOL) and the film just ends. While this could work in better films, here it was but the icing on the turd cake.<br/><br/>The only good thing that can be said is that the cinematography is quite OK, I wouldn't even mind the slow pacing - but alas, there is nothing even vaguely interesting happening in this one, and nothing makes a film worse than it battering me with its uninterestingness.<br/><br/>Skip this one and do yourself a favour.

Take a look at his acting. He definitely fits this role, the ugly, non-emotional, ape type look, but he is not acting. There is no musical score, the end drops suddenly, and though it states that Tommy Lee Jones has a star role, he barely appears in more than 10 minutes of the movie.

","Although the film has its merits, I would consider it a letdown - and definitely not worth all the Oscars it received. In a way, it has some kind of a misanthropic note and this is probably the main reason why I hated it more than I liked it. <br/><br/>We are confronted with strong graphic violence right at the beginning when Bardem's character kills the deputy and grins happily after the victim stops moving - the subtext obviously being that this man is simply the incarnation of evil. I guess the scriptwriters wanted to make sure this message really gets through so the viewer has to endure pointless massacres of totally innocent people who just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. And it gets even worse - those of you who thought Chigurh is simply taking revenge on the human race are in for a big surprise as he obviously seems to love exterminating life in general i.e. there is a scene where he pulls back to shoot a bird perched right beside the road - just for fun and the sheer pleasure of seeing a creature die... <br/><br/>The film acts mostly according to its own logic which often defies common sense and stretches even the maximum suspension of disbelief, taking a lot of unlikely turns and twists which are only supposed to push the story along the scriptwriters' ideas. One of things that disturbed me most though is the way this film deals with the portrayal of the mass murderer Chigurh is: he has ""principles"" i.e. lets some of his potential and totally clueless victims gamble for their lives and then teaches them some conventional wisdom, he is polite to the people he is about to kill, he has his own ""rituals"" such as checking his soles after leaving a crime scene, he is never rude to anyone (no cursing) etc. etc. Such nonchalant and casual depiction of evil is deeply disturbing in that it makes it somehow appear acceptable - a notion I absolutely disagree with. Apart from that, we never learn what made Chigurh become what he is - he is simply there and he is evil and cool, that should do... Too bad all of the characters in this film lack development: Llewelyn is an emotionless and not particularly smart bumpkin who stays that way until he disappears, his wife is nothing but worried and scared of what might happen all the time and then at the end of the film she suddenly becomes quite courageous and refuses to gamble on her own life thus choosing certain death! Plausibility is something that can be hardly found in the whole script so why expect it at the end? <br/><br/>So if you are looking for a message here is one - life is fragile, evil will prevail, generally things tend to change from bad to worse... or was there any message at all? Maybe there was none. Maybe we were just supposed to enjoy the cinematography and the performance the actors delivered. To me, this still did not redeem the film - it left a big black hole and bitterness inside of me... or maybe that was what the filmmakers intended? Who knows..."

","The ending of course frustrates many viewers because the intent, both of McCarthy and the Coens, is not so much to satisfy needs for a satisfying resolution of mystery, but rather to induce thought, reflection, and meditation on the depths of it all.<br/><br/>My wife and I both enjoyed it immensely, even though she had to ""brace"" herself for what she expected would be a gore fest. She was relieved that the worst for her was watching Chigurh tend to his own wound. We spent dinnertime and beyond brainstorming all the stuff that kept coming up from our churning associations.<br/><br/>Many questions seemed unresolved. What happened to the money? Why did Wells spot the money case then do nothing to retrieve it immediately? What exactly was Chigurh's agenda - the money? rage at the incompetence of those who hired him? his own evil ""principles""? Why did someone like Moss fail to think, until too late, of something like the transponder? What happened in the scene of his wife and her mother being sent away? What exactly happens in the crucial scene when Sheriff Bell returns to the yellow-taped crime scene and we see Chigurh (inside that room?). If Chiguhr was in there, why doesn't Bell encounter him when he decides to enter? Did Chigurh take off? Bell spies the unscrewed vent grate, but what comes of that? Does Chigurh have the money? Did Bell take it? Yes, we talked at length about possibilities of Bell, the ""good,"" honest lawman realizing this is ""no country for old men"" and deciding to smooth his way to retirement. This is associated with his puzzling need to visit the old man in the wheelchair toward the end, and also his second dream described to his wife.<br/><br/>So - unanswered questions for us all to discuss.<br/><br/>But there's more.<br/><br/>The title is taken from Yeats' ""Sailing to Byzantium,"" and a review of that poem and its meaning may be useful.<br/><br/>There is some obvious use of symbolism in the Coens' film, and once you begin to notice it, you start ""following the threads."" Car hood ornaments are prominently displayed. Especially telling is the Dodge Ram's head on the car Chigurh uses for a while. Aries (element, fire; house of Mars). But, more than Aries . . . the Minotaur! and now a whole new double-take about Chigurh's imposing, threatening presence. The Minotaur was also a demonic, unstoppable force of destruction, who pursued his victims through the labyrinth. Not only were the pursuits here, through hallways, stairways, and borders labyrinthine, but the device of Moss rigging a line to those tent poles in order to conceal and retrieve his treasure is reminiscent of Theseus using Ariadne's thread to navigate the labyrinth and survive the Minotaur.<br/><br/>The horned image of the ram may also allude to a Celtic god, Cernunnos, a mysterious hunter.<br/><br/>What puzzled us most of all was the possible significance of the Sheriff's dreams that end the book and the film. He dreams of his own father, ahead of him through a snowy mountain pass, carrying a horn filled with fire. There's also mention of money, lost, in the first dream.<br/><br/>In our speculations we wondered how Moss's mother-in-law died. Her cancer? or was she killed? And could the money have been buried in her casket? If it was, my wife says this alludes to ""Huckleberry Finn,"" which also contains a line about ""setting out for the territories,"" which she recalls coming up in Bell's conversation with the old man at the end.<br/><br/>I think I could go on, but I'll stop here for now. Definitely a masterpiece!"

To me the entire previous part of the movie is a plot hole, literally thrown into the script to create the story.<br/><br/>In real life Brolin's character would have discovered the tracking device thing once he got back to his trailer while counting the loot then he would have taken the tracking device thing to some dumpster in the nearest large city and thrown it away. Went back and grabbed his woman and moved to a nice remote location of their choice.<br/><br/>Plus, I couldn't help but notice that no where in any part of the movie does it ever explain why Javier Bardem's character ever even starts after Josh Brolin's character? How does he even get the tracking thing?? The only part that could possibly lead the audience to this assumption is when Brolin is for no reason whatsoever bringing the Mexican some water in the middle of the night and then the group that comes after him. They might have some how unbeknownst to the audience tipped off Barbem.!?!... The only thing it ever lets the audience know is that Javier Bardem's character is basically like the grim reaper and likes to kill people. The audience is just supposed to assume he knows Josh Brolin's character has the loot and that Bardem some how got a tracking device that is tracking this phantom bag of 2 million dollars. That whole section of the movie makes no sense at all because there's no explanation as to how he knows these things.<br/><br/>The whole movie pretty much is a major plot hole! Now that I re-watched the whole thing I don't see how this won best picture, but then again most of Hollywood has been stinking it up lately, even though this came out 6 years ago. Still sucks! This movie is way, way, way superbly over rated!"

","No Country for Old Men was not my cup of tea. As much as I really wanted to love it, I just didn't. There were many aspects of the film that I thoroughly enjoyed, but overall, it just didn't click. For starters, I'm someone who loves background information. I want to know where these people are coming from, where they've been. This movie gave the most information about the Sheriff, who, until the final two minutes of the movie, truly made no impact on me at all.<br/><br/>There were two things in this movie that I loved; Carla-Jean and Llewellyn. They were just so typical that they made the rest of the film feel like it was very plausible. He was so resourceful that I was really sad to see him die. Usually when a character dies in a film it's because they have to for plot purposes or they deserve it. Llewellyn is able to escape an assassin, but can't shake off the Mexicans who are after the drug money. He wasn't killed by this unstoppable force of Anton Chigurh, he died out of carelessness. That right there is simply infuriating. As far as Carla-Jean is concerned, I found her to be a very intelligent and strong-willed individual. For example, when Anton gets her in the end and tells her to pick heads or tails, and she refuses, she isn't letting him win. I think that is key to the entire film. Even though these innocent people die and the malicious murderer escapes, at least he didn't win. Life will go on for him, but I know I'd be haunted by those final words Carla-Jean Moss muttered to me. Then again, I'm not a psychopathic murderer.<br/><br/>All in all, I feel like I missed something crucial. I didn't make connections that needed to be made, nor did I totally get the movie as a whole. Hopefully upon watching it a second time will build toward the movies' credibility as a whole."

Sure, he played a good character and did a good job, but I never ran out of breath when he was on screen like some people told me. The others were just OK. Nothing really memorable. Plenty of random characters were introduced with no apparent reason, like Woody. Jones wasn't good also.<br/><br/>Overall it was an interesting film.

Yes, the acting was good as was the cinematography. The element of suspense was there also. But that's about where it ends for me. Praising anything else like the story or direction would be like sucking up to the Coen brothers past successes. ""Money and success cover up a lot of stink"", I believe Elizabeth Taylor once said. That might explain why this movie has been overly lauded. The world is full of real threats. The world of thieves and drug dealers is harsh and real. Sometimes those worlds collide with our own. That's a story that could be told through a set of fictionalized circumstances in a manner far more worthwhile than it was here. However, this film is nothing more than a self-indulgent presentation of an over-the-top blood-thirst fantasy. It's a pity that so many of us need for our fears to be presented to us much the way that we might face them through a ""scary"" roller-coaster or a walk through a frightful haunted house in October....as nothing more than a lark and nothing to give more serious contemplation to."

This film is no exception, featuring some beautiful scenes as well as as some well-executed action. Unfortunately it's all style, no substance. It starts off well but is undone by a very unsatisfying denouement. Too much time is spent on Jones' opaque and uninteresting monologues. The plot is confusing and full of holes, with irrelevant characters wandering in and out who are not even introduced to the audience.

","It is a pity to read comments that ask ""have i missed something"" after watching No Country For Old Men. The movie, whose title was taken from Yeats' Sailing To Byzantium poem reflects none of the optimism that the poet displays about youth...""That is no country for old men. The young / In one another’s arms, birds in the trees."" The movie, as i interpreted it, is about the passing of time, of generations, of things changing and how people deal with times that they do not, or even want to, understand. Yes, the movie is a crime thriller...there is the thrill of the chase, the Coen brothers' artful control of suspense...but it is also about a country that is on the verge of changing dramatically and, since the movie is set in the 1980s, it reflects a point when the nation is becoming what it is today. But hope is not held out to us in any way..the youth (the future generation then, the present one now) portrayed in the movie are not in any way better human beings than the grown ups..it is, as one of the lines goes, ""all about the money."" No Country For Old Men captures a small slice of American history, a time in-between. Similar to the way the movie Network predicts how Television would become an extremely powerful (and not always beneficial) medium, this movie appears to offer a prophecy on how gun culture and money will indeed be what rules America in the future."

"jzappa","10","3","8","25 February 2008"," A Study in Frontier Logic
","No Country For Old Men is a film that is carefully, meticulously constructed to linger, which it does. It's a film that, despite its cold, ominous eccentricity, is very down-to-earth, pessimistic, and wise. It's imagined so precisely that many details will not dawn on you till later, the appearance of a limping dog early in the film for instance. The film progresses naturally, untouched by any sort of convention, vogue or standards, and moves by way of its deep-rooted outlooks and views.<br/><br/>Visually, No Country For Old Men is of the highest cinematic order. The camera moves so deliberately and many images extract so many microcosms in life, a translucent reflection in a blown-out keyhole for example. Many shots rely more on a dooming presence in the out-of-focus background than in the unsuspecting foreground. Violence is portrayed on and offscreen as genuinely as this ungoverned yet restrained film possibly could. It's a standard-setting work of cinema, if that isn't shamelessly extreme in complement. It's so solid, you feel like you could go to Google Earth and rove around its settings finding no boundaries that divide the film set and the real external world. What I found to be outstanding, a strenuous thing to be in a film the sets the bar so high, is its use of sound, which very much opened my mind to the potential effects of the design of such in the movies. The film never uses music. Each scene is given seamless, faultless attention to ambient noises. In a hotel room, for instance, we hear that humming that we can never really locate. Also, there are at least two scenes where your heart is in your throat on account of the simple discerning of a transponder.<br/><br/>In his third appearance in an incredible movie in 2007, following Grindhouse and Amerian Gangster, Josh Brolin gives the best performance I've ever seen from him. He completely embodies a sort that is very relatable and likely to do some of the questionable things that he does in the story, a shrewd pragmatist that is resourceful and invariably stubborn, intractible, and changelessly intent. He speaks few words, he's dry as desert sand, and does not think for one second about the consequences or alternate outcomes of his dangerous choices in the film. Hindsight and deliberation don't exist in his fixed and steadfast world. The chase that ensues as he sees practical possibilities as practical inevitability written in stone in taking $2 million from the site of a gruesomely fated heroin deal is to him something he must staunchly work through with a stone face.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem, in the first film I have ever seen him in, is a presence to be reckoned with. He bears a knowing perception that telegraphs such a deeply dangerous villain. He's beyond the distance between audience and screen. He is so aware, precise, analytical, and thoughtful that he almost sees us peripherally. Pursuing the money that the narrowly engrossed Brolin has taken liberty of, he is what human beings have never faced or understood about fate. He has a mysterious philosophy that carries him serenely through a non-participating life of casual murder, perhaps that he somehow has reached an absolute certainty that there is no afterlife, that life is ultimately meaningless, and that his understanding of that existentialist conclusion admits him the privilege of controlling the fate of those he comes into contact with. How much of a match is Brolin against Bardem? The resourcefulness of the two men is transcendentally absorbingly suspenseful.<br/><br/>Serving as the film's actual hero is perhaps Tommy Lee Jones, who plays a creaky, weathered small town sheriff who avoids the federal investigation of the incidental heroin deal to protectively pursue Brolin. His manner puts off the audience, yes. All of us who have seen this film in theaters will agree. But the key to his philosophies, idiosyncracies, and pontifications are in how he also puts off other characters. Jones, an actor who is often very deterring in how glacial and inexcitable he can be, is really the only actor I can fully and seriously imagine playing the sheriff. The beauty in the film's dooming, melancholy realism begins and ends with him, as someone who has preoccupied doubts, conscious inquiries, and learned understanding that he does not communicate. When he talks, he's saying things that make sense to his views but never his actual views. To those who he shares the screen with, as well as to us, he's an old man whose mind wanders, as he humbly admits in one scene.<br/><br/>The three very incompatible key men never share a frame with one another, except for once very lucidly late in the film. How disconcerting, how painfully obstructing and displeasing. This is the ambiguous epitome of the film's consuming achievement. We are left wondering, pondering, and even if we don't, it lingers still. Images, lines, characters, scenes, they make our own minds wander the next day and the day after.<br/><br/>Kelly MacDonald, the beautiful Scottish actress from Trainspotting and Gosford Park, has a authentically basic and second-class role, which a woman would in her character's place, as Brolin's wife who, despite having severe misgivings about her husband's steel-engraved plans to secure the money, she still cooperates. She is gently endearing in her performance. There is a scene where she does something that I normally can't stand in another person, which is making lip sounds. However, to my indescribable insatiability during that moment, she feels so tenderly real and pitiful and the scene takes a turn of my newfound investment in her.<br/><br/>Despite the Coen brothers' trademark quirky character embellishments, everyone in the film is screamingly real. And that is why this film is so haunting. It may be dryly funny, off- putting, and subjective with the mindset and behavior of its West Texas characters, but it's all a part of the film's nitpicking at the frightening what-ifs of reality, of life on earth."

","No Country For Old Men - The Coen Brothers (2008) A brutal eclipse of modern-day crime-thrillers, Ethan and Joel Coens 'No Country For Old Men' paints a disturbingly violent and beautiful image of the developing slippery slope in which society is slowly falling down.<br/><br/>Starting with visually stunning shots of the baron landscape which becomes a staple of the whole film, the Coen's quickly and vividly materialize 'No Country For Old Men' into one of the most tense and suspenseful films of the last ten years. It quickly advances into a vicious chase across Texas as the deviously psychotic hired-hand in Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) attempts to track down Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), a back-ward country boy who happened to stumble upon a Mexican drug deal gone bad and help himself to the $2.4million left in the dying hands of the 'last hombre standing', which sets into motion a series of unstoppable and deadly events of which gives ageing Sheriff Tom Ed Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) a chance to reflect upon what he's doing and who in today's modern world, he's facing.<br/><br/>From the moment Tommy Lee Jones mutters ""I've been a Sheriff of this town for twenty-five years"" to his final profound epilogue at the end of the film, the acting throughout is sustained at a very high rate. Javier Bardem in particular, is fantastic as the psychotic, no-nonsense, pure incarnation of evil; hired-hit-man Anton Chigurh (however he does have principles in a very funny sort of way...). Every time Bardem is on-screen, his presence radiates throughout the whole film as you know that death is just around corner, while Brolin plays his counter-part to-a-tee, a fearless redneck living out in the desert sands of Texan outback, who is willing to fight Chigurh and the Mexicans to the last-strands of death for the drug money, and is willing to put his wife, the delectable Kelly MacDonald, in the firing line of those around him too.<br/><br/>Roger Deakins beautiful cinematography, of the baron wasteland which all the events of the film are laid out, supports Cormac McCarthy's adapted novel brilliantly. The Coens decision to adapt the novel, with little-to-no tinkering allowed the full beauty of such a deep and thought-fuelled novel to come to life in only the way in which Ethan and Joel Coen could. In an age of CGI and 'green scenes', it's nice to see such an articulated film that ticks every single box for the basic fundamentals of film-making and in such a thought-provoking way too. 'No Country' throws you in at the moral and ethical deep-end and with no back-story, asks you to make a decision, and it's the Coens finest film to date."

I read the title and thought ""hmm not a really zippy flashy title"" it doesn't really say anything about the film _before_ you watch it. But I think that was what they headed for ... I always had this little thing in my head telling me to watch out for that perfect moment when the title just hits the spot in the movie. And my god it did hit it. I watched it not just looked at it or was there and well just looked at a screen ... no the movie captivates. The Actors just fab! Its like your there as a silent watcher in the film not just sitting there. You feel the characters as people and not ""actors"" going through the ( sometimes painful ) stages of acting out a character.<br/><br/>It is one of the best movies I have seen in ages that has been made in the last few years. Not great classics or good old ... no its new fresh and coen!<br/><br/>When you get round to actually thinking again after the movie you notice that is the perfect combination of great acting great story and that little fizz you just haven't had in the movies for a long time.<br/><br/>The characters pull you in they are simple and complex at the same time they are what they are and you accept them to the full. You might not agree with them or think why did he do this ? But then you see it you understand it and get the picture. No big whys and whats and where. No HUGE plot hole that makes you shake your head.<br/><br/>So if you want a film that captivates and makes you experience theater and movies like you did the very first time ... then this is it.<br/><br/>I really loved it and im waiting for the DVD :)"

From the first scene until the last there wasn't a time when I felt there was filler being added. Although Tommy Lee Jones and Josh Brolin did great job this movie wouldn't have been the hit it is without Javier Bardem's portrayal of the psychopathic killer, Chigurh. His screen presence, facial expressions, vocal cadence, and mannerisms all made me believe he was either a fantastic actor or I wouldn't want to caught alone with him while he was in one of his moods. I'm sure the Coen brothers had something to do with bringing such a menacing character to life and casting has to be thanked for picking the right man for this job too. Anyway, it was refreshing to see what could pass as ""the good guy"" (Llewelyn Moss) being told he was out of his league and not believing it then getting unceremoniously whacked.

","This film is not for everybody. But then, ""Le nozze di Figaro"" isn't for everybody, either. I knew next to nothing about the film before seeing it, and absolutely nothing about Javier Bardem. The latter ignorance was certainly to my detriment, because Bardem is a brilliant actor. I will make a point to see his past work. The writing, directing, photography, and acting in this film---all brilliant. Granted, even recognizing that, there are many who will not enjoy it. And there are flaws, to be sure. Some of the acting for minor characters was just passable (I didn't enjoy Stephen Root's performance, although I like him as an actor, and Beth Grant as Carla Jean's mother approached annoying). Bardem and Brolin, however, delivered powerful and memorable performances. The pacing and mood will be a matter of taste. I thought them sublime, and I found myself wanting to absorb every second of every scene. Many scenes were as beautifully played notes, and I missed them as soon as they ended. If you prefer the passive movie experience, with every plot point served up to you with a side of fries, then you won't enjoy this film. There's nothing wrong with preferring such direct storytelling; some people just like to relax and absorb. But if you don't enjoy thinking about the films you experience, this piece may leave you confused and unsatisfied.

He killed his girlfriend, not because he had a motive, but to see what it would feel like. This opening speech sets up No Country For Old Men, the new release from Coen Brothers - Joel and Ethan, which then goes on to explore that baseless type of evil in the form of Javier Bardem's ruthless, mop-topped killer. He plays Anton Chigurh (how you pronounce his last name is dependant on who says it), a stone-faced killer trying to track down a missing bag of drug money, after a deal goes horribly wrong in the Texan desert. Josh Brolin's local simpleton Llewellyn Moss is the man who took the money after stumbling across the aftermath of the deal-gone-wrong. Everything seems to go remarkably well for Moss until he makes one fatal mistake, leading Chigurh onto his tail. Tommy Lee Jones' sheriff Ed Tom Bell attempts to find Moss before Chigurh does.<br/><br/>Apart from being an amazingly tense, and brilliantly shot straightforward genre movie, No Country For Old Men is also a faithfully adapted story that encompasses all the philosophical debates present in Cormack McCarthy's novel. Ed Tom Bell, the beleaguered sheriff weary with the modern world is wondering where the hell society is leading itself. He is convinced, at his mature age, that the world is going to hell in a hand basket, and morality is being sapped from society. But is that really the case, or has the world always been an evil and dark place? The Coens, like McCarthy, clearly think so, despite themselves being at an age when conservative nostalgia evokes a form of pride when you could remember the ""good old days"" of yesteryear. Days when, in your own interpretation, people were nicer and less evil to each other. Anton Chigurh embodies the new kind of evil that people like Bell are forced to face. And Moss is simply the small time player who thinks he can play along with the big guns.<br/><br/>The performances are roundly fantastic, but no one draws the audiences' attention quite like Javier Bardem. The Spanish superstar dares the camera to look at him with his almost lifeless eyes, and the cattle gun he uses to mercilessly kill his targets. Undoubtedly, however, the real star of the movie are the Coens themselves. Along with famed cinematographer Roger Deakins, Joel and Ethan have made their best movie in years. After dabbling in fairly flimsy-but-throwaway material like The Ladykillers and Intolerable Cruelty, this sees them back on the form of edgier films like Fargo and Blood Simple. Even though many found themselves at sea with the head-scratching ending, there is no denying that as a piece of genre cinema, this is top quality stuff. As a poetic meditation on the new evils of the world, it is even better."
"jhw89","2","3","8","13 February 2008"," completely idiotic
","This movie gets three stars: two for Javier Bardem because he's amazing and one for the really cool part where Josh Brolin shoots a dog before it mauls him. There were some nice shots but I don't really remember them, ergo it doesn't really matter that there were any nice shots in the first place. That's about it, in terms of positives. <br/><br/>This is the most overrated movie I've seen in a long time. I expected more from the Coen Brothers. It is so unbelievably slow and boring. Southern accents all around do not help in any way. With the exception of Bardem's character, I didn't care about anyone, and who wants to watch a movie where none of the characters garner interest from the viewer? That's about all I have to say about that."

","An overall brilliant master piece of film that is well shot and has a range of solid acting. Also the face that the film does not have a soundtrack to the final credits adds to the tension and It is overall a very emotionally effecting movie.<br/><br/>It is well deserved of an Oscar although personally I believe that American Gangster should of won film of the year 2007, because I am unsure that the ending to No Country For Old Men Is justified by the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Would highly recommend and I shall be checking out the other Coen Brothers films."

First of all i absolutely thing that the people who think there will be blood is better then this is either in a mental hospital or has some sort of disease and is extremely delusional. The cinema-photography is unbelievable and what also make it even more amazing it is the first film credited to have Joel and Ethan directing. the first time i went to see it i had to sneak in to the movie i really thought it wasn't going to be that special. but when the credits went up i was star struck!!! I have to say in the quiet words of Paris Hilton This is hot There will be blood it not."
"zetes","10","6","22","11 November 2007"," Almost a horror movie at times, this is one fantastic thriller and one of the Coens' best
","I'm not sure one viewing can do this film justice. It leaves a lot to think about, and I spent a good portion of my Sunday reading other people's views to see if I can come to some sort of conclusion about it. But I can't yet. Well, I can come to the conclusion, in any case, that this is a fantastic movie. There's no doubt about that. The Coens go back to their darker, noir-inspired sides, making the barren Texas landscape feel as cold as the Minnesota winter. The central story has a Vietnam veteran, played by Josh Brolin, finding a bundle of cash on the scene of a drug deal gone wrong. Meanwhile, a methodical killer by the name of Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) hunts him down. On the sidelines is an aging sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) who works something like a Greek chorus, commenting on the main action but never able to have any effect on it. Looked at as a simple piece of film-making, No Country is brilliant. The Coens create a couple of the best setpieces they've ever done. They crank the tension up so high that I  along with the entire audience  was holding my breath. This is the closest thing the Coens have ever made to a horror movie, too. At times, it reminded me of a slasher, where we're waiting to see Chigurh dispose of his next victim in a gruesome way. But unlike your common director of a slasher movie, the Coens know how to make movies. It's not enjoyable when someone gets killed here. It feels all too realm and frankly it was scaring the hell out of me at times. Bardem plays the most memorable movie monster of the current decade. The character even sees himself as a monster, of sorts, as a hand of fate. In that way, Chigurh reminds me of another movie character, Ryunosuke Tsukue, Tatsuya Nakadai's character in Kihachi Okamoto's Sword of Doom. The two films share some similarities (surely unintentionally), for example the almost Brechtian dodge of a conventional climax that forces us to reconsider what  and who  the films are actually about. I think one big question that I've come up with is whether the film sees Chigurh as a force of nature, or whether it is just Chigurh seeing himself that way, and that he is as much subject to the forces of nature and fate as anyone else in the story. No Country started to lose me a little when it went after some big themes at the end. I feel like I didn't absorb everything there was, and maybe I just didn't ""get"" what the authors (the Coens and Cormac McCarthy, with whose work I'm entirely unfamiliar outside of this film) were going for. But I also have a sneaking suspicion that the big themes get a little lost, that the Coens don't accomplish everything they set out to do. But I am eager to see this again  and again  to see if I can work it all out."

","A very unusual choice for Best Picture winner, I really don't see what all the fuss is about with this movie.<br/><br/>The character work in the early going is so under-developed that I didn't give a fig who would win during the shootouts. The pace was so meandering that I nearly nodded off on occasions (1hr 50mins was spent on a story that probably could have been told in under an hour). A score of some description would have helped to alleviate some of the tedium.<br/><br/>The popularity of this one baffles me as much as The Big Lebowski. The Coen brothers must bring something to the table that I just don't see.<br/><br/>Stunning cinematography and a thoroughly engaging performance from Javier Bardem as the villain compelled me to give this film a 4/10 - I can't go any higher in good faith due to the thin plot, dreary pace and general lack of life and spirit in the picture. A shame really as all the pieces were there to make a memorable film."
"ruzin08","2","3","9","14 September 2016"," Style over substance
","Hello again whoever is bored to read the whole text just read the following few lines.... Style over substance is in my opinion the case here. I disagree with other people that say that this movie has no plot. I believe it has one but it seems to me that's it's only to show off. It's like they want to deconstruct the genre of crime and/or mystery movies and they want to make a comment on that. In the first half of the movie we have the normal narrative the stereotyped characters and everything is going according to what usually happens in this type of movies. But in the second half all hell brakes loose. I mean what happens seems more like something that's trying to say something about the structure of the movie or to be some kind on comment on the genre than try to follow the characters....Also in the second half we have all the symbolism and the mystical and philosophical lines that all the fans love to try to connect the puzzle of the plot that it only emphasizes the point of the movie and it's more arrogant and flamboyant than helping deliver the message...It looks like these lines were made only for fans to have something to admire...<br/><br/>Somewhere near the end of the movie it hit me. I remembered Barton Fink and it all made sense. I mean in that movie the also wanted to make a critique on how a director who wrote scripts for theater descended by writing scripts for Hollywood or something like that. But in the end that symbolic critique was very superficial and it seems that it was the kind of critique that the people of the industry of Hollywood that talked about would have no problem of receiving.<br/><br/>It's the same thing with No country for old men I believe. Not only that but this movie because it tries too hard to accomplish something and to have a lot of style seems very pretentious and arrogant to me. It's good for the cocktail parties with all the Hollywood society and the cocaine and stuff but it's bad for cinema bad for art. It seems more like a structural exercise than one would make in film school than an actual movie. It seems the kind of movie that the Hollywood clique the one that's being criticized in Barton Fink would love and it did. The critiques praised it and the fans that couldn't see past the surface praised it. And I really believe it's too much fuss about nothing. They try to make a complex plot and in the same time a symbolic comment about the genre and in the same time something else....You can't do everything!!! The scale has to tip at something!!! Or it has to have some kind of balance...<br/><br/>Finally I don't know if they constructed this messed up movie in a way that everything made sense. And I'm not so interested to find out. It's like this Kinder egg that you are eager to open but once you open it you are disappointed because the toy inside is lame...<br/><br/>If I recall correctly Blood Simple was a movie in which Cohen brothers didn't try to hard. They wanted to make a crime/thriller movie and they did it. And it was good. Now they try really hard to make philosophical comments and critiques and stuff but in my opinion they are not good at it. They don't seem that smart. They seem good at making movies and I believe they should go back to just that."
"chirpyfeminist","1","3","9","27 March 2014"," Glorified snuff film hiding in plain sight
","The points this snuff film tried to demonstrate: <br/><br/>Evil triumphs at the start.<br/><br/>Your kindness will not save you from evil.<br/><br/>Men as living, active, deadly characters. Women (and other weaklings) as virgins, prey, or corpses. <br/><br/>Some men can try to fight evil man. All women, however, won't stand a chance.<br/><br/>Psychopath man has no emotion, is merciless, is an efficient killing machine.<br/><br/>Psychopath man too strong, too virile, too smart. <br/><br/>Poor us normal men, so nice, so smart, but not young or virile enough, how to fight evil.<br/><br/>Psychopath is creative and efficient in how he slaughters humans. <br/><br/>Good men always love other good men. Watch them talk, and talk.<br/><br/>Good people always think they will be spared, but they won't. Watch them cry and die. <br/><br/>The world is an evil place. Evil triumphs all the time. Really.<br/><br/>Various everyday tools can be used to cause gruesome death to people. Allow us to demonstrate in great detail.<br/><br/>Psychopath man is REALLY an efficient killing machine. <br/><br/>Psychopath REALLY treats his victims like animals, worse, objects.<br/><br/>Evil triumphs at the end.<br/><br/>Wow really?<br/><br/>Apparently mainstream media haven't reassured us of that everyday?<br/><br/>Must be pure joy to be editing the footages of this Coen snuff.<br/><br/>This movie is beyond misogyny. It is a snuff hiding in plain sight. But Hollywood daddies love it. Awards! Applause! We need more serious snuff in mainstream theaters!<br/><br/>If there is -1,000,000,000 stars, No Country For Self-pitying Sadists deserves it.<br/><br/>Poor Coen Brothers. Must have reached a crisis stage...they probably needed some TLC, psychotherapy, or good enema kits."

"spokvandoorhouse","2","3","9","25 January 2012"," I hated it. The last 1/5 of the movie went south in a hurry!
","This is one movie that I watched with eagerness after reading the IMDb score and a the quick summary. I wish to god I had read the reviews a little better. I'm not sure that would have deterred my desire to see this, but at least I could have told myself ""I warned you"" and then grabbed a fork and poked it in my eye for watching this. This could have been a great movie in my opinion. The ending was one of the worst endings to a potentially good movie that I have ever seen. I've seen a lot of bad movies and bad endings, but this garbage ending left me so pis@ed that I had wasted my time watching this. It wasn't the gore of the killer, or any of that, it was the multiple empty plots that emerged towards the end that never got wrapped up. It was the way Tommy Jones started assuming a victim role for a part that had nothing to do with him really. It was the ending where ""good and evil"" walked off set and Tommy Jones just babbled nonsense to the end credits. I really got angry when I saw the credits rolling. My lady friend, an avid movie buff, was just as angry. We looked at each other and couldn't believe what just happened. The ending was so twilight zone. For the Cohen Bros to purposely do that to paying customers is low! It wasn't even clever and the reason I'm rambling like Tommy Jones did is because 24 hours later I'm still pis@ed that I wasted that precious time of my life. I'm so glad I didn't pay to watch it in the theater."
"danroy70","3","3","9","8 January 2012"," Plot Hole
","I really thought this movie was not the worse one I have ever seen. I'd even say it was well made and was pretty intense at times. I do have several issues with many plot points in this movie.<br/><br/>First major plot hole, in the first two scenes it starts off with the sheriff talking about how he doesn't want to meet someone like Anton. Then it cuts to the retarded cop that arrests Anton, no explanation is ever given as to why he is being arrested just that Anton is being arrested. I called the cop retarded because after he hauls Anton to the jail he somehow left him in a chair a few feet right behind himself and he's the only cop in the place. Anton is 3 times bigger than him and the cop didn't even cuff Anton's hands behind his back. Of course, the insane evil person that Anton is he immediately kills the tiny officer as soon as he hangs up the phone. Major plot hole... Very sloppy writing in my opinion. Only an idiot would find that situation believable. Cops aren't that stupid and they would be 10 times more cautious of the situation in a small town with very little staff.<br/><br/>Anyways, to the next unbelievable situation in this ""Best Movie of the Year.""<br/><br/>Llewelyn Moss happens to be out hunting some animals. I feel they did a great job on the cinematography on these scenes. But here we go back to the illogical screen writing again. As you watch Llewelyn's character in these scenes you can tell he's somewhat of a smart guy, you do not pick up hunting, scouting and tracking traits/skills and still remain a complete retard.<br/><br/>Llewelyn takes a shot at one of his animal targets but only wounds it, scaring it and the rest of the herd off. So he walks closer towards where hit believes he hit his target trying to find a blood trail to start tracking his prey but finds a different blood trail leading in a different direction. He pulls out his binoculars and sees a dog limping off in a different direction. Llewelyn decides to track where the dog's blood trail originated from and finds a drug deal gone wrong.<br/><br/>It's obvious there are dead bodies, blood and shot up vehicles all over this scene of carnage. Llewelyn searches through the mess and finds a Mexican man in one of the vehicles still barely alive. The man is asking for water but Llewelyn is only interested in finding the last man standing and explains that he does not have any water to the man. Llewelyn continues to scout out the place and finds the last man, or at least a dead man that has a bag filled with a ton of money.<br/><br/>Llewelyn finds the bag with all that cash in it. In real life, if someone found the money and they had already made a conscious decision they were going to take the money they could care less if they found some guy who is half dead and thirsty for some water at the scene. Llewelyn wouldn't come back to give that guy some water.<br/><br/>But nevertheless for the sake of having some kind of storyline this plot hole from hell prevails. Llewelyn takes water back to the most likely dead man at this point and sure enough, there are some mean druggy guys at the drug scene now. The druggy folks try to shoot up Llewelyn, he luckily escapes on foot to a nearby river which was not apparent at all in the first few scenes of the area but somehow there is a large river at this point. Anyways, Llewelyn makes it down the river a bit shoots a pursuing dog and escapes.<br/><br/>Llewelyn can not be as smart as he is in the first few scenes and as stupid as he becomes later as the movie progresses. He's made it back home after these crazy events and is determined to finally get the hell out of dodge but hasn't even looked in the bag of money to check it out yet. Not even to just count how much it is. Any normal person would have counted it the very first time they were alone with the money but nope Llewelyn is the dumbest yet a very smart person. So he has no idea that there is a tracking beacon device in the bag.<br/><br/>Anton somehow gets the tracking thing to find the bag and he hunts down Llewelyn for the rest of the movie. The story continues on and more plot holes keep emerging as the script continues to fall further into ruin.<br/><br/>Zodiac (2007) The Bourne Ultimatum (2007) Gone Baby Gone (2007) There Will Be Blood (2007) Michael Clayton (2007) Into the Wild (2007) Ratatouille (2007) Shooter (2007) American Gangster (2007) Live Free or Die Hard (2007)<br/><br/>I'm sure there are some that I missed but just the movies I listed here are so much more deserving of the Best Picture Oscar in 2007 it's amazing. I can't believe No Country for old Men got Best Picture, this movie has so many plot holes and failures I can't fathom what the Acadamy board was thinking when this came out as the best picture. They must've smoked a big fatty right before they started the reels to this one. Because what I saw was a huge waste of film as it comes to a good, logical screenplay. Perhaps if you make two good films that just hit the spot you can end up writing crap for the rest of your career and people will lap it up as if they were dogs that have been stranded in the high desert for the last 2 weeks. Because the Cohen Brothers did not make anything special here, unless excrement is now the most amazing thing in the world."

I'm not talking about religion; I'm saying that if you have the normal, common sense (if there is such a thing) knowledge of what good and evil is and try to live on the good side, skip this movie.<br/><br/>If you simply must see it because of someone's rave review or gushing over how genius the Coen brothers are or just to see some admittedly superb acting (stretched over a horribly flawed plot), then go ahead, but set a timer to go off 20 minutes before the movie ends, press the Stop button, and make up the rest of the movie on your own. Whatever ending you, being a good person, create, will be better than what was filmed.<br/><br/>If you love this movie *in its entirety* for it's depth and insight into the world we live in, I urge you to search within yourself, look in a mirror, and start speaking the truth. Your life will be better for discovering the discord that allows you to enjoy this movie's ending.<br/><br/>The insight the Coens attempt to show in this film is misinformed.

However. Leone's and Boetticher's movies are satisfying.<br/><br/>The Coens must have wondered: by deleting certain scenes, can we attain mystery, suspense... depth? I think that they succeeded --for some viewers-- because the movie did win best picture Oscar.<br/><br/>I would rather see a movie that is very good than one that pretends to be great. <br/><br/>I give it 6 stars mostly for Javier Bardem.

","Fantastic movie. What won me over was Anton Chaigar, the psychopath. He was a different combination of emotions that blended together perfectly. He shows no humor and keeps the same facile expressions throughout the movie. What I thought was funny was that seeing a white guy in black clothes and a funny haircut ( his haircut is awesome ) walking around in Texas. Anton also seems to have been in the business of killing for a long time. He thinks on his feet and is very good at improvising for supplies he needs ( When he makes the car into a bomb for a distraction and gets the supplies he needs to help his shotgun wound in his leg ). Anton also has the latest in everyday killing, tracking, and entering tools in the time period. Silenced shotgun, cattle killing device for punching though locks, and his transmitter for finding the bag of money ( until Luellen takes it out of the bag in the second hotel he goes to). One finally thing is Anton believes in fate so he doesn't make the calls the coins he flips does, so your life could be in the hands of a quarter. One of the scariest killer/villains ever in movie history."
"DarthVoorhees","10","3","9","23 March 2008"," Bold and Brutal
","No Country for Old Men reminded me why I should continue to invest great faith in the Coen Brothers. It seemed that after the mediocre O Brother Where Art Thou their career seemed to be on a downward spiral with silly comedies but No Country for Old Men is their best film on their resume. It's a piece of art in the sense that it is so realistic and it doesn't try to tell a stylized version of something.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem gives one of the best performances in recent years as Anton Chigarh, a killer who is tracking down a man named Moss who stole 2 million dollars in drug money from a crime scene. Chigarh isn't like other villains who carry emotional depth or who give long monologues, he kills because it's his job and because it's easier to solve problems by just killing the opposing party. His character is a simple villain with not much background and that is why he is so scary. Bardem won a much deserved Oscar because even though he doesn't change his facial expression once in the entire movie and his methods are not explained he shows us this dark and twisted soul. He brutally murders people without any hesitation or second guessing. This character is the force of nature that propels this story.<br/><br/>The important piece to the message of No Country for Old Men is that it is brutal and realistic. Bardem deserves all the praise in the world for this character. It's very refreshing to see a film that doesn't glorify villains and shows that sometimes their is no emotion or soul in killers without having to give speeches about the villain or overshadow the deeds with music or lighting. No Country for Old Men is a very plain and gritty looking film, shot very similar to a documentary, the actors tell the story here, not the editing room.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin gives an outstanding performance as Moss, the hunter who takes a chance in picking up the briefcase. He doesn't think twice and runs away with the cash even though he knows it came from an illegal drug deal. He realizes that he will be hunted and he is willing to fight to the death. He is naive though and doesn't know what he is facing. Moss is the everyday blue collar guy who is brought into hell. All though we know he is greedy we can't help but feel for him and we want him to escape Chigarh because we see ourselves in his shoes. <br/><br/>Tommy Lee Jones is the third piece of this cast. He is a sheriff who is tired of this job. Seeing the rampage Chigrah has caused throws him over the deep end. He holds onto some morals and that is what causes him to hate police work. This character doesn't really matter much to the plot but he help empathizes the evil people like Chigrah that are in the world.<br/><br/>The old thriller is still alive here, the Coens generate a great deal of suspense and keep you on the edge of your seat. The visuals along with the superb acting keep you engaged in this thriller.<br/><br/>No Country for Old Men is one of the best films in recent years. Out of the pool of great films in 2007, I'm glad that this one received the most attention."
"michael-donnelly","6","3","9","13 March 2008"," Not Deserving of the Academy Award
","Don't get me wrong, this was a good movie but it certainly wasn't a great movie. Of the best picture nominees this year, I have seen 2: Juno and No Country For Old Men. Of these two Juno was the much superior film. Like most Coen Brother movies (IMHO) this one fails to live up hype. As for the movie itself, it's starts out promising: A drug deal gone wrong, a local finding the money, and a psychopath chasing after him to recover it. Throw in a veteran sheriff on the trail of both and you got yourself a good storyline for a chase movie. But as the movie progresses, there is little character development. I never felt I really got to know or understand any of the characters. You have three main characters with no real on screen interaction, and then the movie just seems to end. You don't even get to see when the main character is murdered by another random group of people hunting him. The bad guy is never caught, just walks away from and accident. And the sheriff just retires."

But I DO want the Coen Bros to pay me $200; the minimum SAG rate (hourly) for the time I wasted watching this piece of trash.<br/><br/>Yo, Coen Bros this ain't no 'Drugstore Cowboy'. It's a piece of JUNK.<br/><br/>It rivals only 'Into the Wild' as one if the worst movies ever. If they could have combined the END of 'Into the Wild' with the 1st hour and a half of NCFOM together it might have made a REAL movie! <br/><br/>Yeah, yeah it'the Coens artistic mastery that lets this POS slide into oblivion in the last 45 minutes. What a horrible WASTE of two hours of my life this sad excuse of a movie was.<br/><br/>Artistic license or not... entertain me dammit. That is why I pay for movies. You kept me entertained for over an hour.... why drop the ball.<br/><br/>Don't give me some R/L line of BULL ... If I wanted 'REAL' life, I wouldn't be watching your stupid movie!"
"The_Void","8","3","9","28 February 2008"," Absolutely great for the first two thirds.
","The Coens definitely have made some of the best movies of the past two decades; I won't profess to be among their biggest fans, but it's hard to deny the likes of Fargo, Miller's Crossing and The Big Lebowski. After a dip in the form over the last few years, this film became hotly anticipated; often being touted as a 'return to form' for the Coen Brothers. Well, it is definitely a return to form and undoubtedly their best film so far this decade - but I do have to say that I'm somewhat surprised at all the praise this film has gotten. The film is based on a novel by Cormac McCarthy and focuses on Llewelyn Moss, a man who is lucky enough to stumble onto a drug deal gone wrong after following a wounded animal. He soon discovers a case containing $2 million left at the scene and does what any man would do; takes the case without reporting the crime. However, he is discovered by the sadistic and psychopathic Anton Chigurh who tracks him down by any means necessary; and he has no qualms about mercilessly murdering everyone who gets in, or around, his way.<br/><br/>The tone of the film is very relaxed and this bodes well with the Southern setting. It's also a stark to contrast to the bulk of the plot; at its heart, No Country for Old Men is a chase movie and the Coens somehow managed to make the film relaxed and tense at the same time. Almost every supposed great film has some sort of point to make, and while this film does touch on a few; it's never very focused and to be honest left me wondering why they didn't discard any muted 'points' and stick with the thriller elements. The cast is great; it's really good to see a film that puts gritty looking actors in the leading roles and every performance is perfect - Javier Bardem is particularly great as the psychopathic killer. The film is really great for the first two thirds; the chase is thrilling, the characters are interesting and the dialogue will keep any viewer glued to the screen - but then the film takes a shocking twist and it really all goes downhill. I do like a good twist, and perhaps this one worked well in the book; but it certainly doesn't on the screen. It's a real shame too as everything about the film is working brilliantly right up until this point. Overall, this is certainly a good film; it's very well made and interesting...just a shame about the ending."
"schism101","10","3","9","19 February 2008"," Coen Brother's back on top form.
","It's only the 2nd month of the year and already we have a film that can be assured of it's entry into the 'best films of the year' list that many critics will be marking up come the December of this year. NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is a great return to form for the Coen brothers after there recent and disappointing attempts at screwball comedy and remakes, UNTOLERABLE CRUELTY and THE LADYKILLERS respectively, and a superb masterful thriller. When hunter Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) stumbles upon a bunch of corpses and a case of money containing $2m dollars which he subsequently takes, in the middle of the unforgiving Texas heartland, he enters into an unfortunate and harsh set of circumstances that sees him on the run from a shadowy and almost unstoppable hit-man Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem). At the same time closely followed on there trail is Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones, a world weary and wise lawmen on the verge of retirement, who is hoping to find Moss before those that want the money find him first. The Coen's steady and smooth direction provide scenes of intensity and scenes carried along by the actions of the characters on-screen, as there are many scenes not featuring any soundtrack at all, only natural sounds. The characters are superbly played, Lee Jones, is excellent in his role as Bell, his face reads of weariness with the world and at a loss to understand the ruthlessness of today's criminals. Brolin is excellent as Moss, the luckless anti-hero, a decent guy who has made the wrong choice and has to go on the run, and finally Bardem is simply the personification of unstoppable evil, as Chigurh, along with the offbeat deliberate Coen influenced bad haircut, he cuts through the American heartland, with his weapon of choice (an airgun used to kill cattle, killing anyone who crosses his path and offering them a chance to avoid fate by calling heads or tales on a coin toss (the scene in the gas station where Chigurh makes the owner call heads or tails, is brilliantly written). Overall its a superb return to form for the Coen brother's and has much in common with there previous films FARGO and BLOOD SIMPLE, and also reminded me of the hard boiled thrillers of the 70's such as THE GETAWAY and CHARLEY VARRICK, which in similar terms to NO COUNTRY...used the desert landscape as a sort of modern day western setting. Also Roger Deakin's excellent cinematography perfectly captures the mood and intensity of the landscape and deserves any awards it receives. Overall an amazing and unmissable film."
"jimequity99","10","3","9","18 February 2008"," One of The Best Films Ever
","Please do not go to see this movie just because it is nominated for Best Picture. I am an unabashed Coen Bros. fan, and went to see this film waiting to be awed, and I was. This film is not for you if you want the ending wrapped up in a neat, tidy package- it won't be. The ending is as it was told to you by three of the main characters at different points, listening to the dialouge is a lost appreciation possibly by the loud one-liners from various action flicks which stick with you. In NCFOM, the dialouge is gold. From Bartem to Woody Harrelson, who in 10 minutes of screen time, probably gives his best performance ever- this movie is a can't miss for true movie fans, and especially Coen Bros fans. This is destined to become one of the top 10 American Films of all time."
"Gibbs52","7","3","9","2 February 2008"," Over-rated big time
","I am a tough critic. This movie was not only exciting, but also very well acted by all. As good as Bardem was the nomination for best supporting actor should have gone to Josh Brolin who I have never seen even close to this good. I love the Coen brothers as Fargo was one of the best movies I ever saw. I realize that ""No Country"" was not dark humor and the end didn't bother me that much either. I love movies that just end. Thats what happens sometimes. Good guys don't always win and bad guys don't get away often but let me tell you what really bugged me about this movie. Instead of all the dragging out it could have been sped up enough to get more out of Woody Harrelson's character and Josh Brolin never should have died at that point of the movie. He was too determined to beat this bad guy. Bardem reminded me of the man with no name in those Eastwood flicks. Was he a ghost? I realized what was going on (like I know Bardem killed the wife because they were the rules). I thought Tommy Lee Jones was better in this than ""In the land of Elah"" for which he was nominated.I could have written a much better second half for this movie but of course anyone can say that. I refuse to use the clichÃ©,(hint B.L.) so I will instead state my reason why this is not a movie that should have gotten a best picture nomination. It just wasn't that good. I was never on the edge of my seat, Bardem didn't scare me and Woody Harrelson didn't even get a chance to show his stuff. The scenery was beautiful as scenery goes and their were little things I liked such as Bardem's weapon. I saw Juno last night and although I enjoyed that it didn't do much for me either. With the exception of Ellen Page who stands a great shot at best actress. Michael Clayton was good and Tom Wilkinson is a shoe in for best supporting actor. I still need to see ""There will be blood"" and ""Atonement"" before I decide what I think was best. By the way,how the heck did Zodiac get snubbed. Robert Downey Jr should be up for best supporting actor and the movie itself should have got a best picture nomination. OK I am through No wait Adam Sandler was so good in :Reign over me"" he should have been nominated for best actor. I mean it. He was great in that movie. OK I have said my piece, thanks for anyone who bothers to read this. Gibbs"

","This movie tells a tale of hunter and hunted that slowly tightens the screws and propels itself in a dream-like calm that feels simply ""matter of fact."" I never wanted these scenes to end...like lingering flashes of nightmares that I cannot get out of my mind. Roger Deakins' amazing cinematography adds such detail to their impact. This elegant tale of morality and aging is worthy of multiple viewings to unwrap the layers. I plan to go again as soon as I can. I am grateful for all the nuances and the ""unfinished"" ending. I left the theater in a Fargo-like state of mind. The brothers have entranced again. I think that this work will stand the test of time as one of their best works. Thanks for the strange trip, men, sirs."
"harrisonh1","10","3","9","15 December 2007"," What's the most you've ever lost on a coin toss?
","No Country for Old Men is possibly the most interesting, intense, and discussion worthy movie of the year. I can guarantee that everyone who sees this movie will be talking about it for the entire way home. There are so many elements of the movie that are up for interpretation and speculation that a definitive answer as to what it all really means will likely never be reached.<br/><br/>This film is a brilliant mix of storytelling, violence, and, most of all, suspense. Spectacular performances are given by the entire cast, but most notably Josh Brolin, Woody Harrelson, Tommy Lee Jones, and the menacingly dark Javier Bardem. I just cannot stress enough how great Bardem is in this movie. He makes his character, Anton Chigurh, the creepiest guy you can ever hope to see.<br/><br/>No Country for Old Men follows the story of Llewelyn Moss (Brolin), a man who stumbles upon a murder scene and two million dollars in drug money, a sheriff (Jones) trying to find his purpose in life, and a bounty hunter (Bardem) doing what he does best. It may seem like Brolin's character is the hero in this movie, but the story really toys with your perception of good and evil.<br/><br/>It's not likely that No Country's soundtrack will be winning any Oscars or Grammies any time soon, but it's one of my favorite elements of the film. There is no music to be spoken of. It is dead silent. The natural noises of every scene are all that you will hear. The silence helps to build tension and intensity in just about every scene. While most movies are absolutely silent only right before something major or unexpected is about to happen, this movie gives the viewer that feeling throughout.<br/><br/>There is no question that No Country for Old Men is one of the best movies of 2007, but I think that it will quickly take its rightful place as a cinema classic. The Coen Brothers will likely be taking home their first Oscars since Fargo come February. Although I can certainly see how some people will leave the theater disliking this movie, due to its intense and stylized nature, I think that it is essential viewing for any movie lover. Besides, who knew that so much could hang in the balance of a coin toss?"

I thought it was a pit bull, but it seemed too big. I am just glad it isn't after me. Thought my rottweiler was scary looking until I saw them. Tommy Lee Jones, is as usual a joy to watch. Barry Corbin also gives a great short performances. At first I didn't even realize it was him. Once he spoke, of course I knew whom it was. He once again brings a supporting role to a level few can achieve. The first film I ever saw him in was "" Urban Cowboy"". Ever since my family has referred to him as ""Uncle Bob"". I have always like Woody. It's ironic he plays killers. His father is sitting in prison for murder."

","I've just seen this film last week when I went to North America. Then, I couldn't believe my eyes, I had heard about the film so much and the expectations were high; however is far, far away from whatever you can hear about it. This is not just a film, is a whole experience which catches you up from the beginning until the end. I can't deny the ending is a little bit confusing for most of the people, nevertheless it's a very smart part of the movie which really makes you think, not only accept what you've seen. Every acting performance is great, everyone in this film is brilliant... Bardem plays a villain who will be remembered through the years, and Brolin is also outstanding as a man who made a big mistake and then try to get away. McDonald brings the light to such dark film, and her role's final scene is a cardinal point to interpret the film by yourself. Lee Jones also shows up with not much screen time, but it's enough to become a key character in all the running time. And what to say about the astonishing cinematography by Roger Deakins... and the score so hallucinating? And of course, in the other hand is the direction: perfect execution by the Coen brothers who make a big comeback with the most intelligent and worthy film of the decade so far, making a wonderful and unbelievable work based on McCarthy's novel. !It's just a masterpiece... there's nothing else to say!"
"loco_73","Null","3","9","3 December 2007"," Is Evil good?!?!?
","Bleakness, hopelessness and profound despair where the salient characteristics of this movie. It was, to say the least, a disturbing experience watching this film. It is also one of the best movies in recent years, one that once again reiterates how important the Cohen brothers are to movie-making, especially in a time when the medium is drowning in mediocrity and banality. <br/><br/>There is a stark and barren beauty to this movie, which is brutal, shocking and jarring at times. There is absolutely no redemption in it, and hardly any sympathetic characters. The only one, who is tired and weary, and trying to preserve some shred of humanity in a world gone crazy, is Tommy Lee Jones but he fails just as one of his friends in the movie says ""You can't stop what's coming..."". <br/><br/>Well what's coming is the walking, talking, breathing embodiment of evil in the form of Javier Bardem. To say that Bardem has created one of the most memorable ""bad guys"" in movies, is an understatement. I simply have no words to describe what this man brings to the screen. Basically a guy who is what he is, accepts it and goes about his business because that's what he does, not because that is what it is expected from him. Javier Bardem's character, Anton Chigurh, is not trying to be menacing, or to be evil, remorseless, psychopathic, that's what he is, and he makes no apologies. There is no philosophy behind it, no explanation, he just is... The only other characters that come to mind in comparison are Ian McShane's amazing portrayal of ""Al Swerengen"" from the extraordinary ""Deadwood"" and Kevin Spacey's ""Keyser Soyze"" from ""The Usual Suspects"". I'll be hard pressed to think of a better performance, acting wise, this year, with the exception of Russel Crowe and Denzel Washington in ""American Gangster"". This guy is unbelievable, ever since I saw him in ""Jamon, Jamon"", ""Carne Tremula/Live Flesh"", ""Las Bolas De Oro/Golden Balls"", ""Before Night Falls"", ""El Mar Adentro/The Sea Inside"" he has proved to be one of the top actors world wide. This role is just a further confirmation of his talent and range. Come awards season if he doesn't win anything, it will just confirm that awards suck and cannot measure ability of any kind. <br/><br/>***SPOILERS*** <br/><br/>Evil wins in this movie, period, and all that stand in the way die, with one exception Tommy Lee Jones, who just capitulates and gets out of the way. I think that that is what has given such a drab and dreary tone to the movie, that lack of hope and the senselessness of it all. I also think that the movie deliberately avoids too much tension and nervousness, but instead presents this chilling, matter-of-fact atmosphere that takes away that perverted pleasure to revel in the bloody and gory outcomes, unlike for example in the movie ""300"" where the blood and gore are amped up and actually become disturbingly fascinating, effective and well executed. ""No Country For Old Men"" is the complete opposite and puts a different spin on the nature of evil and violence. <br/><br/>***End of SPOILERS*** <br/><br/>The cast is very good, Woody Harelson is good and provides perhaps the few moments of comic relief, if such a thing is even possible in this movie, and Josh Brolin continues to impress with his acting abilities, he can also be seen in ""American Gangster"". Tommy Lee Jones is finally back in form and has exalted his career once again, after a few years of floundering. ""The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada"", and this year ""In The Valley of Ellah"" and now this movie, the man has racked up a lot of impressive performances. His role in ""No Country For Old Men"" is way better than the one in ""The Fugitive"", and I'll be damned if he doesn't deserve his just deserts. <br/><br/>The Cohen brothers have once again delivered in spades, and I personally think that this movie is better than ""Fargo"", and at least as good as ""Miller's Crossing"". I don't want to get into the technical details of the movie, but the cinematography is beautiful and rightly captures the spirit of the movie. <br/><br/>I have not read the novel, but I would venture to guess that this big-screen adaptation is more than a decent one. A movie I'll not soon forget."
"howard.schumann","10","3","9","1 December 2007"," A powerful and uncompromising film
","No Country for Old Men, the Coen brothers' brilliant adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's bloody lament for a vanished America, hits the ground running. A prisoner, Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), turns himself into the police then strangles a Sheriff's deputy with the chain of his handcuffs and escapes. Stealing a police car, he pulls over a driver and murders him with a device used for slaughtering cattle. In the author's words, ""He placed his hand on the man's head like a faith healer, the pneumatic hiss and click of the plunger sounded like a door closing."" That is only the beginning of the myriad violent deaths in this dark and brutal saga that is without any sympathetic characters, just the hunter and the hunted, each, however, with a kind of integrity that hints at redemption beyond the apocalypse.<br/><br/>Set along the Texas-Mexico border in 1980, Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), a welder and Vietnam veteran hunting antelope near the Rio Grande stumbles upon dead bodies and abandoned vehicles, the result of a drug deal gone badly. Fully aware of the risks but with the clarity of John Grady Cole, Moss takes a suitcase filled with two million dollars and heads out in his truck. Thinking about a dying man's request for water, Moss returns to the scene, however. It is not long before he is discovered, shot at, and forced on the run for the remainder of the film. Pursued by Chigurh and the men who want their money back, the film becomes a tense chase thriller with an uncertain outcome.<br/><br/>To add to the closing net, Moss is also tracked by a discouraged sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) and Carson Wells, a hired representative from the drug cartel (Woody Harrelson). As he tries to escape, he must also protect his wife Carla Jean (Kelly Macdonald) from threats from the sadistic killer who kills because it is there. ""I'm not sure why I did this"", Chigurh says, ""but I think I wanted to see if I could extricate myself by an act of will. Because I believe that one can. That such a thing is possible."" He considers himself the representative of fate. ""Every moment in your life is a turning and every one a choosing. Somewhere you made a choice. All followed to this. The accounting is scrupulous. The shape is drawn. No line can be erased."" <br/><br/>In a film in which all the performances are universally excellent, Bardem stands out as the screen's most implacable villain in many years, conveying an unrelenting sense of menace even though we never get beneath the surface of his character. As he struggles against what the film calls ""the dismal tide"", the reflective Sheriff Bell can only ask in Jones' twangy voice, ""Who the hell are these people?"" His granddaddy only had to deal with cattle rustlers but now there are drug dealers to whom casual killing is a way of life. He says, ""I ain't sure we've seen these people before. Their kind."" Bell is not a pessimist. He is simply exhausted and feels powerless.<br/><br/>""I don't know hat to do about em even"", he ruminates. ""If you killed em all they'd have to build an annex on to hell"". Relentless in its heartbreaking sadness, No Country for Old Men is a powerful and uncompromising film, a lament for what America has lost and an outcry against what it has become, a society inured to violence where murder and rape is a coin toss and war is an event that is woven into the fabric of our life."

","The Cohen Brothers have made probably the best movie ever. From the killing to the humor makes this the best film of this decade. The acting, writing and the direction is just spectacular and should get many Oscar and many other awards. First for any good movie it starts with the writing and it is just brilliant and yes there is humor but it is used the right amount and the right timing also it has very good lines and are as good as movies like Fight Club and Pirates of the Caribbean. Then the direction is just superb and the Cohen just absolutely shine with there skill in this film. The film looks very original and has it's own style to it. The acting is just amazing and is the best I have ever seen for long time and defiantly up for many awards. Javier Bardem gives the best performance of the year and my personnel favorite. Anton Chigurh is the best bad guy and is just terrifying and shocking to watch him do his job and his hobby. Josh Brolin who is already having a great year with already two other great films out(Grindhouse & American gangster) completely blows me away with hi performance. Kelly Macdonald who I have never really heard about until I heard about this movie does probably the best female role of the year so far and I hope she gets Oscar nom and be very happy if she gets the Oscar. Woody Harrelson is a actor I have always like and now after this movie I highly respect him and will probably not get any notice or any awards which I think he highly deserves. Tommy Lee Jones in his best movie and best performance will probably get the Oscar since its like the role kinda came with an Oscar and I wouldn't mind him winning it but I would like the other actors to win. This film has no soundtrack or any type of music and I didn't not notice this for the entire and it caught me be surprise and if the Cohen Brothers can make a movie with this much suspense is a massive achievement. OK I have heard that the ending was bad and I just kept hearing that and was worried about the ending. trust me the ending is actually good and before you say that the ending makes no sense and was bad take your opinion of what the ending is and read what the other people think and come to your judgment and then talk about it on the this website. This film To me this is kept me nailed to my seat and didn't even think about going to the bathroom or even get refills cause I needed to know what happen next. To me this is the best film of the year and all time this is the next godfather and the best film of the decade and most likely become a classic."

Everyone acts as if they're on a heavy dose of Ambien and have little to no personality to speak of. This makes it hard for me to care about anything happening to them. The only exception to this is Llewelyn's wife who actually shows emotion. Anton is exceptionally boring. Pretty crazy that all you have to do to win an acting Oscar is talk monotonously and rarely show any facial expressions. The guy hardly said anything the entire movie. There are a few glaring issues with some of the plot points in this movie. Llewelyn finds the money and gets away only to come back later to bring a dehydrated man some water. Why not call the police and let them know what happened if you're concerned about the guy? They'll give him medical care, and you won't put yourself in harm's way. This plot contrivance only served the purpose to have Anton find Llewelyn's truck and find out who he's looking for. The rest of the movie is a very boring cat and mouse chase. After a bunch of emotionless boring ""chasing"" with one brief shooting scene, the main character unceremoniously dies off camera. Nobody ever finds the satchel full of money and Anton gets away. YAWN. <br/><br/>Boring characters and a boring plot. Only good thing about this was the cinematography and the acting was pretty good I guess too despite how incredibly bored everyone acted. No idea why people liked this movie so much. Next time I'm having a hard time sleeping I'll put this movie on."
"leftbanker-1","8","2","5","31 December 2013"," Flawed but Fun
","I had read No Country for Old Men in Spanish a couple of years ago and although I liked it very much I found the story to be unconvincing in many places. I read it again this morning in one sitting, this time in English after watching the movie last week. The book and the movie are both brilliant but I was left with the same problems in the story line. Had I been asked to advise the Coen brothers I would have told them to end the movie with the scene when Chirugh returns the money to whomever he was working for (a scene left out of the film).<br/><br/>Some of the major events that compelled the plot just didn't make much sense. First of all, there is just no way in hell that the protagonist would have returned to the scene of the drug deal massacre just to give a man—probably dead by now—a drink of water. And why, when he kept getting found in hotels, did he keep staying in hotels? Was he afraid to camp out for a bit? If the character had a lick of sense at all this detail was left out of the book and the movie. He made one mistake after another until he ran out of mistakes.<br/><br/>I think that McCarthy is a terrific writer and his conversations in this short book prove this over and over. I don't think it would kill him to use a bit more punctuation but that's just how he wants to write so what can we do? I suppose his style works but sometimes he sacrifices clarity for style. The main purpose of grammar and punctuation is clarity.<br/><br/>I think that one of the things that I like best about the book is the idea of someone having to disappear. It's a fun thing to consider, at least for me. I remember ten years ago, maybe more, a guy who worked for an armored car company made off with one of the trucks and something like $20 million in cash. He got away clean, at least at first. Months later, pretty much after the police had given up, he was captured by Wells Fargo agents who were tracking him for the company he had worked for. The guy had put a gun on his partner and tied him up. He transferred the cash to a van which he drove from Florida to (I believe it was) South Carolina. He ditched most of the cash in a self-storage unit, drove to the border, and crossed into Mexico.<br/><br/>The problem was it was a one man job and he had no way to access the money other than return to the States and get it himself. I don't think he liked it in Mexico much because he shouldn't have even needed money so soon after the robbery. Had he stayed away a bit longer he probably could have seriously reduced his chances of capture upon returning for more money. I doubt that the people whose money he took would give up on him, not after stealing that much, but after a while their passion for the crime would diminish. Anyway, he made out better than the character in No Country for Old Men.<br/><br/>I've dabbled enough in crime fiction and movies to know that an important thing is to stay disappeared directly after the crime. The last thing you want to do is exactly what Lewellyn did in the book which was to drive back to the scene of the crime. How stupid would you have to be to leave your vehicle near the scene? It's easy to track the owner of a vehicle and it's even easier to see it out in the middle of the desert. I just think that McCarthy could have found a better plot device for Lewellyn getting found out by the thugs than his own stupidity. I suppose I understand the author's motivations, I just don't agree with them.<br/><br/>So in review, if you are being pursued by pitiless psychopaths, don't leave behind anything that leads directly back to you—like your truck , you idiot. And you definitely want to stay away from hotels if you are on the run. Most of them these days require identification and perhaps a credit card. You may as well ask to sleep in the city jail.<br/><br/>Lewellyn took over $2 million from the drug dealers which can buy you a lot of options. Of course, you can't travel by air unless you want your name showing up, ditto with renting a car or using any vehicle remotely traceable back to you. In No Country for Old Men he didn't plan on taking the money, he just happened on it by chance. This means he had no time to make a plan and little time to dream one up as events occurred. He should have stayed with his wife as there wasn't much advantage in splitting up and possibly double the risk."

","I personally love,and absolutely adore every single Coen's movie,but this was a total disappointment! The story is a complete ""deja vu"" although the actors are great.What i didn't like about this movie is the slow motion of every single scene.Nothing special,no music to make the adrenalin pumping,no hard words or if may,no words at all.The beginning and the end were the one and only moments where something good something meaningful was said.Many unnecessary characters were introduced and that made this movie seem insignificant.I would be more pleased if ""Burn after reading "" won an Oscar-that movie was great! Since I know Coen's style i figured that although this movie is boring the ending will be worth seeing.And Tommy Lee Jones didn't make that happen.The cast was great the idea was good,the directors were incredible...but this movie lacked purpose and magic.if you ask for thrill this is not the movie for you.I don't mind saying,it was also very predictable...and the characters were not completely formed.Not worthy an Oscar!"

","Saw this yesterday on a Sky channel. What with Christmas etc., not much to watch on television. I knew nothing about it except it was well-known and by the Coen brothers - whose Burn after Reading I thought the most amusing film in years. At first all went well, but as matters progressed I found that the heavy Texas accent and mumbled speech were almost completely incomprehensible - although I got the picture anyway. It did however become more and more annoying. I am an interpreter and well used to understanding English (and variants) spoken in many different accents. This was too much! Of course, it didn't really matter what anybody said (was this one of the messages of the film?), since it was entirely predictable...apart from the little scene where the garage owner must make a call on a coin - the subsequent dialogue showed that someone has been reading their Beckett (top of the class!!). All quite tedious - though I must confess to having watched to the ponderous end - where the sheriff tells his girlfriend his entirely dreary dream about his father. One of the most interesting points was how they got a shirt that perfectly matched the colour of her very unusual blue eyes!!"

","No Country For Old Men has garnered a great deal of praise for its pseudo-philosophical musings and contemplations, but what purpose does it truly serve? <br/><br/>People who fault the film are derided for 'not understanding' its deeper meanings, and it is assumed they dislike it because of its lack of adherence to supposed Hollywood cliché. On the other hand, I would suggest that perhaps this form of movie is becoming as much a cliché as any other, struggling almost too hard to buck tradition and stereotype. <br/><br/>Films that explain everything are (often justifiably) criticised for never leaving any questions, yet like anything in life, it is perhaps best to find a happy medium. The greatest films leave us questioning and thinking, but they are also about something, and say something. They are films that point us in a general direction, that we can then narrow down in focus to interpret in our own fashion as individuals. Yet what happens when the film doesn't even point us in a general direction? When it is so aimless that it can be interpreted in any way, or not at all, in equal measure? A film that tries so hard to avoid saying anything at all, is as vapid and empty as the thing that leaves no room to question. <br/><br/>NCFOM is so open to multiple interpretations of practically every element, that it becomes an empty shell of a film. Those who wish to, can read absolutely anything they want into it. Unfortunately, in the style of the Emperor's New Clothes, those who choose to question its lack of substance are quickly hushed and told in condescending fashion that they do not understand this 'deep and meaningful' experience.<br/><br/>There is little point going into the possible interpretations and meanings in this review, as they are so open and varied. It is like a blank piece of paper, upon which we are told to draw a line from a to b. We could draw it anywhere in whatever way we wished. It provides freedom, but since we are not attempting to create our own work of art with the line, but interpret that of somebody else, it becomes an ultimately futile and most importantly, pointless exercise.<br/><br/>It is an expertly crafted movie, and from a visual standpoint, often a pleasure to watch. The acting from the leads is rarely (if ever) less than good, and often excellent. Beyond that, take from it what you will. Some of you will look at the deep, dark, bottomless hole and see a near endless myriad of images and meanings. Others will pick up the piece of paper with the hole drawn on it, and say that it is only an illustration of a bottomless hole, and really contains nothing but a fine drawing."
"LeroyBrown-2","4","2","5","15 January 2009"," Compared to 'Blood Simple' and 'Fargo', a major disappointment.
","The first Coen brothers movie I ever saw was 'Blood Simple', I thought it was one of the best movie of that year and one of the finest crime drama I ever saw. When I saw 'Fargo I thought it was brilliant, it was clever and entertaining. Comparing it to 'The English Patient', which beat it for best picture Oscar, I thought that the Coen Brothers were robbed. Now with all the praise being heaped at ""No Country For Old Men"", I was expecting a lot. Unfortunately what I saw was a film that pales in comparison to the previous two films. I have not seen any of the competition but if this IS the best film I have to say what a disappointing year.<br/><br/>My main problem with this movie is that it moved too slow. A lot of times a scene lingers before the payoff. We see the character of Chigurh prolonging a scene before the inevitable and since we know he's a ruthless killer we know what he's going to do. It also take a long time before the main plot line gets rolling or at least it felt like a long time. Some of the scenes with Tommy Lee Jones as the sheriff also just feels so painfully slow. Making Tommy Lee Jones seem boring takes a lot of shall we say wrongly applied effort. <br/><br/>The main plot line of the movie involves found money, a drug deal gone wrong, a ruthless assassin. and the cops trying to solve things. I don't need to say anything else about the plot because it's pretty easy to figure out. We know what Chigurh was after but we don't know how he got involved in the first place did he set the drug dealers up? There are numerous plot holes that opens up a lot question but does not answer them.<br/><br/>I don't know why the Coen brothers set the movie in 1980, I suppose that's when it was set in the novel but it certainly has a faded look to it and at times even painful on the eyes. The movie has virtually no music. I have said that in my comments on ""Cache"" and ""Abre los Ojos"", that the lack of music in thrillers is refreshing. However in this movie the lack of music is deafening. It doesn't work this time.<br/><br/>The acting is very good. Javier Bardem, who plays Chigur, is very scary. He plays it like a human terminator. Very emotionless, he doesn't flinch, he doesn't blink, and he doesn't take no for an answer. Although I have said that Tommy Lee Jones was dull at times I have to say that he was good at playing his character. Josh Brolin who was at the center of the action finally is beginning to convince me that he has a future in the big screen something that eluded his dad.<br/><br/>Overall It's a movie with a plot that's easy to comprehend, but just plods along in certain areas and have many situation that was unanswered."
"galensaysyes","6","2","5","31 October 2008"," Cool and smart, but not in a good way
","Cool and smart, but not in a good way<br/><br/>The setting, or range of settings, in No Country for Old Men--the chilly, dry, silent southwestern desert--is wonderfully chosen and perfectly photographed. I'd always wanted to see it used in a movie, and pictured in just this way. I'd found it in fiction occasionally, e.g. in the Lew Archer novels, but not on film, that I can remember. And the story of this movie suits it: a story about a crook, a semi-crook, and a lawman driving across the miles of highways and desertscapes in pursuit of one another. I also can't remember another movie that points up the amount of long and tedious driving it takes to follow somebody.<br/><br/>But with all that, the feeling of the place is missed. The vast spaces are shown, but not how they strike the eye if you're staring across them; the light is caught exactly, but not how it hits the eye if you're using it to see by. The soul-replenishing, or soul-eroding, atmosphere--the chill, the dryness you feel in your throat, the lonely silences--never comes across on film. It's a place where you can hear your own breath, hear the motor of a distant car, see its headlights on the horizon, and wonder uneasily what it's doing out on the road at that time of night; a figure distantly silhouetted against that background takes on a crisp-edged ominousness. This movie pictures the figures, the edges, and the background, but doesn't convey the threat: not even when a murderer is looming up behind an unsuspecting victim.<br/><br/>Why not? <br/><br/>I think, for one reason, because the people in this movie, and the tools of harm they carry with them, have a way of arranging themselves into formal, academic compositions. The men move, rather than being moved; deliberately and without urgency, and with no deep-felt needs driving them: even a greedy man willing to be shot for some hidden money, even a man who has been shot and is begging for water. The movie is more conscious of its own wishes than those of its characters. <br/><br/>Indeed, I'd say self-consciousness is its most distinguishing quality. A writer on writing once advised that if a sentence seems unusually good to the author, he should remove it, because it's sure to be too clever and to call undue attention to itself. The same is true of movie-making. The characters in this movie are so busy moving into the right configuration for the shots that they never have a chance to stretch their legs; the movie is so busy being like a movie that it never has a chance to be born. Like several other recent Best Picture winners and nominees, it's an exercise to please the filmmakers more than a performance to entertain an audience.<br/><br/>I had trouble following it. I kept losing the thread, was never sure how the characters found the people they were looking for. Either that was not explained, or it was simply not interesting enough: not only because the characters' actions had no driving force behind them (in addition to being carried out at one-third the speed that might have held the attention) but also because the characters themselves--the main ones, at least--were blanks.<br/><br/>In this respect the movie reminded me of Wim Wenders's road pictures, where the subsidiary characters (usually women) whom the heroes meet and discard along the way are invariably more lively than the heroes themselves. The people in this movie who piqued my interest were the nobodies, such as the owner of the gas station and the manager of the trailer park. I'd rather have stayed with them, and watched them puttering around in their offices doing nothing in particular, than returned to the main action, because those people had lives, they were about something--something trivial, perhaps, but something. The men at the center of the movie seemed to be about nothing, even when killing or keeping from being killed. To me they were ciphers.<br/><br/>So the movie reminded me of something else as well: the presidential contest that followed shortly after, if it wasn't going on at the time. Here was contest between two men both of whose identities were mysterious; I had some idea of where they'd come from, but no idea where they were going: just like the men in this movie. And most observers didn't seem concerned to ask; seemed content to leave them to it and continue to observe, dispassionately and at a distance: just like the movie makers. So maybe they're on to a real trend in our society, after all. <br/><br/>The one movie of theirs I've liked was O Brother Where Art Thou? In that I thought I saw a genuine affection for the period, the place, and, above all, the music being depicted. I haven't seen all their other work, but what I've seen has put me off. It has all seemed too cool and too smart, as though always on the verge of a smirk. That's an attitude I don't take to, on screen any more than in life."

","When I first saw a movie directed by Joel Cohen (Fargo, 1996), I was certain that I was going to see a series of memorable movies. This in one of them. Javier Bardén (Oscar winner for best actor), gives us a memorable character as I have not seen in the cinema for a very long time: cold, calculi st, frozen expression, like a real machine made only for killing. Another memorable performance is given by Tommy Lee Jones ""West's old rattle-snake"" which find himself astounded by the changes occurred in his town and surroundings. Living in a dangerous city (Rio De Janeiro) and being over 60 years old, I confess that certain phrases spoken by the character ""fit like a glove"", as I witnessed the transformation of a 50's Rio of Janeiro into a hell-hole that is now. But, back to the film... this story as already told in many other movies before (people taking mobster' money) now is given a breath of fresh air by Maestro Joel Coen. A real master-piece which has to be watched by all of those who appreciate a movie done as it should be: clean, with precise cuts, clever dialogs and positively does not bore the spectator. My note, in a scale of 1 to 10, is: 10"
"freemantle_uk","10","2","5","5 October 2008"," Excellent Film
","The Coen Brothers are some of the best filmmakers in the business, very determined to keep their independent status. They have made some great films like Miller's Crossing, Fargo and the Big Lebowski, but they had been through a period where they made sub-par films, especially for their standards. Luckily No Country for Old Men is a welcome return to form and very deserving for winning the Oscars it got.<br/><br/>The film is based on a novel by Cormac McCarthy, but I have no read it, so I will just judge it as a film. It is about a drug deal that goes wrong in the middle of the desert of Texas in 1983, leaving a number of Mexican gangsters dead. A local man Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) was hunting in the area when he discoveries the carnage that happened. He discovered that one man was still alive and that they was two million dollars in cash in a case. However, he suffers guilt and returns to the site with water. In the middle of the night he finds out that they were a more people involved, and a sadistic hit-man Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) who will kill to get results and his favourite tool is the bolt gun. Moss has to go on the run, sending his wife to her mother's and has to use all his cunning to avoid and fight Chigurh. In the middle of these events is the local retiring sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), who slowly gets involved in a world of violence and organised crime. As well there are Mexican gangsters and a bounty hunter played by Woody Harrelson also wanting the money and will do anything to get it.<br/><br/>It is a well plotted film, like the best Coen brothers' which have multiple plot twists and wide range of characters. It is well written, get examples for budding writers. The direction has typical Coen's flair in a good thriller setting: admittedly the film is a little more mainstream compared to other films they have made, but they were still able to make it their own. The characters are colourful and all show to have good knowledge and skill. Tommy Lee Jones character reminded me of Frances McDormand in Fargo. Brolin was able to make his character likely and Bardam was truly a sinister character, who deserved to win an Oscar for best supporting actor. I personally hope he has a good and long career in English and Spanish speaking films. Scottish actress Kelly MacDonald was also in the film and I personally thought she did an excellent Texan accent. This film does not have as much humour to other films by the brothers, but it was still an intelligent film which was philosophical at times. It is a worthy film."
"dvc5159","10","2","5","26 September 2008"," ""...and then I woke up.""
","A film that lives up to its reputation and then some, ""No Country For Old Men"" is a revelation in modern-day Hollywood. No big budget. No special effects. Just raw, bleak film-making at its finest. The Coen brothers have done something here, arguably their best film to date. Quite really, this film blew me away.<br/><br/>In this film, hunter Llewelyn Moss finds a suitcase of drug money at the site of a drug deal gone bad between Mexican and American dealers. The American criminals then hire psychopathic assassin Anton Chigurh to kill Moss and retrieve the money. Meanwhile, Sheriff Tom Bell tries to put the pieces together, but is disillusioned by the truths of the present.<br/><br/>You see, this is not a simple cat-and-mouse chase thriller, nor is it a bleak and ultra-violent neo-noir. Instead, it is a wake up call to the world, the world of violence we live in now, where everyday somebody is killed without reason. Without sense. And the bad guys sometimes do get away with it. That is the sad part of it.<br/><br/>Before I'll get melodramatic, I'll start by saying that everyone's performances were superb, especially Javier Bardem. He deserved his Oscar. Anton is a relentless, merciless, twisted psycho that has absolutely no regrets and no hard feelings towards anyone, be it his client, his target, his target's contacts, his rival, or even a total stranger. He will just take your like even with pleas of mercy. His character Chigurh here represents the angel of Death, the Grim Reaper, who takes the ""souls"" of people who calls their fate. It's a mesmerizing and revolutionary performance, one that I dare to call one of the most sinister and deadly villainous performances of all time.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin is also excellent in his role as the protagonist, hunter Llewelyn Moss. He is a man who knows what situation he will get into, yet he bravely takes risks that may endanger his life, as well as the life of his loved ones. Moss character is brash, and attentive to the happenings around him. Brolin's performance was a vital key factor for this film's success and had Bardem not stole the limelight, Brolin would. This is his finest performance to date and I have yet to see him in bigger roles, much likely as President George W. Bush in an upcoming Oliver Stone biopic.<br/><br/>Rounding out the main cast is Tommy Lee Jones, playing the disillusioned Sheriff Bell. He is fed up with all the violence happening around him and seeks a way out of this. Bell represents the previous generation lashing out at today's level of extremism. We are tired, and we want to end it as soon as possible. But how is it going to end, we ask? It was Bell who said the ""comment opener"" at the end of the film, his voice and eyes filled with sad remorse and heartbreak, it just gets to you, knowing that you want something and you get the other way around. It's just heart-wrenching.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is also great, kudos to Woody Harrelson and Kelly McDonald for their great performances as Chigurh's rival hit-man and Moss' wife, respectively, and also to Garrett Dillahunt as the Sheriff's Deputy, providing little comic relief to this dark and disturbing drama.<br/><br/>Adapted from a Cormac McCarthy novel, the film's screenplay is also masterfully written by the Coens, with some of their trademark dialog in places. Their direction is much praise, from showing off the beautiful cinematography of the countryside, to what was one the Wild West; to a suspenseful nighttime silence in a border-town in the middle of the night. There are some violent scenes, and they are brutal and shocking at best. The film's slow pace is not a problem as it takes time to fully understand what is going on. Also, sparing the use of music is brilliant, it really sets up the tension and the mood for the film. The short music itself is haunting; Carter Burwell's themes are bleak and gritty.<br/><br/>In short, it's nothing more than a movie miracle. It deserved the Best Picture Win at the Academy Awards, and it definitely redefines the neo-noir thriller genre. It is a masterpiece, and one that may linger on freshly in some people's thoughts for years to come.<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 9.3/10<br/><br/>Delton"

I watched the subtitles slide down, expecting for something more that didn't come.<br/><br/>The storyline is one every 13-year old could think of. Drop a box with movie, let it get picked up, and let it get hunted.<br/><br/>Although the storyline was dreadful, the acting was good, indeed.

"deacon_blues-3","8","2","5","13 June 2008"," The Coens are geniuses, but this film has big plot flaws
","In order to make sense of the plot, especially toward the end, one really needs to read McCarthy's novel. There is not enough time taken for factual exposition in the later part of the film. <br/><br/>Chigurh does not possess supernatural powers, but the lack of explanation in the later part of the film leads one to believe that he does. The unavoidable contradiction here is that, if the Coens wanted to imply that Chigurh indeed had such powers, why would he have needed the transponder to track Moss in the early part of the film? How did Chigurh even know that Carson Wells was hired to kill him, and how did he locate him? How did the Mexicans locate Moss, and what actually happened when they confronted each other? How did Chigurh recover the money, and what happened to it in the end? In the film, Chigurh kills the drug buyer, not because he sent Wells to kill him, but because he hired the Mexicans to do his job, which is simply a plain misreading of the novel; Wells was hired by the buyer, the Mexicans were the sellers who lost their drugs and the money that was meant for them, they were not hired by the buyer to interfere with Chigurh's contract on Lewellyn. <br/><br/>When one reads the novel, one finds the proper and plausible answers to these questions, but they are omitted from the film. It is as if the brothers were running low on budget and schedule time, and so just left out big chunks of necessary material. I don't mind omissions that streamline a plot, but those that leave the viewer puzzled about how a certain situation ever could happen create flaws in the storytelling that tend to ruin the viewer's experience of an otherwise brilliant and engrossing film.<br/><br/>Finally, the true monstrosity of Chigurh's character is really only hinted at compared with what is disclosed in the novel. His true pathology is even more chilling than anything you could infer from the film.<br/><br/>I guess what I'm saying in summary is that, if this is the best picture of 2007, with all its flaws, the novel is even better than that! I wish the Coens had taken a little more time with it and done justice to the novel's ending."

","From Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning (and nominated) writer/director brothers Joel and Ethan Coen (Fargo, Raising Arizona) this is certainly a thriller worth watching. Basically in the 1980's, West Texas, Llewelyn Moss (Planet Terror's Josh Brolin) finds the remains of a drug deal gone violently wrong, as well as a suitcase with $2 million, so obviously he's not telling the cops. Doing this, he now has psychopathic killer Anton Chigurh (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Javier Bardem), who will kill almost anyone that gets in his way, and despairing, quite quiet Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (BAFTA nominated Tommy Lee Jones), are both on his tail. There are many intense and gripping scenes as Chigurh gets closer to finding Moss, and there is a lot of blood spill, but the heart of Bell obviously keeps the intensity from becoming too hard to handle. Also starring Woody Harrelson as Carson Wells, Trainspotting's BAFTA nominated Kelly Macdonald as Carla Jean Moss, Garret Dillahunt as Deputy Wendell, Tess Harper as Loretta Bell and Barry Corbin as Ellis. Bardem is superb as the really chilling killer, the ending where Brolin dies, and Bardem gets away, oh, and Jones is talking about some dream he had, is the tiniest bit disappointing. But that doesn't stop this film from being a great thriller from the Coen brothers. It won the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published for the Coen brothers, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Sound and Best Sound Editing, it won the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, and it was nominated for Best Film, Best Editing, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Sound, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Drama.

","I was very confused at the peculiarity of the movie and the way it ended so abruptly. I felt that it probably missed a few details which peaked my curiosity to read the book, but it also left me in search of answers for questions like ""What the H--- happened?"" After searching, I formed my own theory, so for those in need of an explanation, here's mine.<br/><br/>I was baited at the beginning because of all the action. Halfway through the movie the scenes became undeveloped and choppy, dropping my hopes of a good end. Right about then the credits started rolling. I was disappointed when evil prevailed, but half expected it to with such a dominating killer and some bad decisions on Llewelyn's part. What had me confused was the dream. Older people always say the world is getting worse, but to me the dream didn't go with the theme. Normally I would dismiss a bad movie and be done, but something tore at me find an explanation. My conclusion is that in the dream the mountain pass represents life's hard road, and as the road got longer (he got older), his guidance (father holding light) in the quest of triumphing over evil faded. He follows the path of his father with confidence of the reward of a warm fire waiting, which portrays his hope for goodness. (This brought to my mind the scripture,""Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff comfort me."" Psalm 23:4) The last line, ""And then I woke up."" leaves me thinking that we were meant to draw our own opinions about good and evil or heaven and hell."

This is one of those occasions.<br/><br/>There is some great acting by Tommy Lee Jones & several of the cast members. Some of the West Texas Scenery & settings are breath taking. The trouble is this film degrades in another (warning spoiler) new version of Jason going on a needless/meaningless killing spree. This means a new version of s slasher film just won best picture last year, & Hollywood thinks this exercise is intellectual. Oscar blew this one, as it is well produced, splendidly acted trash.<br/><br/>The Coens got a big reputation with earlier films like Fargo. This film is no where near that one. There are 3 main characters who keep looking for and missing each other throughout the film. Upon further review, it appears what is tried for in this film is irony. <br/><br/>The ending is done for intellectual effect but it makes no sense. Tommy Lee Jones cop should have been smart enough to be at the widows house to meet this version of Jason.

If you like guns, blood, & senseless maniac violence this is a film for you.<br/><br/>If you want smart intellect, watch Fargo.

","I was happy to find copies of this flick on the video store shelves after all the hoopla about the movie, and I looked forward to seeing what all the brouhaha was about. After viewing it I have to register a negative opinion. From the start, the movie does indeed draw the viewer in to what seems to promise to be a pretty good - and very well made - action, adventure, mystery (&c &c &c) flick. We do, however, sense a dichotomy here. One part of the movie seems to want to be an action thriller, as the bad guy tracks the good guy and we all get enthralled with who will outsmart the other. I just wish they had followed this line through to a logical conclusion. The other half of the movie seems to be devoted to enshrining Tommy Lee Jones on Mt. Rushmore, and pursuing some sort of barren vision of the Old West, with dry, acerbic, minimalist dialogue that seems at odds with the advanced firepower of the two guys trying to kill each other. I like Tommy Lee Jones, but it seems sad that he is content to make movies where the producers know that his wizened visage and past filmic history will draw viewers, even if all he does is mutter (and I do mean mutter, in that a lot of his dialogue is unintelligible) formulaic bits of Old West wisdom. Robert Duvall does this sort of thing better and more intelligently. <br/><br/>There is also a major editing break towards the end of the film, where a lot of plot threads seemed to have wound up on the cutting room floor (e.g. the mother's death) and the viewer finds himself at a loss. Sheriff Bell's dry conversations, in the last part of the movie, with various hard-to-identify people do not, in the end, compensate for the great question the first half of the movie raised, i.e. ""WHERE THE HELL DID THE 2 MIILLION GO?""<br/><br/>My last adventure in watching highly rated contemporary flicks, the overrated ""Michael Clayton"" led to the same disappointment. As an old fart, I'm going back to ""Double Indemnity"" and ""White Heat."""
"gregkry3825","9","2","5","14 April 2008"," The title says it all
","The point of the movie was that Texas was ""no country for old men"" which is supported by the conversation at the end with the man in the wheel chair. Bell wasn't able to catch Chigurh because he was too old, His time as a law man had past. It was his time to step down and retire. Thats what he was explaining in his dream at the end. I think that the author of the book probably was able to make it a lot clearer since he had a different medium, but the Cowen brothers did a fine job using the big screen. Chigurh was even hit by a car in the end after killing Moss' wife and he was still not able to be caught. I think that says a lot and supports the notion that Bell was not able to catch him."

","My problem with the much-discussed ending is not that the bad guy gets away. My problem is that the ending doesn't quite work emotionally. The film slams to a momentum-jarring stop that isn't entirely satisfying (at least on the first viewing). It makes sense, of course, and it is the same ending as in the novel, but that doesn't make an iota of difference to me because a book's one thing and a film's another. Two very different breeds. All that aside, this is still a superb, rich, beautifully written movie that is heads and shoulders above most. Javier Bardem, as the film's angel of death, is a revelation, and he commands your attention whenever he steps into frame. The plot has to do with a bag of money that ends up in hands not intended for it. Bardem's mission is to collect the money and eliminate anybody who associated with those said hands. Tommy Lee Jones is a weary cop who gradually learns that he does, indeed, live in a country where there is no place for an old man who hopes to see his retirement. On so many levels this film is exceptional. From its evocative cinematography to its rich and organic sound design, it has the stamp of quality and the whiff of aesthetic perfection. The violence is explosive and realistic, searing us like boiling hot water poured on a gaping wound. There is some supreme suspense, too, an example being the sequence in which Josh Brolin's vehicle is located and identified as he crouches in the dark desert. Deserving of all the praise heaped on it and a considerable achievement by anybody's reckoning."
"SvelteNZ","9","2","5","12 April 2008"," Death and the Masters
","Every film buff from Barnsley to Bluff knows the Coens are true auteurs; their remarkable canon of quality movies a study in theme continuity and near flawless scripting, storyboarding, casting, photography and direction. With the meticulously designed and directed No Country, the brothers can claim perhaps a more interesting title: American cinema's new masters of suspense. M. Night Shyalaman eat your heart out! Much of the comment since No Country's release has focused on its subversive translation to screen of genre-bending western/noir story themes and Javier Bardem's galvanizing performance as the cow-eyed, abattoir gun wielding psycho with a '70s serial killer's hairDON'T. But for me, the most satisfying element in No Country is the element of suspense: the scares that grow not from the abundant scenes of brutal violence, but from a creeping, incremental tension. The Coens apply a classical thriller technique that Alfred Hitchcock liked to call ""pure cinema"". (See Brian De Palma's April 2008 UK Empire Magazine interview for more on this.) At several points the Coens call to mind Hitchcock's masterpiece Rear Window, not in content but in design. We see and hear what the actors see and hear, and watch them react. There is no simpler or more pleasurable movie-viewing experience. The sound design, in particular, is masterful; one category where Oscar got it wrong (both prizes went predictably to Bourne Ultimatum). Ambient noise of buzzing street lights, wind and the rumble of pick up trucks generates the noirish borderlands atmosphere, while ricocheting bullets ratchet up the frights during the superbly shot and edited shoot-out and chase scenes. Visually, shot after shot feeds information to the audience with a minimum of fuss (my personal favourite: the ""Free HBO"" motel sign, instantly placing the characters in 1980 America). Brolin and Bardem, in their long cat and mouse non-dialogue sequences, show themselves to be fine silent actors, while delivering on the talking scenes when called upon to do so. Bardem's strangled spanglish monotone is wonderfully inventive; no more so than during his terrific coin-toss scene at the Texaco station, where he modulates his voice and uses facial expression to bedazzle the hayseed behind the counter with weird, nightmarish, Alice-in-Wonderland-like nonsense speak. ""Now is not a time."" But time to watch No Country again!"

When Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) goes on the run he gives Carla Jean (Kelly Macdonald) a gun as he sends her off to her mother's house.<br/><br/>Then later in the movie, when Carla Jean finds Chigurh sitting in her mother's house and Chigurh offers her a deal that if she calls correctly in a coin-toss he'll spare her life, Carla Jean can then act.<br/><br/>She can still dismiss Chigurh's game, saying that he's the one who decides on whether or not to kill her, not the coin. Then Chigurh says she is wrong and lifts his hand off the coin. At this time Carla Jean pulls the gun and kills him.<br/><br/>This would make the film a 10. The lesson is that yes life is full of chance but you can still be prepared for the evil one.<br/><br/>Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) can still give his little dream speech so the title of the film is confirmed. He might even add a word about women having to kill the bad guys."
"winner55","8","2","5","22 March 2008"," brilliant but confusing
","A very difficult film; the Coens spend more than ninety minutes setting up an exquisitely made genre film and then, in the final 15 minutes suddenly twist the film into a meditation on the essential amorality - and inevitable fatalism (in every sense) - of chance. This means that it is easy to discuss the first 3 quarters of the film without spoiling the ending - but the ending seems utterly disjoint from the rest of the film, despite the fact that the narrative remains firmly in place, and the ending really is one possible set of results from the larger part of the film. So the story is certainly well structured - but nothing in the main action of the film prepares for any of the events of the end. The film is brilliantly made; but this almost experimental, uncompromising insistence on uncertainty leaves me more confused than morally challenged."
"Hawley_Griffin","10","2","5","22 March 2008"," No Country for Old Men
","How many times can you reinvent a genre? I'm guessing Joel and Ethan Coen would answer ""a lot"". From their first movie, Blood Simple, they've been grabbing the essentials of film noir and tweaking them in unexpected ways, making the same old material feel fresh. What's more striking is that they've usually taken their inspiration not from the endless noir classics filmed between 1941-58, but from the literary beginnings of the style - the Dashiell Hammet gang wars in Miller's Crossing, the ""detective"" myth created by Raymond Chandler in The Big Lebowski, which replaced Philip Marlowe with an aging hippie nicknamed The Dude, and the ironic James M. Cain dramas where the plot is moved forward by criss-crossing plans motivated by greed in The Man who wasn't There. And this without mentioning Fargo, an anti-noir set in a scenario that's completely white. Now, with their Oscar-winning No Country, for the first time they've adapted a novel and confessed to doing so instead of being ""inspired by"", and reportedly (I haven't read the Cormac McCarthy original) they've been extremely faithful to their source, while still directing a true Coen Bros. movie.<br/><br/>The story is a three-way conflict. There's Lewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin), a blender living in a trailer park who finds 20 million in unmarked cash abandoned in the afternath of a gang shooting in the middle of the desert. Then there's Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a soulless hit-man with a bizarro haircut and a silent cow-stunning gun, who's charged with retrieving the money, following Moss around. Following them both is aging Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), an intelligent, laconic man with one foot on retirement already. These characters rarely share screen time together, and when they do, they don't talk, since one of them is crouching behind a hiding place, shotgun in hand, or stalking each other from the distance. Like many noirs, this western-themed one is not about the resolution of the crime. That's a red herring planted by the writers so that we want to get to the end of the story, which is actually about a bleak, cynical world without any redemption on sight.<br/><br/>The verbal exchanges between Coen characters range from hysterical to cryptic, alluring and mysterious. They've always had a great ear for accents, which they've incorporated as part of the comedy in each of their movies, which always feature a different U.S.-based setting. In this movie, everyone is a Texas reject, and so they ramble on, sometimes not making much sense, but always pleasing the ear. The actors all do an incredible job, and Bardem really had that Oscar coming. His geeky look paired with his deadpan performance are the heart of the film and its most recognizable symbol. Unusually for the Coens, there's almost no music that can be heard throughout the film. There are subtle chords here and there, but until the end credits there isn't anything resembling a musical theme. The editing is crisp and the pacing leisurely. In suspense scenes, the ambiance sound and the deliberate slowness of the characters movements are seriously unnerving. There are a couple such scenes that are truly deserving of being called Hitchcockian.<br/><br/>Where the movie is far from Hitchcock ground is on its moral palette, which is uniquely grey. We root for Lewellyn because his crime is understandable - he finds money which seemingly belongs to none, and he wants it for himself. Yet the ironic truth is that he could've gotten away with it hadn't he decided to compensate his thievery with an act of kindness, aiding the dying ""agua"" man in the truck. True story here. When I left the cinema and went to have a leak, there were two senior moviegoers (no country for them) heatedly arguing about the morals of the movie. One of them said it was inadmisible that the bad guy walked away at the end, having killed many innocent people, while the other said over and over that the movie was prophetic. I decided to say something while I finished my duty, pointing out that movies have no obligation to be better than real life. At this, the angry oldster said I was the reason why corrupt politicians won re-elections and that youth was generally lost. I left the bathroom on the run, looking for some kind of weapon to bludgeon him to death.<br/><br/>Seriously, though, it's not that Old Pants hadn't understood the movie, it's that he was unable to deal with the grimness of its message. On other Coen movies which were equally unapologetic with the greed and generally worthlessness of human life, there was at least one redeeming character. Fargo had a sort of heroine in Sheriff Gunderson. Sheriff Bell, on the other hand, is a survivor. He has no intentions of getting himself killed and, though he wants justice, he suddenly realizes there is nothing to be gained from looking for it and a lot to be lost. For all the dark humor that goes on through the movie, the ending is stone-faced serious and humane, with the old couple quietly talking about dreams, a wall clock ticking on in the background. Anyone who claimed the Coens were all style and no substance stands to be proved wrong with this incredible movie. Poetic and inspired, it's a great comeback from the brothers after two stinkers in a row (Intolerable Cruelty and The Ladykillers) did nothing but harm to their reputations as great storytellers with one of the most unique and literate comedy styles. Like always, great comedians are the ones that create the best tragedies."
"celr","2","2","5","18 March 2008"," Fun if you don't expect anything
","First, as someone pointed out in another review, if you want to see a really good movie on the nature of drug violence, good, evil and religious symbolism see ""La Vírgen de los Sicarios."" (Our Lady of the Assassins) A much, much better movie than NCFOM. <br/><br/>I'm giving it 2 stars because it entertained me by its skillful camera work and sense of action and location. It held my interest, but believe me, the one star reviews here are spot on. It is as bad as they say. To me it was like a piece of junk sculpture where a whole is created out of a collection of disparate but well crafted parts welded together with no continuity or internal logic. For me there was a weird fascination in its badness, but I don't expect anybody else to have the same reaction. The plot doesn't make sense, the characters don't make sense, and we don't care about them. And don't give me any of this nonsense about the meaning of evil or the decay of civilization. All that puffy literary crap is just made up. It reminded me of ""Last Year at Marianbad,"" a lot of sound & fury signifying nothing. <br/><br/>People have been trying to make sense out of the plot, but I think the plot was intentionally nonsensical. Film is not reality and for some films (For example the Dr. Phibes movies) a convention of unreality is sustainable and charming. But here the techniques of realism are used to subvert realism. Maybe the Brothers thought it would be like Duchamp's bicycle wheel, but it's not that good, or meaningful. Yes, we want a film that isn't predictable and doesn't necessarily follow the usual formulas of film noir, but with useless characters, characters who do totally illogical things, and action which isn't shown so we only have to guess at what happened and why and to whom, we are left only with an incoherent assemblage of cinamagraphic tricks. <br/><br/>You may enjoy this movie in a perverse way, as I did, but then maybe not."

There decisions lately seem to be aimed at a rather peculiar mix of the public.

As long as ppl put enough superlatives to express their utmost respect for this 'masterpiece', the number of ppl who believe something amazing is going has happened will grow. Silly really, if you realize that it's just an average movie.<br/><br/>There is hardly anything exceptional about it. Neither is it completely worthless.

","Great acting, character development, great script, terrific directing, terrific locations and pace. No story.<br/><br/>The actors in this movie are first rate - and would almost have to be incompetent to screw up the amazingly well written script. Do people in Texas really talk to each other this way? If they do it's darn quick witted and clever. We know enough about most of the characters to care about them - in particular the one that starts the movie out -- Lew. He's a decent guy that does something stupid. You get the sense that his wife loves him and is a good person. She is also pretty. You really want Lew to survive his mistakes. But just as you're really starting to get engrossed in the game of cat and mouse between the psychopath and Lew he gets murdered by somebody else. At that point you start rooting for the sheriff - but he really never gets into the game or figures out what's going on - he's too self absorbed, tired, scared, old - busy thinking about the brave unarmed men who preceded him and his dreams and good old boy platitudes and sayings. In fact this movie could've been done without any law enforcement at all - they're completely extraneous to the story - if you can call it that. That people with southern accents are stupid is a much over used stereo type - and it's milked for all it's worth here. The Sheriff retires because he can't keep up with the modern day crook or killer. Shucks they're just beyond him. And nearly every person shot down in cold blood by the psychopath has a southern drawl. You want this guy to get it. He doesn't. Everything about this movie is believable. In the end, for those of us who go to the movies to escape reality - that's what's fatally wrong with it. Do you really want to pay 10.00 to see a movie where all the good people that you care about are portrayed as victims of bad luck or ignorant hay seeds that get killed? Even if it has an implied prolific ""chance"" theme; the psychopath and his asking his victims heads or tails only to be slammed into by a green light runner at the movies end. If that is supposed to be deep -- sorry it isn't. IT'S STUPID! Or where the psychopathic cold blooded killer walks off into the sunset with nothing more than a couple nasty wounds ready to continue his lifestyle of killing and destroying of innocent lives? For crying out loud! That's what is in the news papers and on TV and in the white house - so why pay to see it in a theater? Oh, and the loose ends: What happened to the psychopath? We think we know what happened to the wife. What happened to the money (we know the wife couldn't have spent it all) What happened to the drugs? What happened to the other guy in the car wreck at the end? And what's more important after Lew, His wife, his Mom and several other innocent good people die - who really gives a crap? Oh yes, we can discuss all the clever dialogs and reasons why this and reasons why that - but when it comes down to it - this movie says that there is no justice in the world. But WE ALREADY KNOW THAT - THAT'S WHY WE GO TO THE MOVIES AND PRETEND THAT THERE IS. I feel ripped off by this movie. When the movie ended I felt betrayed because I was pulled in and made to care about people who were murdered and the killer got away. That's cheap movie making BS - and it's not original at all. It could've been a great thriller. Instead this is just another movie that glorifies the worst of the worst. I hope this movie is soon forgotten."

","This is a movie with two tones. The crimes and dramas are concentrated on two men fighting for the money. On the other side, the old man Ed has been doing the pondering work in a aching way. However the Ed's line comes out not that obvious and strong, so if you don't really pay attention, you probably would miss this part, which makes you rate this movie one out of ten. Ed Tom represents the sadness and heaviness of movie. He is the man who is feeling ""overmatched"", who doesn't understand the world around him. and chooses to quit. He uses getting old as an explanation for his nonacceptance of the current world. He misses old-time and old-timers. In his eyes, the people nowadays, they kill, they prey, they get into the business which leads to ending their lives, they lack basic human compassion, and they run on the dead road without hesitation. Ed just doesn't get it. But is it really just a time thing? Is it really just about old-time and new-time? Probably not. Ellis says, I quote, ""What you got ain't nothing' new. This country is hard on people. You can't stop what's coming. It ain't all waiting' on you. That's vanity."" Half of Ed Tom's role is like an observer; he sees the things, he describes the impression this world makes on us, and he speaks out what's in his mind, as other roles in this movie are just going with the storyline. His worries and confusion and frustration is not that different from that of some people in real life. He appears as an archetype of a group of people who has been shocked by the campus shooting, the shopping-mall shooting, the causeless battles, the madness and unseasonableness. It seems to some people, the world has gone mad. What's wrong with us? We can't help asking this question. And the hole caused by the oxygen can is quite a symbol and strong image of the hearts of these confused people. Dark and deep and painful. How can we handle all these things? Accept it? Ignore it? Fight against it? You make your own decision. But still, it is nothing new. Older generations, they have experienced the same darkness and coldness, ahead of us."

I will give the filmmakers credit for fooling me the whole time. Because for the first hour and a half, I thought I was watching The Hills Have Eyes 3, almost. That may be overdoing it, for at least for the very beginning it looked to be a horror movie, which never get nominated for Oscars.<br/><br/>So, where do I begin. I don't know who the Coen brothers are... no thats not a good start. How about, the film jumps right into the action, it start 18 minutes into it, like most movies do, it starts right away. A little Narration from Tommy Lee Jones, and the good acting is noticeable. The first 3 quarters of film, is a big, complicated chase seen, and you don't know where the movies is going for that whole time. Which is a reason why I like it, a little. The last half hour seems to be jotted in strictly to pick up some Oscar nominations, because otherwise is was a simplistic detective mystery movie, for real. The last quarter of the film begins with (SPOILER) the character, who I thought was the main one being shot. I told you there was a spoiler, twice. So I say, ""Wow, there's a half hour left, thats a long exposition"" or whatever is in that story chart at the end with the climax, inciting incident, etc. The first time you see the body lying there, you... you're quite shocked really.<br/><br/>His wife is called down, yep hes dead alright. But it wasn't the bad guy. So I know that we have to find out what happens to him.<br/><br/>NOW, yes NOW, with 10 minutes left, we figure out the reason for the plot, or the message.

","NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN (Dir: Coen Bros, 2007)<br/><br/>When the Killer of the Road, do not need a cause for to act as he use to. <br/><br/>Rafael J. Salin-Pascual <br/><br/>The idea of evil, without a cause, is subversive, and hundred percent produces in a pretty good amount of people negative emotions. But in fact, it is more often to find that in serial killers. That is what psychologist, that are working in aggression have found out: They killed without any remorse and without a cause other than to feel-good. <br/><br/>There are three men in this excellent film of Coen Bros., Anton, the killer, the sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) and the poor chaser that ended being a prey, Llewlyn Moss (Josh Brolin).The excellence of this film are the solid way in which each one of the three people are developed. One may say that they represent three visions of deal with life. Anton is the predator, the primitive way of deal with the others: ""With me or against me"" without mercy, selfish. Llewelyn, is the practical man, taking whatever opportunity is available, risk as part of the challenges the life offer us, sometimes you may win or you may die. The third character, happens to be a collection of roles,. The Sheriff is the representative personage of the law, he enforced, but also is a wise guy. He knows when should be calm and when you need to move. He is also the one that detected, since the beginning of the film, there are evil people, that kill without a reason. His voice in off give us several points of their philosophy of life. He describes a teenage killer he once sent to the chair. The boy had killed his 14-year-old girlfriend. The papers described it as a crime of passion, ""but he told me there weren't nothing passionate about it. Said he'd been fixing to kill someone for as long as he could remember. Said if I let him out of there, he'd kill somebody again. Said he was going to hell. <br/><br/>The fascination that ordinary people have with such roles like Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem); ""Mr Brooks""(2007) (Kevin Costner); or ""Death Proof"" from Tarantino, with the main character Stunt Mike (Kurt Rusell) a real killer of the road, are in some way to understand that they have the capability for to control the animal instincts. Some of those killers, that was mentioned above, are similar with Michael Myers, in Carpenter's Halloween who returns to his home town on Halloween night to stalk and kill a group of babysitters. They never defeated, and never died. <br/><br/>Obviously there is no reason for Anton to kill so many people, but in fact there is at least one: ""They saw him"". That is what he asked to same people that escape of this dark angel. Anton has his own rules, and he used, besides guns a cylinder with air at high-pressure, he used that for to kill people like cattle. Anton main goal in the film is chasing to one man, Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), who happens to be in the right place at the right time and by that ""recover"" some money from a massacre place I a fatal delivery of drugs, by doing that, Llewelyn accept, to enter this mortal game running away from a real predator. <br/><br/>The Sheriff, Tommy Lee Jones, and deputies, are amazing about the lack of emotional resonance of Barden. The killers without any cause, has became attractive business for the movie industry, but also and easy explanation of our deep and amoral instincts, that culture has try to deal with them. So we can see that even civilize and ""normal people"" like Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) in ""Match Point"" (2005, Woody Allen) could become a killer, with and clear cause. It is clear know, that there are some circuits inside the killers' brain or sociopaths, that are no working properly, so what ever the education, economical level, or any other factors, there is no reason other than the lack of a kind of break that stop ""the killing machine"", that we all carry inside our brain. <br/><br/>What is the explanation for to say that old man do not belong, in some way, to the kind of country, like the one in which killer without cause live in. In my opinion, the moral values. I am not describing that from moralistic point of view; also I am not trying to say that old people are on a higher position, from moral values than new generations, The differences are, exactly that some people do not need reason for to kill somebody. Old people use to create a confabulation theory, a justification for their criminal acts, Iraq's war, is a good example of that way of thinking. ""We were looking for weapons of massive destruction"". That war it is full of those explanation. That difference, between to create an explanation, that result in a confabulation for criminal actions or not to need at least one, that is the Country that result beyond of old people moral values. Socrates, an old man, once say: ""Bad men do, what good men dream."" And movies are like dreams, or dreams are the cinema of the mind."

","A perfect, beautiful flick for 4/5ths of its runtime. No Country... marks the time (even moreso than Fargo did) when the Coens stopped being cartoonish and let all of the pretty, flamboyant paint that represents most of their stuff seep in like woodstain. And it is totally satisfying to see it... Then they follow the written narrative off of a friggin' cliff.<br/><br/>This thing goes to show the dangers of a movie trying to trace the lines of a book too carefully. The film's ending may work in print, and I actually like stories that sort of zig off course and cause me to wonder about what I've actually been reading to that point. Raymond Carver does that very well. The same can't be said for movies, however. A film is first and foremost a visual experience, and the brain is not going to (at least mine won't) forgive a flick when, in this case, the movie magically turns from a very VERY good suspense thriller into some sort of existential manifesto on greed and man's place in the order of things by way of a surgically removed climax. It is just too jarring a change in the world of sound and vision to pull this off. There are limitations to the form, and the ending of No Country... shows one of them."

","For those who did not ""get"" this movie or thought the ending sucked or the plot was thin, you simply did not pay close enough attention to the dialog. <br/><br/>If you listen closely to the few words that Ed Tom Bell speaks throughout the film it should become clear that: <br/><br/><ul><li>The movie is about a dream, Ed Tom Bell's dream about what may have (or did) happened to his father who died in early middle age. Read/listen to the final words of the film carefully: </li></ul><br/><br/>""Alright then. Two of 'em. Both had my father in 'em . It's peculiar. I'm older now then he ever was by twenty years. So in a sense he's the younger man. Anyway, first one I don't remember to well but it was about meeting him in town somewhere, he's gonna give me some money. I think I lost it. The second one, it was like we was both back in older times and I was on horseback going' through the mountains of a night. Go""in' through this pass in the mountains. It was cold and there was snow on the ground and he rode past me and kept on going'. Never said nothing' going' by. He just rode on past... and he had his blanket wrapped around him and his head down and when he rode past I seen he was carrying' fire in a horn the way people used to do and I could see the horn from the light inside of it. 'Bout the color of the moon. And in the dream I knew that he was going' on ahead and he was fixing' to make a fire somewhere out there in all that dark and all that cold, and I knew that whenever I got there he would be there. And then I woke up."" <br/><br/><ul><li>In the movie, Ed Tom Bell is an older man of about 60-65 years. Here he starts off describing his father by referencing his age - ""I'm older now then he ever was by twenty years."" - informing the viewer that he died somewhere in the 30-35 year range. Now think back to the image of Llewlyn Moss, the protagonist, with his scruffy hair, ruddy complexion, and abbreviated manner of speech - he represents Ed Tom Bell's image of his father prior to his death! </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Notice that he mentions TWO dreams - the first representing the life of Bell's father, and the second representing the death of Bell's father. The first dream was about money, and presumably we have just witnessed that dream through the hunter/hunted struggle over money between Chigurh and Moss. The second dream is representative of the father's procession into the afterlife, riding horseback into the darkness - ahead of Bell (he did die before him) - where he will be awaiting his son's arrival one day.</li></ul><br/><br/>Wow.

"dhaney-4","9","2","5","21 January 2008"," Where was the soundtrack???
","I am not sure what movie the people who have rated this a 10 were watching. I am an huge Cohen brothers fan, and have seen all of their movies. There were only 2 redeeming qualities in this cinematic debacle. The acting was great. Tommy Lee Jones and Josh Brolin were wonderful in portraying what the writer was looking for. The cinematography was, equally impressive. The sweeping shots and use of lighting made the actual visuals of the movie worth watching. That was the end of it. The writing had moments, but fell short most of the time. The most glaring problem I saw with the entire movie was the blatant lack of sound track. I would go as far as to say the person who did the mix down and recording might have just forgotten to roll the background tracks in. There was NO MUSIC!!! ALL Movies have a score written for them. This is a western and could have had a sound track that made the movie. WHERE WAS IT? Look back at the Clint Eastwood spaghetti westerns. If it weren't for the soundtrack, some people wouldn't even remember them. Were there no available composers or did they spend too much money on the acting talent? To give a movie a 10, it has to be a complete movie. The Cohen brothers won Grammys and Academy Awards for the music in O Brother, Where Art Thou? I am not asking for that kind of sound track, this has no musical numbers, nor should it, but some a rhythmic drums or percussion in the sweeping scenes of the desert wasteland would have been great. A little acoustic guitar could have really added to the viewing experience. In fact, every movie the brothers have made has had some of the most memorable sound tracks ever put on a movie screen. Raising Arizona, The Big Lebowski, Fargo, and Miller's Crossing had moments where the sound track was the star of the show. Even The Hudsucker Proxy and Ladykillers had good background music. I watched this movie in a megaplex with several hundred people, and I could hear munching on popcorn more than what was happening in the movie for most of it. Not to say the sound track would have saved the movie, but, had they gotten someone great to do the score, Maurice Jarre, Jay Fergusson, Danny Elfman, or even maybe given Carter Burwell a little more time, it would have at least moved my score up to above average. I certainly hope the future does not hold more of this silent movie treatment."
"LoneWolfAndCub","10","2","5","19 January 2008"," A brutal, dark and violent masterpiece
","No Country for Old Men shows us again how good Ethan and Joel Coen can be. Much like their earlier films (Blood Simple and Miller's Crossing), No Country for Old Men is a slow moving, character-driven, dark, brooding and violent film filled with some of the greatest recent performances I can think of. This movie is probably one of the most unconventional movies I've seen this year and the only one to leave me speechless.<br/><br/>I won't explain much of the plot apart from the basics, as watching the movie without knowing much about it is ultimately more rewarding in this case. Basically, a man stumbles across $2 million near the Rio Grande and afterwards is pursued cross-country by a madman hell-bent on getting the money.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem and Tommy Lee Jones are our three main actors and each give a distinctly different but amazing performance. Josh Brolin is Llewelyn Moss, the man who finds the money and needs to get far away. He is the protagonist and carries the majority of the movie on his shoulders. We feel for him and his greedy mistake, and as he develops into a man unwilling to go down without a fight, he only manages to up the ante for himself. Brolin indeed excellent and this is the best thing I've seen him in and this role will no doubt land him more lead roles. Javier Bardem is the villain Anton Chigurh, a ruthless and frightening individual who will stop at nothing to get the money. He is a force of nature, seemingly devoid of any morals but who strangely sheds tears in a couple of scenes in the movie. Bardem is so scary and I haven't seen a performance this good in a long, long time. I hope he is recognised for this movie and his villain is the truly the human form of evil. Tommy Lee Jones is more of a support but provides the audience with the most to think about. His many humorous but philosophical musings are always interesting and never dull.<br/><br/>The Coen's must also be applauded for their directing and writing skills, truly magnificent and talented, these two are! Of particular note is the use of absolutely no music throughout the entire film, it provides such an atmosphere and in fact heightens the tension of many scenes. The ending is the part of the film that caught me completely off-guard, though, as it is very abrupt and rather depressing. This doesn't make the film bad, however, it is just saying that the good guys don't always win and not everything is as neatly wrapped up as you would like it. Despite the numerous reviews which trash the ending, to me it perfectly fits in with the tone the Coen's were trying to achieve. <br/><br/>Overall, No Country for Old Men is the best movie of the year and a must-see. Truly stunning.<br/><br/>5/5"

","You know what, this movie is for everyone! Yes you may think it's too violent. But every twelve year olds who saw ""the saw"" movies (or just TV in general), wouldn't be seeing something nearly as violent.<br/><br/>And i would recommend this film over the new narnia movie, just because i truly believe this movie works as a fairy tale too, but one that is so close to reality, but without ever letting the fantasy bubble burst so that it can preach to us.<br/><br/>This film places Texas to be as foreign as any far-away land, with people whose accents/dialect might as well be a foreign language to us, with people whose occupations couldn't be anymore exotic (drug-dealing, shooting a rifle, very exotic), in this film there are king, prince, princess, villain, monster. What's different is that there's not really a happy ending, but rather a dignified ending, i would say it's a hopeful ending, because i felt like it's a new beginning now. Where evil is still amongst us and it will always be, but rather than to avoid or to attempt to defeat an evil entity, we face the devil inside of us and recognize what we truly fear and figure out if it's worth fearing at all.<br/><br/>I really wish more young people my age would see this movie, because it is truly about the post-9/11 generation. I had to see the movie twice to even realize what the title intended to mean. It's provided me images, dialogs, symbolisms, that forced me to think on cross-generational relations, the wisdom and stupidity in both the old and the young, but mostly the fear we share. And whether that fear will make us impotent, or brave to take action.<br/><br/>This is a great film, because within this very entertaining action-slasher-thriller, the film has true humanity and ambiguity, that actually stirred something in me, the same way i can say about 'ratatouille'. but never about pretentious crap like 'there will be blood'."

","This was just a hands down great film. I and others in the theater were on the edges of our seats For me it was an action packed, suspenseful western, by way of the Coen Brothers. The acting from everybody was down to a T. Javier Bardem, he just immersed himself into cool but crazed hit-man. What this movie does that very few others do is leaves the audience to fill in the blanks for themselves. Instead of giving the audience all of the answers and wrapping it up, it leaves the audience to draw their own conclusions of the mysteries within. I personally recommend Javier Bardem for Best Supporting Actor. Tommy Lee Jones and Josh Brolin were no slouches either. This is going to be a favorite at the Academy Awards. Hey, if the Coen Brothers win best director, that would be a first in the Academy history, two brothers earning Best Director."

","Brilliant! Well almost. This disturbing morality tale by the Coen Brothers, is a superbly directed; written; acted and photographed dramatic thriller that left an indelible imprint on my memory hours after viewing. It is a multi layered film for discerning film goers and will not be everyone's cup of tea but one which I found strong and invigorating.<br/><br/>It is a film about our actions and the consequences they result in. How our characters can contrast with the surroundings and environment in which we live. We call the shots and pay the price, which affects not only our own fate but inadvertently those around us.<br/><br/>The script is peppered with wit and dark humor and Javier Bardem as the main villain is downright chilling and creepy ***Spoiler Alert***Like life, the climax of the film is downbeat and offers no satisfying resolution, but to my perception this is what gives the film it's potency and edge. I must add though, that it was a mistake to not include the showdown at the motel near the climax of the film. The events that had transpired and had ostensibly appeared to be building up too a violent and suspenseful confrontation between Lewelyn and Chirguh, my expectations were suddenly deflated and I felt cheated when an off screen shootout occurred and the Mexicans decided Lewelyn's fate. This deceit was a poor choice made by the filmmakers, considering that the films end left one hanging.<br/><br/>If you are willing to go the distance, enter this country at your own risk - you may find it a rewarding journey but be prepared to get shaken not stirred."
"chrissterlin","3","2","5","11 December 2007"," Intelligence Vetoes This Monstrosity
","The best way that I can describe ""No Country For Old Men"" is if it were an independent film. Now independent films usually end at around ten or twenty minutes, but rather than just ending there, ""No Country For Old Men"" dragged on into stagnation for 2 of the worst hours I have ever wasted in a movie theatre. Now, I grant you, the twisted, cold logic of Chigurh (Javier Bardem), is enough to send chills down even the most brave men and women of our society and Josh Brolin keeps an individual enraptured in the film, but Tommy Lee Jones' performance (as Sheriff Ed Bell Tom) did not impress. Where was Jones' range? His happy, sad, surprised, angry, and hurt emotions all had the exact same dead-pan face.<br/><br/>The plot was semi-decent-not great, spectacular, or amazing...just OK. There were several clever bits that made one chuckle, and a decent amount of suspense was thrown in. But the plot continually lost focus, and therefore, lost the interest of the audience as it went through many pointless and meaningless tangents.<br/><br/>The ending was awful too, I mean, it appeared as though they simply ran out of money and couldn't film any more, so they just tossed what they had onto the screen. No resolution, no conclusion, and nothing to indicate the Jones' last monologue motivations.<br/><br/>All in all, (and this is coming from a man who cries every single time he watches ""Brokeback Mountain"") a pretty awful experience."
"JackCerf","7","2","5","3 December 2007"," Fatalism and Quietism
","The Coens have withheld the dramatic resolution that the setup promises: There is no final confrontation between Moss and Chigurh or Bell and Chigurh. Somebody else kills Moss, Chigurh evades Bell, and it isn't even completely clear, though it is hinted, whether Chigurh recovers the money. Instead, Chigurh kills an innocent because his peculiar idea of integrity requires him to, and he is himself almost undone by a random act of fate, while Bell decides that the world has simply gotten too hard for him to deal with any more. That may be how things work out in real life, but drama is supposed to impose a structure that real life lacks. The Coens willfully refuse. (Since I haven't read the novel, I don't know how much it dictates that decision. Even if it does, the Coens decided to use that novel as the material for the movie, rather than something else.)<br/><br/>You can write anything you want on the resulting blank slate. What I put there is a terrified but emotionally distant fatalism. As Chigurh sometimes tells his victims, everything they have ever been and done has led them to the point where he kills them, without foresight or avoidance being possible. Fate, or History, or God, or the Universe, or whatever you want to call it is at best unrelenting and indifferent to our individual concerns. Worse, it may even be cruelly amused at our illusion that we know what is going on and can control events.<br/><br/>Our age is pervaded by apocalyptic thinking. The fundamentalists are all dreaming of the End Times and the Rapture. The secular leftists are half fearful, half ecstatic over the same thing with the God part left out, either through the fatal crisis of capitalism, or through environmental catastrophe as our material civilization inflicts incurable damage on the planet, or by good old nuclear holocaust driven by events in the Middle East. Crossing all party lines is the fascination with the killer asteroid. What I think the Coens are saying is that the End is coming in one form or another, that there's nothing we can do about it, and that our individual wants and needs will be worthless and meaningless when it gets here. The only thing to do in the meantime is to live quietly, abandon the illusion of control, and cultivate our own garden for as long as we're allowed. That's a profoundly anti-American conclusion, dismissing all of our native optimism, and the culture optimism built, as a childish illusion.<br/><br/>Bell decides to live that way. Carla Jean Moss faces death that way. She's perfectly right, of course, that the coin toss has only such meaning as Chigurh chooses to give it, and she refuses to pretend that her will has any influence on what he will do. I suppose that once you realize you're in the gas chamber at Auschwitz, all that's left you is the dignity of taking a deep breath instead of trying to claw down the bolted door."
"bobbobwhite","9","2","5","26 November 2007"," Very faithful to the book, and even better
","Writer Cormac McCarthy, he of few and common-man words in his latest books, weaves an anxious tale of West Texas crime, murder and deep mystery in this ""who's going to go down hard"" tale of rabbit and coyote, one running and the other chasing relentlessly for nearly the entire film. The story is basically this: Drug deal goes real bad, outsider finds money and runs, drug dealer hires killer to find the money and deal harshly with the interloper and anyone getting in the way. And he does this at times in the most creative fashion by using a slaughterhouse stun gun, of all things. (No more storyline here, as it has been revealed in detail in other reviews.)<br/><br/>The Coen Bros. nearly outdid their great success Fargo here, but humor mixed in with the mayhem and a classical musical score in Fargo made it a more satisfying story experience overall, IMO, than the almost pure evil and ill will toward innocent humanity that this story pounded at us relentlessly. And, as I remember it, there was no music at all in this film until the credits ran but that rare decision fit this harsh film well.<br/><br/>The magnificent Spanish talent Javier Bardem played Anton Chigurh, the single-minded psychopathic killer hired to chase down Josh Brolin's interloper character Lewellyn Moss, and he was as scary in looks, words and practice here as any screen heavy ever, and was positively blood-chilling in his brilliance. Bardem is a real masterpiece, as in The Dancer Upstairs he played a good man to the bottom of his soul in the face of abject evil, and in this film he was the exact opposite and even more effective. Both jobs proved his immense range and talent and that he is unquestionably at the very top of the list of the most talented international actors working today and easily the most memorable character in this film full of good ones.<br/><br/>Brolin's working class good looks and manner were perfect as a poor welder who found $2 million in drug money and a bunch of dead guys while he was out hunting antelope. He was just a regular guy living a meager life in a trailer with his overly dependent wife, who aggravatingly asked him endless and clueless questions in the way a 2 year old child does, and this found money represented his only way out of the deep hole he was in so he intended to do all it required to keep it. <br/><br/>Tommy Lee Jones, who played Sheriff Ed Tom Bell in the middle of the chase to catch up to both Moss and Chigurh, was as downhome terrific as only he can be playing a leathery Texas character. As a very savvy, old school, near-retirement lawman, he knew from the start that he was overmatched in this case and was merely spitting upwind against the hurricane of modern drug crime, often wondering aloud why and how it all happened and befuddled him in the process. He was getting old and nearly irrelevant in modern drug crime casework and he knew it, but he still almost got the job done due to good fundamental police work. And, while almost shocking in its abruptness, the film's ending implied that much of the crime committed in today's complex and ruthless drug world is realistically impossible to solve. The opponent is just too rich, powerful and persistent, but also more willing to go to all out bloody war at all costs to win.<br/><br/>As a result, if you need stories with feelgood Hollywood endings, see something else. But see this one if you want story and acting quality above all else."

","A time when drug deals come with multiple murders and amoral operatives is no time for aging West Texas sheriff, Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) to stay on the job, especially since Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) is determined to retrieve the dollars from amateur but crafty Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin). <br/><br/>No Country for Old Men, adapted from Cormac McCarthy's 2005 novel by the Coen brothers, is a classic explanation of a title, where the plot is perfectly in synch with the titular expectations. In fact, this film is one of the best modern westerns ever and even at this late time of the year, closing in on Oscar, one of the best of the year.<br/><br/>Because the Coens are notorious for ingeniously wringing out humor in dark films (Think the washed out Fargo, the pregnant cop, the Minnesota accents), no one will be disappointed at the laughs emerging from the clipped, minimalist speech of Texans who wouldn't acknowledge Mr. Death if he were handing them a calling card. For example, when Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson) is asked how dangerous Anton is, he replies, ""Compared to what? The bubonic plague?"" <br/><br/>The Coens catch the slow, indifferent drawls and irritation at strangers who don't get it. But in most cases, Anton Chigurh is in no mood to indulge these rubes and disposes of them as one might shoo flies from a hot border cafe. (Sometimes he engages his victims in a simple existential conversation concerning fate and personal responsibility.)<br/><br/>The pace is slow enough for Jones to do his best acting ever, with Brolin a stunning Nick Nolte imitation. But the slow, assured menace of Bardem dominates No Country, like the arid, deathly plains of New Mexico cinematographer Roger Deakins nails perfectly as metaphor. Add this modern Western to this year's excellent westerns 3:10 to Yuma and Assassination of Jesse James, and you have as satisfactory a genre year as ever since Unforgiven. <br/><br/>Much will be made of the Hitchcockean pacing and inscrutable ending.

So, what made it so bad? It was MUCH too long. Many scenes were  extremely violent and/or graphic, yet they achieved nothing for the  plot. Since they didn't have anything interesting to say, they just  decided to go shoot some more people. This was extremely unfortunate  since the actors themselves weren't bad. It just doesn't go anywhere.  There are a few humorous moments that are played very well, but these  are rare moments in a long, bloody, and otherwise boring movie. Yes,  there is suspense in the fight scenes, and the characters show a lot of  potential, but everything in it just seems so pointless due to lack of  plot, that you simply lose interest. It was actually painful to sit  there any longer. By the end, I was definitely ready to go.  It seemed that I was not the only person in the test audience that did  not enjoy the film, since many people snuck out during the screening,  and others complained out loud during and after the film. It is  long-winded and lacks the proper plot development to hold your  attention. I hope (for the sake of the bored public) that they make  some changes before they release it in the fall.   --- I also feel the need to clarify after reading the other two  reviews: I'm not some uncultured schmuck that doesn't know a good movie  when I see it...

So it is about the cheapness of life when it comes to money and drugs and stuff but quite frankly there is a lot of rambling in the movie, a lot of the dialogue has nothing to do with the story, its just a bunch of old timers rambling about their dead fathers and the like. There was no room for histrionics really, all that was required was plain and simple acting which veterans like Tommy Lee Jones and Javier can easily manage. Granted that Javier's performance was perfect (that of a stone cold killer with no scruples and a 2 face like hangup) but altogether its boring and a waste of time and doesn't deserve to be in the IMDb top 250."
"cober69","1","3","10","5 June 2012"," Highly overrated movie based on overrated book!
","First I've read the book. Then I watched a movie. When you do like this, disappointment not an exception.<br/><br/>First and the most! Brothers-directors ruined the whole idea of the movie just by missing one scene. Scene where Chigurh pass the money to the owner. Just like that! Not showing this short scene turned Chigurh from a loyal hard worker (of very specific matter though) to a regular greedy psycho killer and trashed all the sense of the story. If there's any sense at all. Least what I see: don't take what not belong to you. That's it. And brothers Coen easily flushed it in a toilet.<br/><br/>Notice – I never consider the storyline. Though I got many questions to an author of the book. Here I talk about movie only. Many critics say that brothers took a book and caaaaarefully put it to a screen. Yeah right. And Chigurh was a dark-eyed? What a magic turning. McCarthy very stingy on a characters portrayal but even then we know that Chigurh had blue eyes. Bardem - not. But that's really nothing in comparison to a plot holes in a script and ""magical"" turning things like when 15 year old hitch-hiker turns to a mid-aged hotel slut, black Plymouth Barracuda turned to a Ford Bronco and so on and on. Not to mention disappearing scenes like Chigurh's shooting with Mexicans when he meets Moss. And much goofs, anachronisms and continuity.<br/><br/>And what about two guys in Dodge Ramcharger? In the movie old one says to Chigurh: mind riding, butch? WTF? In the name of what brothers-shmathers decided that employer would talk to an assassin that way??? Naturally in a book there's no such thing. Book doesn't need some stupid explanations why Chigurh killed those guys. <br/><br/>Actors were good but no more then poor directing allowed. Chigurh-Bardem was really not bad, but where the brothers read that he ever smiled? I can go on and on, but what the point? Totally overrated movie. If you want some more brain damage – go read the book. Also overrated, but at least with concept."
"Brian7250","1","3","10","25 October 2010"," What a let down
","I remember when this film was released, there was so much hype and they only showed brief trailers on TV, suggesting that it would be really shocking when you finally saw the whole thing. I saw it for the first time last night on British TV. It was just another film where the main character goes around killing for fun. No real story, no proper explanations, the only 'good guy' is eventually killed, the police are totally useless, the criminal uses a pneumatic gun to open doors (big deal), is dumb enough to get injured himself a couple of times, but presumably gets away at the end. Fade to black. Completely unsatisfying. When will some of these directors realise that it takes a bit more than violence alone and being a bit different or 'clever', just for its own sake - to make a good film."
"michaelRokeefe","10","3","10","23 February 2008"," Terrific saga. Not to be missed!
","Joel and Ethan Coen cunningly adapts a story by Cormac MaCarthy that is set in 1980s West Texas. A beginning with so much anticipation; and a fade to black finale with your's truly expounding...s^@t! Llewelyn Moss(Josh Brolin)is a redneck slave to his resources that while hunting in the dusty Texas desert stumbles upon a drug deal gone real bad. Bodies of Mexican gangsters bullet-ridden and swarmed by flies lay by expended weapons. Moss coolly ignores a damn pickup load of drugs, but eagerly grabs a grip on a briefcase full of $2 million in $100 bills. He doesn't realize that he will soon be chased by a psychotic hit-man, Anton(Javier Bardem). This is the most methodical, ruthless, no nonsense killer in movie history. One unstoppable bad ass. Small town Sheriff Ed Tom Bell(Tommy Lee Jones)personally knows how determined and crazy Anton is and will try to track down Llewelyn and save him if possible. At the same time joining in the chase is the high dollar bounty hunter Carson Wells(Woody Harrelson), who is hired to stop Anton. Desert landscapes are photographed beautifully. The violence is bitter and most definite.<br/><br/>Llewelyn is too damn stubborn for his own good. He seems to not know the meaning of quit. He is a welder by trade, but $2 million in a briefcase means retirement. Anton is ultimate in regard to being the most psycho killer to take unnerving joy in his obsession with everyone's destiny and gives the flip of a coin a whole new meaning. Sheriff Bell is pretty much borderline old codger with pride in the old school of enforcing the law. Wells is cocky, fearless and not too afraid of death. The murder rate is brisk and guaranteed to speed your pulse. Also in the cast: Kelly Macdonald, Tess Harper, Barry Corbin and Stephen Root. Thanks to the Cohen brothers for this bleak guilty pleasure."

","Let me put it this way: Hollywood, all the writers, Directors, Performers etc. given 1000 years to prove their worthiness & ability to make film, all of their expertise combined together would not be able to come-up with anything better than No Country For Old Men! BRAVO! Its absolutely excellent & gripping.<br/><br/>This movie is as Raw as fresh meat! Actually they should have another genre for No Country.........RAW!<br/><br/>Though, rightly mentioned elsewhere, it is not for all audiences i.e the people who are (only) into Tom & Jerry or Simpsons, by the way I love animation too!<br/><br/>As for the people who have seen it & could not fully understand the incidents in it, or questioned the logic of some sequences: Heres some rather helpful that may change your perspective at looking at it. Do we not, very often come across news articles about unexplained or unresolved cases or massacres without any apparent reason? All the serial killers who are now behind bars were once amongst ordinary people like us........Thats how you should look at J Bardem's character. <br/><br/>I have seen all. All the greats from The Godfather1,2,3 to Sin City, Usual Suspects to ever fresh the Shawshank Redemption. But this gem stands out from the crowd<br/><br/>While Javier B is creepier than Linda Blair in Exorcist Kelly McDonald portrays innocence. And I personally loved the ending which leaves you guessing & wanting more. Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh  the terrifying, floppy-haired murder machine of ""No Country for Old Men""  isn't particularly chatty or seductive, but the intensity of his performance, If you're judging it as an actors' showcase, the film offers one great performance after another, from Javier Bardem's chilling contract killer to Josh Brolin's corruptible Everyman to Tommy Lee Jones' world-weary sheriff. <br/><br/>Even the smaller roles are filled by exceptional character actors like Beth Grant (of ""Donnie Darko"" and ""Sordid Lives,"" among many others) and Stephen Root (""Office Space"").<br/><br/>So if you would like to experience cinema at its best go see it. It is haunting, excellent & breathtaking 9.5/10"

","The Coen Brothers most definitely back to form. Like 'Fargo' (the Coen Bros film it is closest to), it is the landscape that dominates the film. Here, we are in the harsh world of West Texas, and from the magnificent opening sequence we are left in no doubt of man's insignificance and smallness, and of how life is always going to be a struggle against this landscape. Once again, the Coen's brilliantly conjure up a graphic, vivid sense of place - there are surely no-one among present day film-makers who are better at bringing a particular landscape to life. After all the justified praise for other aspects of the film, and for the performances of the leading actors, I thought that the filming of West Texas deserved a mention"

","Although Josh Brolin, playing Llewelyn Moss, is ostensibly the star of the Cormac McCarthy story, his faultless performance is overshadowed by that of Javier Bardem - the ""hood"" Anton Chigurh. Bardem's performance is unquestionably the stuff of Oscars and every time he hits the screen the effect is electrifing. Seemingly inhuman (other than the time he spares the life of an old petrol station owner on the toss of a coin) he radiates evilness.<br/><br/>Set in Texas and on the Mexican border in 1980 the tale verges at times on the preposterous as a tangled web involving trailer trash opportunist, Moss, stumbles upon$2 million dollars as the result of a shoot out between rival Mexican gangs at the handover of a truck load of drugs. Instead of handing it into the police like any good boy would do he decides to keep it and there then follows an elaborate chase to get the money back, led by Bardem , The Mexican's hired hand. It is much complicated by the simultaneous tracking of Moss by, but the other Mexican gang, a Private detective/hit-man, Woody Harrelson, and a ""whatever"" Police Sheriff, the world and police force-weary Tommy Lee Jones who is nearing his retirement.<br/><br/>In the middle of it all sits the vulnerable and utterly convincing wife of Moss played beautifully by Kelly MacDonald. What a repertoire she has - her range is astonishing and she is quickly becoming one of Scotland's greatest actresses ever.<br/><br/>The title is in some aways a parody. It's difficult to reach old age in this racket and the deaths clock up on a regular basis. but also it represents the central theme of the movie which rotates around Thornton's imminent retirement and the memory of his father, also a copper, who died young (in his 40's).<br/><br/>It is a movie about death and has strong ethical and moral undertones. Although he has little screen time it is Thornton who is, in reality, the central protagonist as it is he who bookends the action with his reflections on life and its meaning.<br/><br/>The action is pretty grizzly but rarely gratuitous, as the Coen's have chosen to direct it lightly - no great epic cinematography, no music AT ALL - it's almost a Hollywood Dogme film and that adds greatly to its impact.<br/><br/>Heavy-handed direction, big scores, florid cinematography; all would have turned the preposterousness of the tale into a preposterous movie. As it is, it succeeds effortlessly in being the movie the great mafia directors (Coppola, Mann, Scorsese) would die for. In the hands of Tarantino the film might have become a parody of the book.<br/><br/>The Coen Brothers are very, very good filmmakers. This is a very, very good Coen Brothers film.<br/><br/>9 out of 10."

","The Coen Brothers' 1996 not-so-cult movie I just mentioned may not be a direct comparison(though,as I recall from just seeing it,it isn't TOO far from being one,to be honest)to this current offering from them.<br/><br/>PArt-time big game hunter Llwelyn Moss(JOsh Brolin,bruising and bleeding away his cleaner,sexier image here)runs across a prairie filed where a drug deal has gone violently wrong and left what appears to be no survivors. Among the carnage there,he spots a briefcase loaded with $2 Million. Letting greed get the best of his better instincts,Llwelyn takes the case and makes with it,much to the chagrin of the angry drug lords who once possessed it and of particular interest to one Anton Shigurh(Javier Bardem,a vision of steady concentration and nightmarish violence and efficiency),a hired killer who seems to have gone completely rogue. On the trail of both are two completely different agendas: hired ""fixer"" Carson Wells(Woody Harrelson,in his most succinct performance in recent history)and local Sheriff Ed Tom Bell(Tommy Lee Jones,who should ready himself for another onslaught of major award noms,if not outright awards for this performance),an aging,world weary lawman with more sense than to chase this case,but too much guts to let it go. As Shigurh carves a violent swath of destruction through south Texas into Mexico,it becomes increasingly evident that the clean escape that Moss had planned with the money is becoming almost impossible and a much higher debt to pay than what's contained in the purloined case he's been keeping.<br/><br/>With heart-breaking performances by Kelly MacDonald(as the confused and powerless wife of Llewelyn),Tess HArper and Beth Grant(As,respectively,the warm and caring but ultimately unable to help wife of the Sheriff and Llwelyn's opinionated and feisty mother-in-law)and a dialog and soundtrack that is spare yet hauntingly effective,this movie makes the very choice move of making sure that little or no backing sound highlights or underscores the violence(and there's plenty of it)that this movie provides. Off the top of my head,the main comparison that this movie has to Fargo is that in both,a less-than-physically agile but very sharp and incorruptible law enforcement officer(here,Jones,in FArgo,Frances McDormand)tracks vile,potentially vicious thugs(here,of course,Bardem;there,Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare)through a state that is full of rural,potentially unforgiving terrain(FArgo's Minnesota and North DAkota to Old Men's Texas). Adapted off Cormac McCArthy's best-seller,the Coen's have seemed to rediscover their ability to contract their more scattered,frenetic,tongue-in-cheek natural style(think Raising Arizona,The Hudsucker Proxy,The Big Lebowski and,to a lesser degree,Barton Fink)and brought it down to something almost poetic and hypnotic(think MIller's Crossing,a film I personally found lushly made but irritating and hard to engage in). This movie disturbs as well as it entertains,but I have a strong feeling that was the aim of the makers,and as such,they hit their target(no pun intended)."

The filmmakers are amazing at visually tell the story, but it gets boring. One guy going after the other for 1 hour straight is too much. <br/><br/>So, lets talk about the characters. Like I said, all fun to watch, but...
Our ""hero"": purposely made less likeable than typically. The movies asks you the question: ""would you like this guy?"" And that was awesome. But after, they make him dumb so the movie can start with the action and persecutions. He goes back to the place where he stole the money because he was guilty about letting a guy die without giving him water. This is insanely stupid and took me out of the movie. Why they would make him like this? Either make him a guy with grey morals towards ""good"" or good. This guilt induced stupidity seemed out of character and just needed for the plot.<br/><br/>Then you have Chigurh. In the end, we can't really know if he was a myth or not. He might be as terminator as he looked it was, or maybe what we see is not really what it happened. There's no way to know. He was a monster impossible to destroy and more a charicature representing nihilism than anything else.<br/><br/>Finally, Tommy Lee Jones absolutely being old very well. You know, because he's old?

","No Country for Old Men is what I call a film with great potential. The potential of being a masterpiece, potential of reaching same heights of ""Fargo"" or ""Blood Simple"". But by the third and final act, the film loses its narrative arc and it resolves into just a good film.<br/><br/>The first, second and third acts of the films are truly gripping - genuinely thrilling. Every muscle on the faces of all the actors moves exactly the way it should, following the directors' vision; the actors' enunciation is 100% perfect, and the dialogs, frequently minimalistic, are flawless. But by the last act, the graph drastically falls, characters don't get their proper send off and the film basically ends without any conclusion.<br/><br/>The film is fueled with damn good performance by Javier Bardem, stunning photography by Roger Deakins and some great sound design which compensated for music score. Bardem is eerie, creepy and down-right chilling as Anton Chirugh, a ruthless psychopathic serial killer. His stone cold expressions are imported straight from hell. Bardem's Chirugh is one of the best on screen villainy I have seen. Josh Brolin is decent enough, Tommy Lee Jones is just there. Bardem outshines each and every cast member and steels the film.<br/><br/>Roger Deakins' (who unfortunately again didn't won Oscar) work is marvelous. The bleak, deserted region of South Texas is wonderfully framed and composed. Deakins played with shadow and light so well in jaw dropping sequence of Motel confrontation, that alone deserved an Oscar.<br/><br/>The film could have been so much more - only if the screenwriters/directors Coen Brothers could've made the ending of the film a little bit more cohesive.

It may just be the actual public and their comments who give it that feeling. No country for old men is a plain and sort of predictable film. This doesn't take any charm away. It also doesn't make it the best film of the year. In any case, I know Cohen's worshipers will continue to think that I don't have a clue and I will continue to roll my eyes.

","In ""No Country for Old Men"" Josh Brolin plays ""Llewelyn Moss"", a man who stumbles on the scene of a shoot-out between Mexican drug dealers and ends up finding $2 million dollars which end up being bugged. Javier Bardem plays ""Anton Chigurh"" the psychopathic killer who is sent after Lleweln to retrieve the stolen money, but leaves a trail of bodies that no one seems able to follow. Tommy Lee Jones plays ""Sheriff Ed Tom Bell"" who has been the sheriff in this West Texas area since he was 25 years old and is saddened by the amount of violence that is starting to manifest in this peaceful area. This movie is nothing special in my opinion. Not sure if this is supposed to be a thriller or some kind of crime drama but its plot is shallow. As I've never knowingly seen any movies by the Coen brothers I cannot compare this to anything else they have done. This movie is similar to many of the other one that have a good guy who isn't a good guy who does something that makes someone angry and a bad guy who is the baldest of the bad who is after him. Since all the action in this film happens at night, the lighting is supposed to make it seem more suspenseful. When the two trucks come to the top of the ridge without their lights on with the sunrise behind them is probably the best scene in the movie. The use of indirect lighting gives the scenes a more surreal appearance and it makes it them somewhat believable. The shootout in the middle of the street is also decent except if you're shot in the leg with a shotgun you aren't moving well enough to disappear that fast. Also when you blast a shotgun in the middle of a small town street, no matter what time, someone is going to come out and take a look. In almost all of the gunshot scenes is the viewer the target of the blast. Every time someone is shot up close the camera is looking down the barrel of the gun. This makes me feel like I've done something wrong by watching the movie in the first place. Then there is the splatter effect from the gunshot, they all looked the same and if there is splatter there should be bullet holes to go along with it, in my opinion. There is no real reason to even have Sheriff Bell in the movie since he doesn't really play an important role. All he does is give some commentary on how violent the world is becoming and how old he is getting. His ""woe is me: attitude brings any action build up to a staggering halt. Although parts of the movie are pretty dramatic, it is predictable and the overall lack of plot development keeps this from being a movie to be watched over and over.

Discovered by a pair in a jeep, he's chased into the river and loses his truck.<br/><br/>Moss stashes the satchel in the air vent of his motel room hideaway, but a group of Mexicans occupy the room, lying in wait to ambush him. He's forced to rent a connecting room that shares the same vent. Chigurh, hired to retrieve the money, traces it via a radio transponder hidden inside the satchel, bursts in and slaughters the Mexicans. Searching for the satchel, Chigurh removes the vent cover with a dime and realizes Moss has retrieved it and escaped. Chigurh tracks Moss to a border town hotel, his pursuit climaxing in a firefight that spills onto the streets.<br/><br/>Both men are badly wounded. Moss flees across the border, collapsing from his injuries and waking up in a Mexican hospital. There Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson), another hired operative, offers to save his life for the money. After Chigurh brutally treats his own leg wounds with stolen medication, he gets the drop on Wells back at his hotel and kills him just as Moss calls the room. Picking up the phone and carefully avoiding the blood on the floor, Chigurh offers to spare Moss's wife, Carla Jean (Kelly Macdonald), for the money. Moss is defiant.<br/><br/>Moss arranges a rendezvous with Carla Jean in El Paso to give her the money and send her out of harm's way. Everyone converges on El Paso, but Bell and Carla Jean do not arrive until after Moss is dead in a shootout. Bell returns that night to the scene and finds that the lock to Moss's motel room door has been blown out. Chigurh hides behind the door of a motel room, observing the shifting light through an empty lock hole. His gun drawn, Bell enters Moss' room and notices that the vent cover has been removed with a dime and the vent is empty.<br/><br/>Bell visits his Uncle Ellis (Barry Corbin), an ex-lawman. Bell plans to retire because he feels ""overmatched,"" but Ellis points out that the region has always been violent. For Ellis, thinking it's ""all waiting on you, that's vanity."" Chigurh locates the widowed Carla Jean and waits for her at her recently deceased mother's home. Although he gave his word that she would die if Moss did not hand over the money, Chigurh offers her a coin toss; Carla Jean refuses to call it. Leaving the house alone, Chigurh carefully checks the soles of his boots. As he drives away, Chigurh is injured in a car accident; his left arm is badly broken. He manages to leave the scene before the police arrive.<br/><br/>Now retired, Bell shares two dreams with his wife (Tess Harper), both involving his deceased father. In the first dream he lost ""some money"" that his father had given him; in the second dream, he and his father were riding horses through a snowy mountain pass. His father, who was carrying fire in a horn, quietly passed by Bell with his head down and was ""going on ahead, and fixin' to make a fire"" in the surrounding dark and cold. When Bell got there, he knew his father would be waiting. Then he woke up.<br/><br/>So, wouldn't you hire the killer ?"

","I've got to agree that this movie did absolutely nothing for me.<br/><br/>There was nothing special about the acting. The story was predictable and ultimately dissatisfying.<br/><br/>I only watched this movie AFTER it had won best picture. I kept waiting for the ""good part"", and then it was over. The ""good part"" never arrived.<br/><br/>I wasn't alone ... my wife liked it even less than I did, which I wouldn't have thought possible. As soon as it ended, she immediately asked ""Why did we waste our time on that?"" I had no answer.<br/><br/>Maybe we're just old enough that we've seen everything in this movie before, in fact over and over and over again. And since we watched movies and TV drama thru the 70s, we've seen plenty of movies where ""no one won"". If you are young enough that all you've ever seen are sugar coated and deus ex machina endings, then maybe the ""no one wins"" ending is a surprise. To us it just invalidated the struggle of the characters we had watched throughout."

My god, this is a bad movie. That simple. I don't know what it is with the Cohen brothers, but their movies are anything BUT masterpieces.<br/><br/>First off: good camera angles and cinematography DO NOT MAKE A MOVIE!! There is a lot more to a movie then just the way it is filmed, for example, a plot, something most people would consider necessary in a movie. This movie is a collection of ramblings by Tommy Lee Jones and a lot of blood. That's it. Javier Bardem played a very good psychopath, but the movie did not make sense. At no point is anything explained. There is a lot of blood, shootouts, then all of a sudden Woody Harrelson pops out and plays some douchebag cowboy trying to get the stolen money or something like that, since nothing is ever explained.<br/><br/>Now, I don't know if the book was good, Cormac McCarthy is a pretty good writer so I hope it was better than the movie, because this movie SUCKS!!!

"Doylenf","6","2","6","25 October 2008"," *****POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD*****Gripping tale of a psychopathic killer has no ending...
","I have to give NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN a very mixed review.<br/><br/>For the most part, I agree that NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is a well executed crime drama, patterned somewhat after the much better written FARGO, in which the central character was a female officer. Here, it's a male sheriff (TOMMY LEE JONES) given to some armchair psychiatry aimed at trying to understand what makes today's western civilization (or lack of it) tick. He gets no answer from the script.<br/><br/>Nor do we get a satisfying ending to a story that is full of grim menace supplied by its main character (JAVIER BARDEM) who goes around dispensing with almost every member of the supporting cast.<br/><br/>Nor do the characters act in a way that makes common sense. This is the main trouble with the script. WOODY HARRELSON, for example, seems to walk meekly to his final destiny with the casual air of a man unalarmed by the situation after warning JOSH BROLIN (a man on the run) that he's up against a man who simply wants blood. Likewise, Brolin's wife accepts her fate meekly after stating that she ""knew"" the killer would show up on her doorstep.<br/><br/>It's taut with suspense most of the time with only a few spots that drag, but it's the inconsistencies of certain characters that gave the script some flaws, as well as a general lack of humor which made the dark happenings in FARGO more bearable.<br/><br/>The biggest letdown is the dry ending with no justice for the guilty man and Tommy Lee Jones describing a dream that has nothing to do with the events we just witnessed. Period. The End.<br/><br/>The very flat ending is the weakest part of all. But the performances of JAVIER BARDEM, TOMMY LEE JONES and especially JOSH BROLIN in a very unusual role for him, make the film eminently worth watching."
"dave_wlogan","10","2","6","21 September 2008"," Classy, Visual and Brilliant
","This film is the kind of movie I want to win the Best Picture Oscar. It carries great acting, strong visuals, great script, excitement and above all a series of themes. I believe 2007 was a very strong year for film and this movie is the best of the lot.<br/><br/>Firstly the acting in this movie is spot on. Brolin, Bardem and Jones with truly phenomenal performances. Bardem is the epitome of the psychopathic killer and completely sells it. Right from the start he is great. The first kill and then the second he just has such a menace about him. Brolin also shines here. But Tommy Lee Jones is just a wee bit better than Brolin. They achieve this brilliance through under-acting. In some films over acting is required but in this they brilliantly chose to go for the under statement.<br/><br/>The way the film is shot captures the isolation and emptiness of the landscape but also come across as aesthetically pleasing. Shot length isn't rushed and that is important to the suspense and action aspects of the film. Overall this film had a hell of a lot more visual presence than all the films of 2007. By Presence I mean that the shots look like they could be still photos or they convey a lot of information about the characters or the world in which the film is set.<br/><br/>This film's script is one of true class. Each character has been thoroughly written to perfection. All, even minor characters, have their personalities conveyed through the dialogue and plot, the acting as well but this is a pretty good script. The script got me the first time with the charm that Sheriff Bell has. His lines like, ""true story? I couldn't swear to every detail but it is true that it's a story"" add a sense of comfort that a grandparent would give. Even if it is a disheartening confession. As it is this is a colossal script.<br/><br/>It's the slow yet gripping pace set by the rest of the film which give the action scenes such force. By themselves they are brilliantly captured on film and epitomised by the suspenseful yet not climactic showdown between Moss and Chigurh. The brilliance of it is down to Chigurh taking away Moss' hope of ambush then Moss taking away Chigurh's hope for execution yet it ends in stalemate. In a formulaic movie this would have been followed by an end showdown bu the Coens brilliantly chose not to let the audience see Moss' demise.<br/><br/>This movie has several themes. The strongest being the nature of violence. This is shown through Chigurh's persona and Bells' contemplations. Chigurh commits violent acts for no reason and doesn't understand that he could just leave the situation alone. Bell acknowledges this fact and tries to understand why someone could be like this. In the end he finds there is no reason, its just the way the world is. The second idea comes in at the end when Bell discusses his second dream. He tells of how he and his father rode into a canyon and his father covered his face with his hood with no conversation between the two. On this I have read many different views, none of which are wrong. It's very open ended. But I tied it back to the beginning and how he talks about how he thought his father was proud that he was a sheriff at the same time as Bell. Yet in the dream there is no warmth between them, this could mean that Bells' father is not proud of him or that Bell has been a better man than his father. But Bell has always compared himself to the ""old timers"" who died or were crippled before retirement and it could be that he feels that he is now an outcast.<br/><br/>Anyway you look at it this film is very entertaining and provides food for thought. A MUST SEE!"
"johnnie0168","3","2","6","20 September 2008"," Cold and unfeeling
","If the point here was, ""ain't this a pretty cool way to kill someone?"", then I would have to say, ""Well, Yeah, it sure is different."" Other than that, what was the point? A string of morbid, cold, mechanical killings? Saw that in ""The Godfather"". Didn't like it then, either. Both of these movies were made for the misanthropes among us and I just don't happen to be one of them. I count myself among those who like to come away from a movie feeling a little better than when I came in. The Coen brothers entered cult status with ""Fargo"" and ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"", and so I guess I just expected much more from them than this. I have no problem with the performances or the way the movie was made. I'd just like someone to tell my WHY it was made.<br/><br/>Addendum; Since I wrote the above comments several months ago I have had somewhat of a change of heart. This is a movie that grows on you. The 'cold and unfeeling' opinion still stands, but the movie is much more than I gave it credit for being. The acting is superb throughout and the storyline and character development are both very strong. It's still not a 'feel good' movie but for the above reasons, I can forgive it for that."

","I just finished watching this film. I normally wait a day before telling anyone anything about a movie I've seen, but I couldn't wait to complain about this thing.<br/><br/>I've watched hundreds of movies. The more complicated a movie is, the more I like it. I love movies I have to watch twice because the twists and turns came so fast. Syrianna is a good example of that. If you want me to watch a movie, say ""I didn't get that movie."" I'm not against films where the good guy dies. I'm not against movies where everybody dies. Hell, I loved Reservoir Dogs. I would have been OK with the good guy dying in this one, but not that way, not without being there to watch. Not without some sense that his death was thought out.<br/><br/>The great potential with this film was for Louellen to kill the assassin. Great pains were taken to show that the assassin was indestructible. He even had a contingency plan for getting into pharmacies to take care of his own gunshot wounds.<br/><br/>Here's how it should have ended: Louellen's wife arrives at the hotel in El Paso just after the gunfight. The jacked up pickup speeds away carrying the last 4 Mexicans left alive. The sheriff walks out and takes his hat off to tell Louellen's wife he has been killed.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie plays out as released until the assassin goes to kill Louellen's wife. She refuses to call the coin toss, and Louellen springs out of the shadows and shoots the assassin repeatedly. The sheriff retires and explains to his wife that they now have a million dollars to spend. Louellen and his wife walk from the flaming house of his now-dead mother-in-law carrying a bag. Fade to black."

","I haven't read the source material that is behind this movie, so I don't know if there is the potential for a decent film hiding in there or not. I did feel like rushing the DVD out of my house and back to the rental store as quickly as possible and told my wife in no uncertain terms to never buy this for me as any kind of gift.<br/><br/>Why? I think it is an ugly movie, which may have only been made because the Coens are able to get a film, any film, done on a smallish budget and with the knowledge that there is a built-in audience for their movies. Seems to me that they recognize the ugliness of the movie by hiding several murders of key characters off screen. Money shots exist here and there, but nothing feels truly wedded to the narrative. The story itself just dribbles to an end but, for me, not a resolution.<br/><br/>I have no respect for writers that handle character arcs by simply killing characters as the story winds down. It is careless writing which doesn't respect character or the audience. I really enjoyed several other movies by the brothers and I hope they can somehow get back to quality writing and directing."

","There have been a number of well written negative reviews of this film, any of which are pretty representative of my view.<br/><br/>I go back to the beginning with the Coen films and have enjoyed many of them very much - I always especially enjoyed the look of their films, the quirky scripts, the entertaining acting.<br/><br/>Visually, the movie was as I expected - brilliant; very well filmed and edited (probably the main reason I rented it). The acting of course, excellent; mostly 'understated' performances designed to convey realistic characters - those worked well.<br/><br/>The story - lazy. A character driven story (but hey, it's really a chase movie) to be sure but the dialog wasn't strong enough to support a mostly character driven story and the story was too 'realistic' to be interesting (this is a movie, not real life). Not interesting, in spite of the tension created by the 'chase'.<br/><br/>Worst of all, the Coens have wasted and bastardized their film making talent by focusing on ugliness, cruelty, and violence. I know that violence has been a key 'selling point' in many of their films but this movie takes it to a new level, it's not even darkly funny anymore.<br/><br/>This is not the kind of film I expect to see the Coens making at this point in their careers though I don't know why my expectations should be so high for them - I don't even know them."
"griggs-2","3","2","6","14 April 2008"," Vastly Overrated- Falls short of Expectations
","First off, clearly to critics or viewers such as myself, the cast is exceptional. Tommy Lee Jones and Woody Harrelson are great and obviously Havier Bardem is a brilliant up and coming actor. However I wasn't impressed with the plot and found it to be slow paced, un-eventfull, and unexplained lacking several details. How can this deranged individual go from town to town killing people meanwhile the cops barely seem capable of obtaining a warrant for his arrest..<br/><br/>Also... It's not that original or fresh; a madmen in the middle of the desert murdering people on a rampage. Sounds like it wants to be more of an action thriller that Kurt Russell or Bruce Willis would star in.<br/><br/>Not Oscar worthy in my opinion."
"I_saw_it_happen","6","2","6","14 April 2008"," stunningly mediocre
","The hype around this movie was intense. After all, it beat out 'There Will be Blood' for a host of awards. And it's not at all a bad movie. But it's not all that different from a host of other action movies that came out this year. It's amazingly normal. One of the least compelling of Cormac McCarthy's works, practically written to be a simple action movie, and (despite all the talk about 'gratuitous violence') much more tame than most action movies I've seen over the last few years. I in no way wish to suggest that this wasn't an enjoyable movie, but it simply wasn't anything remarkable. Tommy Lee Jones manages a few quite funny lines, and far outshines anyone (including Javer Bardem) in this film. But the last bit of the film, in which Jones plays the protagonist, seems the weakest part of the film. As someone who watches lots of art films as well as action films, seeing someone make a pretty good action movie and then try to resolve it all with an art-house 'ambiguity' plot is disappointing. The Coen brothers did a much better job with violence, suspense, and historic America in 'Miller's Crossing', which was a far superior film to 'No Country for Old Men'.<br/><br/>To enjoy this movie, lower your expectations. It's not as wonderful as everyone says, but not half-bad. If you're expecting something great, you'll be let down. If you're expecting 'Fargo', you'll be pleasantly surprised."

If is the best hollywoood had to offer in 2007 I definitely do not want to view what came in second or third. Predictable from beginning to end, even though it never really does either. The only way this got votes for best picture was as an artistic fringe piece because as a motion picture it is not entertaining. As someone who has seen the 100 best movies ever made reaching back to the 1930's this would fall somewhere between 1000-1500th place. Truly a forgettable piece."

This was a decent film that certainly had its moments, was well acted and directed- yet the fundamental story was insufficient to manifest the inference of 'greatness'. I believe it would be advisable to go and watch this film with lowered expectations, I fear it has been hyped up by certain critics who aim to see genius in something that is simply something adequate for their own delusions of critical expertise.

"dorp-2","9","2","6","14 March 2008"," Very entertaining movie, but sometimes confusing.....
","For example: When Tommy Lee Jones (TLJ) is talking to that old El Paso sheriff, the sheriff mentions how it was strange that Chigurh had returned to a sealed off crime scene where a hotel clerk had been killed and that Chigurh had then killed a retired Army Colonel. What was that in reference to? I know there was an earlier scene where a hotel clerk was killed, but there was nothing about a later visit to that hotel or the killing of someone else there, let alone a Colonel. Also, when TLJ then returns to the El Paso motel that night, it appears that Chigurh may be hiding behind the room door (TLJ thinks he is). I took it that the Coen's wanted to give that impression for dramatic purposes, but that he was actually standing outside the motel in the dark just watching TLJ make his entry so that he could escape unnoticed with the money (I think the book has him watching TLJ's character from his car). Finally, the El Paso motel a/c vent that presumably held the hidden money that Chigurh found was so damn small that it wouldn't have held much of the stash, let alone the case that Josh Brolin's character was hauling it around in. That shot of the tiny a/c vent really blew it in my view. Despite some flaws, the movie was excellent. I didn't even mind the unresolved ending since it is more likely the reality of such situations."

I don't know much about the Coen brothers and the fact that this is their film doesn't been a thing to me.<br/><br/>I think that the basic idea, the story about a guy who comes across a bunch of dead bodies, drugs and 2 million dollars, is quite good. Javier Bardem is very good, convincing. And I like the part when everyone start chasing him, just because he went back to give that guy some water. The first half is tense, interesting and just when I thought that this movie is really that great, I got disappointed. The first half is actually good and interesting, but the second half... Help me, I'm lost.<br/><br/>In the second half, I cannot memorize all the characters, they all look the same to me and I don't even know who they are or what they're after. I get it that it's all about the money, but it's just all confusing. Maybe I just didn't quite understand this movie, but I wouldn't be 100% sure of that, because even if this is the big ""Coen brothers"" movie and they're all talented, there are things in this movie that just seem like they don't belong here. For example, the title, ""No country for old men"", I don't really know why it's called that way or what does it has to do with the sheriff's dream in the last scene. The ending was poor. I just sat there for a few seconds wondering: ""This is it?"" And the old guy in the wheelchair, is he supposed to be some kind of a wise man? Or how did Anton escape when sheriff came back to the scene of the crime after Llewelyn's death? And when did Anton get a chance to kill them all (the girl by the pool, Llewelyn and all the other guys around)? I watched it twice, and I'm considering watching it five times if necessary, but I think that, even if I watch this movie 100 times, I'm still not gonna like it...<br/><br/>I thought this movie was a lot better."

Cudos to Roger Deakins for the mesmerizing cinematography. Pay attention to the chase scene in the desert.<br/><br/>The themes touched upon are dark and gritty.

","I have watched their last film,before ""No country for old men""-"" The Ladykillers"" and i can say that The Coen brothers are back again.""No country for old men"" is a film about human nature nowadays.The leading character-Llewelyn Moss (played very good by Josh Brolin who had a very good year playing in ""American Gangster"" as well) is a guy who is blinded by the money.Ed Tom Bell(the great Tommy Lee Jones) is the typical old sheriff who understands that he is becoming more and more useless.The villains are now psychic masterminds and there is indeed ""no country for old men"".He is at the edge of his life and he is making the balance-a negative one. But I really think that this film is Javier Bardem's film.He is the memorable thing in this film.His character is the reflection of our age-no emotions,no exceptions,no rules,just some sick principles.Javier really got the idea and get into his character. Another thing I've noticed is the lack of sound,which if you watch the film you will understand.The noises of the desert and the guns are enough to express the dark background.I think that this is one of the few new films that have a lot of messages involved and it is a masterpiece of it's own age."

","When I first saw this movie I was quite pleased and thought that it may be one excellent film. Most probably I was overwhelmed by its beautiful cinematography. Then I realised that the film is pretty boring and completely empty. It reminds me of some books by Aldous Huxley, 'a minor master'  both consisting of one 'Idea' masquerading as good art. In both cases it feels utterly preposterous; aiming high but reaching low. The ideas here are nothing new, that is, chances and 'accidentality' of human fortune or misfortune, something Herodotus nicely wrote about, and of course, struggle between good and evil. Now the problem here is that there are no engaging people in this film; Chigurh is a too abstract an idea to be interesting to the slightest, the rest are not worth mentioning  they are so dull. Just to mention that Tommy Lee Jones is one of many actors who are only good at playing themselves, and quite frankly I don't think that I'll ever go to see any more films with Woody Harrelson. And of course the title is completely ridiculous  it may be attractive to some teenager who would be fascinated by these writer/directors' 'insight' into obscure literature of W. B. Yeats; but frankly I feel it as some empty 'grand' words with no meaning. All in all, this film is nearly complete waste of time (save the cinematography, like I said before) and another missed opportunity at Oscars. Two out of ten"
"YaumingYMC","9","2","6","9 March 2008"," If you thought that was bad
","The title of this film comes from first line in the poem written by Yeats called ""Sailing To Byzantium"". The poem is about how the Byzantium Empire, despite its magnificence, was slowly and surely crumbling into inevitable irreparable decay.<br/><br/>In the same way, this movie is about how the spirit of decay and destruction is coming into American Society. Its an allegory, mayhaps a loose one perhaps. But it will help you to see it as such.<br/><br/>The psycho killer like death is unstoppable. Towards the end, two characters discuss fate. It seems absurd, a random twist that serves no purpose in the story.<br/><br/>But nonetheless I liked this movie. It had atmosphere. It had soul. Sometimes that is good enough to make you ignore the other inconsistencies of the actual story.<br/><br/>The performances of all the actors were worth watching. The main villain was riveting.<br/><br/>As for some loopholes ... Why did Josh return back to the drug trade massacre scene? Answer -He wanted to give a bottle of water to the dying drug-driver. It made no sense and improbable. It was foolish and dangerous. But he was on a high after coming back with $2million. And humans sometimes do very dumb things."

","Woah, took way to long, can't believe they got an award for editing, coulda done with at least 30 minutes of cuts, drawn out scenes, could have done with a soundtrack, from brothers who use music so well, to leave that all behind. Could have done more to use plot, tell the viewer things they don't know at the end of the movie like who business man was, there should have a been a deal at the beginning or something showing where this all started, it just lacked a whole bunch of substance. Now I can't understand how this is being compared to Citizen Kane, and is tied for the most awards by one person at Oscar night. Lebowski, Fargo, Every film other than this deserves credit. This was a colossal faux pas, a waste of my time. Filmmakers like Kubrick and Scorsese haven't produced anything near as horrible as this, I hope that the coens next investment of time and money will be better than this. Into the wild, was a better story based on a book as well. Better book better screenplay no wins. Juno had better acting, plot, and soundtrack, but was ignored for being dubbed a comedy. As far as cinematography? Into the wild has more breathtaking scenery. Everyone I know male/female under 20 over 60, none liked it and found this movie pointless. A few older men who read the book liked the book but not the movie. I have yet to meet a person who enjoyed this film in reality. Bad, Bad, Bad, give us the lebowski coen brothers, or we'll cut off your Oscar!"

","Two hours of average action, and a meaningless ending. Only the slaughter machine and the sheriffs comments to his limited deputy gave some variety. I liked some aspects of this movie (parts of the end, a bit from the start), but all together I wished I wouldn't have watched it. Oh, quite authentic is the scene where the killer medically treads his wound. If you like violence you even might expecting more by the movie as well. Even good casting and good action couldn't hide that the story was lame. Maybe something got lost in the German translation, but I won't watch it in English to find that out!

You should not give this film too much credit, so that people won't have to be too disappointed when exiting the theater."
"Nergal","9","2","6","28 February 2008"," A fantastic film, well worthy of the praise it receives.
","For me, the Coen Brothers had been on a downwards slope since 2000's O Brother, Where Art Thou, which is certainly not to say it was a bad film, nor was The Man Who Wasn't There for that matter. They were both good films, but certainly not as good as what had proceeded them, and with Intolerable Cruelty it seemed as though the Coens had lost their touch.<br/><br/>To say that No Country For Old Men is a blazing return to form would almost be selling it short, it is quite simply the equal of any film that the Coens have made before, perhaps even a crowning achievement in a spectacular career, and coming from an admitted Big Lebowski fanatic, that's high praise indeed.<br/><br/>While most synopsises of the film will tell you that it's about a hunter who finds $2 million, and ends up with a cold blooded killer hunting him down, it's much more than that. It's mainly to do with the Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) who acts as narrator for us, his contemplations, realisations, and the story of the $2 million is essentially second fiddle to this character arc, because while it's pivotal, it plays out through Bell's interpretations. Killer Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) appears throughout the film like a force of nature, rather than a real person, and we never really get any insight into him, because Sheriff Bell doesn't understand him; he is a caricature of violence. Likewise, hunter Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) seems to be a much more well rounded character, because he is known by the Sheriff.<br/><br/>Now, while the story of Moss's flee with the money isn't exactly the point of the film, it's something told to us by the narrator as a catalyst for his decisions, it's still a remarkably compelling tale, and it's done so well that if you want to ignore the deeper arc of Tommy Lee Jones's character, and simply focus on the game of cat and mouse between Moss and Chigurh, I think you can do that and still come out of the film with a fantastic experience, and I would say that aspect of the film is what will bring people back for repeat viewings.<br/><br/>What the Coens have done here, is crafted what is quite easily their most tense, thrilling, and action packed film yet. The action is quite frightening at times in the way it plays out, and the tension in some scenes had me almost holding my breath in anticipation. Violence in No Country is similar to that you'd find in one of Takeshi Kitano's Yakuza thrillers, or David Cronenberg's recent films, visceral and authentic, serving to shock the viewer rather than excite them, and it's something I'd like to see more of.<br/><br/>Before seeing the film, I had read a lot in passing about Javier Bardem's performance, but he truly exceeded my expectations. I don't think I've seen anyone who absolutely extrudes menace like this before, you genuinely feel afraid for any character who in his presence. He actually manages to out-do Dennis Hopper in Blue Velvet, he turns in that disturbing a performance. That Oscar was well and truly deserved here.<br/><br/>Without wanting to gush, it's simply astounding how good this film is. The direction and cinematography is on absolute top form, and for once I think the Academy got it right in awarding those aspects, because every shot in the film is starkly beautiful and action scenes play out in sheer relentlessness, almost like in James Cameron's The Terminator, with a bleak overwhelming sense of dread always looming.<br/><br/>Overall, it's just a masterpiece, and I would highly recommend it."
"shafatqadri","9","2","6","28 February 2008"," Coen Brothers at their best!!!!!
","Bleak drama ""No Country For Old Men"" won four Oscars on Sunday, more than any other film, including best movie, director and adapted screenplay for brothers Joel and Ethan Coen.<br/><br/>I'm giving this film 9 out of 10 stars, because all the knowledgeable critics say this is a masterpiece, and I am an amateur reviewer with too much time on my hands, so what do I know? I may even post a second review once the dust in my brain settles...No Country lived up to the accolades for the majority of the film, with an unexpected ending that needs some in-depth examination to appropriately digest and appreciate. I intend to watch the film a second time to both enjoy the beautiful west Texas cinematography, top notch acting of Bardem, Jones, and Brolin, as well as concentrate on the implications of the ending.<br/><br/>I don't think No Country for Old Men has been released in India. Seems strange ehh? Or have I missed it, I m not quite sure but I managed to download it over the last weekend and see it :-) There is too much happening,a man finds 2 million dollars in the desert, after a drug deal goes wrong. He makes the mistake of going back, and is soon chased by other men who knew about the deal. Now it's a game of cat and mouse between him and a hit-man hired to take him out. Then there is the sheriff who is on their tails. I don't want to give too much away...<br/><br/>The Coen Brothers (Ethan Coen & Joel Coen) are back after a long time to the big screen in this intense blood soaked thriller starring Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem in the lead roles and Tommy Lee Jones plays the Sheriff who's seen too much blood shed in his time. All three give stellar performances, but it's Javier who stands out, as the heartless psycho killer on the lose. The intensity in his voice is enough to make you squirm. His portrayal of the assassin looking for the money is frightening and along with Bill from the Kill Bill films, one of the best villains of the past decade. Tommy Lee Jones is perfectly cast, be it seems like no stretch for him.<br/><br/>There are bits and pieces of dark humour throughout the film, which is a great way to let you relax after the intense moments that are everything else. Even with the bits of comedy here and there, No Country For Old Men is the most mature piece of work from the Coen Brothers. So confidently directed there is no musical score throughout the film. Instead, we are taken directly into this world. We are no longer watching a film, we are apart of the cat and mouse game. Right from the squeaking of shoes on a tile floor of a man being strangled to the beeping of a transmitter signifying impending doom. There is no need for music, the performance speak for themselves.<br/><br/>The Coen Brothers had previously reached a creative peak with Fargo, but No Country for Old Men serves as a new high for the directorial duo, and if Michelangelo can have both the Sistine Chapel and his statue of David, then surely the Coens are entitled to their two masterpieces; the classic Fargo and the modern No Country for Old Men.<br/><br/>Other recommended Coen brother movies: Fargo Blood Simple Burn After Reading"
"richard_sleboe","10","2","6","28 February 2008"," With good reason
","Reason has come to life on the silver screen. But not as we know it. ""No Country for Old Men"" brings us reason as described by Neal Stephenson in ""Snow Crash"". Reason is a weapon. But not just any weapon. It's the ultimate weapon, wielded by a mysterious man (Bardem) the Sheriff (Jones) thinks is not a man at all, but a ghost. Retired welder Llewelyn Moss (Brolin) fails to read the signs. He pays a stiff price, for a very unreasonable act of charity, when he comes face to face with reason. It's a hopeless endeavor to point out subtle scenes or magical moments, simply because there are so many of them. At the same time, this movie is much more than a string of scenes. Suffice it to say neither human law nor divine intervention have any way of stopping the sheriff's lonesome ride into the darkness. While the movie meets the high standards of superior craftsmanship and quirky humor we have come to expect from the Coen brothers, it also achieves a new level of coherence and subtlety. It's much closer to ""Blood Simple"" and ""Fargo"" than to ""The Big Lebowski"" or ""Intolerable Cruelty"". It's also a tribute to past masters of the genre. Just as Sheriff Bell tries to prove himself worthy of the legacy of long-forgotten law enforcement officers, the directors try to hold their own in the celebrated company of John Ford, Howard Hawks, John Sturges, or Fred Zinnemann. I think it's safe to say the old-timers would welcome the brothers at their table."

","I failed to see this movie when it first hit the big screen months ago. I was disappointed. Then I heard it was going back to theaters because of its Oscar Nomination. I had a second chance to see it on the big screen so last night I jumped at the opportunity and me and my brother sped to the theater and managed to see it. That was the first movie I saw in theaters in 2008, and let me say, it set the bar rather high for the other movies I will see in theaters in 2008. That movie was great. The acting was perfect. Every character was great and well-played. Even the bad guy was good, you even wanted him to make it at times just so you could see him more. Tommy Lee Jones is still a great actor. Although he threw me off at times, sometimes he seemed senile, others he seemed like the most sane guy in the world. Javier Bardem was excellent as the insane Anton Chigurh. Josh Brolin gave his best performance I think as Lewellyn Moss. Even Woody Harrelson changed my opinion with an unforgettable performance as the sharp Carson Wells. The storyline wasn't really original, but the Coen brothers managed to change it, add twists to it and whatnot and make it into something completely new. The only flaws with this movie were A. The timing. Some scenes went way too fast or were skipped completely. Other scenes dragged on a bit. Also the ending was VERY confusing, I had to look up the FAQ to fully get it. BUT this was still a GREAT movie. See it while its still in theaters. 9/10."
"Presumptuous","10","2","6","17 February 2008"," ""No Country for Old Men"", a Rare Treat
","The Coen brothers strike again with their new brilliant masterpiece ""No Country for Old Men."" With an outstanding cast and an anything but ordinary storyline, it's hard to believe this film could creep into the theaters without being noticed. But the film isn't just a bang-bang action thriller, for there's more than what meets the eye in this delicately crafted work of art. Conscience, decadence, the strength to act and to step down are all a part of the pinnacle of human nature that's illustrated in every character in this film. The movie opens with one of the most brilliant monologues in film history narrated by Sheriff Ed Tom Bell. Bell is played by the one and only Tommy Lee Jones who gives one of the many fantastic performances in the film. Bell is a law man in the lonely and desolate lands of Texas, where he and others are trying to track down Anton Chigurh, a merciless killer murdering random victims. Javier Bardem plays the sadistic psycho path Chigurh, stealing every scene in the film. When he appears on screen you can feel every muscle seize in your body, and when he speaks every hair will stand like prickles on the back of your spine when you hear him utter ""what's the most you ever lost on a coin toss?"" Amidst all the chaos in this perplex thriller is poor Llewelyn Moss, played by Josh Brolin who becomes targeted by the killer after he comes across a drug deal gone bad and takes 2 million dollars from the horror scene. Brolin portrays Moss with raw and real emotions, showing his moral contemplations and conflicts throughout the movie. These characters along with many others, including Woody Harrelson and Stephen Root, all play a vital role in this film. It's the choices they make and the actions they take that ultimately lead to their destiny. This is flawlessly conducted with intricate layers of superb acting puppeteer by one of the most amazing adapted screen plays written and two of the most unique directors in cinema history. As incredible as this film may be, it is not for the faint of heart. In between cat and mouse games and the eternal conflicts between right and wrong, the film has moments of being gruesome and absolutely terrifying, yet fascinating to watch; Sometimes you have a powerful urge to look away yet you can't keep your eyes off it. Between a beautiful complex adapted screenplay, powerhouse performances, and a chilling chemistry, ""No Country for Old Men"" is a rare treat. It's so unpredictable and superb it would be a crime for any one to pass up this dazzling Oscar buzz phenomena."

I simply don't understand what I'm supposed to feel after the good guy dies, the supporting good guy gives up and retires, and the bad guy walks off into the sunset.

That's the kind of impact the picture had on me, and it is very rare that a movie makes me take stock after I have seen it. I felt like I had experienced something when the credits were over and the picture went black. The biggest impact was Javier Bardem's portrayal of Anton Chigurh. I heard someone say that they ""Were actually frightened at what might happen on the screen every time he came on screen"" and I would echo the same feeling. I don't know specifically what it was, but I couldn't wait to see the movie again and I have raved to anyone that would listen about how great the movie is. I see that Javier got a Golden Globe for his role and I certainly hope he nets the Oscar as well. Smashing job by Javier and the Coen brothers and the best picture I have seen since The Departed.

","The long awaited new Coen brothers movie 'No Country For Old Men' is a mini masterpiece! <br/><br/>Josh Brolin (Planet Terror, American Gangster, In The Valley of Elah, The Dead Girl) is Llewelyn Moss, an everyday guy who while out hunting stumbles across a scene that has gone horribly wrong. He discovers a case of money which he takes and proceeds to become the films kinetic energy, pushing it onward. Javier Bardem (The Sea Inside, Collateral, Before Night Falls) as the mysterious Prince Valiant coiffured villain Anton Chigurh (pronounced Sugerr) feverishly seeking its return, flipping coins along the way, is brilliantly menacing. Tommy Lee Jones (In the Valley of Elah, The Three Burials of ..., Double Jeopardy) is the soulful, philosophical Sheriff Ed Tom Bell carrying the morals of the movie while Woody Harelson (Cheers, Natural Born Killers) plays a bounty hunter, Carson Wells, who joins the hunt to catch the relentless Anton.<br/><br/>'No Country...' is very noir'ish in its aura, It is put together in a most interesting way in what feels like a compilation of short stories. This opus is very scenic in that when there is a vista or some kind of landscape to capture, you feel its vastness, and when it is a confined space you are made to feel the claustrophobia. In 'No Country' you feel the heat of Texas, feel the tension when it is closing in, and you certainly feel the pain when it hits... But it also contains a sprinkling of the Coens trademark dry humour in well chosen places throughout. Well worth a look.<br/><br/>This notch in the Coen Bros' belt is easily better than Intolerable Cruelty, & Lady Killers - but they are a 'different kettle of fish' really. 'Old Country...' is the type of film that the Coen Bros are more known for and maybe 'expected' of them. It is 'Blood Simple' mixed with 'Fargo' and perhaps a tiny pinch of 'Big Lebowski' thrown in.<br/><br/>Don't ask me what I mean by a 'mini' masterpiece. Maybe I don't feel confident enough to say Masterpiece. Or maybe in my 'heart of hearts' I do not think it is totally deserving of this title, time will tell (some are stamping it a classic even now). But I can say it is a great yarn, some great action is install for you, terrific tension, acting (Brolin, Bardem, & Jones, Brolins wife, and mother-in-law), and overall... its certainly well worth a look!! <br/><br/>'No Country For Old Men' is an A+ cinematic experience."

No Country for the old men is a strange mix between a high tension thriller, a modern western, a black comedy and a philosophical tragedy. The thriller element is very well done. Javier Bardem plays maybe the best Psycho in years. I definitely would not like to come across his way in the streets. WIth only few dialog he has the power to carry the whole movie.<br/><br/>For the good ones TOmmy Lee Jones comes into 'action'. He is an old sheriff who can't cope more with the violence and the way of life of the modern society. Maybe he is right. The news now is much more filled with violent images then before.

","When I read the negative reviews for this film I am reminded that there is a tsunami like generation of people that do not care to think anymore. The corporate pandering to the young masses, the placating to the mindless who are satisfied with mediocrity, who ask for no better, and who's lack of intellectual curiosity has brought us precisely to this place, this country, this NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN. <br/><br/>A simplified theme in this film is much like the old saying ""God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference."" <br/><br/>SPOILER OF YOUR LIFE>>>- KUDOS TO THE BLOG THAT SAID ""IT'S AN ALLEGORY', WHICH JUMP STARTED MY BRAIN. it is Javier Bardem in a pageboy shroud. It is the Seventh Seal.<br/><br/>Death is inevitable. You cannot cheat death. You will not know when or how it is coming. Especially if you are a willing participant on the battlefield, as Lewellyn becomes when he decides to follow the blood money and take it. He sets the game in motion. Maybe even the black bag of money is a pawn in a chess game. That is when he invited death into the game. He begins as the hunter and becomes the hunted. All our choices in life lead us to our destiny. Many paths to take, but in the end Death will be there. You might be able to evade it for awhile or put it off (as Lewellyn manages to do when he shoots Anton) ,but, it will eventually find you. Sometimes sooner than you think. The older we become the more that we realize that this really is our fate, we are mere mortals here on earth, and we must begin to embrace or envision another existence. We will not win this battle. Bell asked the old man (Ellis) about a death.when did it happen. And he answered 19zero9. But Bell meant ""how long did the death take"" Was it quick and painless? And Bell begins to understand that this is something he cannot control, nor could his father before him. This ""mess"", this ""war"" is life and before we can ""continue"", past our hopes and dreams, we still must face it. Death.<br/><br/>Bell infers that this bunch of outlaws are the worstit's the worst of times and it was easier ""in the old days for the old timers"" and Ellis (the old man) tells him that's vanity. It is vain to think we can conquer all the evil in the world because maybe the point of good and evil is to give man his free will. Ellis says he doesn't ""got any of the cats. Some are wild and others are outlaws"" Ellis has learned to live with them. He isn't curious anymore about why people do the things they do. It is part of human nature. It is not new.<br/><br/>Bell reads from paper about shocking crimeswhat it takes today to get people's attention.. Green hair/bones in the nose. Nothing has changed. After every horrible school massacre they always say what they will do ""so this will never happen again"" And of course we know it will.<br/><br/>The characters that come in contact with Chigurh, some live some die, some are ""flirting with death"", without knowing it, as we all tend to do. Chigurh carries the air gun like a scythe, he travels from vehicle to vehicle, but those whom he needs the ""vehicle"" from end up as most in his pathbut getting the ""air gun"" the painless hit,, not the shotgun These people weren't really on the battlefield. Others have chosen to be on the battlefield, or in the battle (think about references to Namfrom Woody, from Mexican border guard.) And death is not always obvious, we do not see it coming, as we did not ""see"" the death of Moss. It came when we weren't looking, by unexpected methods.<br/><br/>Moss bought a coat and a beer with the blood money, which the guys made sure they saw and had in their hands before they gave the coat to him, even though it wasn't worth $500. ""Was he in a car accident?"" the guy asks repeatedly.Moss lies, says yes, but they still offer no help. He eventually ends up in a Catholic hospital which, tends to his wounds, and clothes him, in a humble robe, seemingly without payment. Which is what Jesus would do.<br/><br/>Moss is given several warnings not to mess with Chighur but in the telephone conversation with Chigurh he has a chance to save himself(remember the religious icons before him?) yet, he turns it down. He crosses the border and purchases clothesstill with the blood money and this is the shirt he will die in.<br/><br/>Later one of the young boys on the bicycle wears the same shirt. Chigurh offers money (bloody) for it and has them tie the knot, which keeps Chigurh or Death on the move. They tell him he has a bone sticking out of his arm, but maybe they are too young to understand the impassionate manners of death. After all, Chigurh has yet to bloody his boots through all this mayhem. The boy doesn't want to take money for itbut he eventually does, even refusing to share it with his friend and ultimately promising not to say they've seen Chigurhdenying death. But maybe this is just a symbol of history repeating itself. A boy who will in the end become a man who will encounter his brushes with death. Maybe he will take the path of Moss and it will come sooner rather than later or maybe he will follow the path of Ellis and Bell, and become yet another older and wiser man, who following the righteous path and living with the noblest of intentions, learn only one truth in the end. Death is inevitable."

Now to add to the list there is No Country For Old Men. Simply put, it's one of the best movies I've seen in years.<br/><br/>Based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy, it follows 3 main characters : Llewelyn Moss, who discovers the aftermath of a drug deal gone wrong, and takes off with the money. He's being chased by a killer Anton Chigurh who not only wants the money, but will kill anyone who gets in his way. Chasing them both is Sheriff Bell who begins to realise that what he's chasing is something he can barely understand.<br/><br/>The acting is superb. Josh Brolin shows here, as he did in American Gangster, that he is becoming a very good actor. Tommy Lee Jones gives another excellent performance as Sheriff Bell. Kelly MacDonald as Moss's wife shines in a small role, but the standout performance is Javier Bardem as Chigurh. Soft spoken, yet totally terrifying he dominates the movie.<br/><br/>The script gives all the actors plenty to chew on, with most of the dialogue lifted straight from the novel. It's a brilliant adaptation.<br/><br/>Directed by both Ethan and Joel Cohen, they keep the movie gripping, with some impressive shoot-out sequences. Roger Deakins's cinematography is stunning. The look of the open desert and empty locations is brilliant.<br/><br/>There has been some comments regarding a key plot moment at one point, and also the ending of the movie. Without giving anything away, I will say to those wondering, it is the same in the novel, but if you pay attention, it all makes sense at the end.<br/><br/>I don't think it's the best Cohen brothers movie. Personally I still think Miller's Crossing is their best. However this is one of the best movies to come from Hollywood in years."

","No Country for Old Men (which will henceforth I shall spell without an ""o"" or an ""ry""... and possibly without a ""No"", ""for"" or ""Old Men"" either) is entertaining only in the quantity of sewage Hollywood can pass off as meaningful, artistic film-making.<br/><br/>*Spoiler* <br/><br/>A Vietnam veteran hunter, played by Josh Brolin - ably demonstrating his ability to use the same facial expression and tone of voice in every scene, finds some dead Mexicans in the desert along with a ton of drugs and a case full of money. Being too stupid to think of anything else to do he takes the money and leaves. Later he returns so that the Mexican drug dealers can easily find out who he is. He escapes and goes on the run, pursued by a group of vicious stereotypes; a bat-poo insane hit-man (Javier Bardem) with a humane cattle killer; a large group of disposable Mexicans; a cowboy (Woody Haroldson); and, a hoary old sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) who spouts meaningless philosobabble while doing absolutely nothing about the mounting pile of dead bodies.<br/><br/>After lots of moody shots of the Texan countryside and a fair number of random murders by the hit-man (""excuse me sir, would you mind standing there like a lemon while I put this sinister looking device against your head""), Brolin's character is done to death (off screen) by the disposable Mexicans, who are, in turn done to death by the hit-man. He takes the money and offs Brolin's wife, presumably because he likes killing people. Then he gets hit by a car and wanders off into the sunset with a broken arm.<br/><br/>The sheriff goes to see his uncle who says that things were much better when his uncle was being shot by injuns in 1909 and we end with some funky dream analysis.<br/><br/>*End Spoiler* <br/><br/>This is the type of movie that will be considered ""deep"" by the kind of people who are now embarrassed by the fact that they used to think that the Matrix was ""deep"". No Country has all the depth and emotional content of a shallow puddle of warm urine.<br/><br/>The acting is universally terrible the storyline unbelievable and the ending unsatisfying. As noted, Brolin uses the same expression throughout the film. Bardem's character is invisible when viewed from the side. Haroldson has just enough screen time to annoy one before being killed and Tommy Lee Jones does his standard impression of Droopy the bloodhound.<br/><br/>Frankly if you want to you can read anything you want into this film, its a ""viceral emotive commentary on the violence of the human condition"", a ""no holds barred analysis of the choices men make in a world in which good and evil are no longer separated"" or, as I personally prefer ""a soiled pile of self-indulgent w*nk"".<br/><br/>Go on, you know you've got 2 hours of your life that you don't need."

"Matt_Layden","8","2","6","22 December 2007"," Confident Film-making From The Coen Brothers.
","A man finds 2 million dollars in the desert, after a drug deal goes wrong. He makes the mistake of going back, and it soon chased by other men who knew about the deal. Now it's a game of cat and mouse between him and a hit-man hired to take him out, with the sheriff on both their tails.<br/><br/>The Coen Brothers are back to the big screen in this intense blood soaked thriller starring Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem in the lead roles and Tommy Lee Jones plays the Sheriff who's seen too much blood shed in his time. All three give stellar performances, but it's Javier who stands out in the mix, as the heartless psycho killer on the lose. The intensity in his voice is enough to make you squirm. His portrayal of the assassin looking for the money is frightening and along with Bill from the Kill Bill films, one of the best villains of the past decade. Tommy Lee Jones is perfectly cast, be it seems like no stretch for him. Brolin surprised me, he carried the film very well and did what was needed to be done.<br/><br/>There are bits and pieces of dark humour throughout the film, which is a great way to let you relax after the intense moments that are everything else. Even with the bits of comedy here and there, No Country For Old Men is the most mature piece of work from the Coen Brothers. So confidently directed there is no musical score throughout the film. Instead, we are taken directly into this world. We are no longer watching a film, we are apart of the cat and mouse game. Right from the squeaking of shoes on a tile floor of a man being strangled to the beeping of a transmitter signifying impending doom. There is no need for music, the performance speak for themselves.<br/><br/>There many intense scenes in this film, one in particular is when we do hear that beeping sound, we anticipate what's going to happen. Great visuals and sounds are used throughout this scene. Along with that audio sound is the visual. An unknown predator lurking in the shadows. We can't seem him, but we can see the bright light from his gun. The cinematography is beautiful. Right from the opening scene, we get a sense of the world these people live on. The open range of the desert.<br/><br/>The violence is grounded. You won't see people jumping through the air wielding two guns as doves fly away in slow motion. The villain uses a compressed air tank to break into rooms and kill innocent people. Not only does the villain kill the so called ""bad people"", but innocent bystanders as well. The man is so psychotic that he will decide your life by the flip of a coin.<br/><br/>With all the good must come the bad. The film is indeed very good, but it can't get over it's own praise. The fault with films like this is that is rarely lives up to it's praise. While this film is indeed good and one of the years best. I wouldn't ranked it up there with films like Goodfellas or Pulp Fiction. No Country for some reason sat odd with me as the credits were rolling. I liked it a lot, but I wanted to like it even more. There was one scene in particular that caught me off guard and I didn't really like, but I can't say what it is without spoiling the film. Also the ending, this is the big discussion of the film. Many people loved the film up until the ending. Well, throw me in the boat as well because I did not dig it very much. The last bit of the film seemed to drag on. The characters had nothing left to do, the story was over, yet the film kept rolling on. It seemed like it was trying to go for some closure, but never really gets there.<br/><br/>All in all this film is great and certainly in the top ten films of the year. But, much like the character who can't call the coin for you, because it wouldn't be fair, I can't ""tell"" you to go see this movie...you have to call it (or see it) yourself."
"c_grown","10","2","6","20 December 2007"," Outstanding Movie !!
","Like a good cigar ""No Country For Old Men"" gets better with each draw. This is a film that is unlike most from the very beginning. The story is told slowly at first with a delicate crescendo to the climax. Then, like one of the characters in the film says, ""I knew this weren't over."" it is the last 15 minutes that makes this film truly great. To say more would be unthinkable.<br/><br/>The film is set in 1980. The writers are very specific about this for several reasons. Primary of which is the fact that the US is about to change. Drugs and technology are about to change society forever and for those of us that lived through that period, we never saw it coming. Indeed, the primary focus of this film is about the inevitability of change. That, and not unlike the Vietnam war, we are a bunch of strangers thrown into events out of our control being run by powers much bigger than ourselves. We can't stop it. Whether we survive this period or not is as random as a coin toss.<br/><br/>The writing, direction, cinematography and acting are all first rate. If Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones aren't mentioned on Oscar night, something is terribly wrong. Go see this film!"
"latin_cs_player","10","2","6","19 December 2007"," A real masterpiece
","I just saw this film yesterday night and I am still thinking about the characters and the film's ending. I have not read the book but I will probably read to see what are the differences. I think that the Coen brothers might just have surpassed ""Fargo"" which was in my opinion one of their finest works. <br/><br/>The plot of the movie is very linear and simple, but what really makes this movie outstanding is the characters who are deep and complex. Still, the character which will probably be most remembered is Anton Chigurh, played by Havier Bardem. This character is the baddie from the movie, and believe me he is bad. However, this character is complex which is rarely found in films nowadays. Javier Bardem truly outdid himself, this is his best performance, and in my opinion he might just have created the most memorable villain in film history.<br/><br/>This movie is a must see but don't expect a popcorn flick, because I did notice in the theater many people leaving very disappointed. See this movie with your full attention and you will be rewarded with great cinematography, great characters and performances."

All I can say about the end of the movie is you just have to use some logic and you can figure out what motivates Tommy Lee's character to retire after his experience on this case (he felt scared for first time in the job). I think he's seen enough evil in his lifetime and I interpreted the scene in the hotel where he sensed (and we knew) Anton was lurking in the room (closet i believe) that he sits on the bed since he had had enough and didn't want to look in the closet or under a bed for a psychopathic killer...he felt mortality and decided he wanted to keep enjoying life which is why he ended up retiring at the end.

"hnewstadt","10","2","6","14 December 2007"," No Country for Old Men as Political Allegory
","When one considers that this novel was published in 2005, that the film was released in 2007, and the action takes place along the Mexican border near George W. Bush's Odessa, Texas, circa 1980, it should not come as a surprise that there are deep parallels embedded in the story relating to current American policies and politics. In fact, I am becoming convinced that No Country for Old Men is a political allegory that is meant to be a direct reflection of today's geopolitical events. I still believe that the story is tied strongly to the themes of inner struggle, the Trinity, and good, evil, and innocence, but I now see a more direct political allegory layered with religious/philosophical images and overtones.<br/><br/>Ed Tom Bell is George W. Bush nearing the end of his Presidency. His father, an earlier Texas lawman, was/is George Herbert Walker Bush. Llewelyn is a born and bred American hero, he is also a Christ figure. He is a heartland American Christian. Llewelyn tells Carson in the hospital that he is a welder, a modern version of a carpenter, a joiner of materials.<br/><br/>Anton represents Islam. He is an Islamic terrorist acting according to his own philosophy and morality, contrary to the law (Ed Tom) and western cultural values (Llewelyn). If you doubt he is a terrorist, consider how he improvised a car bomb which he detonated on a city street in order to steal supplies from the shattered pharmacy.<br/><br/>The money is the money, but also represents the corruption of innocence. It's oil money, drug money, big contracts, however it is that great wealth may fall into someone's hands, corrupting one from a righteous path. Llewelyn found the money when he was diverted from tending his flock (the antelope herd), and backtracked the blood trail of the wounded dog to the scene of the carnage. The dog was certainly a sign of corruption and evil. The managers and businessmen were just that, oilmen, Halliburton and Enron execs, totally corrupt, doing business with Mexican drug smugglers and terrorists like Anton. The Mexicans are Mexicans, but also represent the broader third world influx moving across open borders. They are corrupting as well, and bring with them a new set of rules, their own values, and challenge the value of American life. One on one, Llewelyn sees the wounded Mexican wheel man as a brother, and places himself and his family at grave risk by going back to bring the man water. His reward for this kindness is to be hunted down by the Mexican's compadres. He is chased at dawn by the blazing light and machine gun fire of the jeep, and then by a devil dog, into the river - a baptism under fire.<br/><br/>Carson is a military contractor. He is hired to bring down the terrorist Anton. He has dealt with Anton before, on which side we are not quite sure. He is cocky and assured of his superiority. He underestimates his enemy and is killed by the terrorist. Llewelyn has a strong belief in his own abilities, his ability to survive, and his manifest destiny. Llewelyn is killed by the out-of-control Mexicans, running amok in Llewelyn's land, possibly at the behest of the corrupt business interests.<br/><br/>In the end, Anton goes limping off, banged-up, but still in the world. Ed Tom retires to his beautiful wife who is apparently untouched by these matters, while Llewelyn's wife Carla Jean is dead by the terrorist's hand. Ed Tom dreams and vaguely remembers the money passed to him from his father (power, influence, legacy), which he has somehow now lost. He sees his father ride by in the night, carrying a flame. Ed Tom dreams that his father is riding ahead to prepare a fire and make camp in the cold darkness ahead."

","While it would be somewhat accurate to describe No Country for Old Men as a ""guy movie,"" it would probably be understating the case; this is more like *the* guy movie. The Coen Brothers bring suitably low levels of sentiment and optimism to their remarkably faithful adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's grim novel, but they more than make up for it with a gripping pace, intensely visceral action sequences, and a worldview as bleak and unsparing as the out-of-the-way locations in which its events transpire. Set along the Texas-Mexico border in 1980, the movie chronicles an increasingly bloody cat-and-mouse game that begins when local good old boy Llewelyn Moss makes off with a suitcase full of drug money and doesn't end until a series of sleepy locales have been turned into battlefields.<br/><br/>The novel on which this film is based--like McCarthy's work in general--deals largely with the behavior of men turned loose from civilizing influences, and the Coen brothers manage to stay true to McCarthy's core themes while at the same time creating a cinematic rendering of the darker side of our existence that's nothing short of awe-inspiring in its totality. There's nothing remotely glamorous or stylish about the film's setting or its characters, but that little fact doesn't prevent the movie from being a visual stunner of the highest order. In form and style No Country for Old Men is as much a Western as it is a thriller, and the Coen brothers here take the expansive cinematography and murky morality of Sergio Leone's classic revisionist Westerns to their logical extremes. The atmosphere throughout is stark and dingy, shot through with the darkest of humor and blunt, uncompromising depictions of frequently graphic violence.<br/><br/>While I found the direction and the remarkably seamless adaptation of the source material to be the real stars of this film, that should hardly be taken to mean the acting isn't uniformly top-notch, as all of the principals involved throw themselves convincingly into roles that aren't exactly typical major-release fare. Josh Brolin makes a solid and relatable lead as Moss, and Tommy Lee Jones is more than competent as grizzled Sheriff Ed Tom Bell in a role that was practically written for him, but the most indelible figure figure here is easily Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh, the menacing human Terminator who leaves death and destruction wherever he goes. The hulking Bardem certainly makes for a physically imposing presence, but it's chiefly his emotionally blank performance that turns Chigurh into one of recent cinema's most memorable villains, a psychotic, remorseless, yet amusingly philosophical killer whose humanity is tenuous at best.<br/><br/>It's evident right away that No Country for Old Men is no ordinary thriller--from its jaw-dropping opening scene, it picks up a momentum and tension that it doesn't abandon until its conclusion. There are no wasted moments in this movie; from beginning to end it's masterpiece of atmosphere and setting. To create a film this intelligently and carefully crafted, and gut-wrenching and raw at the same time, is certainly not an accomplishment to be taken lightly, and my hats go off to the Coen brothers for pulling it off. In the competition for the title of best film of 2007, it's going to be hard to top this one."

Not so much that I can say about it other than how disappointed I was when the main character died off screen(partly because I've been waiting for him to make it big since the Goonies), I mean they don't even explain who took him out. My best guess is it was the Mexican dudes....<br/><br/>To compare this movie, the first Coen Brothers I've seen, I would say it was along the lines of 'Eye of the Beholder' or 'The Pledge' it was in no way a special movie.

"socrates99","9","2","6","23 November 2007"," What an accurate vision of the current West and some of its people!
","In terms of screen time, its probably Brolin, Bardem and then Jones, and they all deliver as if they never doubted their artistic choices for as much as a minute. Bardem probably comes away with the most mind-boggling performance. His 'psychopath' makes you wonder if he actually knew one. It's a little unnerving watching him intimidate people he encounters, but there's also something about him that convinces you, this man would survive. Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones somehow share the true center of the film, giving it the heart and familiarity we need to get entangled with Bardem. Every minute each one spends on screen is like a gift. Both have such a feeling and understanding for the characters they play that it quickly becomes apparent that there will never be a remake of this film, as rich as it is in story and drama.<br/><br/>I probably spent a couple years living out West, and, in my opinion, this wonderful film has pretty much distilled some of the more dicey parts of that experience to its essence. Brolin I especially recognize, and it was good fun to tag along beside his character as he makes choices few of us would have the guts to make. But the West is full of desperate people and there's no denying it."
"night_wng2000","7","2","6","22 November 2007"," Overall Good Movie, tho not for the average movie-goer
","It was good to see Josh Brolin on-screen again. I have always enjoyed his and father James's work. I can't believe some of the comments I read, especially one that totally overlooks Jones's character! His is one of the pivotal roles in the film. After all, his character is what the whole premise of the story is place on.<br/><br/>I liked how the Cohens cut from action/thriller type scenes, which dealt with the drugs and money, trailing Brolin's character, and back to Jones's character to how he was tracking the case. I also enjoyed how Jones portrayed his role, which showed the difference in crime fighting approaches. You can see his as being laid-back methodical thinking, basing his conclusions on factual evidence, against the ""Miami Vice"" type of hyper-active approach to go fast, making conclusions based on circumstantial evidence, and assumptions.<br/><br/>I also liked Bardem's character. However, I don't give him kudos for the style. I liked the way it showed his ability to evade any visibility, as well as glimpses of skills that proved he had to be a professional govt agent, albeit a rogue agent. I did wish there weren't lapses in the time-line, as others also commented on. If he'd shown me something better than Hannibal Lector, then my opinion would change.<br/><br/>What I didn't like, was the lack of any substance regarding the Mexicans, and how they were able to track the money. The question was posed, but left unanswered. In my view, that was a crucial point. Another was the build-up of Brolin's character, and giving us a major fall-off at the end. What happened with his wife? What happened with the police case? Jones's character seemed to give the impression that he had absolutely no concern, after he retired. I think any lawman would either casually follow an unsolved case that was still fresh when they retired, possibly staying involved, either actively, or as a consultant, if nothing else! I know some think/say that this movie wasn't intended as mystery/action. But, I think when there's as much left hanging at the end, as was done in this one, that it looks more like an unfinished story. You'll never hear Oscar suggestions from me. That's all bull, as far as I'm concerned. Everyone knows the quality of their own talents and abilities and the result of their labors. Oscars are only to hype an actors value,, and to me, it doesn't make any movie worth paying upwards of $10, to see the theater release.<br/><br/>However, even with my dislikes, I cannot ignore the fact that I was enthralled and entertained, which is why I rate it 7. If they could have done a bit better with the ""ending"" and shown a bit more in the middle, to clear up some confusion, I think it could be a 10."

As an adaptation of writer Cormac McCarthy's 2005 novel of the same name, it does a great job of bringing the suspenseful tale onto the big screen. With the great performances done by A-list powerhouses like Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, and Tommy Lee Jones, it is easy to understand why the Academy would grant this film the title of 2007's Best Picture. However, what sets this film apart from other thrillers is its psychological aspect that can leave the audience fulfilled yet puzzled. The dark nature of the world of criminals, hitmen, and killers is well represented in the rather bitter outcome of the story. No Country For Old Men is a movie that greatly captures the attention of the audience with its suspenseful and engaging plot.
Taking place in Texas during the 1980s, the movie follows the perspectives of three major characters: Llewelyn Moss, Anton Chigurh, and Sheriff Ed Tom Bell. After discovering the ruins of a Mexican drug deal gone wrong as well as a briefcase with $2 million, Moss (played by Brolin) finds himself being hunted by a gang of criminals and a vicious hitman. Enter Anton Chigurh (played by Bardem). This man with an unforgettable haircut and evil smile had been hired to retrieve the money, which he does by bringing mayhem to the places he visits. Caught in the violence stirred by the hunt for the briefcase, Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (played by Jones), a World War II veteran, must put a stop to the crime spree in his town. And so the story begins as these three characters' lives are intertwined in the suspenseful plot filled with murder and brutality.
As part of the audience member, it was hard to look away from the screen of the projector. It is expected that a story taking place in 1980's Texas would be filled with shocking violence and savage killings. The music's ominous tones also add to the anxiousness as no one knows what is going to happen when the killers are around. Anyone could die and anyone could live. It is like a coin toss of life. Although the gore may not be as explicit as mainstream horror movies, the blood and injuries and sound effects can instill shock into the viewers. The creepy performance by Javier Bardem elevates the frightening radiation of Chigurh's presence in his scenes. This coldblooded killer is wonderfully shown to be detached from society as his victims could only see the emotionless expression of their murderer. Even when injured, Chigurh showcases no feelings except for his determination to heal up and continue on the hunt. This vile antagonist is characterized exceptionally by the actor. Josh Brolin's performance of Moss allows the audience to connect and sympathize with his character. His unlucky altercation with the criminal underworld hits really hard as his entire life with his beautiful wife is jeopardized. It is within the audience's hopes that Moss is able to survive this quarrel and live happily with the $2 million. The blood and sweat and injuries that Moss gained throughout his run from the hunters would frequently make me question if he would die. Even in times of rest and safe hiding, I could only hope that no sudden danger will appear to threaten Moss' life. The performances of these two actors greatly depict how one's life can be greatly flipped upside down completely after a single impactful event. Tommy Lee Jones acts as the experienced old man of the story who is overmatched yet holds the responsibility of solving this crime story. Although Jones's character of Ed Tom Bell may not be the most enticing aspect of the movie, it still allows the audience to view the movie from the perspective of the law and other minor characters (e.g., Moss' wife aka Carla Jean). Bell's character is often seen dealing with the aftermath of a shootout or a crime scene, of which we are given more information about the chilling actions of the increasingly violent underworld. Jones brings home the performance of a respectable and lovable Sheriff who has to deal with a problem he is underqualified for. The audience can see the disturbance and hopelessness in Bell's eyes but also his attempt to make everything under control. The fate of these characters truly shows how in only a span of years, the world has gotten much more violent.
No Country For Old Men's violent action scenes are highly complimented by its suspenseful storytelling. The unpredictable fate of the characters brings a great psychological effect as the audience could only bite their nails and guess what would occur next. Ultimately, the film shows how uncertain life can be when it is involved in the violent underworld of crime. It is just like a coin toss."

","""No Country for Old Men"" is a well made movie. It's just not a very satisfying one to watch. The Coen Brothers are good film makers. They've made more than a couple of very good movies. One of the biggest elements in their good films is missing in this one: humor. ""No Country for Old Men"" is almost laughless. The humor is greatly missed because this movie is actually kind of silly. Javier Bardem just walks around like the Terminator. He's indestructible and, therefore, not very interesting. Josh Brolin's character is also not very interesting. ""No Country for Old Men"" is an unusual Coen Brothers movie because it doesn't warrant many revisits."

","I reserve 10 stars to only the cream of the crop of my subjective opinion. I also realize that I am leaving a review of a movie that came out over 10 years ago, but I'd like to leave my 2 cents just in case anyone cares, even though they almost certainly don't.<br/><br/>This is MY best/favorite movie of all time. Beginning, middle, and end are so perfectly aligned and executed. Every line, every cut, every performance is spot on. If you listen to the opening monologue and keep it in your mind throughout the movie, you can see how carefully done everything is. Thematically it is bleak, and very precise. The movie is not obscure or vague in what it is trying to present, but it also doesn't beat a dead horse in getting it's message across. The dialogue is extremely careful, and well-executed. The people who I have discussed this movie with who don't care for it take issue with the plot. The plot is very simple, and has very little to do with the picture. I understand that this isn't some people's cup of tea. Some people enjoy a Hollywood plot with everything settled when the credits roll, and that's fine. So if that is your thing, you might not like this movie, because it certainly won't give you closure, put a smile on your face, and help you sleep at night as you put your kids to bed during your miserable life. I would recommend any Marvel or Pixar movie to you (There are about 500 to pick from).<br/><br/>I don't like to compare books to movies because it's an entirely different platform, but you really don't have a gripe if that's your thing. The book is very well represented, almost to a T.<br/><br/>I've seen this movie probably 30 times and it never loses it's luster. It doesn't get better with every view, that's a cliche that I won't abide by. However, it remains so truthful, and it's message grows more relevant with each passing day for those of us who are unfortunate enough to be paying attention. ""Okay, I'll be a part of this world."""

"CubsandCulture","10","1","2","18 February 2019"," In retrospect this is truly a great film...
","When this first came out I wasn't all that impressed with the film. It seemed at the time to be just a exceptionally well crafted crime film that centered on a gripping cat-and-mouse chase. That's still true. The film is taunt and the tension is palatable. I think the reason that I didn't really connect with the first time is the Coen Brothers' humor is rather subdued in this film. The tale is darkly funny in places but it isn't laugh out loud the way, say, Fargo is. This isn't a complaint per se but the film feels a little atypical for the Coens.<br/><br/>That is not to say it isn't exceptionally well directed. The Brothers' beautiful and mathematical compositions are all over this film. Likewise, the film use of shadow is very reminiscent of their noir-ish films, ala The Man Who Wasn't There. Likewise, the script's reworking of the western conventions has a lot in common with how they like to turn genres inside out.<br/><br/>The best part of the film is easily Chigurh. There is dullness mixed with utter malice in his characterization. Bardem gives one of the most unnerving turns as this man of warped morality, the self-appointed hand of fate. The haircut is utterly terrifying in context.<br/><br/>I am so glad I gave this another look. It is a great film."

","There are probably no film-makers to match the Coen brothers with regard to the crime/thriller genre. From the seminal Blood Simple (1984), on to Miller's Crossing (1990), thence to the chilling Fargo (1996) and now, finally, what must be viewed as a masterpiece of cinematography, editing and storytelling. They've done quirky comedies and dramas along the way, but, for my money, nobody beats these brothers when it comes to thrillers that are also horrific.<br/><br/>A good story is a prime requirement, of course: score ten-for-ten, straight up. Then the characters: down-to-earth Texans and Mexicans, tough as nails, the good and the horrifically bad. They're all there in a cast that meshes beautifully to produce a relentless pursuit across the flat, almost featureless, quasi-moonscape of the Texas deserts and low-down border towns.<br/><br/>As the fade-in begins, there is the voice-over by Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) as the camera pans across the ochre plains and rocky outcrops, and you might think how appropriate the title is. You're right, but it's more than that, of course, being a metaphor for the times: a society almost ruined by drug-running, incessant murders and killings, and the mindless pursuit of money. This is the over-arching theme with which the Coens ring out the tragedy that unfolds as Sheriff Bell tries to catch up with Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) who's got two million dollars of dirty money that the bad guys are trying to find.<br/><br/>In a few words, here's the basic story: Moss finds two million at the site of a drug gang battle in the Texas desert. He takes the money and runs. Unknown to him, a sociopathic hit man, Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) is hot on his trail to recover the money and kill Moss. At the same time, Sheriff Bell is hot on the trail of Chigurh, who's left a series of dead victims along the highways and byways. So, Moss sends his wife, Carla (Kelly Macdonald), away to El Paso (with her mother) for safety reasons, and so that he can contend with the killer on his trail. And, none of them know that members of the Mexican drug gang are following Carla, hoping she'll eventually lead them to Moss.<br/><br/>Essentially, however, it's a story about the contest between Moss and Chigurh: the former, a Vietnam vet who trained to kill; the latter, one of society's nightmares who simply kills - on a whim, on the toss of a coin, and on principle. Bardem's performance is calmly devastating: never raising his voice, never displaying anger, never showing mercy. And professional to his very core. The most disturbing scene is his encounter, early in the plot, with an old clerk at a country gas station who inadvertently annoys Chigurh with an inane but innocuous question. Watching and hearing that exchange of words reveals everything you don't want to know about Chigurh and his penchant for killing.<br/><br/>So, while the basic story (drug gangs, gun battles, innocent victims, good guy-bad guy) has been done before, many times, it's the character driven nature of this story that makes it into a riveting thriller, helped along by the Coen brothers' expertise with camera, script, editing and sound. On that last point, this film is noteworthy with the almost complete absence of a musical score, an aspect that heightened the suspense - because, as the viewer, you're able to hear more easily the far-off sound of ominous steps in a corridor, characters breathing, the snick of a gun being cocked, and so on.<br/><br/>Most stories in film and literature end unambiguously. However, the final scenes between Bell, Ellis (Barry Corbin), the old-time deputy, and Bell's wife, Loretta (Tess Harper) seem to be completely at odds with the main narrative, to the extent that some viewers have been annoyed/infuriated with the apparent lack of closure, according to some reports I've seen. I'll say this much: from one perspective, there's a nod to the ending of Point Blank (1967); from another perspective, one must remember that stories are constructed and, therefore, are open to interpretation by the viewer. I have an interpretation that brings full closure for me. It's up to you to develop yours.<br/><br/>Thoroughly recommended, but for adults only. Has gruesome, bloody violence and a killer (Chigurh) with the kinkiest weapon yet put to film. Like I said, ten out of ten.<br/><br/>

"sked-74246","10","1","2","24 July 2018"," Setting the Record Straight
","This film is incredible, and those who are giving bad reviews simply don't understand the underlying theme of the Coen Brothers films. From Blood Simple to Hail Caesar!, the Coen Brothers are taking an existentialist approach, meaning they're showing their audiences the pointlessness of life and plans, which is why No Country for Old Men is so captivating, but also why reviewers feel that the movie has an ""empty"" plot. People often have a problem with the protagonist of the story loses to the antagonist, and then chalk it up to a bad plot, as if the writer/director hadn't seen this plot device for the 3-5 odd years they worked on the film. Ultimately, they've made a choice to kill the protagonist and leave the antagonist alive (also having us lose faith in the police officer) to give us a feel of existential dread, and further the idea that violence is not about the protagonist using it to restore balance, but it's about the fact that violence is not effective in real life. This is one of the reasons that Javier Bardem was cast in the role. When the Coen Brothers asked him to play Chigurh, he said he ""hated violence,"" and made them want to cast him even more. It's because they too hate violence, and wanted the audience to feel unsatisfied by the ending because unlike Tarantino, they wanted the violence to feel pointless and unfair. So ultimately when you watch Coen Brothers films, try to see them through the lens of existentialism, because they tend to find the ideas glorified in movies (ie. robbery, fame, mystery, murder) utterly pointless. It's what made Blood Simple, Miller's Crossing, Fargo, The Big Lebowski, and finally No Country for Old Men, so successful."

On top of that there's a police officer who doesn't accomplish anything. He just laments the violence. His commentary is supposed to root the events to something deeper, I guess, but the story isn't really that deep. It's basically about a quirky, random serial killer we don't get to know anything about. <br/><br/>I guess the book is better."
"valentinvolland","7","1","2","1 May 2018"," A western noir with a few flaws (very minor spoilers)
","This western noir film from the Coen brothers is not that bad.
The cinematography is great, as is usual with Roger Deakins who has cooperated once more with the Coen Brothers. I also like the minimalist score, which created a suspencefull atmosphere and is nice for a change as many films have a very noticable score, diverting at least some attention from the film itself and giving cues to the viewer as to what is happening (which sometimes is too comfortable). The actors do a very good job, even Josh Brolin who I normally dislike. Javier Bardem does an especially good job as the figurative 'angel of death'.
The main problems mainly lie in the actual story. While I personally do appreciate and like the unusual story strucutre and the anticlimactic ending, many people don't and see it as a flaw. However I do see quite some flaws in the plot and in the characters. Besides a few plotholes (as I see them) I just don't see the point of certain characters (especially Woody Harrelson) in terms of their contribution to the story and the themes of the film. They are basically pure decoration to the story and could have been excludes without effect on the story. Furthermore while I find the themes of the film to be intriguing their depiction could have been better and have not been deeply explored. I have seen better films tackling such themes as coincidence, chance, morality and nihilism. 
On a side note, I find the depiction of Mexico to be rather stereotypical (and not in an ironic way). Some people have metioned this film has a (stong) comedic side which I can't confirm, I only laughed two or three timed throughout the film. For anyone who can't see blood, this may not be your type of film.
Having said all this, I did enjoy watching this movie and I wasn't bored."

","No Country For Old Men was the film viewed, the film is about a man named Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin), who happens to stumble across a dark and dangerous situation, and is being tracked down. Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) was a somewhat psychopathic, yet determined force that stops at nothing to accomplish his goal and track down Llewellyn. Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), he is an iconic town sheriff, who questions society and is on a mission to figure out who is causing the trouble in his town and locating and protecting Llewelyn Moss and his wife. The theme of this film would be, something that may look like a lucky find or a dream come true, may have a dark force following it and may stop at nothing to retrieve that find. 
The film No Country For Old Men uses strategic camera angles to pass the emotion that the director was trying to convey. Some examples of this includes the close-up's as Anton flips a coin or speaking to a victim., in addition another great example of the skillful camera angles includes the close up of Anton's feet and/or gas tank as he walks up to a door with his Captive Bolt Pistol, the camera focuses in on his face quite frequently, this increase suspense and also focuses on his dark side and psychopathic goals . 
The lighting used in this film played an important role in conveying the story. The lighting was very helpful in conveying the dark side of Anton Chigurh to the viewers. Some great examples of the skillful lighting techniques are seen when Anton pays a visit to Llewellyn Moss's wife, as she walks in he is sitting in a shaded dark corner of the room waiting for her, this shot built a lot of fear, suspense and a slight sense of nervousness. 
Based on the theme of this film, another film comes to mind, which also happens to have a very similar theme, the film that seems to share this similar theme is Pulp Fiction, this film shows share the fact that it a has charactered two characters that are similar to Anton Chigurh those characters are Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L Jackson), these characters share the psychopathic yet determined drive and share a similar goal to retrieve what was stolen, while maintaining a dark tone throughout the film.
The film did a great job building on the theme, with very skillful camera angles and very skillful lighting techniques. To add to the success of the film, the cast that was chosen was a truly talented group of actors, they played the characters in the film almost perfectly, these successes alone was a few reason why this film could be considered a true classic."

","The Coen brothers bring the 2005 novel, No Country for Old Men by, Cormac MacCarthy, to life in the most gruesome, homicidal, and brilliant way possible. Although it initially could be classified as a ""western"", it is also so much more. It is also an adventure, thriller, drama, and a crime film as well. You will enjoy this intense and unpredictable film no matter which movie genre you prefer. <br/><br/>The movie follows a man named Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), down on his luck, who stumbles upon the deadly aftermath of a drug deal gone terribly wrong. Among the carnage he finds a briefcase of two million dollars and makes the ill-fated decision to steal the money instead of reporting it to the police. From that first moment on, he is hunted by the crazed psychopath, Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), who has been hired to get the money back. All the while, the local Sheriff, Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), investigates the crime scene and is soon after both of them trying solve the case. <br/><br/>This movie is a ""one-of-a-kind"" because it uses scenes of dark humor with minimal dialogue coupled with extreme violence and gore to tell its story. One scene that illustrates this perfectly shows Anton Chigurh holding someone at gun point and contemplating whether to kill them. The scene then cuts to Chigurh checking the soles of his shoes for blood, telling us that the deed had been done. Tommy Lee Jones's character, Sheriff Bell, adds some, much needed, dark humor to the movie without any dialogue at all. In one scene Bell walks into a trailer where people have been murdered and just sits down on the couch and drinks some milk. It is so bizarre and unlike ""normal"" police behavior that it is funny. <br/><br/>Casting decisions for this film could not have been more spot on. Javier Bardem plays the role of a remorseless psychopath perfectly. From his horrible haircut, to the way his, deep, breathy and monotone voice gives you a sense of doom whenever he comes on the screen. In addition, Josh Brolin does an excellent job playing Llewelyn Moss, a desperate man on the run who you actually start to feel bad for and almost forget that his greed led him to be in this situation.<br/><br/>Overall this is a fantastic film that puts a gruesome twist on classic westerns. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves thrillers with dark humor to break up the serious nature of it. The Coen brothers really hit it out of the park with this film and the four academy awards that it won proves that it will be remembered for a long time as one of the greats."
"filipemanuelneto","5","1","2","20 February 2017"," A great drama with Javier Bardem showing his value.
","This film is about a man who discovers a lot of money next to a slaughter between drug dealers, deciding to immediately take it of knowing, however, that someone will try to recover it. Its a very strong film, violent and a little difficult to digest. The reason for the title is not immediately evident but it ends up being perceived with the progress of the narrative. Beginning in a very elegant way, this one develops in a intensely and densely, constructing suspense around the three central characters. The ending, however, seems a little too sudden after so much dramatic tension, and so we get a little dissatisfied and expecting something more that never comes. The central characters are assured by Josh Brolin, Tommy Lee Jones and Javier Bardem. The three of them were excellent, each in their own way, but Bardem stood out as a villain, with a deep, somber interpretation but holding the entire film around him. I believe that with this film Bardem has proved himself to be a great talent and has a promising future if he knows how to run his career well. The leadership is assured by the Brethren Cohen, in a dense register and away from the sarcastic comedies to which they have accustomed us."

","Can't believe the bad reviews this film is receiving. Granted it is not an easy watch, with some graphic violence and an unconventional story line which doesn't conform to normal rules which can be unsettling on the first watch, but it has so much else to commend it that it certainly warrants a viewing. It probably helps if you are a Coen brothers fan, as I am, the dialogue is typical of their style, very dry, black humour throughout that helps offset the tense and grim goings on. The acting is great , especially Tommy Lee Jones , James Brolin, Woody Harrelson and of course Javier Bardem as a truly chilling killer.

","No Country for Old Men is probably the only neo-Western on film to be successful as a feature. The Coen Brothers love their mystery, where the story doesn't seem to have a clear end in sight for the protagonists, and this movie is like a post-modern Western that builds upon the aesthetic foundations of John Ford's westerns like The Searchers and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, except No Country for Old Men is set in 1980 and the update is terrifyingly fitting for the story. Not much has changed, and the Texas setting shows that the morale of the Old West has been preserved by men like the ruthless Anton Chigurh.<br/><br/>The Coen Brothers create a world they explore fully regardless of the genre; The Big Lebowski used stoner comedy tropes in the midst of a neo-noir comedy setting, Burn After Reading was a black comedy showing regular (and ignorant) people blackmailing exposure of CIA-operatives, and No Country for Old Men is a Western that has the same atmosphere as the genre-classics except it's a generational update with the same morality of the Old West.<br/><br/>It's an entertaining and, at times, uncomfortable story exploring greed, and how the changing of the times shows the sad difference of ideologies between the old and the young, hence the title."
"smatysia","6","1","2","9 January 2016"," Memorable dialog
","Well, a lot of very strong opinions in the comments section. I'm guessing that the Coens would consider that a success. I thought that the film had some very strong points. Excellent acting from Jones, Bardem, Harrelson, Brolin, and Kelly Macdonald. Nice photography and sets. (I'm pretty sure that I have stayed at one of the hotels in Las Vegas, New Mexico that served as one of them) Some memorable dialog, that may have been lifted from the McCarthy novel. Some of the extreme nihilism was a bit off-putting, but that was obviously the point. A big problem was the ending. I hate to criticize a film for being unconventional, because formulaic endings can be bad, too. There is definitely a place for films with ambiguous or undeveloped endings, although that place is usually in French art-house cinema. I did find it in need of more of a point. Perhaps I missed it."

","This movie starts out very good. All of the scenes are well done and shot at a high level. The acting is very good too. As the movie unfolds, it definitely keeps your interest and remains compelling. In the beginning, you overlook some flaws because of the amusement, good acting, and entertainment, thinking they are going to be a bare minimum. But as you progress towards the end, one major big flaw keeps arising, and it starts to become a joke and the film loses credibility. In a nutshell, ask yourself, ""How can a serial killer who has been known and found out from the very start of the film, in an age of radio, television, and phones just go wherever he wants whenever he wants and nobody recognizes him or reports him? How can the FBI and police force not catch up to him after all those days and weeks?"" Haha. It's hilarious. If you think about it, it is one of the stupidest plot holes and oversights you might have ever seen. And this is just the tip of it. You can go into more details too. I say, ""It's like he's the ""invisible man"""". Then there is how everyone he is out to get acts stupid and have no powers that most humans have intellectually. They lack reasoning skills. Moss, at times, does, but only at times, and eventually he succumbs to the stupid nature anyone who isn't a serial killer seems to possess. Lol. It's a good movie, but the lack of realism in the story that this guy just keeps getting away with everything is ridiculous and way too far fetched. Last but not least, you will absolutely hate the main character, and when you view the end, because you hate him so much, and watch him get away from law enforcement for the 100th time (like they don't exist Lol), there's a good chance you should and will hate this film. Still, professionally, it is a well made movie with good acting, cinematography, and overall interesting story so 6/10. You want to like these overrated Hollywood movies, but they just always seem to let you down."

It's like they're really learning deeply from their experience from time to time. Maybe sometimes they create a movie that has a score degradation, then years after, they got a high score movie again.

How they create an art (movie) was just unmatched beautiful and new-aged also unrepetitive.<br/><br/>NCFOM is one of the best crime movie in early 21st century. It is thrilling, original, funny, and beautifully written. Thats what i like from coen brothers. They made a joke which mostly creative and intellect based on the character's script. Im not losing even a piece of grit when i watch this movie. It's somehow cold-blooded and unpredictable. 3 of the lead characters doing a beautiful performances. From every aspect, this movie is above average (but not high). Maybe a little bit plot holes will do, but it's Hollywood typical nowadays, don't mind it.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie.

"Rickting","10","1","2","26 November 2014"," A triumph for all involved
","The best picture Oscar doesn't actually mean as much as it should. The films which win that award are usually pretentious, overlong, aren't actually the year's finest film and lack true punch. No Country For Old Men, which won the award in 2007, proves that academy voters aren't a load of pretentious film snobs and it's a pretty brave choice for the award. It's also the right choice. This exploration of evil, law, Religion, fate and morals wrapped up in a nail biting cat and mouse thriller is a masterpiece and one of the decade's best movies. Some will dislike it due to its blunt refusal to stick to conventions. It has something on an anti-climax. The Josh Brolin protagonist never actually meets Javier Bardem's hit man and dies off screen. Bardem gets away and the film ends with Tommy Lee Jones talking about a dream. Joel and Ethan Coen were defying convention in a very audacious manner so this doesn't undo all the brilliance that came beforehand. NCFOM will be a frustrating experience for some, but most will probably like it. It may require a couple of viewings to understand.<br/><br/>Apparently the screenplay is very faithful to the novel and much of it was copied, but it's still a fine screenplay. Many of its themes aren't obvious without close analysis but the emotional impact and haunting nature of the film is undeniable. The direction is something else, and this might be one of the tensest and most visually stunning thrillers ever made. The Coen brothers successfully create some of the best motel scenes since Psycho and make a bowl cut absolutely terrifying. The acting is great all around, but Javier Bardem is terrifying and hypnotic as the villain. The film has a sense of humanity and depth, it looks amazing and it's thrilling and gripping from start to finish. It's an incredible movie and essential viewing for Cormac McCarthy fans. It may lack a hugely satisfying conclusion, but sticking to conventions all the time can be incredibly boring. Definitely one to watch. Just don't expect to look at a motel, a bowl cut, a coin flip or a captive bolt pistol the same way again.<br/><br/>10/10"

Sometimes, when I see the movie, some bad guys looks so nice and attractive. For example, the Joker, in Dark night, and Anton Chigurh, who is the murder in this movie. Someone said he just killed people with nothing. Actually, 'Yes'. I think, he think the world can be explained only 2 ways, and life is always be continuity of coincidence. This sounds nonsense but, this make him as 'Him'. And, personally, I really care about BGM all the time, but in this movie, there is no music at all. I usually think that no music, cannot express deep emotion, but it was wrong. One each, single line has the moment which I can think about it deeply. Actually, this was so good to me.

","A teacher of mine highly recommended me the movie. So, I bothered to download it. It was a great watch! Very gripping and unpredictable. It's an action-thriller and I understand why the critics felt that it's one of Coen brother's best work. The story takes place in 1980 Texas. It starts with a man, who stumbles on a fresh, drug carter crime scene. He finds a bag containing 2 million dollars and he decides to take it. A decision he surely regrets at a certain point. The rightful owners of the money starts coming after him and his family. And they aren't playing fair. I loved the mysterious Antagonist and his methods of assassinations. The ending was abrupt, however, I enjoy abrupt endings. The characters were quite well rounded and everything pretty much went hand in hand."

He has no idea that a serial killer played by Javier Bardem is after that money. The film becomes a cat and mouse game between Brolin and Bardem. Bardem is chilling in this supporting role. He is a killer who can't be reasoned with. The direction from the Coen's is masterful. So many well crafted quiet scenes where you are holding your breath explode into violence. The screenplay was so well done and constructed very well. You are on the edge of your seat most of the film. Tommy Lee Jones is also great as sheriff trying to track down Bardem and warn Brolin's character. The cinematography is amazing to look at. The performances were great. Especially Bardem in the Oscar winning supporting role. It totally deserved best picture at the Oscars for 2007. I highly recommend this film."

And let's take a second to just commend Javier Bardem for some disgustingly amazing psychotic characterization. One of the best supporting roles I've ever seen in film hands down. <br/><br/>Coen brothers this is your gem. Your crowned Jewel. And you rightfully won Best Picture, Best supporting actor, and best adapted screenplay, and best directing. And that's what I love about them. They do it both, writing and directing.

","I read all of these one star reviews and you have to wonder, have any of these people ever read a great book.<br/><br/>The Coens think their audience is intelligent. What a sin in world where a Michael Bay picture grosses a couple hundred million and makes no demand that you use your brain ever.<br/><br/>I recall a complaint about this movie from a friend. They didn't like that the good guy dies and the bad guy gets away. There is no good guy or bad guy in this film. Tommy Lee Jone's character is the closest thing to a good guy, but he is an observer and has absolutely no impact on the story.<br/><br/>Our, ""hero"" is not a good guy. He is a guy that attempts to steal 2 million from a drug cartel. This is always a bad idea and his actions tempt fate and put the people he loves at risk. Our, ""bad"" guy is not a guy, but a force of nature. He is every hurricane, tornado, earthquake, stray bullet from a drive-by, and he is a 1,000 man deep army for the drug cartel. He is death, and if you see him, you are dead. A ghost that flips coins if you meet by chance or chases you to your end if you get in it's way.<br/><br/>Our hero also thinks you can show compassion in a game where there is no tolerance for compassion. A simple gallon of water, a kindness, is his undoing. He doesn't understand the rules of the game.<br/><br/>The title is a big clue too.<br/><br/>This is a film about fate. How it may find you if you are hiding, but it will certainly find you if you tempt it. It's about knowing your place in the world. And by the time you notice there is no place for old men in the new game, you are the old man. But the game never changes. You do.<br/><br/>The script is as tight and as perfect as anything I've seen in years, and I try to see every movie of note. And the cinematography is flawless and endlessly interesting.<br/><br/>The violence is there for a reason and has to be there. ""A Clockwork Orange"" distracted you from today by pretending this was tomorrow. ""No Country"", uses a similar device in some respects. The horror of cartel crime circa 1980 is nothing compared with today. Only maybe we are not really looking, then or now.<br/><br/>There is so much more. But I think you have to want to find it. <br/><br/>I do find it amusing to think of this movie as a little bit of a response to the main theme in, ""Barton Fink"", for the Coens have made a big, ""wrestling picture"" this time."

","The 'country' is the US-Mexico border (more specifically West Texas) and, for anyone involved in the drugs trade, they are unlikely to become 'old men' because the attrition rate is so high. It is clear then that this is a movie with a high body count but, in the hands of the talented Coen brothers (Joel and Ethan), the story of a drug deal gone wrong is told with a superlative mixture of drama and style that won the film four Academy Awards including Best Picture.<br/><br/>On this occasion, although the Coens as usual wrote as well as directed (and co-produced), they were adapting an original work, the 2005 novel by Cormac McCarthy. So they are McCarthy's characters but the Coens' choice of actors is superb.Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin and Woody Harrelson are excellent and Javier Bardem is - not withstanding a weird hairstyle - simply wonderful as the unstoppable killing machine with a fondness for coin tossing.<br/><br/>It is not always clear what is happening but the action quickly moves on, so one has no time to ponder on the confusion.

(Even though a second view helped me get a better handle on the whole arc of it's events.) <br/><br/>It's creepy from moment one. The whole atmosphere is like the ends of the earth itself, whether Josh Brolin is out hunting, at home or in some rented room for a while. You probably have an advantage if you haven't read the book, I guess, not having read the book yet myself. The knowledge of what is going to happen from scene to scene would have only ruined the ability to take all this in and not process the action (and actions of the folks involved) the wrong way. Meaning, some events that are pure cliché in most films don't happen here, at least not nearly the way one might think they will. Expecting formula fare from ""No Country For Old Men"" is like trying to buy vending machine candy from a gasoline pump. <br/><br/>The Oscar winning Javier Bardem redefines the word intimidating for the early 21st century, as his murderous robot of a criminal shows all the emotion of dry ice. The aftermath of people taking their eyes off what should not be ignored at all leads to lethal consequences for so many. Brolin and Bardem are pretty much polar opposites in this tale, but share a resilience that keeps their wounded men going when most males would run screaming into a police station to end this descent into sheer torture."

I would just like to add that I enjoyed watching the movie and that maybe the idea behind it, it's that there isn't any particular reason for the events displayed besides the money, weather is motivated by greed or despair. Maybe the screen writers on this movie tried to make it simple and focused on the characters in the present situation without giving us a backup and a Philosophical, Mystical or Ethical reason for their behavior.<br/><br/>Sometimes people NEED to have a reason, we all love conspiracy theories and complex plots because it brigs up more drama to the whole situation, but the way I see it, it's not necessary, because we can read it or see it on the NEWS every single day: People getting killed, kidnapped, beaten up or whatever for no apparent reason besides being on the wrong place at the wrong time. You know people DO a lot of crazy stuff for money (if you don't believe me just watch any ""Reality"" TV stupid show on MTV or any other channel) So why not have a guy just trying to keep a big amount of money, a crazy strange psychopath murderer trying to take it away and a Sheriff who maybe didn't really give a rat's ass about the situation (since he was retiring anyways) just doing what they think is the best for them???

"HelloTexas11","8","1","2","19 May 2009"," exciting, thought-provoking Coen Brothers' film
","A riveting and intense movie, 'No Country for Old Men' can apparently be seen on a couple of levels. I'm afraid I only saw it on one, that of a conventional chase/thriller done with style and intelligence, with some unexpected twists and turns. It's also quite gory and violent; it would be hard to argue though that the violence here does not add to the film's characters and its story. Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh ranks right up there with Robert Mitchum's Max Cady ('Cape Fear') and Dennis Hopper's Frank ('Blue Velvet') as one of the creepiest, most malevolent bad guys ever to stalk across the silver screen. Like those classically evil characters, he is relentless and ubiquitous, seemingly impossible to kill and without a shred of conscience. Chigurh exists for one reason: to kill in cold blood again and again. Virtually none of the people he kills pose any sort of threat to him personally; he could find out what he wants and be on his way, but it appears that if someone has seen him and spoken to him, a code of sorts within him demands the person be killed. Yet occasionally, the person isn't, for reasons never made clear. A couple of times in the movie, he lets a coin toss decide a person's fate. Chigurh's prey in 'No Country for Old Men' is Llewelyn Moss, played with taciturn toughness by Josh Brolin. I think the main thing that makes this story work is the fact that Moss is almost a match for Chigurh. While many of the rest of the people we meet in the film are simply mowed down by Chigurh, Moss proves to be a cunning and resourceful foe, at one point even turning the tables on the seemingly invincible executioner and shooting HIM. The third main character is Tommy Lee Jones' Sheriff Ed Tom Bell. As always, Jones is fascinating to watch and gives a fine performance, but I found myself wondering how many times he's played the same role. 'The Fugitive,' 'U.S. Marshals,' 'The Client,' even 'Men In Black'... they're all essentially the same character, a cranky but endearing authority figure with a droll sense of humor. It's a character that wears well though, and nobody does it better than Jones. Here he is investigating the murders and Moss' disappearance though he stands apart from the action, wryly commenting on the case and life in general while never actually encountering Chigurh. The plot concerns Moss chancing upon a satchel with two million dollars in it at the scene of an apparent shootout between two rival Mexican drug gangs, at a remote spot in West Texas. All the gang members are dead save one who is badly wounded. Moss makes off with the money but quickly discovers others are after him to recover it. Chigurh works for one of the gangs as their prime hit-man and thus begins his pitiless and unrelenting cross-state pursuit of Moss and the stolen loot. Moss ingeniously escapes time and again, and Chigurh just as ingeniously tracks him down to his next hiding place. (Pity the poor motel clerks wherever Moss chooses to hole up; they almost always fall victim to Chigurh.) The ending is 'unconventional,' as they say, but hey, it's a Coen Brothers' film... what do you expect? I'll leave the existential explanations of 'what it all means' to someone else and say, to me, the lesson of 'No Country for Old Men' is that nobody just forgets about two million dollars."
"ajmelck","7","1","2","16 May 2009"," Respect, yes; love, no.
","The Coens' scattershot approach to film making means that you never know what's coming next: good comedy, bad comedy, torpid thrillers, electrifying, genre-busting thrillers or perfect, ice-cold artworks like No Country for Old Men.<br/><br/>In many ways it's a work that reminds me of Cronenburg's A History of Violence in its subject matter, its emphasis on the arbitrary, inexplicable nature of existence and its deliberate withholding of information from the viewer.<br/><br/>And it's this last point, the withholding of information, that truly reveals the Coens' greatness. In his recent book How Fiction Works, James Wood states that this is exactly the strategy that Shakespeare uses to raise his plays above the level of other revenge tragedies. Essentially it is because we don't know why Lear and Othello and the rest do it that they remain compelling figures.<br/><br/>In No Country, we are also faced with characters who seem to have the word ""INSCRUTABLE"" written on their foreheads. And not only that, these characters are then put into situations that are deliberately withheld from us - the shootout that precedes the film, the shootout at the El Paso motel, the conclusion of Xavier Badem's visit to Kelly MacDonald at the film's end.<br/><br/>Lesser artists would have wanted to tie up the loose ends and resolved all the open questions, but the Coens, while perhaps not of Shakespearean vintage, honour the tradition of serious film-making in which the ending staying open, the threads hang, and we hang too, wondering when we will finally fall.<br/><br/>Which doesn't necessarily make for a feel-good movie. And the film's most sympathetic characters are not treated kindly: Llewelyn Moss is shot off-screen and found dead, Sheriff Ed Tom Bell fizzles out of his police role, broken by what he has seen, and what happens to Carla Jean Moss remains unclear.<br/><br/>There has always been an icy streak in the Coens' films, from Blood Simple to Fargo, to the Man Who Wasn't There. You could say that they're like boys pulling wings off flies just to see what will happen. And then they pull off another one and another one...<br/><br/>Despite these doubts there's no denying the brilliance of the work. You may not like it particularly, but you've got to respect it.<br/><br/>However, if you're looking for a film that packs as visceral punch while also speaking to the heart, go and see Let There Be Blood."

","This is not a feel good movie. It is NOT for young children. It is rated R for good reason. It tries to accurately portray a situation where an average Joe on a hunting trip in the sparse country of south west Texas comes across a drug trade gone bad. He finds a bunch of vehicles far out in the wilderness. When he investigates, he finds lots of dead people and a truckload of drugs. But no money. He does a little tracking and finds a suitcase with $2million. In 1980 that would be about $4.5 million in 2008 dollars. He hopes to disappear but underestimates the people who seriously want the money back. Our average Joe, Llewelyn Moss, who you will find yourself rooting for, is courageous but makes a few mistakes. He is being pursued by a cold, menacing killer who has no remorse in ending peoples lives. The killer is smart, resourceful, and relentless. He has a large bank account to sustain him and connections that help him pursue our average Joe who has $2million.

It is also about life choices and people facing hardship. It digs into how cruel some people can be when pushed into the wrong circumstances. And how sometimes the decisions we make determine our fate.<br/><br/>Some have labeled this movie as boring or too slow moving. I suppose it might seem that way to those who are accustomed to lots of explosions and cars flying through the air.<br/><br/>It won several awards so it cannot be as bad as some depict it. My guess is that most people under age 25 will not like this movie, it doesn't satisfy the rapid pace of movies and video games they have come to expect.<br/><br/>When it ended I caught myself thinking, ""That's it? That's the end?""<br/><br/>But then it hit home what the movie was really about. Keep an open mind to the events and I suspect it will have the same effect on you.<br/><br/>Examine the plot, multiply the mayhem times 10 and you might be watching a movie about the same area in 2008."

","The Coen Brothers brilliantly gave us 120 minutes of excellence in a runtime of 122 for ""No Country for Old Men."" A gripping edge of your seat emotional heart-stopper of a film offers the story of a man, played expertly by Josh Brolin, who found something that he wasn't supposed to find. Now he doesn't want to give it back. However, hot on his trail is one of the most despicable on-screen characters in cinema history portrayed by Javier Bardam. His character is so bad, he bleeds evilness! The third leg of the stool is the role of the sheriff, played nostalgically by Tommy Lee Jones. Incidentally, at no time do any of the three major characters ever appear on screen at the same time. If nothing else, the Coen Brothers are great storytellers. The film is wonderful, BUT .............<br/><br/>***** FAIR WARNING ****** Do not read any further if you do not want a general sense of how the film ends.<br/><br/>The movie ends with no resolution. We never are clearly told what happens to Josh Brolin. Nor do we know what happens to Javier's character. We never find out whether or not Tommy Lee Jones accomplishes anything other than retirement. We are left to guess. I felt really cheated. What should have been a ""10"" on a scale of 1 to 10, is kicked down to an ""8."" I despise being cheated when watching a film. I want resolution and I do not want to have to guess at what the ending is all about. I expected an extremely violent confrontation between all three men and got zilch. There was no explosive climax to the film as promised on the DVD cover. I suppose the Editor got scissor happy - or the Coen's ran out of money."

It is soooo cliché.<br/><br/>Anyway the movie was good except for a few flaws.<br/><br/>First, when the Liuan was being chased by the truck at the beginning the pursuers must have been really bad drivers. It seems they chased Liuan for minutes within 50 feet of him but couldn't manage to run him over??? Secondly, when they sick the dog on Liuan and Liuan shoots the dog at the last second, the dog is CLEARLY a stuffed animal.<br/><br/>Lastly, the ending was downright weak.

Sometimes I think some people can make movies and do what they want, and the whole crowd says ""Nice"", I liked the Big Lebowsky and Fargo but seriously, are they really that good ? By the way, I like Josh Brolin and his way through Hollywood, there have been some good movies he acted in, Tommy Lee Jones to me is not my favourite actor, maybe because there were some really crappy movies he acted in. The Killer, I remember him from another older movie, Perdit Durango, a movie that tries to be like Tarrantino but not really managed it to convince. The new movie from the coen brothers is not bad, but sometimes boring and I don't think all of the conversations shown are really brilliant. But, like i said, though, a good movie."

The self-reverential Coen Brothers are not as smarmy here as they were with ""Fargo"", and they know quite a lot about film structure, instinctively staying aware of their audience and keeping them watching intently even as they throw in loopy curveballs, lengthy conversations and perplexing jump-cuts in the editing. Unfortunately, they also operate (smugly) on one-note throughout, so that even when the movie hits its intended targets, there's no excitement, no awe in what we're seeing. The characters in the film do not matter to the Coens; the circumstances of the people in question are what count (and if they don't live very long, no problem; their histories and predicaments are then shucked off, forgotten about).

","This movie feels like some's first draft of a story - a half-completed jumbled mess. For example, take the character of Bell. What does he do? How does his presence - or the attention spent on him by the audience - ever serve to progress the narrative? One could remove all scenes with Bell from the film, and the story would be unchanged and still make perfect sense. He is useless to the story. If you can remove a main character like this from the story and not create any plot holes, there is something very wrong with the story-telling. Perhaps Bell's character serves some purpose in the book, and was kept in the film version despite his inclusion being without purpose.<br/><br/>Furthermore, why does the movie not show the deaths of some of the major characters (one can guess Carla was killed because Chigurh is checking his boots as he departs the house at the end - but that is far from confirmation)? And Chigurh's fate as he limps away from the final car wreck? What is point of intentionally leaving the audience in the dark? To me, this is not fancy struggles with fate and chance - it is just poor story-telling.<br/><br/>I did otherwise like the cat & mouse aspect of the plot of the start and middle of the film.

(i could only bring myself to watch the film once though. i could never get those 122 minutes back; so i feel obligated to myself and others - in form of warning to express my disdain for this film. I am sorry.) <br/><br/>So, is it perhaps the 'absence' of film conventions that made it what it was? the fact that the film wasn't really a film, it was just a series of pointless, wandering moments comprised together to make people 'question the unquestionable' or to create controversy in the world of art (influencing contrasting reviews such as mine and many others; because it did a good a terrific job at that, and i admire the cast for that achievement....)<br/><br/>Or rather, was the film just an experimental 122 min of every conventional cinematography shot; 'yes, the Mise en Scene was 'dynamic' it consisted of every camera angle; the use of light was tres chic? The inclusion of contrasting characters made the film so fascinating and exhilarating?'..... I really do not know where i am going with this point because the film was so pointless and doesn't influence or evoke any form of interest or comprehension from me.<br/><br/>Yes, it may be interesting to see a film where the absence of key or conventional elements makes it what it is... but this film just didn't quite cut it.

Mr Tommy Lee Jones looking more and more like one of those expensive Japanese dogs portrays a completely unbelievable cracker-barrel philosophising sheriff who is clearly in the wrong job.He is overwhelmed by the crimes he is supposed to be investigating and lacks the energy or inclination to inspire his equally timid deputies. Set in the 1970s,there are no computers,no inter - agency co-operation,no grasp of the bigger picture,just a bored sheriff on the verge of retirement looking for a quiet life. When a homicidal maniac crosses his path he regresses to the days when it was safe to leave your covered waggon unlocked at night. There is nothing new in ""No country for old men"",it's just the Coen brothers being clever - clever with the old ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" plot that Sam Raimi did so much better in ""A Simple Plan"".

","In a year of well-reviewed films, each of which fell short in some respects, ""No Country for Old Men"" deserved the Oscar mostly because of the quirky vision that is characteristic of all films by Joel and Ethan Coen. It is not a great film, merely better than the competition -- and Javier Bardem makes for a really scary villain who kills for pleasure as well as for professional reasons. Tommy Lee Jones, a tired lawman, Josh Brolin as a hunter who stumbles across a failed drug deal and takes away $2 million in cash, and Woody Harrelson as a cool private operator on Bardem's trail all do their jobs well but if you have nightmares they will be filled by Bardem's character. For my money, Bardem's performance was superior to Daniel Day-Lewis' overrated acting in ""There Will Be Blood."" 2007 was not the banner film year that many critics claimed it was and ""No Country for Old Men"" is not a great film, merely another triumph for the Coen Brothers, who are possibly the most interesting scriptwriters and directors in the business on this side of the Atlantic."

It seemed lifeless and bland at times, yet you always felt the anger, violence, and greed was just under the surface, ready to explode at any time when you least expected it. the film didn't make any apologies for the story it was telling. The film moved smoothly from one chaotic scene to another, always done in a way so skillful that you didn't notice you had become so intrigued into what was going to happen next. It was a cat and mouse story, a hunter and the hunted kind of story but its real value was in the depiction of two completely different worlds, the human and the subhuman and how one bad choice brings both these worlds together..the innocent and the evil and the consequences of these characters and plot colliding.."

I go to the movies to feel, not to think, not to squeeze my brain trying to understand the new philosophical thoughts of the Coen's. What happened to the protagonist 3 minutes later of the turn point is just insane, and makes that psycho killer the new protagonist, but without any motivation other than this insanity.

","A psychopath killing innocent people with an air gun is not deep or brilliant. Watching a defenseless old man being shot point blank in the head for no reason is not symbolic of some deeper meaning. It's a sick reflection of the Coen Brothers personal and mental problems. And enjoying this movie is the same thing as being fascinated by a car wreck and all the people laying on the street bleeding. This movie is nothing but a slasher film like Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street. Tommy Lee Jones character tried to throw some philosophy in there but it didn't amount to much. It's a chase film involving a bag full of money big deal.<br/><br/>But I gave this movie 8 stars for a few reasons. The Coen brothers are experts at creating tension and suspense. My eyes were glued to the screen the entire film. They let each scene breath. Most movies force everything down your throat with quick edits and dialouge as if the filmmakers are afraid that everyone has a short attention span. The Coen Brothers trust that the audience has brains and patience, and they're right.<br/><br/>But in order for these long scenes to work you need great actors and this movie had them. Josh Brolin was born to play this role and does a great job considering his character had little dialouge. Javier Bardem deserved the Oscar. I forgot I was watching an actor and believed he truly was a psychopath. His screen presence was overwhelming and I hung on to his every word and mannerism, wondering what he was going to do next. I think what the audience is waiting for, or hoping for in his character, is the slightest glimpse of humanity, compassion, or morality. Right before he was possibly about to kill someone, we wanted at least the slightest morsel of good to come out. That's what made it suspenseful.<br/><br/>However, even with the excellent direction of the Coens, and the great acting, I never want to see this movie again. Innocent, kind, defenseless old men brutally killed with a device used to kill cows is not entertaining a second time. It's not deep. It's not brilliant."

","Based on the 2003 novel by Cormac McCarthy, the movie unfolds in the dusty Texas borderlands as hunter Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) stumbles upon the remnants of a desert drug deal gone bad, complete with a case containing two million dollars. Succumbing to temptation, Moss makes off with the money setting in motion a chain of events that leaves a trail of blood spattered carnage across the State as he is pursued by the ruthless, coin tossing hit man Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) among whose killing weapons of choice is a pneumatic air gun. And Tommy Lee Jones Is A Lone Sheriff Who Is Running This Town Of His Until Chigurgh Comes And Kills All The Residents. A MUST SEE!! No Country For Old Men 10/10"
"bluesman-20","10","2","7","21 March 2008"," Don't read anything into it just take it as it is a great story.
","No Country For Old Men is first and foremost a story. It's meant to reflect real life and how things often play out in real life. Bad Things happen to good people and good things happen to bad people like a toss of a coin. The movie opens with a Hunter superbly played by Josh Brolin stumbling upon a drug deal gone bad and discovering a suitcase full of money 2 million dollars to be exact. He takes the money and suddenly everything changes for him from good to bad to terrifying. A killer who wants his money stalks him and no one stands in his way for very long think of the grim reaper with a very bad haircut. and you'll come close to Javier Bardem's KIller. Tommy Lee Jones is as close to excellence as any actor can be in this movie he delivers a old world point of view as a tired sheriff who wants to retire but is suddenly given a case that has too many dead bodies and a man on the run in need of protection and he feels powerless. This role was made for Tommy Lee Jones deadpan delivery and if he said he doesn't have a sense of humor he lied it comes across very subtly in his acting. The Coens's have made a movie as close to an Real Life event as possible. Yes The ending may be unsatisfying for some but to me it made perfect sense. In Real life we do not often get the endings we want just the ones we deserve. But see it and judge it for yourself. A masterful stroke of film-making This one can actually lay claim to being the Citizen Kane of the 21st century. It's flawed and it's story takes you into many other directions until it reaches it's point just like life. Fantastic and chilling and very worth while seeing again and again if only for Tommy Lee Jones and Javier Bardem's masterful performances."
"scoochie9","10","2","7","19 March 2008"," Wow!
","I only just saw this movie on DVD, well after the Oscars, but my (belated) response is an unequivocal ""Wow!"". ""No Country For Old Men"" is like a slow, hypnotic, completely mesmerizing ""Pulp Fiction"". I was glued to the screen the entire time. It's like something Quentin Tarantino would create if he were on quaaludes and mushrooms combined. I'm a huge fan of the Coen Brothers (""The Big Lewbowski"", ""Raising Arizona"", ""Fargo"", and ""Intolerable Cruelty"" are among my all-time favorites), and I'm thrilled they finally got their shining moment with this completely brilliantly conceived film! I'm not normally a fan of westerns, and how very slowly they usually seem to pan out, but this movie used every possible slow-moving scene to up the adrenaline one (or two, or three, or ten) more notch(es). Not to be overlooked was the ethical stance the movie took. The title itself bespoke what is a major problem in the world today: socio/psychopaths, and their unerring tendency to breed... With all these ultra-creepy, conscious-less people being born indiscriminately, it's no wonder this may end up ""no country for old men""... Old men who actually have a sense of ethics and fair play. Old men who actually CARE. Wow! Great job boys!!!"
"dtbaker2","9","2","7","15 March 2008"," Ending
","Excellent depiction of human nature - An accurate and reasonably violent tour of the violent trade in the (sadly, part of the global economy) nasty drug commodity.<br/><br/>I was especially and pleasantly distracted (long enough to gather my bearings) when the candy bar wrapper expanded on the counter during the filling station scene. A respite and perfectly non-typical direction - Coens' style - a well thought out pause during a tortuous scene. Answer the question! The ending - well, at first observation, it was flat. For me, on the second viewing after I became aware of the sense of it all...it was simply brilliant.<br/><br/>A perfect fade to black.<br/><br/>Highly recommended - Wow."

","I must say that I have not read all the (800+!) comments, but I certainly don't agree with the last several negative reviews.<br/><br/>I just watched it last night, and found it deeply affecting, though not for the reason most would think.<br/><br/>Found it well constructed, well acted, and well photographed. I'm looking at this film through the eyes of a 61-year-old police officer who's been in the biz for just a bit short of 40 years. So I'm pretty much down with Jones' character. When he says, ""I begin to feel overmatched."", I know exactly where he's coming from. And that's exactly (IMHO) why we didn't have a big, hairy shootout with the assassin.<br/><br/>Bell says to himself...""that's enough"", and takes his retirement. Too many changes, too many really evil men running around. A time for younger men... No Country for Old Men, after all."
"linwes","9","2","7","12 March 2008"," Two stories perfectly blended into one perfect film
","I know it won't happen, but I would love for everyone who questioned or didn't like this film to have a chance to read this comment. I'm a huge movie buff and I've seen just about everything out there and I, like other movie buffs get into watching a movie thats been given four stars and has won best picture and wonder if it's really going to be that good. I started this movie and was on the edge of my seat from the very start. This film is two hours in length and the first hour and ten minutes may be the most edge of your seat, suspenseful and beautifully filmed hour and ten minutes of any film in a long time. There is very little dialogue but the violence and images that unfold the story in this hour and ten minutes is just incredible. It is at this point that the film takes a turn and involves more dialogue and gets more complicated and has less action. It is probably from this point of the film until the end that people get turned off and hate the film. They wonder to themselves, why would the writers/directors go from the suspenseful/little dialogue first half of the film to this, well I'll explain. You must watch this film until the very end, it may even take viewing it two or three times to realize the true point. Once you really understand the title you will understand the film. You should understand it is basically two films in one, a very violent half with a henchman who is crazy and defies the code of ethics to the extremes of even killing his employers and innocent people for no reason trying to get back two million dollars that a man without a clue stumbled upon and the sheriff caught up between them. Then there's the other half that once understood blends perfectly with the first half where we realize that this sheriff is caught up in the past and the good ol' days. He loves the way things used to be. He realizes how the violence and mayhem are just too much for him to handle. He realizes how this country is going bad and how its badly effecting everyone, especially old men like himself who probably share the same thoughts as himself. He realizes as does the audience in the awesome climax of this amazing film that it truly is ""No Country for Old Men"""
"departed07","10","2","7","11 March 2008"," A spellbinding masterpiece!
","There have been words described by critics about this movie that seemed to fit the profile: ""Masterful!"" Gene Shalit, Today Show; ""Hypnotic!"" Richard Schickel, Time Magazine; ""Flawless!"" Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun Times and so many words that I can't give a list.<br/><br/>If the Coen Brothers were to have a class lesson, it would be ""How To Murder 101"" ever since the 1980's when they started on Blood Simple (1984) before their 90's flick Fargo (1996) where killing people with a wood chipper became an innovated technique; now, in this decade, ""No Country For Old Blood"" is a nightmarish masterpiece where your nerves will get the best of it. It's the Coen's Trifecta of murder films!<br/><br/>""No Country For Old Men"" is not only the title of the film, but a metaphor meaning that if you don't have the balls to take responsible for your actions, then you don't belong in your country. Josh Brolin, who has grown up since his Goonies days, plays Llewelyn Moss, an Ex-Vietnam vet who's a bum living in the country side of Texas with his wife (Scottish actress Kelly McDonald) where anything could happen until Llewelyn happens to be hunting and sees a group of dead bodies before finding a satchel of money near of two million dollars. In another part of town, Anton Chigurh (Academy Award Winner Javier Bardem in the most freakish role) is on the manhunt killing people left and right where he's looking for the two million dollars. His presence is somewhere between Michael Myers of Halloween to Freddy Krugger where no matter what, this killing machine can't be stopped. His weapon of choices are a silenced shotgun with a cattle gun to open doors and pop heads. After the numerous killings and the connection found, Sheriff Ed Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is on the case where he doesn't think that retirement will come anytime soon while hoping he can catch Moss before anybody kills him.<br/><br/>The film has top notch acting from all of its cast both main and supportive. Tommy Lee Jones is fine as Tom Bell, Josh Brolin is outstanding as Moss; but the true standout of this masterpiece is Javier Bardam's award winning performance as Anton Chigurh where once you see his face for the first time and see him in later scenes in either a calm state or his character in a violent rage, your heart will start pounding while feeling more than just a little terrified at the same time. The rest of the cast includes Kelly McDonald hiding her Scottish accent to a Texas voice and Woody Harrelson as a hit-man hired by Stephan Root to catch the psychopathic killer.<br/><br/>It's truly spellbinding!"
"Exeron","8","2","7","5 March 2008"," Coen's Oscar material
","No Country For Old Men The Coen brothers have a theme. What matter kind of genre it is, it'll either make you afraid, or amused.<br/><br/>I noticed that the Coen brothers have spent a lot of times with details on this movie. Many things ordinary directors wouldn't even think of, so that's definitely a plus. The one thing that the movie was missing that made me disappointed, was the music. There was no music in the movie what so ever. At certain point there was a mood string playing but that didn't work that much. I mean even at the most silent moments you could add some low trembled guitar or something in that direction. I've seen some Coen films and it's pretty odd for their style not to include music in the film.<br/><br/>But they managed to make you feel excited and create a very dark mood after all. So that's a + again.<br/><br/>I have to write this: For those who are sensitive of tense moments, jump scenes whatsoever. This movie made me jump many times and the moments aren't small jumps, at some points you'll really freak out, so i warn sensitive viewers out there.<br/><br/>Anyway if you like the Coen brothers, and the sort of Texas crime genre, you'll definitely enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>90% ""A chilling and thrilling crime story"""

"MaxBorg89","10","2","7","25 February 2008"," Mesmerizing - an instant classic!
","Since 1984, the Coen brothers have been seducing, entrancing and surprising film-lovers all over the world with their wildly imaginative body of work, or at least they did until 2003. Then came Intolerable Cruelty, followed by The Ladykillers: not bad movies per se, but clearly not the best of efforts on their behalf. Thankfully, No Country for Old Men is everything one could expect from them. In fact, it's their best film since Fargo, a fact acknowledged by the three Oscars they won (Best Picture, Directing and Adapted Screenplay).<br/><br/>Hang on. Adapted? Yes. Surprisingly enough, the brothers' return to form is not a product of their remarkable imagination. Instead, it is based on a novel by Cormac McCarthy, albeit one that seems to be tailor-made for the Coens: Texas (where their debut Blood Simple was set), colorful characters, impeccable dialogue and occasional outbursts of violence - it's all there, complete with a sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones' Ed Tom Bell) whose reactions to the ensuing madness are modeled on Fargo's Marge Gunderson.<br/><br/>It is Bell that constitutes the film's soul: his words open and close the story, and his candid reflections on mankind are the center of No Country's analysis of absurd bloodshed. The latter is prominently caused by Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a passionless killer who is hired to find Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin), a hunter who has come across a suitcase containing two million dollars after discovering a drug affair gone horribly bad and decides to keep running despite the warnings of a more suave hit-man (Woody Harrelson): Chigurh will stop at nothing, and proof of that is evident in the trail of corpses he has left behind with a cattle gun. Bell always arrives too late to where either of the two men has been, and can only hope the violence will stop some day. Yes, it really is no country for old men.<br/><br/>This film marks a return to the Coens' typically humorous and noirish settings, while also adding an elegiac beauty, captured by Roger Deakins' seductive cinematography, which reminds of Sam Peckinpah's Westerns: the Texan landscapes provide a sense of timelessness that makes the brutality reflect human history altogether, rather than a specific period (although the movie takes place in 1980). The environment is also used to set the film's tone, especially in terms of sound: Carter Burwell's magnificent music is heard only four or five times in the whole picture, leaving room for the wind that blows swiftly across the desert and announces awful things to come.<br/><br/>Along with the formal beauty, the Coens, as always, offer excellent performances: Jones provides a soulful variation of a part he could play in his sleep by now, his Sheriff being the only real ""good guy"" around; Brolin, for whom 2007 was a breakthrough year (Grindhouse, In the Valley of Elah, American Gangster), is laconic and instantly charismatic as he moves the action forward and says some of the fantastic screenplay's best lines (""If I don't come back, tell mother I love her"". ""Your mother is dead"" his wife remarks. ""Well, then I'll tell her myself"" he replies); and Bardem, who won the film's fourth Oscar (Best Actor in a Supporting Role), is nothing short of a revelation, trading his natural likability for a frightening coldness (and a ridiculous hairdo) that marks Chigurh as the most iconic hit-man in cinema history - like Ben Kingsley, who shocked everyone with his raw turn in Sexy Beast, the Spanish actor has undergone a transformation so scary some viewers won't believe it's the same person who made the world cry in Before Night Falls and The Sea Inside.<br/><br/>Bottom line: No Country for Old Men is quintessential Coen: funny, poetic, violent and tragic. In other words, a masterpiece."

By the time Woody Harrelson's character is rubbed out, does anybody seriously think anybody is going to stop Anton from killing Moss? The Coens don't even give us the satisfaction of seeing Moss done in ... and he certainly deserved it, the way they had him screw around with the money when he just should have thrown it in his truck and got the hell out of Dodge, so to speak. I have no idea where people who are calling this movie ""suspenseful"" are getting it from. No confrontation between any of the 3 major characters, none of the cat-and-mouse you'd expect along the lines of The Third Man ... and watch this comment be attacked by the ""I get Coen Brothers movies and you don't"" crowd. Miller's Crossing was better. The Man Who Wasn't There was better. This is not their best work. Sorry."
"uscdude","10","2","7","23 November 2007"," Absolutely fantastic
","I came into this film with high expectations, and they were met with ease. I am quite a Coen fan, but regardless, this blew me away. The scenery was one of my favorite parts of the movie, as its bleak beauty was a wonderful treat for the eyes and really contributed to the sense of emptiness, being alone, feeling like you're so far out in the middle of nowhere that anything could happen and nobody could know about it. The quiet and lack of music contributed a similar effect. All the actors were great and the casting was spot on, even though in one scene where Tommy Lee Jones takes off his hat and there's a close up on his face he looks older than death. Everyone was great and right for the feel of the film. In addition, the killer's simple philosophy revealed by his several coin toss incidents ""You stand to win everything"" were really interesting and provided a window of insight into his character, leaving him explained but at the same time, an enigma. The Coens also knew when enough gore was enough gore. There was plenty of good, old-fashioned violence for any red-blooded American male but they knew what was enjoyable and what would have been gratuitous. Finally, one of the things that I enjoyed most is the abundant humor throughout the movie. They knew when to keep things serious and when to give some levity, and the film was exponentially better for it. Go see this movie as soon as you can."

","Yawn. Oh, good, it's over!<br/><br/>After an interesting start, the film tumbles to boredom. Tommy Lee Jones talks his usual 'what the hell is he saying' jumble. Javier is a brilliant actor, but he just seems to do everything in slow motion in this film. Is it just me or does the acting seem very, very laidback - almost lazy?<br/><br/>The entire film I was rooting for the protagonist, who is then suddenly killed off screen. Uhm, why?

I actually checked if there was an extended version or directors cut, but no it's the biggest cop out on an ending ever. It wasn't cleverly done as some new twist or sometimes bad guys win, it was pathetic. As for the bad guy, fair enough he played it well, but it wasn't that hard to do."

","Anton is one of the scariest villains I've seen on film. The kind you love to hate. Just listening to him talk gave me chills. The scene in the convenient store had me on pins and needles. This film is worth watching just to see Javier Bardem nail the character Anton Chigurh. Now for the things I didn't like were the long dialogues between Tommy Lee Jones character and his deputy, friend, wife, etc. Most of it was boring and unrelated to what was happening in the film. Woody Harrelson's character did not convince me that he was a bad-azz. I also didn't like the film treatment of one of the characters. I can't say whom without giving away spoilers. I really didn't like the ending."
"fgkforlife","10","2","8","21 March 2008"," Very good movie Theory
","I have a theory for NCFOM<br/><br/>First off, you see how the man in the gas station gets the call right, so he doesn't die. But... Later on, like 10 minutes, you see Anton pull change out of his pocket, and only one of the pieces of change has blood on it, the quarter.(Also to note, the coin is on tails as he pulls it out of his pocket, possibly symbolizing it has lost its luck, because the gas station owner called heads.)<br/><br/>So in turn, I believe that Anton killed the gas station owner, regardless of the choice of heads or tails, then took back the coin.<br/><br/>So, when Llewelyn's wife meets Anton, no matter what she called, he still killed her.<br/><br/>No more debates, Anton killed her, that is that, based on my reasoning."
"Scars_Remain","10","2","8","19 March 2008"," Perhaps the Greatest Movie of All Time
","If this isn't the great movie ever made, it certainly deserves to be in the top 5. I was completely blown away with everything about it. I feel that this movie takes film making to a level it's never been to before and does it beautifully. Anyone who happened to give this movie a negative review really doesn't understand a good movie when they see. It is absolutely brilliant in every way, shape and form. It deserved to win best picture and it did win best picture so I guess the Academy doesn't always get things wrong. If any of this sounds bold to you, see the movie and then tell me I'm wrong, I dare you.<br/><br/>Joel and Ethan Coen once again have made a movie that truly shows that they are two of the greatest directors of all time. The acting is utterly amazing from everyone. Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin, and Kelly Macdonald all give the performances of their careers but the best performance was Javier Bardem's. His character is one of the most creepy and well thought out villains I have ever seen on screen and he nailed it perfectly. The story is extremely well crafted and the fact that there is no music makes it much more intense and it also makes it feel like it moves along very fast. The gore/violence is very convincing. There are so many good things about this movie that it would be far too much to list.<br/><br/>I don't care what kind of movies you are generally into. Every single person on this planet needs to see this movie as soon as possible. If you are a fan of film in general, you'll absolutely love everything about it."

"rainfall","5","2","8","26 February 2008"," Finally, a Coens film beloved by everyone... but is it good? and does it worth it?
","First, I must say that I absolutely love Coens' films (those real Coens), but I can't not to admit that No Country for Old Men is very far from their standart of movie-making. It's a good film, well cast, well made, well filmed, actors play good (and Bardem plays very good) but there is something that doesn't make it those Coens I'm used to (or have been used to even). See, once you start making movies for big audience, for big money you will never stop... even if you try. And it doesn't look to me if Coens tried. Their entry to mainstream was painful, Intolerable Cruelty and then Ladykillers were really very disappointing. But at that time Coens already had a reputation of top class filmmakers (who they are in fact!). So that's why came this project - amazing PR campaign, only lazy critic (especially American one, especially in those big shiny movie magazines or some central newspapers) didn't call it an Oscar contender in best picture (means it finally fits all Academy's standarts). Film doesn't have philosophy - it has one simple idea which is chewed by every mind, by every critic (and wannabe critics, who represent much bigger army in today's world of information). And, furthermore, it doesn't have the style. It has a great picture, which is a very different thing. It's absolutely beloved by so many people because finally Coens have a film that suits everyone. It suits critics, it suits Academy, it suits producers and it suits masses who now discuss the genius of Coens and run on IMDb to cast their ""10"" vote to make it 23d best picture ever made. I feel sad that Coens went the same way that Scorsese."
"stewiefan201","10","2","8","23 February 2008"," The Coen Brothers have created a modern classic, and a very memorable one at that.
","No Country For Old Men is about a man named Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), who one day while hunting in Rio Grande stumbles upon a bunch of dead bodies from a drug deal gone wrong. While looking around the murder site Llewelyn finds 2 million dollars tucked away in a duffel bag. He runs off with the bag but soon realizes that he has been found out, and is being tracked by a mysterious violent killer named Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem). He sends his wife away from the danger and leaves for a motel to hide out, but soon must find an intelligent way to defend himself because he is still being hunted. Meanwhile Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is tracking down Llewelyn and Chigurh, while trying to solve the murder case. From there on in violence and suspense occurs as Llewelyn tries to stop the violent and purely twisted Chigurh, and get away with the 2 million dollars.<br/><br/>This is certainly one of the best movies of 2007. No Country is well made, well acted, well written, everything about it is very good. The plot is very intriguing and constantly interesting. The dialogue is also excellent and sometimes actually scary. There is one scene I'd like to mention which involves No Country's villain Anton Chigurh and a department store clerk. The clerk asks Chigurh a little about himself, and chigurh replies with aggression and anger saying it's none of his business which only adds to the mystery of his character. During this suspenseful scene Chigurh is angered by the clerk's intentions and questions, so he decides to flip a coin and ask the clerk to call it heads or tails. It soon becomes obvious that this coin toss is going to determine the fate of this clerk, and the dialogue in that scene perfectly realistic and gave me shivers down my spine.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is also very good. Josh Brolin gives a great performance as a desperate man trying to get away with a lot of stolen money. Tommy Lee Jones is also very good and believable in his role as he is with many movies he stars in. But the real scene-stealer here is Javier Bardem who has been nominated for best supporting actor at the Oscars, and very much deserves it. Bardem's performance as Chigurh is highly intriguing and he is one of the key parts in No Country that makes the movie very suspenseful. I had never heard of this actor before this movie but now I'll keep an eye out for him since he impressed me so much.<br/><br/>There are quite a few scenes in No Country For Old Men that contain no dialogue at all. From there it is up to the actors and direction to generate suspense and key interest. That works to full effect in this movie because it is near perfectly handled. The scenes where Moss and Chigurh are on each other's trail are superb and to me very, very memorable. These scenes also carry out very originally and are very detailed in the way the characters react, how they hide, and how they prepare to take action. Anton Chigurh in my opinion is one of the best, if not the best, movie villain since Hannibal Lecter. Chigurh is extremely intelligent and also quite frightening and haunting. His character does not use a gun or knife like a normal killer in movies today. He uses a cattle gun with an air tank to shoot out the locks of the doors, and a certain kind of shotgun that I'm not sure of the name.<br/><br/>Besides these brilliantly executed scenes the story is also very interesting. It portrays one man's greediness and just how far he will go to keep the money he found. The storyline also never explains Chigurh's background which makes him mysterious, scary, and a memorable villain. Sheriff Bell's part is not as large as the plot going on between Moss and Chigurh. But he is every bit as intelligent as the other two main characters. No Country's story really portrays well a psychopathic maniac, and how he affects and harms the lives of people violently, psychologically, or both. Many audiences have complained that the end is a cop-out, which may be because it does not end like a normal film probably would. However I thought it was a good ending for not being sugar coated and instead taking a different route.<br/><br/>No Country For Old Men is a brilliant film and one of the best movies of 2007, and may even be one of the best movies of the whole decade. It is a suspensefully charged film that moves in a completely different direction than a normal movie. I give No Country For Old Men a 4 out of 4."
"DICK STEEL","7","2","8","16 February 2008"," A Nutshell Review: No Country for Old Men
","The second movie watched today is also released by Paramount Vintage and Miramax, and shares with There Will Be Blood, eight Academy Award nominations, in a fight for most of the major honours. The brothers Coen's new film have been gathering wave after wave of honours, but somehow it didn't really quite work for me, despite the premise being something I would go for, and most likely to have enjoyed.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong though, there are again brilliant moments in the movie that I enjoyed, but on the whole, it was the unsatisfying anti-climatic finale that did it in for me, with too convenient a coincidence arising from a random act, and a frustrating interpret-it-if-you- please treatment that those who are more actively cerebral will get a field day deciphering and debating all the underlying meaning that make up the movie.<br/><br/>Much is said about Javier Bardem's Anton Chugurh, and I'm agreeable with the nods to his understated portrayal as a modern day, flesh and bones Terminator, who's armed with a gas powered hammer gun used to send cattle to heaven, and a high powered rifle with silencer attached. His target is 2 million dollars in a suitcase, coming from a deal with Mexican druglords turn awry, which Josh Brolin's Llewelyn Moss happened to steal away when he chanced upon a zero sum game in the middle of an open plain. So it's somewhat cat and mouse chase, with Terminator Chugurh after Moss to seek out those stacks of 100 dollar greenbacks, and sending those unfortunate good natured folks to heaven/hell should they come crossing his path. But I have to admit that the gun battling duels and confrontation between Chugurh and Llewelyn are tension filled enough to leave you at the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>If There Will Be Blood talks about money, No Country for Old Men talks about violence, or the random senselessness of it all. Through Chigurh's extremely focused quest, we become bewildered and numbed when he dispatches his victim without batting an eyelid, with little opportune of mercy being shown. As Tommy Lee Jones' Sheriff Bell, in a supporting role as yet another jaded cop who is world weary, notes in his daily reading of the news, wacky incidents often get reported because of the help of curious onlookers, but those which often involve a crime, somehow never get the all important second look.<br/><br/>This is not your usual narrative story with expected conventions. You come to expect something in the way the movie is built up by the Coens, but more often than not, it stops short, deliberately of course. There are some wonderful moments on its own, with scenes that are witty, and filled with a wicked sense of black humour. But ultimately, it's quite open ended for vast interpretation, and leaving you with questions that don't get answered. The ending is one of frustration for me, but come Oscar time, there isn't a doubt why this movie has been the darling of so many critical circles, and is probably expected to bag an Oscar award, or two."

","*****Read the comment titled ""Joel and Ethan's Country,"" I insist, that's the best comment about this movie hands down. That guy hit it on the head about this movie. For years American moviegoers were spoon fed plots and were made to yearn for satisfying outcomes ""in the end."" This movie is trying to tell you something about society thats way more important than the plot outcome. I love the David Lynch like writing of the Coehns that is more for the intelligent. Too bad there isn't more movies like that. I wonder where we are going in this country where money and material things are more and more important and really learning something and celebrating culture are getting lost.

","I've held a light for the Coen brothers ever since I saw Blood Simple - a very intelligent movie that requires the viewer to participate - you really do need to think. Now I find that really engaging - whilst I do have my moments where I just want something to wash over me and entertain me without requiring any effort from me I also like a challenge. The Coen brothers are capable of producing both these kinds of movie. It's why I can be certain what ever they produce it will have merit. No Country for Old Men is a return to Blood Simple territory. You need to have at least a passing interest in the psychological make-up of life's misfits to make the most of it but it is jolly well worth the effort. It is chilling, engaging, moving all at once. The actors all produce exemplary performances of their craft. It's already on my forward list for DVD purchase despite it's less than uplifting storyline. Well done the Coen brothers, well done all the actors, photographers and crew. Brilliant."
"after_the_credits","8","2","8","11 January 2008"," Very good, but not great...
","While I can't find anything technically wrong with ""No Country For Old Men"", I still can't call it great. It has been compared to the Coens' own GREAT crime caper ""Fargo(1996)"", and that's pretty fair. Looking at the two movies side by side, they do have a lot in common. However, ""No Country For Old Men"", unlike ""Fargo"", is almost entirely without humor. And, it offers very few incidental pleasures, e.g., no great musical score to enhance the mood, and only one or two memorable supporting characters.<br/><br/>""No Country For Old Men"" was not based on an original screenplay by the two brothers. It is based on a novel by Cormac McCarthy. It is the first time they've adapted someone else's material, and it shows. There's no zest, no gusto, and no desire to blow our minds. For whatever reason, they've decided to make a straight-forward movie, albeit a taut, dutiful, and effective one. Here's hoping they get back to developing their own stories."
"barnes-183","10","2","8","6 January 2008"," Why I think this movie is fantastic
","Of course the acting, directing, cinematography are great. It is a Coen brothers film so you expect that. What really clinches this for me as one of their best films, is the sneaky way that they use Jones as Sheriff Bell. He bookends the movie and he has a lot of screen time, but the Coens deliberately keep him out of what you would normally consider the main plot by the film. The movie is about Sheriff Bell and his self identity based on his crooked actions and the values he wears like a cheep mask. Just how does he merge those two aspects into a coherent view of his own self? The Coens do a good job in making this movie seem like a tense violent drama when in fact, it is a character study (Sheriff Bell). How many movies do you see that don't even include the main character/protagonist in the action that surrounds the main plot arc? The main plot arc in this film is fine, but nothing special. It has elements of Blood Simple and a number of non-Coen shoot-em-ups. As peripheral as the Anton vs. Llewelyn stuff is to the main goals of the movie, it is the part that the casual movie-goer is going to eat up. <br/><br/>Since I haven't seen a lot of critics mentioning the critical ""evil"" side of Sheriff Bell, let me clarify my P.O.V. Sheriff Bell was involved with the drug deal and either runs (my guess) the drug running Mexican or is just middle management type in their organization. Why do I think this? *Bell sees one of his own underlings (criminal, not law enforcement) driving a pick-up truck with some dead bodies in the back and he pulls the guy over and makes him strap the bodies down better so that it isn't so obvious. *Bell constantly avoids interacting with other law enforcement involved in the case (or drug crimes in general). I can imagine that he doesn't cherish time spent with DEA agents. *Bell doesn't need to look at the crime scenes because A) in some cases, he knew the details of the crime before it happened and B) he knows full well that if a crime is committed by the Mexican drug ring, he damn sure isn't going to find and capture the guilty parties. *As soon as Carla Jean tells Bell where her husband is, Bell has his Mexican drug goons wack him. Bell of course shows up just as they leave (with the hope that he can retrieve the $$ before the cops have a chance to make it to the scene of the crime). *Bell chooses to retire because he knows that Anton will track him down and kill him because he was part of that whole drug operation gone wrong. He kinda hopes that going low profile will help him, but you can see the anxiety, desperation, and fatalism in Bell as the movie closes.<br/><br/>What is quite nice is that the ending leaves us hanging from a number of different perspectives. (The Llewelyn/Anton thing gets wrapped up, but that was just a distraction from the real issue of Bell's inner demons anyway.) We don't know if Anton will actually come after Bell because we don't know if he will recover from his accident. We do know that if he does recover, that Bell will die (Bell is clearly knows he is out gunned). We don't know, however, if Bell will ever get his old morality back (at what age was he when last he had it?). If Anton dies of his car wreck wounds, will Bell eventually come out of retirement and return to the drug business? Will he live a life of quite desperation, always wondering if a bloody death is around the corner? Will he accept the fact that he deserves the death that Anton would bring him and meet his end with peace in his heart? Will he take steps to save his wife from dying by Anton's hands? (He could only do that by admitting to her what part he has really been playing in local crime for the past 30 years though.)<br/><br/>I rank this 10/10 because of subterfuge. The Coens created a character study that very cleverly pretends to be a tense crime drama. Just like Sheriff bell pretends to be a folksy, down-to-earth, family values kind of guy when in fact he is an altogether different kind of beast."
"michaeldenis","10","2","8","10 December 2007"," The ""Anti-Fargo""
","The Coen Brothers have created a number of films with followings. There's ""The Big Lebowski,"" a redux of the 1940s detective thriller, and there's ""Barton Fink,"" a tragedy about the nature of salaries. Each of their films, excluding that Clooney movie, is deservedly revered. ""Fargo"" is my favorite. It's a thriller about the nature of being middle class, where the evils of the middle class created a crisis and the goodness of the middle class perseveres. Fargo's secret is that it follows characters that have souls.<br/><br/>""No Country for Old Men"" returns to the circumstances of ""Fargo"" from a new perspective. This time the Coens ask us to forget about good and evil, and step into the mind of modernity incarnate, a person who is well aware that nothing matters.<br/><br/>This is a trying experience. A man I respect saw this film before me and said, simply, ""It's cold."" Indeed. The contrasts the Coens draw with the pleasantly bad Steve Buscemi and the angelic Frances McDormand are stark and, I would guess, quite deliberate. Where there was redemption and humor, there is now emptiness. Fargo advises, ""Go. Live your life well."" No Country states, ""Flip some coins."" Whether we reference Harry Lime on the Ferris Wheel (lucasaq), Lt. Robert Hearn of ""The Naked and the Dead,"" or whatever else out there that made you think there is nothing, this work is a fine addition to that canon.<br/><br/>""No Country for Old Men"" is about the darkness of existence. When you watch the film, remember the first few sequences. A dying man sits in a car begging for water. Another man sees him and walks away to tend to other things. Late that night, he awakens, remembering the thirsty man. He gets up, says goodbye to his wife, fills a milk jug with water, and goes to do the right thing. That was his only mistake. Right wrong, a main character might have quipped, I'm the guy with the gun."

"Birdhasflown","10","2","8","4 December 2007"," Vintiage Coen Brothers
","No other film this year is more somber, cold, and morally objectifying then Joel and Ethan Coen's ""No Country for Old Men,"" The Coen's latest opus is adapted by Cormac McCarthy's book. The Coen Brothers interpretation of the novel is an almost exact literate reflection of McCarthy's hard, unflinching vision of 1980s West Texas, as the vast and hot desert is as unsympathetic as the criminals who dwell in it. The Coen's genius speaks for itself as they rehash McCarthy's Western vision into vintage Coen film-making: a film-noir classic that reminds us how great movies can be.<br/><br/>The story chronicles welder and ex-Vietnam veteran Lewylen Moss (played by Josh Brolin) who uncovers a satchel full of money surrounded by shot-up SUV's and dead Mexicans while hunting for antelopes. Having a young wife and trailer to come home to, he takes the money of course. Soon he is tracked down by an assortment of criminals, including a psychotic expert killer, Anton Chigurh, played menacingly by Javier Bardem.<br/><br/>The film embodies an eerie if not unsettling portrayal of evil, as this ruthless assassin rids whoever crosses his path with no remorse or sympathy. He finds truth in the fact that if you cross his path, you are very much meant to be killed. The only thing that may save you is a coin toss, but you would have to be lucky for him to be that gracious. The killer carries a cattle gun, which is a device that shoots compressed air out of a hose. He uses this device to impale locks out of doors, and on people to. In one scene, posing as a police officer, and wielding the gun on his side, he politely asks a man to get out of his car, and prods the hose to his forehead killing him instantly. He did not want to foray the vehicle with blood.<br/><br/>Tommy Lee Jones gives the film a much needed reprieve from the violence and carnage as he plays wise and melancholy filled Sheriff Ed Tom Bell. He follows Anton's string of crimes and tries to ease Lewylen's concerned wife as he follows her husband's trail on the run. Sheriff Bell stands for all of us who endlessly contemplate evil's profound hold on the world, as it walks in many forms. For the entire film carries with it a nihilistic message. Its message is that sometimes the most we can do to fight evil is to remain diligent and strong, and the Sheriff, Lewylen and his wife Carla Jean realize this quite tragically.<br/><br/>The film's pacing is superb as the camera envelops the viewer into the reality of the situations, with steady camera shots where the actors show the actions on screen without the camera presenting it. Little to no music is present throughout the film, which makes for a more surreal experience for the viewer, as you feel you are with the actors as the actions takes place.<br/><br/>The film's themes of greed and how the good combat against evil make prevalent themes in Coen pictures. Another theme is how the stark imagery of the landscapes and settings connect with the conflict of the characters. The forlorn backgrounds of desolate, morbid landscapes mark their films with an eerie presence. For they give off an unsettling perspective of lands without end, where peace and safety from evil are no where to be found. This is beautifully crafted in the gaping desert of this film and the frozen tundra of North Dakota in the Coen's Academy Award winning ""Fargo."" If you are an avid film-goer and have been deprived of entertainment as well as profound meaning in films all year, ""No Country for Old Men,"" is your ticket."
"MacAindrais","10","2","8","3 December 2007"," Said he was going' to hell. Reckoned he'd be there in about 15 minutes
","No Country for Old Men (2007) ****<br/><br/>When I first reviewed the Cohen Brothers' Fargo, I was openly aware that I had enjoyed the film and thought it was something excellent. Nevertheless, I was left slightly perplexed with the feeling that something in the movie just didn't quite work enough to give it full marks. I took to ranking the film as 9.5/10 whenever I was asked. Where is that other .5? In ""No Country for Old Men"" I found it. Yes, it contains the perfect mixture of its elements  all in balance. <br/><br/>The film, adapted from the novel by Cormac McCarthy, examines the situation which follows after Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin in another excellent turn) discovers a drug deal gone bad in the deserts of Texas. He finds the bodies, the guns, and then the money. He takes some of the guns, all the money, and leaves the bodies behind. He soon realizes that he is being hunted; on one hand by a gang of Mexicans who have something to do with the deal; on the other hand by a ruthless psychopath named Anton Chigurgh (played incredibly by Javier Bardem). Both parties were hired by a rich businessman of sorts (William Root), who in turn hires a bounty hunter (Woody Harrelson) to take care of things when things get out of hand. Also in the mix is Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones in anther great performance). He investigates the killings in the desert, and the bodies of others who were unfortunate enough to meet Chigurgh along his hunt for the stolen money. <br/><br/>Jones delivers two great monologues in the film. One at the start, off-screen, narrated to Roger Deakin's beautiful cinematography, and the other at the very end of the film as the camera remains steady on his face. These monologues are just two of the marvels of No Country for Old Men. The cinematography is breathtaking; the dialogue superb. Another marvel of delivery in the film is virtually every line of dialogue delivered by Bardem. Consider one scene in which, after being offended by the small talk of a gas station attendant, where he forces the man to call a coin toss. The wager is ""everything,"" and though it goes unspoken, the attendant quietly realizes the brevity of the situation. The only issue I take with the film is with some of the lines given to Carson Welles, the bounty hunter played by Woody Harrelson. Some of his lines seem out of place, but that they are delivered so well it hardly matters. That the film makes no real false steps completely erases any other small issues. <br/><br/>The film merits some serious artistic credits. Shots, dialogue, editing all have moments of incredible beauty and meaning. The camera work and set up of shots are incredibly well crafted. Things move at a deliberate speed, never too fast, never too slow, and serve to heighten tension to a tee. I was reminded of one of two films this year that blew me away. That film was Bela Tarr's The Man from London. The other was No Country for Old Men. Though the camera shots are never as long or as lingering, some of it's fluid and slow movements reminded very much of Tarr's style. Whether the Cohen's have seen his work or not however is irrelevant. One of the most glorious moments in the film comes as one character makes his final appearance. The framing, the dialogue, and the final slow fade amount to such a great sendoff a better one can not be imagined. <br/><br/>The film takes its subject matter more seriously than Fargo did, and contains just the right mix of violence, poetry, odd humor and pathos. Therein lies the .5 missing from Fargo. In that film the mixture was off, not a bad thing but nevertheless after seeing No Country for Old Men I recognized that's what had been perplexing me. The closing monologue by Ed Tom Bell about a dream he had of his father, is one of the most important moments in the film, delivered by its most important character. His final words and the final cut in the film will stay with you: ""And then I woke up."" Cut to black."

","This was definitely an interesting movie. A highly violent and plodding thriller clearly a product of the Coen brothers. It is reminiscent of Fargo with respect to pace and tone. At times the film seemed in need of an infusion of energy, but at other points the tempo seems more than appropriate. Josh Brolin seems to be laying down the gauntlet as a serious thespian. Especially, given his recent performance in American Gangster. Javier Bardem continues to delight, but that is to be expected from an actor of his caliber. One only hopes the Coen brothers don't wait as long to bless us with another cinematic piece. Let me know what you think at www.urbandementia.blogspot.com."

","It takes a special talent to turn what should be a thrilling chase movie into something quite as dire as this offering by the Coen Brothers. The pace is as leaden and lifeless as Andy Warhol's film of the Empire State Building and the rambling story line leaves one with a sense of bafflement about what the directors were trying to achieve. When the psychopathic Chigurh pursues Llewellen Moss leaving a trail of murder and bodies one would think this would spark a major manhunt alert. But does this happen in the Coen's version of Hicksville USA? Hell no! The most that Tommy Lee Jones' sheriff can muster is a brief visit to a crime scene before settling down to read the paper over coffee and doughnuts in the local diner. What, no search helicopters? No roadblocks manned by State Troopers? The local police can not even manage a warning put out over the local radio and TV stations. The basic story line of this film is remarkably similar to Sam Raimi's 1999 film ""A Simple Plan."" But whereas that had a tight and believable script with many twists and turns this only has what Billy Connolly would call ""The Big Mamba"" - Miles and Miles of Bless All. No Country for Old Men?

","While Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) was hunting pronghorn near the Rio Bravo (or Rio Grande for North Americans), he found a mark of blood that take him to a typical drug dealers scene with abandoned cars and death bodies. There he found a bag with two million dollars. Soon he will be followed by a hit-man named Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) and by the local sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), who is trying to help Llewelyn from those very dangerous men.<br/><br/>The script of this perfect film was adapted by the Coen brothers from the novel with the same name by Cormac McCarthy. The plot of the film is simple in a way, showing an strange crime story setting in the old West. But there are too many things that make this film more than just another crime/western film and those same things are still in my head trying to be completely understood. One of those things are the great and memorable characters; Llewelyn Moss is the representation of the average man doing anything for money, Ed Tom Bell is the classic old man surprised by the increased of violence in his region and always in defense of the law. But the most mysterious and unique character is Anton Chigurh, since his strange last name, his strange haircut and his strange weapon ( a captive bolt pistol) to the fact that we don't know anything about him just that he kill everything that is close to him. Even the other main characters (Llewelyn and Ed) never confront Anton face to face, so it definitely one of the strangest characters that i have ever seen on a film. Another thing that is great in this film is the interpretation of the fate and how you can't stop what's coming. I mean, after watching the film a person who was with me tell me ""all because Llewelyn fell remorse for the Mexican asking for water and he return"", but for me even he never come back to the scene of the drug deal, Chigurh will be following him because the bag of the money contains the radar and because Llewelyn did something that change his life forever and he can't go back. Just as the coin toss, because is a simple decision but it can change your life. There are a lot of great dialogs that will make you watch this film more than one or two times.<br/><br/>The cast: is perfect and i'm not surprised of all the awards that came and the ones that will come. They are all great but Bardem steals, without a doubt, the film as Anton. For me is his best role in all of his career and is a fact that is his most ""popular"" role.<br/><br/>The Coen brothers: this is the first adapted film that they have done and is with the same beautiful cinematography of most of their films, showing the old West as the unique scenery for a story like that. Right now are as popular as great; who cares if the Academy doesn't give them the awards, they will be the same great directors with or without the Oscar. For me ""No Country for Old Men"" is their best film since ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" from 2000, and is my third personal favourite of them. And left me the desire of re-watch all of his films before the release of the DVD.<br/><br/>Conclusion: i love this film and is the best i have seen in this year. Is great when a great film like this one is as great as popular because a lot of people will watch it just for it nominations. Anyway, i'm just waiting for the DVD to watch it at least three more times. 10 out of 10<br/><br/>PS: the Mexican title for this film is ""Sin Lugar Para Los Debiles"", that means, ""Without a Place for the Weaks"". I don't like when they change the essence of the title but for me is not bad the Mexican title because it's a fact that in a situation like that you can't be weak."

","Ethan and Joel Coen are officially back in action. After ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" we all waited for another masterpiece (""Intolerable Cruelty"" and ""The Ladykillers"" are only solid) from productive Coens. But I'm happy that the waiting time is over; ""No Country for Old Men"" is here and Coen's are better then ever. They decided to make a movie based on a novel by Cormac McCarthy and the whole movie is nominated for 8 Oscars.<br/><br/>Story is about Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), who goes out hunting and he founds lots of dead bodies, drugs and bag full of money near Rio Grande. Old sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) has to solve this case and on Llewelyn's way is also crazy killer Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) who wants the money for himself.<br/><br/>What is excellent in this movie? Well, I would say almost everything. Direction is perfect, with great shots and movements of camera. Also Coen's know how to make actors shine. Tommy Lee Jones (he's always brilliant), Josh Brolin (surprisingly good), Kelly Macdonald (great), Woody Harrelson (excellent short performance) and Barry Corbin (just like Harrelson) are staring in it. But there is one man that stands alone in this perfect cast: Javier Bardem. His last performance in ""Love in the Time of Cholera"" is wooden, but here he surprised everyone. He trows coins (just like Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face), he's 100% crazy, 100% original and 100% brilliant. He represents ultimate evil in this movie. <br/><br/>""No Country for Old Men"". Title is very important and the first lines indicate what is this movie about: ""I always liked to hear about the old timers. Never missed a chance to do so. You can't help but compare yourself against the old timers. Can't help but wonder how they would've operated these times."" There is the importance of the whole story. Old sheriff Ed Tom Bell is surprised with the time that he lives in. Most important conversation is between Ed Tom and old Ellis. Ellis says that there's always been crimes and evil is always here. But they are too old to fight with it and that's why there is no country for old men - ""This country's hard on people, you can't stop what's coming, it ain't all waiting on you. That's vanity."" And also my favorite dialog (if you put aside all Bardem's ones) is the last lines between Ed Tom and his wife; when he's describing his dream (watch it carefully cause that is the last scene). <br/><br/>Coen's are here and their movie is one of the top 10 this year. Masterpiece of a movie that you need to watch. I watched it twice and I want more. More of Bardem, more of Coen's and more of this spectacular movie that has hidden meaning. Cause ""No Country for Old Men"" is not only a chase for Llewelyn Moss and bag of money or some pointless killing path of Anton Chigurh. No, that is not Coen's way of directing movies; ""No Country for Old Men"" is intelligent and strong movie."

A hunter named Moss (Josh Brolin) stumbles upon the scene of a drug deal gone really, really sour. Dead bodies, including a dog. Shot up trucks. A huge stash of drugs. And, at the end of a bloody trail, a dead man and a satchel with $2 million in cash. Now, what would you do in that situation? You're armed, but who knows who's out there in the wilderness, looking for their lost loot? If you're Mr. Moss, you amscray the heck out of there.<br/><br/>Of course, someone's gonna come looking for that money, and that person is a crazy bastard named Chigurh (Javier Bardem), who has a penchant for killing and absolutely no moral compass to speak of. He wants something, he kills you and takes it. Or takes it and kills you. Either way. Chigurh is single minded, but he's by no means a simple man; he's whip smart and blindingly fast with his gun and his feet. There's something about Chigurh that separates him from every other killer who wants his money back; its intangible, and it's all because Bardem is so perfect in the role. His sad eyes belie an absolutely terrifying, methodically maniacal criminal.<br/><br/>Completing the trifecta is a beleaguered, world-weary sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones). Sheriff Ed Tom Bell is to No Country for Old Men as Marge Gunderson was to Fargo; the no-nonsense, superclever, seasoned Johnny Law who tries desperately to piece together the puzzle before every character has been murdered, a la Shakespeare. This is a role Jones was made to play, and I can safely say he turns in the finest, most nuanced and sincere performance of his long career. Jones has the countenance of a leathery cowpoke as it is, and the unique drawl to accompany it, and the beautiful, poignant script (also by the Coen brothers) allows him to really show his stuff.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, though, in spite of its subtleties, this is a very violent movie; many painful, gut-wrenching deaths occur. Still and all, one thing that makes the movie work is that the violence seems real, not comic-book style; it's not violence without serious repercussions.<br/><br/>Back to the writing. At times during the film, multiple story lines are in motion, a la Pulp Fiction, and everything moves so seamlessly that it's only later, in retrospect, that you recall certain aspects that tie in one character's perspective with that of another. A mediocre screenwriter would have trouble with this, and plot holes the size of the Rio Grande itself would emerge. People would laugh about the plot inaccuracies and overall inadequacies.<br/><br/>And then, finally, there's that ending. Some people will absolutely love the ending, but others will stare at the screen for a few minutes, wondering if there's more to the story. Simply put, not everything is explicitly resolved, so if you're the kind of person who must have everything tied up as if in a 30-minute sitcom, you're going to have an issue or two with the finale. There was a bit of silence in the theater in which I saw this movie, but I didn't get the impression it was the angry ""THAT'S IT??"" kind, just the surprised kind."

","This film has just about everything; gore, action, love, hate, philosophy, huge suspense, good acting, good dialog, great cinematography... the only thing it lacks is a nice hardcore sex scene(i'm old fashioned in that way)<br/><br/>In an attempt to rebut the nonsense of those people who gave this movie 1 star, i will explain in the simplest possible terms why i disagree with their complaints.<br/><br/>To begin, i have read lots of criticism of the dialog being unbelievable, not relating to the story, and being pointless. They are correct in the sense that the dialog does not relay plot points, but for good reason; For example if the character of Moss has done so the result would have been something like this: ""I'll hitchhike, that way it will be harder to follow me."", Or ""ill look at my watch for a few minutes before approaching, that way i can judge of he is dead or not""... The basic point being, this is one of those rare films that relies on the idea of the viewer retaining some form of intelligence; A bit risky with todays audience but in opinion a worthy gamble.<br/><br/>The same can be said, to a certain extent, concerning character development; The viewer is required to judge the characters based on their actions as well as their sometimes complex dialog. Sorry, but the reason no characters say things like ""I love you, you cant die, you are everything to me"" is the reason this film is great.<br/><br/>I could go on but i think you get the point. In summary, if you are the kind of person that laughs because everyone else is laughing, not because you get the joke, you wont like this movie. In which case i suggest that you turn on your brain. You should feel privileged to have seen a movie that was ""confusing"" as apposed to being thankful for a pile of garbage dumped in your lap(aka 300)"
"jaredmobarak","9","2","9","21 November 2007"," Got some hard bark on that oneNo Country for Old Men
","While No Country for Old Men is not a perfect film, it is masterfully crafted and orchestrated to brilliant effect. My only reservation here is the lethargic pace in a few moments, but mostly the ending that seems to go on for about ten minutes too long. I will fault that with the brothers' adapting process of Cormac McCarthy's novel. We are able to drop so many characters throughout the proceedings without a second thought, that the necessity to go back to Sheriff Bell at the end was a bit too out of place, waxing poetic for pretension sake. Otherwise, there is very, very little not to like.<br/><br/>Upon viewing the trailer, I was under the impression the story would be more than just about a man stumbling upon two million dollars and his attempt to elude capture by the enigmatic Anton Chigurth. However, much to my surprise, and ultimate approval, there was not. Every periphery character comes to the story for the sole purpose to enhance the central plot and give a bit more information on the cat and mouse chase. It truly is Josh Brolin's stoic Llewelyn Moss versus Javier Bardem's psychopathic Chigurh, and these two do not disappoint. I cannot believe Brolin almost wasn't in the film at all. He had done a test reel with Robert Rodriguez during Grindhouse filming and sent it in for review only to find that the Coen's wanted to know who lit it, not more about the actor included. With a little pressure from his agent, the brothers reluctantly took a meeting, pretty much when the audition process was over, and that was all she wrote. Who says some hard work and persistence can't get you anywhere? It may have gotten Brolin in an Oscar winning film.<br/><br/>The leads are so good here, they don't even need to speakand believe me they don't for much of the movie. Sans score/soundtrack, the quiet foreboding atmosphere and the shear expression of exertion, mentally and physically, on either's face amps the tension and suspense to unforeseen levels. I was on the edge of my seat for practically the entire film, waiting anxiously to see what carnage Bardem would leave in his wake and if Brolin would once again escape, barely able to walk, for a freedom that probably wouldn't last too long. I can't think of any character more menacing them Bardem in recent memory, if ever. With his Dutch Boy haircut, sly smirk when speaking, and harsh deep accent, he would give even the most unfretted person shivers. And his air gun contraption always dragging behind him is a fantastic touch. With so few words emitted, the props do all the speaking for him.<br/><br/>Every supporting role is magnificently handled as well. If the Coens know one thing, it is the small town, country bumpkin mentality. The old southern drawls and longwinded ways to say simple things, with just the right amount of flair to leave you shaking your head about how real people don't talk that way, are here in force. Kelly Macdonald plays the wife who knows what's happening but never lets on to perfection and Garret Dillahunt is a riot as the smarter than his words deputy. His description of the shootout is hilarious and his back and forth with the sheriff always entertaining. That sheriff, played by Tommy Lee Jones, is also spectacular. He is the stand-in for the old men of the title, a lawman from a bygone era trying to understand the cruelty and deceit running rampant. Brought up by men who did their duty without the need for a gun, now chasing around murder after murder with federal agents going over every gruesome detail ad infinitum, he knows he is outmatched, and realizes he just doesn't have the stomach to exist in this new world. We get all that from his character and his actions alone, we don't really need the epilogue of him visiting people from his past to discover it for himselfit is a bit of overkill. Oh, and don't forget the city-types in Woody Harrelson and Coen regular Stephen Root, both funny and effective in small roles.<br/><br/>What really stands out, though, is the storytelling on display. The Coens are not afraid to go slow and make everything perfect. Each time I found myself questioning something about how Brolin's Moss was handling a situation; I soon got my answer with him waking late at night with an epiphany. Those two moments were a revelation, as though the filmmakers were reading mind. Every motivation was spot-on and each word carefully placed with minimalist precision, letting the audience know exactly what they need, no more/no less. The film is also beautifully shot and composed. There must have been some storyboarding going on because some of the set pieces and angles are breathtaking. You know exactly what is in store from the beginning as you see Bardem quietly getting free from his handcuffed position to kill his first victim, all while being blurred in the background. We need to see this blood and violence at the start to understand his malice and remorseless attitude, but the Coens know too much can be too much. Towards the end we only see the aftermaths and residuals from the killings. What was once shown to startle, with its brutality, eventually changes to become a device for us to now watch the killer's face as he commits his atrocities. He seems to have become slightly unglued; perhaps meeting a formidable foe for once, and we are forced to peer on his impatiencejust one more detail woven into the effective tapestry of this film. Welcome back Joel and Ethan; hopefully you will stay for the long haul."

"Thrashman88","6","1","3","2 October 2017"," Could Someone Explain Me This Movie
","The Cohen brothers are known for their brainy, meticulously crafted, character driven films. I love ""Fargo"", and ""No Country For Old Men"" had all the elements of another masterpiece, yet it is not. It is a very well made movie, very well acted and with some high impact action sequences and some nasty gore thrown in to make things real, but since I know little about the characters, little I care about them or what happens to them. You have Javier Bardem as psychopathic killer Anton Chigurh. Where this guys came from, what's his purpose and why does he carry a powerful air gun (with which he can shoot people dead at close range or blow door knobs off). You have Josh Brolin as Llewelyn Moss, an average Joe with a military background who happens to stumble upon a drug deal gone wrong and grabs a suitcase filled with 2 million dollars. A surviving drug dealer, bleeding to death in his truck asks Llewelyn for some water. The guy will not last more than a couple of hours at the most. Llewlyn drives back home with the 2 million suitcase. Instead of packing things up immediately and leave town with his wife Carla Jean, he makes the incredibly STUPID mistake of going back to the scene of the crime carrying a gallon of water. It seems he wants to give some water to the dying drug dealer but for this, several hours have passed, it's dark now and sure enough, the drug dealer's dead, not before a rival gang sees him in the distance and chases him, until he escapes by jumping into a river. <br/><br/>That was the stupidest plan ever and sure enough, it sets the ball rolling for the rival gang to try to find Llewelyn Moss and get their money back. The rival drug gang assign wacko head Anton to go after Llewlynd, which turns ""No Country For Old Men"" into a tense thriller.<br/><br/>Everything was going just fine until the abrupt ending, where town sheriff (played very laid back by Tommy Lee Jones) starts mumbling some monologue stuff, as if to tie some loose ends of the story and suddenly, Poof! The end credits start rolling. What happened to Anton? Did he actually killed Llewelyn's wife? No I'm sure there are some brainy reviewers here that might say that films leave certain stuff for people to make their own conclusions, but this is really over the top. I actually thought my bluray disc player had stuck and jumped over to the credits but no: that WAS the actual ending.<br/><br/>One thing that also really bothered me were the shoot out sequences. It appears that Southern Texas is devoid of a police force, since we actually see very few of them, in spite of fire arms being fired left and right, at night and in broad daylight. It reminded me of Mexico, where you can do this sort of stuff during a traffic jam only to have police arrive an hour later. But Mexico is like that, uber corrupt, far more than ANYTHING in the States. Throughout the entire film, I didn't get the impression the police were after Anton Chiguhr, save for the very end.<br/><br/>All in all, I enjoyed the movie. I only wish my brain could be far more developed to understand the meaning behind this film, the abruptness of how it ends and what was it all about"

","No Country for Old Men follows a man as he stumbles upon a case of money and takes it for himself. Meanwhile, a psychopathic killer hunts him down for said money, while the sheriff goes looking for both of them in order to protect the man with the money. <br/><br/>For the most part the acting was good. Josh Brolin was good, Javier Bardem is good, Tommy Lee Jones is fine for his whole maybe thirty minutes of screen time. The performances aren't spectacular, but they're better than average for sure. Most of them, anyway. The characters themselves aren't horribly complex, even Bardem's character wasn't. There wasn't a lot to the characters, so it was hard for the actors to pull off anything amazing. <br/><br/>The way the ending was presented was both unique and unexpected, and wasn't at all what I expected. <br/><br/>There were plenty of cool set-ups and reasonably suspenseful fights, even if they were mostly unproductive. <br/><br/>While most every line of dialogue was well written, there were a handful that popped out where it was blatantly obvious that the characters weren't talking to anyone other than the audience. They were written so that the audience would have a better idea of what was happening. <br/><br/>Sometimes things happened or worked out without any explanation as to how. Sure, there were some parts that the audience could just assume, but the question of 'how' often came to mind. On top of that sometimes things just didn't make sense when they really should have. They were little things, but they impacted the movie regardless. <br/><br/>The characters had pretty thick accents, and often talked quietly in said accents, making it almost impossible to understand them from time to time. Sure, I could turn on subtitles, but this is a movie where the spoken language is English, and as an English speaker I really shouldn't have to do that. <br/><br/>Overall No Country for Old Men is, while a good movie, nothing to freak out about. Sure, it's good, it's well-written and pretty well acted, but that's really about it. There really isn't a lot to appreciate about this movie, but there's plenty to complain about. I don't see why people love this movie so much, it's honestly pretty forgettable. In short, it was good, but nowhere near best picture worthy. In the end I'd still recommend this movie. With the amount of praise it's received you'll probably still love it."

","Another viewing, after I'd seen it twice about seven years ago, and it turned out to be a bit of a disappointment again. This time around, I was more able to get into the straightforward thriller feel of things. I still think Brolin wasn't the best man for the part, but then again, this whole film lacks that 'Coen-feeling', somehow. And a lot scenes with Tommy Lee Jones were just downright boring. I mean, of course his part is important to the story, but a lot of his complaining and such was just too much for me. Another bummer (again) was Bardems part, although he was not as annoying as before, and some of Antons rants even came close to making sense this time.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there is no typical musical theme by Carter Burwell, except for that terrific bit just after the film is over. Not using much music can help add the tension, and I guess it did so here.<br/><br/>I found it to be a little more fun to watch than the last time, but it's still no masterpiece in my opinion, not by a long shot. A big 6 out of 10."
"ravi-mistry1997","6","1","3","1 December 2014"," Brilliantly crafted, brilliant performances, brilliant suspense, but not perfect.
","This film is, hands down, one of the most shocking, brutal yet beautiful movies I have watched. Setting the scene in a dusky, dry Texas desert we see our main protagonist, Llewelyn Moss, hunting deer before stumbling upon a drug deal gone wrong. He finds $2 million dollars and skedaddles. A bit naive to think he wouldn't get tracked down, but that's beside the point. He then proceeds to go back to the scene and give water to the drug dealer where he gets shot at by Mexicans who are obviously a part of this drug deal. We then see where our murderous, merciless antagonist, Anton Chigurrh becomes part of the story. He is given a tracker, by people whom we are not introduced to, that will tell him where the money is. Again, us as the audience not knowing why he wants this money so badly that he feels the need to kill everyone who breathes anywhere near him.<br/><br/>Between this moment and the moments leading up to the death of Llewellyn, was hot with shootouts, and lots of intense dialogue. Mainly due to the cold, almost alien-like confrontation given by Javier Bardem and his victims. However I grew no strong bond between the character of Llewellyn, mainly because of his selfish act putting his wife at risk, but I guess that's due to the morals that are trying to be put in place in the movie. This morality embedded in Tommy Lee Jones' character. I believe that his character was just there to give meaning to the title. He served no role in the movie except tell us in frank words; it wasn't like this back in my day. And because of this he felt he was too old to confront these horrific acts due to his age and lack of understanding as to why the generation cares so much for drugs and money. <br/><br/>I do believe the film was futile and simplistic. Simplistic in the terms of, if this movie's storyline was put into the hands of another director, it would be a B-movie. But I'm not just ""crapping"" on the movie. It had it's moments, all of the moments being the scenes of Javier Bardem's character. You could feel your heart rate rising within every word he spoke to his victims, the intensity was unreal. <br/><br/>6/10"

Despite the movie is well-said that "" it is possible to have yourself a certain set of principles that, if followed correctly should make you will be nearly invincible to those that follow the traditional set and beyond. By the way, the plot of this movie is very clinched and boring and also there are the random characters being introduced in the movie for no apparent reason.

","The story is just another one that develops quite aimlessly. But really like how the movie throws the focus back and forth between Chigurh and Moss without loosing any moment but instead complete the story's puzzle pieces altogether. What quite disappoints me is that not even once did Tommy Lee Jones had the chance to sound out one of his usual pitched commanding order barking yells or excited characteristic lines of dialog. The action bits are great and, I got to admit, were designed superbly. The execution also considers the night factor nicely that the dark of the night doesn't reduce the quality of action despite they're using less lights such as muzzle flashes. The acting is just superb. All thumbs up for Javier Bardem's performance. He really nailed his role greatly. Josh Brolin also acted out great, although still his performance is not as great as Bardem's due to he played a character which he already used to depict. Too bad that the movie doesn't really give Tommy Lee Jones' character more part."
"i_ianchev","9","1","3","23 February 2014"," This is No country for old men
","I have recently watched Cormac McCarthy's ""The Counselor"" and that's why I decided to pay due attention to his""and the Coen brothers' ""No country for old men"". A true hunter-prey classic tale about life...<br/><br/>I'll start from the ending, where sheriff Bell shares his two dreams - the first about losing the money that his father (also a sheriff) gave him and the second about his ride along with his father. I can truly connect to this metaphor. It is a vivid vehicle for the directors and the script - our fears, hopes and thoughts are all reflected in our dreams. And the dream to follow into his father's steps became kind of a nightmare (losing the money his father gave him) for Bell. But the true message which we receive through this insightful movie is the moral of the second dream. You see, the title of this film comes from the 20th century dramatist William Butler Yeats's poem ""Sailing to Byzantium"". It goes like this:<br/><br/>""That is no country for old men. The young In one another's arms, birds in the trees – Those dying generations – at their song, The salmon-falls, the mackerel-crowded seas, Fish, flesh, or fowl, commend all summer long Whatever is begotten, born, and dies. Caught in that sensual music all neglect Monuments of unageing intellect""<br/><br/>""Those dying generations"" are Bell, his father, his uncle and his grandfather who were all sheriffs at the depicted parts of West Texas. And their covenant is fading and will ultimately be lost. The weary and old sheriff is overwhelmed by his own incapacity to deal with the new generation of crime and loathing. His uncle Ellis reminds him that these parts have always been wild and violent. Despite this Bell feels like his grasp is not firm enough and that he is heading where his father ""awaits"". After all his efforts to help Llewelyn Moss despite his fear, he ends up finding him dead. And he feels like there is nothing he can do about it. That people like Anton Chigurh and the Mexican drug cartel members overmatch him with their boundless discontentment. That law and order are already lost and he can do nothing but stay away from this world of the hunters and their prey. I think that this is exactly why at the end of this movie he has accepted his part as the one who will inevitably fade away like a dinosaur, like an ""old man"". Failure is weighing above his consciousness. And that's why after his retirement he is more content, troubled only by his dreams, reflecting on his past where he sees no future for individuals like himself. This is a very interesting juxtaposition - between the feeling of moral codes passing and the sense that since ancient times people have always been the same, that we are living in a circle of discontentment. This is both eerie and assuring to me. What do you think?<br/><br/>And in the end I just want to add my utter admiration of Cormac McCarthy's books which show us our violent nature of selfishly deluded living beings. The stories are mature and absorbing. Reassuring that there is no white and black, only gray in our lives. The script is precise in tension, with thrilling sound and camera work. The imagery is both beautiful and a bit hopeless. I felt some of these aspects in ""The Counselor"" too, but then again Ridley Scott and The Coen brothers are two very different categories."

","To me, the contrast between this film and Joel and Ethan Cohen's newer film ""True Grit"" is as far apart as you can get. Maybe technically, they both succeed. But movies are about story-telling first and foremost. This movie fails on many levels from a story-telling perspective. It fails to deliver a complete story, fails to inspire, has no moral compass, and ultimately just sells us short as movie-goers. What do I mean ""sells us short""? I mean the movie-makers show us scenes we don't need to see (such as shots of dead dogs), and don't show us scenes we do need see *** spoiler alert *** ... (such as what how our hero and villain meet their final fate). It is startling how my criticisms of this film are polar opposites of why I applaud Joel and Ethan Cohen's newer film ""True Grit"". Both are basically Westerns, but True Grit has a complete story, full character development, and is deeply rooted in morality and courage. It is everything this film is not. That's why I say ""No Country for Old Men"" has ""No Grit""."

","Moss was killed by the Mexican group that was tipped (unknowingly) by his mother-in-law. The hit-squad though, could not find the cash. Later, Chirgh enters the motel to look for the money and also can not find it? Why else would he apparently still be there (in an adjoining room) when Bell arrives? Or was he only symbolically there? <br/><br/>Radical interpretation: Bell finds the money (and then retires from the police force.) This would also explain the director's attempts to show a mysterious inner-bond between Bell and Chirgh, such as the ""milk"" scene where they are identically reflected on a dead TV screen. I found this connection unsubstantiated, unlike another film ""Manhunter"" which explored a creepy-believable connection between detective and (in this case) Hannibal Lecter. But hey, let's take it to another level to substantiate their connection: Chirgh is the illegitimate son of Bell, from his Mexican girlfriend! <br/><br/>Beef question: is the Chirgh unstoppable? Yes, IF he is solely a symbolic ""dream"" death figure wandering through the world as master of its (ironically, lack of chance) elements. Notice that in all his death-dealing scenarios there is never the stray person that pops in unexpectedly, the off-duty cop or gun carrying vigilante. As a human-being though, Chirgh is definitely stoppable. If Moss would not have been so stupid (lock-cylinder to head, duh!) he could have nailed Chirgh in his motel room after he first found the transponder. He needed to simply place his armed ass to the side of the door. As insurance, I would have packed some pillows out from the wall on the door's hinge-side opposite of where I would be placed. This would divert attention just enough for a clean kill. Hasta la vista, Chirgh!"

","Film critic Roger Ebert once said that the biggest mistake the Academy Awards ever made was giving 2000's ""Gladiator"" the award for Best Picture of the Year. Now I thoroughly enjoyed ""Gladiator"" and if I had to list what I personally felt was the Academy's biggest mistake in Best Picture, I think I would select 2007's winner ""No Country for Old Men."" First of all, let me state that my giving this Oscar-winner a negative review, that I am standing very far away from the majority. Most people who have seen ""No Country for Old Men"" would describe it as a masterpiece; a modern-day classic with truly marvelous suspense. Well, I've seen the film and I would describe it was neither a classic, nor very suspenseful. And I know that by panning this film, that my review will be the subject of user criticism and probably, for some, proof of my worthlessness as a reviewer. But I sat down to watch ""No Country for Old Men"" with high expectations and had the time of my life with the first half-hour, but soon lost interest after that and ultimately I resulted in feeling the movie was in a word: mediocre. Very well-made, but mediocre.<br/><br/>The film is about a hunter (Josh Brolin) who stumbles upon a killing field that resulted from a drug deal gone bad. While investigating, he comes upon a case full of money and instead of turning it in, keeps the cash and goes on the run when he learns he's being tailed by a vicious tracker for the dealers (Javier Bardem). Meanwhile, a sheriff played by Tommy Lee Jones, tries to solve the whole affair more or less in the background.<br/><br/>Now this is a story that had me interested at the start. It's basically an updated version of Geoffrey Chaucer's classic ""The Pardoner's Tale."" And it sports a great cast with great performances, especially by Bardem, who won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, and is well made by the Coen brothers, famous for their previous endeavors such as ""Fargo"" (1996), however, the film ended up, to make it short, very much like its cinematographry: dry and lacking vibrancy. Again, it had a terrific beginning. But immediately after that, it seemed that the movie really bogged down and became deprived of the energy required to stay interested. And part of the reason for this is the inclusion of unnecessary characters. The Woody Harrelson character, in particular, is completely unnecessary and really does nothing at all worthy of one's time in the picture except stand around and talk. What was the point of his character? To a certain extent, what was the point of the Tommy Lee Jones character? I feel the film would have been better had it strictly focused on Bardem and Brolin as the hunter and the hunted, for their story was the interesting part. The subplot with Harrelson and Jones' wanted to retire just really seemed to get in the way.<br/><br/>I won't rant on about this film forever, but there is one more thing I really do want to cover. I read a lot of reviews about this film and a lot of enthusiastic supporters said the film was so riveting and so suspenseful that ""Alfred Hitchcock himself couldn't have done better."" Well, I've seen the film and I can honestly say that Alfred Hitchcock most certainly could have and DID do better in films such as ""Rear Window"" (1954), which was twice the movie this is. There was suspense at the beginning, in a sequence with Brolin being chased by drug dealers and voracious dogs, but after that, I didn't find a single moment where I was on the edge of my seat of finding myself jumping in fright. So all in all, we all have a Best Picture-winner that we don't think is worthy of the award and for me, it's ""No Country for Old Men."""
"neil-476","7","1","3","28 June 2009"," Frustrating
","I don't care for the Coens. While they are undoubtedly exceedingly talented, they have a propensity for making films to please themselves on a level which the viewer doesn't always share - this viewer, at any rate.<br/><br/>No Country For Old Men is so nearly mainstream that I very much enjoyed it until the end, when it left me feeling frustrated. I'm a great believer in stories having satisfactory resolutions (as opposed to happy endings), and No Country has no resolution whatsoever: worse, it actually goes to some trouble to set up a non-resolution.<br/><br/>I don't know whether the lack of a resolution is a feature of Cormack McCarthy's original book or whether it is the work of director/adaptors the Coens, although I strongly suspect the latter. Whoever is responsible, it spoiled the movie for me fairly comprehensively. Understand - I have no problem with an ending where the villain gets away with it, but I do like to have a resolution.<br/><br/>And it's such a pity. The script is excellent, the performances are excellent, the look of the film is excellent, the direction is very good (it is a little slow), but there's no darn resolution!"
"nicolasmarinus","6","1","3","25 May 2009"," No film for everyone
","""No country for old men"" is extremely well-directed and the acting really stands out.<br/><br/>I love how most of the back-story is only implied at and left to the viewer to piece together. The pacing is slow and the scenery minimal, yet none of this makes for a boring movie, on the contrary.<br/><br/>Where it falls short, is relevance and at times credibility. I'll give a few examples.<br/><br/>Credibility: <br/><br/>If you find 2 million dollars of drug money, what kind of moron would you have to be to return to the crime scene in order to assist a dying man there you left in the first place. Not very credible. It seems more like a plot contrivance to initiate the hunt.<br/><br/>Running from a truck at night in the desert? And winning?<br/><br/>Woody's character finds the main character in 3 hours and the hidden money one hour later in a very unlikely hiding place. Really? He's one clever puppy!<br/><br/>Relevance: <br/><br/>There are a lot of scenes, characters and dialogues that seem to go nowhere. Tommy Lee Jones does little more than think aloud about ""these days"" and what role does Woody Harrelson's character fulfill? What does he contribute?<br/><br/>The total breakdown of the film came when the lead character is killed off near the end, creating a huge void that could have been interesting, but isn't filled at all. Instead the villain gets into a car accident and the sheriff retires and dreams about dad.<br/><br/>Now you can argue that is probably how it would unfold in real life. However, this ""true to life"" theme doesn't correlate with the lack of credibility I mentioned before.<br/><br/>During the film, you feel this underlying tension that seems to be building up to something. Instead, towards the end, it unravels into banality, leaving me with a feeling of doubt as to why I bothered investing time into characters that wound up nowhere.<br/><br/>In short, it's a memorable film with good emotions and powerful scenes, but with a very ambiguous ending. Not for everyone."

I even re-wound the film on sky as I thought I must have missed 10 minutes or more, but no it was just a stupid ending. I think the film could have been made as a good action movie if it had compressed the original movie to about 25 minutes.

","When I saw this movie at the cinema, I remember loving it. I still do. But as I was coming out and thinking about what I had just seen, I realized I hadn't seen a Coens movie. I had just seen a thriller that happened to be directed by the Coens.<br/><br/>No Country for Old Men is one of the finest movies I've seen in recent years, and like most Coens fans I rejoiced in their winning the Oscars at last. But I wish they had been recognized for a movie that's more similar to their usual work. I have no complaints about the technical aspects of the movie: sound, editing, cinematography are all excellent. The acting is good, especially Tommy Lee Jones and Josh Brolin's. Javier Bardem didn't impress me the way he did everyone else that year: I think cinema has enough one-dimensional, monotone pseudo-philosophical badass villains who behave like the Terminator as it is. But I can't blame the Coens. They're just following Cormac McCarthy's novel here.<br/><br/>Most of my complaints spring from novel. The Coens, constrained by it, couldn't fill the movie with their usual brand of nonsense and quirky humor. This is a serious movie, more serious than a heart attack, although it's nothing more than a chase movie. Not even in Blood Simple, arguably the Coens most darkest movie, were they ever this serious; they counteracted it with a lot of off-beat humor.<br/><br/>One of things I love in the Coens is how life is pretty cheap. Visser in Blood Simple can kill for just $10,000. In Fargo, Carl and Gaear can kidnap just for $80,000. Pathetic amounts when we think about the millions that usually pop in crime movies. But it shows how cruel people can. Not in this movie: $2,000,000 are at stake here, a sum worth killing for indeed. I can't blame Anton Chigurh (Bardem) for having so much trouble about it.<br/><br/>Apart from minor quibbles, No Country for Old Men is worth watching. The things the Coens do with sound, silence and shadows in this movie is amazing. Roger Deakins deserved an Oscar. The first showdown between Moss (Brolin) and Chigurh is just a masterpiece of suspense.<br/><br/>Tommy Lee Jones gives my favorite performance in the movie, as an aging, small-town sheriff who can't really cope with the dark modern world of Chigurh. Jones projects so much world-weariness and sadness onto his face, you feel he's really been a cop all his life.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a tense, fast-paced thriller, worth watching as much for its story as for its technical aspects. It's a great movie. It's just not a great Coens movie."

","The Coen brothers can be brilliant or terrible; this film belongs fortunately to the Fargo side of their movie making. The plot is crisp, violent, snappy, and intensely dark, yet the pacing gives everything an exuberance that belies the overall material. <br/><br/>This is a film about evil for the sake of evil. The acting is excellent, the beaten down cop on the case (Tommy Lee Jones), the very very bad guy (Bardem) the waster (Josh Brolin) who finds the drugs money, and his girlfriend(Kelly Macdonald) who will become a more significant character towards the end of the movie. The final scene is bitterly disappointing though, the film just drifts way. The novel I believe has this ending, but oh boy it doesn't work here. It is a shame, because it robs the film of greatness. <br/><br/>I think the key scene in this movie is were the girlfriend comes face to face with remorseless evil(Javier Bardem). She realises she has been betrayed, and this gives the movie an understated but powerful emotion punch. Shame about the films ending though because it softens the harsh bleakness of the movies overall message. You will long remember Bardems performance, but the movie has more to offer than that though, but it needed a more dramatic, and better thought out ending to make the films other qualities more apparent."

","I love the Coen Brothers for their Quirky comedies like Raising Arizona and Hudsucker Proxy, but I am always underwhelmed by their pulp dramas, like Blood Simple, Miller's Crossing and, most recently, No Country for Old Men.<br/><br/>I could tell early on I wasn't going to like this, but got sucked in by a brilliant, menacing performance by Javier Bardem. Like John Turturo in Miller's crossing, Bardem is an electrifying presence in a sea of blandness. Bardem's scenes are gripping and mesmerizing, but that leaves the 60% to 70% without him quite dull.<br/><br/>Structurally the movie is interesting. The movie relies on the audiences' familiarity with film structure to raise certain expectations and then thwarts those expectations one by one. It's an interesting idea, but while arguably what happens is more likely than what usually happens in movies, it's also less interesting and less clever. And since the movie as a whole still isn't realistic (and is also decidedly mannered), there doesn't seem to be much point in throwing in some realistic events to try and add some irony.<br/><br/>As mentioned above though, I never like Coen Brothers pulp dramas, so if you like the others, you ought to like this one too."

","The focus of this complex film is on an aging Sheriff, Ed Tom Bell, who is working on the case of a drug deal that has gone very bad indeed--it has left several people dead and two million dollars up for grabs. When there is that kind of money on the loose there most likely will be several parties interested in its recovery, and here we have Llewelyn Moss (who accidentally happens on the money), a band of Mexicans (who delivered the dope), business investors, bounty hunters, and one Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem). All of these characters play an intricate cat and mouse game, but the three main players are Moss, Bell, and Chigurh. <br/><br/>The film has higher aspirations than being a typical crime thriller. It touches on the role that evil and fate play in our lives. These themes are particularized in the personal experiences of Ed Bell who can stand in for anyone who is old enough to remember a time when astonishing acts of violence seemed rare. At the scene of the drug deal Ed has witnessed a brutal massacre and he subsequently tries to track down Chigurh, one of the most amoral and evil killers ever put on the screen. Chigurh is particularly scary since he is intelligent and not obviously crazy.<br/><br/>Ed is astonished by what he perceives as a rise in a type of violence which he does not understand nor know how to deal with. He relates a gruesome story out of California that truly dumbfounds him, a story that provokes a laugh from his younger deputy. The rather downbeat message is that in the face of evil most people try to ignore it and go about their daily lives, but people like Ed feel overwhelmed and come to regard themselves as helpless bystanders. Perhaps the older one gets the more societal changes in the United States encourage one to feel like Ed, hence the title of the movie.<br/><br/>The location shots in west Texas are beautifully filmed. It is a harsh and spare landscape which has shaped the local inhabitants, they are direct and sparing of words. Whether you like this film will depend greatly on whether you like the lean dialog and deliberate pacing. For example, when Bell goes to visit his friend (relative?) Ellis he asks ""How you been Ellis?"" and gets the response, ""You're looking at it."" By appearances, Ellis is not doing too well. When Ellis makes the comment, ""I got to say, you're looking older,"" Bell replies, ""I am older."" These lines are delivered with perfect pitch. But there is more substantial conversation. Ellis comments, ""Well, all the time you spend trying to get back what's been took from you, more is going out the door."" This pivotal scene between Bell and Ellis is a wondrous piece of work, accomplished actors delivering great dialog.<br/><br/>Then there is Javier Bardem who probably deserved his Oscar. What a versatile actor. Compare his performance in this movie with those in ""The Sea Inside,"" and ""Before Night Falls,"" and you become a believer in his talents. All the actors are perfectly cast.<br/><br/>The musical score is minimal and that seems to greatly accentuate the tension. <br/><br/>There are some classic scenes such as the exchange between Chigurh and a gas station attendant where a life depends on a coin toss. I am sure existentialists could make much of that scene. When he is not out for a deliberate kill Chigurh likes to play the game of tossing a coin to determine life or death. In the abstract Chigurh could represent the role of fate in our lives: an uncontrollable force lurking out there just waiting to change our lives in some unpredictable way. Chigurh himself is ultimately the victim of such a fateful event.<br/><br/>The final scene is powerful. After telling of a dream where his father appeared as protector and safety icon Bell comes back to reality to realize that he has no such protector and in fact is no longer of much use in this world, not even to his wife. When he realizes this his look of anguish is agonizing to watch.<br/><br/>I have see seven of the Coen brothers movies (including ""Fargo"") and this is the only one that has truly engaged me."

The quirky look and feel of the film are classic to other Coen films, but the overly simple and unbelievable plot overshadow the films attributes. Did Bardem really deserve the Oscar? He barely speaks throughout the film. I had a hard enough time coping with the bad hairdo, let alone admire his pointless character. Not even the violence of the film is enough to hold this viewer's attention. Woody Harrelson's character is about as deep as a comic book hero, and Tommy Lee Jone's jovial nihilism just does not hold up, especially after his last ranting monologue which concludes the film. He has the unfortunate quality of an actor who always seems to be the same person: Tommy Lee Jones. Sorry, but it just did not work this time."

This is not a shoot-'em-up or a clichéd thriller. It is a thought-provoking crime drama that is often tense but also takes the time to make its points clear. I found that viewing the film for a second time recently allowed me to better appreciate the film's depth.<br/><br/>The performances here are top-notch for the most part. Javier Bardem is menacing in his Oscar-winning role as Anton Chigurh, Josh Brolin is solid as man-on-the-run Llewelyn Moss and Tommy Lee Jones is perfectly cast as weathered lawman Ed Tom Bell. There were a couple of casting choices not quite to my liking but those were in minor roles.<br/><br/>The direction and cinematography are excellent, as you might expect from the Coen brothers. One of the interesting touches in this film is the almost complete lack of a score. Consequently, the early scenes set in the Texas desert have an eerie sense of windswept desolation.<br/><br/>This may be the best film that the Coen brothers have ever produced.

"London_Movie_Fan","3","1","3","28 July 2008"," Terminator + Gunfight at the OK Corral (Contains spoilers)
","Ever since 'Billion Dollar Babe' won the Oscar, I too have begun to doubt the Academy's ability to select real winners capable of standing the test of time. Unfortunately, 'No Country for Old Men', is another film that makes me wonder what the selection panel were thinking when they chose this movie for best picture. But it is not all bad by any means.The writing is good, the performances are excellent, (I certainly agree with the praise lavished upon Javier Bardem - the film is worth seeing if only for his almost reptilian portrayal of an extremely menacing and memorable bad guy), and, all in all, this is a stunning example of film making at its best. So what's missing?<br/><br/>The film finishes leaving an impression that the bad guy (Bardem) is more principled than many of the people he has killed. Indeed some are scum and he makes the world a better place by eliminating them. But he also murders a number of totally innocent victims who simply are in the wrong place at the wrong time. One character is killed simply because Bardem's character told the victim's significant other, who he has already killed, that he would do so. While keeping such a promise shows that the man is true to himself, when many other characters are not, the problem is that it's hard to associate any kind of rational morality with a someone who is so obviously a psychopath and who violently murders at least 10 people. It is impossible to empathize with this character. <br/><br/>(I also have a problem with Tommy Lee Jone's character as he contributes so little to bringing Bardem to justice. Josh Brolin and Kelly Macdonald are very good, though.) <br/><br/>We love Hollywood movies to give us happy endings, but instead this movie gives us a healthy dose of reality by reminding us that no one lives happily ever after in the real world. in doing so 'No Country for Old Men' ignores the reason why so many of us go to movies: precisely to find the happy endings that the real world denies us. We want movies that give us hope that the good in people outweighs the bad. We need to go on believing that good does triumph over evil. And that our entire concept of right and wrong is valid. Sadly, 'No Country for Old Men' reinforce the values that define society, it simply reveals the very worst of human nature. Maybe we need to be reminded of that, although real life massacres at US schools are probably more effective in doing this. in the end, this movie doesn't give us hope, it is reduces the audience to the role of voyeur amidst a relentless killing spree. <br/><br/>I think if you analyzed every movie listed on the IMDb database site, you'd find no more than 20 basic story lines. Things like: perseverance under adversity, relationships and romance, redemption, self-discovery, sacrifice, revenge etc. etc. I don't know what genre this Coen Brothers movie is trying to fall into. In fact, I suspect that it is deliberately trying to break the mould. But, Scott Peck, the famous psychologist, once said that every human interaction is an opportunity to learn or to teach. I believe that any good film should teach us something about the human condition as well as entertaining us. By teaching us nothing, the movie leaves a void rather than an imprint.<br/><br/>Ultimately, we want films that reflect unassailable truths about life,but truths that give us hope and a purpose to otherwise meaningless existence. Often it isn't the story itself that is important, but the telling: the way in which events lead us in a surprising way to the conclusion we hope and expect to see. For all these reasons, I'd like to see Bardem's character meet his nemisis.<br/><br/>Despite these deep flaws, it is still a remarkable movie."
"crey014","8","1","3","28 July 2008"," Both works, the book and the movie, are definitely not a convenient form of entertainment as they make their audiences work for it. And if they do, it's cathartic.
","With literary and cinematic accolades under its buckle, ""No Country for Old Men"" is a fascinating renovation on the western genre. With westerns habitually, they are predisposed to scrutinize various circumstances that authenticate the protagonist's sense of right and wrong. In this parable, it pioneers a character, Anton Chirguh, as an icon of the lack of ethics, that it simply twists everything out of proportion, shaking everything on its way. Both works, the book and the movie, are categorically not a convenient form of entertainment as they make their audiences work for it. And if they do, it's cathartic.<br/><br/>Set in 1980's Texas, a retired welder named Llewelyn Moss inadvertently stumbles upon a drug trade gone wrong. He finds a satchel full of bills, totaling to about 2 million dollars -- enough temptation for him to keep it. Trouble is, people who own the money wants it back fast, employing a hit man named Anton Chirguh, a character whose morality is close to zero and even uses virtue as an excuse to keep on his violent rampage. Sheriff Ed Tom Bell, an old timer and last on a generation of county sheriffs is on the case. With a labyrinthine con lined with unjustifiable violence, this shakes his notion of goodness to the very core.<br/><br/>Written by Cormac McCarthy, the novel definitely has this trademark fashion that may require a lot of effort to value. Each chapter starts with a stream of consciousness from Bell, nostalgic about his time as a Sheriff, when times and circumstances were comprehendible to him. The way that McCarthy writes for the rest of the novel is pretty similar to writing a script as he skimps on description and focuses on dialogue. He definitely has an amazing eye on tongue and this style instantly raises the sense of urgency the novel exudes even if some scenes span days between them.<br/><br/>With that, the Coen Brothers have easily loyally adapted the book to the screen. They were able to capture the essence of the novel within a 2 hour run time. Special kudos on the casting too as it is quite impossible to see other thespians hovering over these characters. Anton Chirguh is personified brilliantly by Javier Bardem, Oscar award and weird haircut in tow. With the first half of the film almost a carbon copy of the novella, the second half is where the Coens start to take liberty. They have reduced the Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson) character and even almost immediately eliminated the female hitchhiker Moss met by subbing her with another motel customer seducing him with alcohol. Both decisions were pretty smart, as I could imagine how they could have easily slowed down the pacing of the movie. However, there were some ideas instantly detached from the film and I guess this will be left for the book readers to discover.<br/><br/>In the novel, a scene between Moss and the female hitchhiker becomes a standout. At a diner, both characters chatter about the past and how it eventually catches up. Moss laments about the illusion of starting over and its futility. This was a pretty poignant scene as it highlight's Moss' regret and how he acknowledges that what he did can't be undone. On the other hand, in the film, the conversation between Chirguh and Carla Jean seem to not loose its luster. The scene basically highlights Chirguh's motivation for murder: to preserve his image as a character that doesn't hesitate.<br/><br/>""No Country for Old Men"" is definitely an intriguing story of morality. It teases its audience of hopelessness by making the last sheriff of a long line of county sheriffs quit in the face of an Anton Chirguh. But then, it leaves the audience with a small glimmer of hope by reminding them that Chirguh is still indeed human and can expire, punctured by his own bone. Both works are very compelling and can exist without each other. At its surface, it seems like a celebration of violence however it gets richer with time and will further reveal what it's really celebrating about."

It's a drug deal gone wrong, and Moss goes in search of the last man standing and the money he undoubtedly has. He finds him dead and aims to make a getaway with the money. Unbeknownst to him, the money is being tracked by the ruthless and brutal Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) who stops at nothing and for no-one on what he believes is a predestined course through life. As they tear across Texas near the Mexican border, leaving bodies and destruction in their wake, they are followed by the aging, weary and increasingly bewildered Sheriff who does not comprehend the evil Chigurh poses and begins to wonder whether humanity is going to hell in a handcart.<br/><br/>It is strong source material for the Coens, who started their careers on very similar territory with ""Blood Simple"". Their ability to construct intelligent thrillers is well established and with a strong foundation in the source material they excel. The script is clever, subtle and carefully constructed. At the centre are three characters who never quite share the screen, one of whom is the good man, principled and upstanding, whilst another is the evil man, confident in the idea that he has to do what is set out for him, and the third is caught in between the two, not a bad man, but not wholly good either. The three play out a gripping thriller, whilst the nature of man's morality is questioned.<br/><br/>The figure of good is common in the Coen's work (""Fargo""'s Marge is the prime example) and is normally the heart of the film. This could be said of Bell, but he is not the core of the film. That title belongs to Chigurh. The film opens with this quiet man killing a lawman and an unfortunate driver, the latter in a punchy and gory manner, the former in a sickening, sadistic way. From then on, every second Chigurh has on screen is menacing, a sense which is enhanced to the extreme by Javier Bardem's brilliant, subtle and electrifying performance. Dressed in dark clothing with the most unnerving haircut ever seen on screen, Chigurh becomes a ""ghost"", a force of evil and it is this that drives the film to the heights it reaches.<br/><br/>We have no special reason to feel for Moss. He does little to earn our sympathy, and yet we are driven to distraction for his wellbeing once Chigurh is on his tail. Whenever we do not see Chigurh we expect him to arrive. We gasp when he creeps into the back of the frame and we shiver when he's on screen. A scrunched up wrapper uncoiling becomes threatening in his presence and life and death hangs on a coin toss. The weight and clunk of his gas canister, the punch of his bolt gun and smack of his shotgun all contribute to our terror in what is a masterpiece of writing, performance and design.<br/><br/>But Chigurh is not all of the film. Josh Brolin's Moss is a fine character and another magnificent performance. He is a true everyman. He is a good man in many ways but vulnerable in others. His greed gets him into trouble, but his generosity digs him deeper into it. Brolin brings his character into sharp focus, as does Tommy Lee Jones. Bell's dry humour and wisdom are engaging, but his sense of ever increasing evil around him makes him more interesting. His sense of free will directly contrasts Chigurh's blinkered determinism and the two bring philosophical depth to the picture.<br/><br/>But, for all of the intelligence, this film would be nothing without its gripping and tense plot which is superbly executed by the Coens. Every element, every sound, every light, every note of music and every line, is used to maximum effect. Whereas in the infinitely comparable ""Blood Simple"" the directorial style filled the frame, here the film uses subtle touches (hats off to cinematographer Roger Deakins most of all for his superb work behind the camera). Everything in it is sparse which makes every sight and sound all the more powerful. Some scenes make you slow your breathing so you don't miss a thing and draw you to the edge of your seat. The film echoes itself and broadens its message. It takes the brutality and wrongdoing out of the western wilderness and into the shining cities. It shows the corrupted and the uncorrupted. It shows the end of innocence and after the fall. It is brilliantly balanced and brilliantly constructed. There is not a false step anywhere. There isn't a dud performance or a pointless moment. It is an astonishing neo-western thriller.<br/><br/>The ending of the film is pure poetry. It may be too abrupt for some, but think on it awhile. It adds mortality to this tale of morality and fate and it completes the films thoughts nicely. After the songs to human goodness in ""Fargo"" and, to a lesser extent, ""The Big Lebowski"" it is almost shocking that this film seems to say that humanity isn't going to hell but is already there. But that's not quite the whole story. In the middle of the savagery and inhumanity, there is still good with the bad. There is no shadow without the sun. It is the perfect ending to a film which is brilliant, gripping and absolutely satisfying. This is not just a must see. This is a masterwork."
"Ibuk","9","1","3","10 July 2008"," Simply amazing
","After hearing many people rave about this movie I finally got a chance to see what the hype was about when I brought it on DVD. It would be fair to say I was not disappointed. Adapted from a Cormac McCarthy novel it tells the story of a man who stumbles upon a large amount of cash and how it starts off a chain of violence. Javier Bardem was outstanding as the uncompromising Anton Chigurh and Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones provided great support. The movie moves at quite a stately pace but that works in its favour. There are many moments that disturb me, for instance in the last scene where Anton Chigurh kills Josh Brolin's wife just because he promised him he will kill her. I am not familiar with Coen Brothers work but I will definitely check out their work after seeing NCFOM. NCFOM is one of the best movies of last year and is worthy of it's hype."

","Even though I'm only 16 years old, I've seen hundreds if not thousands of movies in my life and pay very careful attention to every one that I watch. I'm what you can call a young critic and I'm very particular about the movies that I give a 10/10 to. But for this one, however, I didn't even have to think one minute before giving it a 10. <br/><br/>""No Country for Old Men"" is filled with such great acting, cinematography, music and of course it was directed by two of the greatest directors of our time. The characters in the film are nothing short of unforgettable (especially Javier Bardem's bone-chilling criminal) and it would not surprise me if this became an American masterpiece even years from now. <br/><br/>The ending of the film was somewhat controversial amongst audiences but I found it to be appropriate for body of the film. Even though the ending could have been different, it takes nothing away from the brilliance of the rest of the movie. I don't expect to see another film like this one again and no movie has had me more mesmerized than this one. Go see it! You will not be disappointed."

","The pace, tone, imagery and character of this film are nothing shy of perfect. Though I had a pair of objections over scenes that must have either been left on the cutting room floor or abbreviated during the screen writing process, I had to think that this was nearly the best film of its genre I had ever seen. I saw that coming, having read the novel and been a life-long fan of Coen Bro.s films, but I didn't exactly expect the spot-on performance turned in by Josh Brolin as Llewelyn Moss (a role that was turned down by the late Heath Ledger, and perhaps it was providence that landed him the Joker role upon which he was too busy working). Without that performance this film would not have been the beautifully-worked masterpiece it is.<br/><br/>The story's central theme, given away by its title, was also developed very well. The sense that Ed Tom Bell is at once a brilliant officer of law-enforcement and an impotent has-been comes through without being damaged by over-acting or over-thinking of the script. And enough has been said about Javier Bardem that there's no need for further comment.<br/><br/>In short, No Country is the pinnacle achievement of this cinematic style."

I was hooked in the first couple of minutes and stayed that way until the credits rolled, and two seconds before the credits rolled I thought, ""It should end right here."" And it did. And behind me a young lady said she wanted her money back, and lot's of reviewers had the same experience. This is a movie you either get, or you just don't. And if you don't, you should read the novel. But you probably won't.

","Something about this movie makes me want to call it perfect, the characters, the cinematography, the tension. The opening scenes set a beautiful canvas on which to draw out the rest of the movie, the hunting, the searching, the finding and the killing. What a perfect adversary for Anton in Llewelyn Moss. And how wonderfully his girlfriend says ""Llewelyn"", you've got to see it just for that. The wild west is eerily evoked in the modern day with the same characters as always; the goody, the baddie and the sheriff. The blood and guts are pretty gruesome but you can always avert your eyes for that, I did. The end is thankfully a little less than you are pining for, which is exactly what the movie needed."

","In the vast blankness of rural Texas, Llewellyn Moss discovers a case of money among a strewn of dead bodies. Having decided that he will take the money he places his life in more danger than he initially anticipated.<br/><br/>No Country for Old Men is a quiet film. There is not that much dialogue or score to sway emotions, and one is left to contemplate the actions of the characters on screen. It is in fact a more sombre and aspirational piece of film making, which does not 'dress-up' scenes for excitement and instead crafts nail-biting suspense and tension. There are some truly vivid scenes, and this film should be watched for its showcase of adrenaline churning moments of tension.<br/><br/>Although No Country for Old Men succeeds to a certain extent in achieving its cinematic aspirations, it is unfortunately flawed by a lack of substance and structure. Although the cinematography, lighting and prose of Ed Tom Bell suggest there is more underneath the surface I would argue that there is little depth. The film also does not convey the purpose of certain characters, who they are, what they do, and events unfold with little explanation.<br/><br/>The characters are what make No Country for Old Men enjoyable. In particular the supporting cast of Carson Wells (played wonderfully by Woody Harrelson) and Carla Jean Moss (the excellent Kelly McDonald)are fun and interesting to watch. Javier Bardem is the obvious stand-out performer as the psychopathic killer who follows his own peculiar 'rules' of engagement.<br/><br/>No Country for Old Men is expertly executed in the art of suspense and tension and has a haunting quality, which is aided by a memorable cast of characters. However, No Country for Old Men has its flaws, and this makes it less memorable than is probably should have been."

We don't just get a bunch of baddies doing bad things. We see them doing things that say a lot more for their respective characters than mere, ""you're good, and you're bad.""

Seldom but occasionally there is something to be found in the middle isle of my film shopping supermarket. And this is one of those. The plot is poor and flawed (on purpose??) and could have been written by anyone and the script is tedious as far as I am concerned. It is however saved by great acting performances especially by Tommy Lee Jones. He plays this role to as near as perfection as you will see in any film this year. The man is a walking acting legend. There are however major flaws in the plot and script which made me scratch my head and think about whether this was a realistic piece or whether it should be seen as sci fi. Some of the things that happen could not lead to empty streets and no one reacting. There is another major flaw about characters finding each other but if I go into this I would be spoiling parts of the film so I won't. Anyway as I said this is merely a personal opinion.

"DeeNine-2","9","1","3","17 May 2008"," Lean, mean adaptation of the Cormac McCarthy novel
","The way the last quarter of so of this movie was cut makes me wonder, who did the cutting and what was the rush? We see Llewelyn dead but we don't see him die. We can presume the money went to Mexican drug dealers but we don't see that happen. Or--because Chigurh gives the kid a hundred dollar bill for his shirt--maybe HE got the money. Whether Carla Jean (Kelly Macdonald) is still alive as Chigurh walks out the door is unclear—intentionally unclear since the psychopathic fatalist gave her a coin flip. However she wouldn't let Chigurh avoid responsibility for her death by calling the coin flip. What's a madman to do? We never find out. Or—since we see Chigurh checking the bottoms of his boots for something (blood?) as he leaves her place—maybe he did kill her.<br/><br/>I wasn't keeping count but Chigurh wantonly killed somewhere around a dozen people, mostly just because he could. I think this kind of character--a psychopath with a code (you harm, insult or even inconvenience me and you die)--plays well in this age of violence in which we live.<br/><br/>Don't misunderstand me. This is a riveting flick, as one would expect from Ethan Coen and Joel Coen. The acting, especially by Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin is superlative. Bardem, with the thick pageboy hairdo and the big malevolent eyes and the no nonsense conversational style, is particularly good. Brolin becomes the country and cocky Llewelyn Moss very well. He is much more likable in the movie than in the book.<br/><br/>One thing that the movie cleared up for me was the business with the money in the air conditioning shaft at the motel. Llewelyn puts it there in the first place to hide it. When he comes back to the motel he sees that the drapes are a bit parted and he knows somebody's in there waiting for him. So he rents the room on the other side and manages to pull the suitcase out. The Mexicans who were waiting for him didn't have the tracking device (transponder) so they didn't know the money was nearby. Chigurh knows of course, but by the time he is through shooting the Mexicans, Llewelyn is gone.<br/><br/>A problem in the very beginning of the movie comes up when Llewelyn acknowledges that he is about to do something incredibly foolish. He goes back to the bloody scene in the scrub desert to bring the dying Mexican some water. The fact that he says it's foolish doesn't excuse it as a plot device. The guy was just about dead when Llewelyn left him many hours earlier. Coming back now with water isn't going to save him. Furthermore, Llewelyn was originally indifferent to his thirst. There must have been some water or something to drink somewhere in all the vehicles on the scene, but Llewelyn doesn't bother looking. It's curious that Llewelyn didn't realize that bringing the man who had been bleeding for many hours some water wasn't really going to help. If he wanted to help he could have dialed 911.<br/><br/>By the way, this device, which has the effect of giving Llewelyn a ""fatal flaw"" in the Greek dramatic sense, was also in Cormac McCarthy's novel. If Llewelyn doesn't return to the scene, the story would play out a bit differently, to say the least. Since Chigurh has the transponder he would locate the money and possibly take Llewelyn by surprise.<br/><br/>What are the chances that Carson Wells (Woody Harrison) is able to go to the exact spot where Llewelyn threw the money over the fence and into bushes? Close to zero, I would say. I suspect that the Coens were going to do something with this unlikely plot event but as it turns out, they didn't. In fact, there is a lot they didn't do or show, so much so, I just think they got overwhelmed with all the footage they had and the time constraints and just sliced it up near the end.<br/><br/>Now, why this is called ""No Country for Old Men""? Cormac McCarthy took his cue from the poem ""Sailing to Byzantium"" by William Butler Yeats. Here is the opening stanza.<br/><br/>That is no country for old men. The young<br/><br/>in one another's arms, birds in the trees<br/><br/>--Those dying generations--at their song,<br/><br/>The salmon-falls, the mackerel-crowded seas,<br/><br/>Fish, flesh, or fowl, commend all summer long<br/><br/>Whatever is begotten, born, and dies.<br/><br/>Caught in that sensual music all neglect<br/><br/>Monuments of unageing intellect.<br/><br/>The theme of Yeats' poem is the impermanence of this world, and so he set sail ""To the holy city of Byzantium"" where things are made of more permanent stuff such ""as Grecian goldsmiths make"" and where things are eternal like ideas.<br/><br/>One of McCarthy's points is that the bloody violence of the border towns of West Texas about which he writes resembles more ""the mackerel-crowded seas"" than the holy city of Byzantium, and the ""sensual music"" is the sound of bullet hitting bone from those dying generations at their song. Additionally, the old men in the story, Ed Tom Bell (played very effectively by Tommy Lee Jones), Roscoe Giddens (Rodger Boyce), and Ellis (Barry Corbin), feel estranged from the lust of the young after money and drugs.<br/><br/>The premise of the movie centers around a dope drop in the semi-desert gone bad that Llewelyn Moss stumbles onto some time after the shooting has stopped. Moss is wondering, where's the money? He follows the bloody trail of someone carrying something heavy and finds him and it. It's a carrying case with $2-million in hundred dollar bills.<br/><br/>Needless to say that kind of cash attracts a lot of flies.<br/><br/>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

"iwshepherd","10","1","3","16 May 2008"," No one sees the biblical references to King Solomon
","No one understands this movie. This movie adapts two very well written books of the Holy Bible by King Solomon, namely Proverbs and Ecclesiastes, to a very well written book by Cormac McCarthy. The movie is cryptic but not to the ""wise."" <br/><br/>King Solomon rebuilt the Temple in Jerusalem. What city was the gas station proprietor from? What town name was on the back of Llewelyn's jacket that he bought from the teenager at the border? At what motel did Moss stay in Del Rio? <br/><br/>The dreams are discernible. <br/><br/>""Who is like the wise one? And who is there knowing the interpretation of a thing?"" - Ec. 8:1<br/><br/>THE FIRST DREAM: Bell says that he met his father in town somewhere. He said that his dad was going to give him some money. Bell says he thinks he lost it. INTERPRETATION: Ecclesiastes 7:12 ""For wisdom is for protection the same as money is for protection."" Ed Tom Bell's father gave him wisdom but Ed Tom lost it. Remember the opening monologue about the old timers?<br/><br/>THE SECOND DREAM: Bell says that the second dream was that of his dad and himself on horseback going through a dark, cold, snowy mountain pass. Bell says his father, carrying a horn with fire in it, went ahead of him into the darkness. He says his dad was going to make a fire somewhere in that dark and in that cold. Bell says whenever he got there his dad would be there. INTERPRETATION: Ecclesiastes 2:14 ""As regards anyone wise, his eyes are in his head; but the stupid one is walking in sheer darkness. And I have come to know, I too, that there is one eventuality that eventuates them all."" (see also Ec. 6:9) His dad, despite being wise(""sees"" by the light), goes ""ahead""(dies). Ed Tom is left ""walking in the darkness"" - he becomes unwise as the first dream tells. Ed Tom does not understand the world anymore. He will eventually meet up with his wise father. They have the same eventuality - death. But not yet for Ed Tom who awakes from his sleep. <br/><br/>Ecclesiastes 5:13 is the premise for a character like Chigurh: ""There exists a grave calamity that I have seen under the sun: riches being kept for their grand owner to his calamity."" Chigurh provides the ""grave calamity."" <br/><br/>The film follows these two quotes from King Solomon: 1) TIME AND Unforeseen CIRCUMSTANCE BEFALL THEM ALL (Ec. 9:11) 2) FOR EVERYTHING THERE IS AN APPPOINTED TIME:...A TIME TO DIE...A TIME TO KILL AND A TIME TO HEAL(Ec 3:1-8)<br/><br/>Ed Tom Bell doesn't carry a gun, just like the wise ol'timers: ""Wisdom is better than implements for fighting."" Ec 9:18<br/><br/>Ecclesiastes 9:11 ""...the swift do not have the race, nor the mighty ones the battle, nor do the wise also have the food, nor do the understanding ones have the riches, nor do even those having knowledge have the favor; because time and unforeseen occurrence befall them all.""(See also Ec. 8:7,8) <br/><br/>Solomon wrote: ""'...Everything is vanity!...there is nothing new under the sun...time and unforeseen occurrence befall them all.'"" - Ec 1:2,9;9:11. Likewise Ellis says to Bell: ""Whatcha got ain't nothing new. This country is hard on people, you can't stop what's coming, it ain't all waiting on you. That's vanity."" (Those lines by Ellis are what tipped me off to the Biblical themes)<br/><br/>Ecclesiastes 3:19 states: ""For there is an eventuality as respects the sons of mankind and an eventuality as respects the beast, and they have but one eventuality. As the one dies, so the other dies; and they all have but one spirit, so that there is no superiority of the man over the beast."" Chigurh ambivalently kills some of his human victims with a pneumatic device used to slaughter livestock. Ed Tom Bell alludes to that scripture in a story about a fictitious rancher named Charly Walser. <br/><br/>This is the basis for the woman offering Llewelyn beer by the pool. Proverbs 7:10-13,18-23 reads ""And look! there was a woman to meet him, with the garment of a prostitute and cunning of heart. She is boisterous and stubborn. In her house her feet do not keep residing. Now she is outdoors, now she in the public squares, and near every corner she lies in wait. And she has grabbed hold of him and given him a kiss. She has put on a bold face, and she begins to say to him: '...Do come, let us drink our fill of love until the morning; do let us enjoy each other with love expressions. For the husband is not in his house; he has gone traveling on a way of some distance. A bag of money he has taken in his hand...' She has misled him by the abundance of her persuasiveness. By the smoothness of her lips she seduces him. All of a sudden he is going after her, like a bull that comes even to the slaughter, and just as if unfettered for the discipline of a foolish man, until an arrow cleaves upon his liver, just as a bird hastens into the trap, and he has not known that it involves his very soul."" <br/><br/>The El Paso Sheriff and Ed Tom discuss the degradation of society, showing their foolishness. Ecclesiastes 7:10 - ""Do not say: 'Why has it happened that the former days proved to be better than these?' for it is not due to wisdom that you have said this."" <br/><br/>By the end of the movie, Ed Tom Bell isn't sure about the world he lives in. The character begins as a confident old crusty cowboy, but in the end he can't make heads or tails."
"I_Love_Spielberg","10","1","3","14 May 2008"," It makes you think at the end.
","One of the things that I like about the Coen Brothers is their masterful writing ability. This certainly is no exception. The ending really makes you think. I won't give it away of course, but you won't be able to get it out of your mind. Furthermore, this is also, I think, their most violent movie ever. I've never seen anything like this that they've done. Sure, they've had more violent scenes from the past, such as the wood-chipping scene from ""Fargo,"" and some of the violent scenes from (ugh) ""The Ladykillers,"" and the throat-slitting scene from ""The Man Who Wasn't There,"" but there are tons more violent scenes in this.<br/><br/>This movie is also very intense. You can't relax in any scene of this movie without wondering if Javier Bardem is going to kill someone or not, which he does a masterful job of keeping the intensity and the non-redeeming qualities of the character alive. You can even see it in the eyes, which is very hard to do.<br/><br/>So, if you like movies like this, where the violence is non-stop and the ending won't leave you, then this is your type of movie."
"kennyj-4","9","1","3","7 May 2008"," Brilliant!!!
","An excellent and thought provoking movie that is a world unto itself. It doesn't tell a story as much as it reveals the characters to us through the circumstances of the plot. Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem's character) interests me to no end. It seems on the surface that he is just another crazed killer type character that kills because it brings him pleasure. To me this is a misinterpretation of who this character actually is, and a misreading such as this takes a lot out of the film. To me, the Chigurh character is an exercise in absolute adherence to an absolute set of principles. He is a person who, unlike anyone who you will probably ever meet, has drawn for himself a plan of action which he applies without exception to every situation he is thrust into. He places his success in his various endeavors, and survival above all, and does not hesitate to kill anyone who even has the possibility of inconveniencing him in the future. However, it appears to me that he adheres to this harsh course of action not because he believes himself or his cause to be above others, but because the unfaltering nature of his behavior is the only tangible thing he has to hold onto in this world. Although he accepts that he must hold himself up to this high standard of completely unchanging behavior regardless of situation for himself and possibly for others, he seems at the same time to resent this. When he kills, he does so in the most humane way available to him using, when it is an option, a cattle gun used to kill steer painlessly before processing their meat. He also, whenever possible, leaves the fate of people up to their call of a coin-toss, perhaps in his mind putting their lives in the hands of fate, releasing him from his obligation to kill them, or even cleansing him of the guilt of killing them when he does. Additionally, he doesn't kill people if they haven't seen him.<br/><br/>-All in all, this movie was an excellent watch, a real ""must see."" I do caution though that it should be watched with ones thinking cap on, lest some of the significance of this fine cinematic experience be missed."

I've read a lot of comments by people, and talked with a lot of people that have seen it and they either love it or hate it, no in between.<br/><br/>The story is about a hunter (Josh Brolin) that finds a case full of money, and is pursued by one of the best characters I have seen on screen in a long time, a man named Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem). Now that Llewelyn has got into trouble the Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) takes it upon himself to try and track down Llewelyn and get him out of the mess he's in before Anton does. Your very basic but very fun to watch cat and mouse. But more than just the basic plot is intertwined with great somewhat of a narration by Tommy Lee Jones.

","There are probably no film-makers to match the Coen brothers with regard to the crime/thriller genre. From the seminal Blood Simple (1984), on to Miller's Crossing (1990), Barton Fink (1991), thence to the chilling Fargo (1996) and now, finally, what must be viewed as a masterpiece of cinematography, editing and storytelling. They've done quirky comedies and dramas along the way, but, for my money, nobody beats these brothers when it comes to thrillers that are also horrific.<br/><br/>A good story is a prime requirement, of course: score ten-for-ten, straight up. Then the characters: down-to-earth Texans and Mexicans, tough as nails, the good and the horrifically bad. They're all there in a cast that meshes beautifully to produce a relentless pursuit across the flat, almost featureless, quasi-moonscape of the Texas deserts and low-down border towns.<br/><br/>As the fade-in begins, there is the voice-over by Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) as the camera pans across the ochre plains and rocky outcrops, and you might think how appropriate the title is. You're right, but it's more than that, of course, being a metaphor for the times: a society almost ruined by drug-running, incessant murders and killings, and the mindless pursuit of money. This is the over-arching theme with which the Coens ring out the tragedy that unfolds as Sheriff Bell tries to catch up with Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) who's got two million dollars of dirty money that the bad guys are trying to find.<br/><br/>In a few words, here's the basic story: Moss finds two million at the site of a drug gang battle in the Texas desert. He takes the money and runs. Unknown to him, a sociopathic hit man, Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) is hot on his trail to recover the money and kill Moss. At the same time, Sheriff Bell is hot on the trail of Chigurh, who's left a series of dead victims along the highways and byways. So, Moss sends his wife, Carla (Kelly Macdonald), away to El Paso (with her mother) for safety reasons, and so that he can contend with the killer on his trail. And, none of them know that members of the Mexican drug gang are following Carla, hoping she'll eventually lead them to Moss.<br/><br/>Essentially, however, it's a story about the contest between Moss and Chigurh: the former, a Vietnam vet who trained to kill; the latter, one of society's nightmares who simply kills – on a whim, on the toss of a coin, and on principle. Bardem's performance is calmly devastating: never raising his voice, never displaying anger, never showing mercy. And professional to his very core. The most disturbing scene is his encounter, early in the plot, with an old clerk at a country gas station who inadvertently annoys Chigurh with an inane but innocuous question. Watching and hearing that exchange of words reveals everything you don't want to know about Chigurh and his penchant for killing.<br/><br/>So, while the basic story (drug gangs, gun battles, innocent victims, good guy-bad guy) has been done before, many times, it's the character driven nature of this story that makes it into a riveting thriller, helped along by the Coen brothers' expertise with camera, script, editing and sound. On that last point, this film is noteworthy with the almost complete absence of a musical score, an aspect that heightened the suspense – because, as the viewer, you're able to hear more easily the far-off sound of ominous steps in a corridor, characters breathing, the snick of a gun being cocked, and so on.<br/><br/>Most stories in film and literature end unambiguously. However, the final scenes between Bell, Ellis (Barry Corbin), the old-time deputy, and Bell's wife, Loretta (Tess Harper) seem to be completely at odds with the main narrative, to the extent that some viewers have been annoyed/infuriated with the apparent lack of closure, according to some reports I've seen. I'll say this much: from one perspective, there's a nod to the ending of Point Blank (1967); from another perspective, one must remember that stories are constructed and, therefore, are open to interpretation by the viewer. I have an interpretation that brings full closure for me. It's up to you to develop yours.<br/><br/>Thoroughly recommended, but for adults only. Has gruesome, bloody violence and a killer (Chigurh) with the kinkiest weapon yet put to film."

","First Time I Saw this film I thought it was very good and deserving of every accolade it was getting. The second time i watched this film I realized how much of a masterpiece it is. No Country For Old Men Has the feeling of suspense like Hitchcock's best films combined with the signature Cormac McCarthy feel of a western and the Coens sense of wierdom. Javier Bardem is great as antoine sigur, proving he is one of the best actors alive and I can't wait too see Biutiful. This is the Coens most serious film besides Blood Simple. They have a great body of work though so it is hard too say. And there work is so varied so most people I know have a different favorite film of their's then the other. I personally love Barton Fink, my therapist loves Blood Simple, my sister loves Fargo, my drama teacher loves Raising Arizona, but No Country For Old Men is probably their best film to date because of how great Bardem is in it. He is like Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs or Mitchium in Night of the Hunter or Cape Fear."
"legendaryunderdog","4","1","3","28 April 2008"," An example of what movies have become.........
","The Coen Brothers know how to shoot a movie, they are Masters at the Art. Fargo is one of the greatest movies I have seen but 'No Country For Old Men' has still got me wondering: ""Why all the hype?"". Drug Deal Gone Bad, guy (Brolin) checks out the scene, comes back to give an already dead guy water and by doing so....gets himself into what we call ""Hot"" water. Having never been impressed with people in real life who think they have the answer or the prophetic language to verbally submit someone to fear, I really didn't care for the role of the Hit-man named ""Chiguhr"" (I believe thats how you spell it). Sure that is the design of a great movie when it grabs your emotions as such, but I just didn't care for his scenes, too bland, trying to sound too 'prophetic', which actually to me sounded too 'pathetic'. Tommy Lee Jones is the only reason I rate this film at all, his role was amazing, he really mastered the southern tongue very well, his insightfulness was great and comical too (which seemed odd for this kind of movie, but thats the Coen Borothers at work folks!) The ending also messed with my head pretty bad, I wanted to break the DVD in half! Anytime I ever watched a flick about someone killing people, the killer usually gets killed him or herself by the 'hero'. In no way did I find this movie gratifying (maybe I'am not supposed to?) I really don't get why everyone raves this movie as so wonderful, Academy awards? Jeesh! I like to see the killers get killed, not get into a car accident, break their arm and walk away. Yeah maybe the car accident was karma for all of his wrongdoings, but my problem is the fact that he isn't dead. I'm sorry 'No Country For Old Men' lovers, but this movie really let me down, I guess in this day in age of crappy movies, I shouldn't be so surprised.........."
"kos-27","6","1","3","28 April 2008"," missed masterpiece
","The movie could have been a true masterpiece but instead it came out only solid - leaving some viewers not quite satisfied because of its promising first half. The killing of the main character happened too easily and too unnoticed, not clear what actually happened. Since the film was built up to follow the leading character, there should have been a more dramatic showdown. The sequence when the sheriff goes back to the scene of the crime was directed to seem important but the result left me guessing. At the end it wasn't quite clear who had the money, one could only assume it was Chigurh. After the shooting of the main character the film lost (or changed) its rhythm. I don't agree with some of the viewers that the very ending of the movie was bad; it was the whole last third of the movie that seemed to have changed its style. The end itself didn't disturb me. I had to read the book (which, by the way, is fabulous) to make up my mind what to think of the movie. A lot of people wrote that the movie was a very accurate adaption of the book. I don't agree. Maybe the atmosphere and the actors (which are great) are well transformed into a movie. But the film leaves out passages that are essential for better understanding: In the book the leaving out of the killing of the protagonist is better motivated and the scene where the sheriff goes back to the hotel is explained and resolved. We get to know more about Chigurh who is clearly not a real person but a symbol, a Punisher for the Greedy America. The sheriff (the main character of the book) and his monologues lead us through the book. In the movie they seem either too short (in the beginning) or too long(in the end) -there is not a good balance between the action and the philosophical scenes. It's a pity that the message of the story couldn't be fully understood because of the uneven pace of the movie and the badly cut storyline.<br/><br/>I can understand people who say it's a great movie- they don't have the heart to rate it worse because they feel it had the potential and should have been a great one. Maybe the Director's Cut will prove them right.<br/><br/>Rating: 6"
"powersx2","5","1","3","27 April 2008"," Parts are great, but on the whole overrated
","I liked the movie a lot for at least the first hour. However, truth be told, I was braced by everyone I had spoken to about the ""awful non-ending."" So at least I was ready for a lot of disappointment at the end and that was good, because the disappointment aspect certainly didn't disappoint.<br/><br/>Some observations on the whole: the Llewelyn character is the best in the movie and is killed off so unceremoniously that the movie loses a lot right there. In a weird way, it reminded me of ""Psycho,"" how so much time is spent developing one character and that character winds up being very secondary. Next: the whole Javier Bardem academy award thing is eluding me. To me, this role wasn't even challenging. How is it hard to play a robotic serial killer who delivers every line with the exact same cadence? When I see all the hype this guy got, it makes me wish I got into acting. Nice job mind you, but not a difficult role.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with this movie though is the long string of superfluous characters. Woody Harrelson's character is completely and utterly useless. I'm not sure why that character even existed in this. The Tommy Lee Jones character is deep at some levels, but besides making one phone call to Llewelyn's wife and walking into the one hotel room, he doesn't pursue our villain at all. In fact, he doesn't do much of anything save serve as philosopher-Du-jour (in a hick sort of way) to the audience. I just don't get it --- he in the end, seemed equally useless.<br/><br/>Normally I like movies with odd endings, I really do (I even wrote a novel as such). I enjoyed Lost Highway, Mulholland Drive, and heck, I even LIKED the way the Sopranos ended --- but this just lost me. Not confused me, but lost me. In the end it all seemed very pointless and if that's the only point the movie makes, all I can hang on to are the positives of some good suspense scenes and some stellar acting by Brolin. Watch it once, and file it under ""overrated."""
"Vastian","4","1","3","27 April 2008"," Ultimately unsatisfying
","No Country For Old Men has a very cool antagonist, I can't stress that enough, the bad guy is awesome. Apart from that I found the entire cinematic experience to be drawn out, largely uninteresting, and entirely forgettable. The movie suffers from what I call ""Master and Commander Syndrome"", a term meaning that the pacing is largely unsuitable for the supposed tempo of the film story.<br/><br/>I am well aware that short reviews such as this generally leave themselves open to ridicule such as ""you just didn't get it"" or ""did you even bother to watch the entire movie"". The answer to both is 'yes, I did', and I found myself bored and in the need to watch an episode of Studio 60 just so that I could go to bed knowing that the entire evening wasn't wasted."

","With all the hype surrounding this movie, I was expecting something much better. In general, the movie was well made, the acting was strong and the cinematography was excellent. What ruined the movie for me were several things (spoiler alert):<br/><br/>There were far too many coincidences and/or unlikely (if not impossible) events. While the transmitter is an explanation (though even that's a stretch) as to how Chigurh could have found Moss at the motel, how did the Mexicans know he was there? How did Carson Wells find Moss in Mexico and how would Chigurh know both of them were there since the transmitter was gone by then? Wells finding the money was another huge stretch. I could go on with several more example but others have pointed them out. Suspending disbelief is one thing but this was just sloppy.<br/><br/>I have no problems with movies with endings that leave parts of the plot unresolved or don't tie things together neatly. What I didn't like about this ending was the sheriff babbling on about some dream he had. What a weak and boring way to end a film! Half way through his scene I was making a mental note to myself not to bore anyone ever again by describing my dreams to them. I had never realized before how boring it is to listen to someone go on and on about some dream, especially when its implied that the dream has some profound meaning.<br/><br/>There are far too many flaws in this movie - it's way overrated."

Then Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) a Vietnam veteran who accidentally finds two million dollars near a car wreck in the desert. Llewelyn stays with the money not being able to calculate the deadly consequencesÂ… Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) a serial killer, psychopath who is in search for the money.<br/><br/>The film presents us non realistic dialogs, lots of gaps in the plot, random and unexplained relationships which lead to the loss of focus on the main subject(for example the relationship between Carson Wells and Anton Chigurh, couldn't find in it any point at all). The characters are hard to relate to, therefore hard to appreciate, even though all the actors gave extraordinary performances (Javier Bardem does give a sincere portrait of a psychopath). Sadly for me it wasn't enough with the good performances, I never could fully grasp the point of the film. At the end it's like the viewer is playing connect the dots, and all of the dots don't form any shape at all, it's an inconclusive ending that leaves too much to the viewer's imagination.<br/><br/>All of these reasons lead me to conclude that its sense of greatness is overrated."
"ShootingShark","6","1","3","9 March 2008"," Stylish And Arresting Drug Payola Crime Thriller From Master Filmmakers
","In West Texas in 1980, Llewelyn Moss comes into possession of a case full of money after he happens on a drug deal gone bad. He goes on the lam, but is soon being pursued by both the County Sheriff and a dangerous killer named Chigurh. Can he make it ?<br/><br/>This is the Coens' Big Ticket - it recently won Best Picture, Best Directors, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor Oscars - and it's one of their better films after the rather lightweight Intolerable Cruelty and The Ladykillers, although it's still not a patch on their early quintet of masterpieces. What I like best about it are the heart-pumping action sequences and especially its stalwart refusal to play the action conventionally. We never see the standard shootout where Moss dies, but come across it after it's happened, and we're never entirely sure about Chigurh's actions. He's a peerless psycho in the tradition of Michael Myers in Halloween or John Ryder in The Hitcher - he seems to be able to be almost everywhere at once, following a logical method only he can appreciate. It's nail-biting stuff, but it's also a little confusing at times; what is Chigurh's connection to the Mexican drug-runners exactly, and why is he not there when the Sheriff returns to the motel room and we see a shot of him crouched inside ? Another original touch is that Jones is essentially unrelated to the story - he is constantly assessing the aftermath of the action and bemoaning the direction of society, but he doesn't really affect the plot. A Texas lawman who would rather not carry a gun and fears a coming age of psychopathic killers and druglords is nothing if not original. The cast are all strong, with plaudits to Brolin as the sharp cowboy who can't believe he's missed a trick and Spanish actor Bardem as the contemplative, slow-moving killer. The photography of the beautifully lonely New Mexico desert locations is wonderful, and, as ever, Carter Burwell provides a haunting minimal score. This movie has echoes of others, notably the Coens' own debut, Blood Simple (another shoot-'em-up in Texas) and their friend Sam Raimi's A Simple Plan (another guy-finds-a-pile-of-money thriller) and deliberately feels like some early eighties flick (The Border, say) but has plenty of authenticity and wit of its own. A great duck-you-sucker crime thriller, based on a novel by Cormac McCarthy."
"RResende","Null","1","3","4 March 2008"," the children who got out of the sandbox
","This film is a great experiment in many levels, it is one of the best uses of widescreen i've seen in recent productions. The photography is enviable, and i call attention to all the scenes taking place at the slaughter location. Day, night, down up, up down, all the situations and angles are tried, they all mean different things in different moments of the narration. It's really good work. But there are questions to be reckoned, i think.<br/><br/>I'm convinced that most of the enjoyment one can take out of a film (or other creative work) is a matter of personal decision. Basically you have two choices: get superficial, or think/feel. The vast majority of the average cinema crowds work in the first case which basically translates into ""did i like the story"", ""did i like the performances"" (on the basic level of convincing/artificial), and the prettiness of the images. For that kind of crowd, this film will work perfectly, because it is built with already seen situations/plots/characters. None of this is unusual, drug dealers, money, sheriffs, and the border with Mexico, Oh and the psychopat. With this lines, i'm not taking myself out of that average crowd. I work my ways in trying to understand what might be behind what i've seen. In this case, i don't believe the Coens would simply go with the flow, and make what would be expected from other competent directors. But indeed, apparently they do... i suspect it was on purpose.<br/><br/>I like to check for self-reference in films, or metaphors to the real world machinery of things. I tried to make my one interpretation of the world i watched in this film and establish a possible relation that may have some logic, or none at all. It is important to say that i didn't read the book, nor am acquainted to McCormack's writing, but i think the influence of it may be felt in the narrative structure, of episodes which are parallel which from time to time intersect and connect (the Coens don't often work this way). Anyway, i decided to watch this: we have a film starting in the aftermath of a slaughter. Several bodies, dispute over drug in a border territory, and a use amount of money. This is staged for us, it is the section in the film where we are more forced to really see the set and be placed there. We have someone who is totally clueless about anything that has occurred, and fate/fortune takes him to find the money. And we have him being hunted for that. Check the hunter. Everybody thinks he is crazy, that ""you (he) don't have to do this"". But he never gives in a little bit. He has his own moral, he creates his rules, and he even gives fate a chance, when he uses a coin to decide on life or death. All and all he just seeks exactly the same as everybody else, the 'macguffin' (money), but somehow we know he has other motivations, though we really can't tell what. This was made by two brothers, who are proud of being the ones who play in sandbox of the corner of Hollywood, make their games and don't get annoyed by those who are ""just"" after the money. But hey, they also play the big game, they also produce in the context of the Moss and the Wells, and they are under the jurisdiction of the Bell. They are not independent in the bankrupt European vision, they are not even low cost filmmakers. They are stars, and the mediatic success of this film made them even more like stars. So I think i watched a game. The Coens putting crowds, investors, producers watching themselves running and fearing the Coens, and laughing. Undercovered irony. But i'll add a catch to this possible game. The film filled many pockets, it is watched, and its success may turn it into some kind of a paradigm, of a style to be chased, copied, and recognizable. So who won the game? <br/><br/>And by the way, i think this is one the most ""conventional"" Coens films ever, conventional in relation to the Coens films as much as in relation to conventional films.<br/><br/>My opinion: 4/5, it's playful to watch Joel and Ethan, but i think they've done better. But this is a good film<br/><br/>http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com"
"crazyhaole","Null","1","3","27 February 2008"," a few observations
","SPOILER ALERT<br/><br/>Sometimes a film based on a great novel stands on its own. In this case, if the moviegoer hasn't read ""No Country...,"" I can see how he or she could be a bit mystified at the events of the film and their sequencing. (The novel itself required me to turn the pages back several times to get reoriented). As well, there are some symbolisms that become more apparent if the viewer has read beforehand. For example, one would know that Moss was a sniper in Vietnam which makes his wince at his failure to cleanly kill the antelope a little more meaningful. He's about 30 now, perhaps beginning to think he's losin' it, over-the-hill, etc. with that crummy shot. That he risks big time in stealing from organized criminals would be just a little more understandable with such weighing in his mind.<br/><br/>One scene I would love to see done differently: The final shootout where Moss meets his demise. The novel was clear that Lleylin pretty much sacrificed himself in an attempt to save the young woman's life, a final display of the values he doesn't let go of. Wish this could'be been worked in.<br/><br/>Possible ""goof"": When Lleylin first spots the massacre in the desert, the scene appears at least a quarter-mile from the top of the bluff he is on. Later, when he returns with the water, the same bluff only seems a couple of hundred yards away."

","This movie really did a good job scaring me in a way I haven't been for a very long time. I had no idea how it was going to develop (which doesn't happen very often these days!) and several times during the movie I noticed I was holding my breath. On principle I don't give a movie top rating after the first review so I am going to give it 9/10 - and maybe I will change this when I have seen it again.<br/><br/>It's a story we have seen so many times before; a guy stumbles over some drug money and decides to keep them - knowing that there is a big risk involved. Our ""lucky"" guy is an Vietnam veteran(Llewelyn Moss) who, during a hunting trip, stumbles over a very obvious shoot-out scene. A lot of automatic weapons and a lot of dead bodies. Our guy figures that there must have been ""a last man standing"" and uses his hunting skills to track him down. He is in the meantime dead but has the money that our guy probably knew he would have as he had seen the drugs lying on a truck. From here on the movie turns into a chase between Moss and an assassin/serial killer. I know that this probably doesn't sound altogether innovative but the script and direction makes the difference.<br/><br/>Tommy Lee opens the movie with a narrative where he describes the changes in time seen from the law enforcers point of view. A couple of generations ago they didn't have to wear a gun but now.!<br/><br/>There was something about our protagonists that made me shutter; the title is so true ""this is no country for old men"". Its only a country for the ruthless and cynical.<br/><br/>I have rarely seen a better casting. Moss is so believable as the war veteran living in a camper. His opponent - Anton Chigurh - epitomizes evil. I came to think of ""the iceman"" every time he appeared. So sinister and determined. One of the things that is so great is, that you don't know who will prevail. Chigurh is so lethal but on the other hand Moss knows how to handle himself very well. He is resourceful and have a background as a veteran and a hunter to make him a formidable opponent.<br/><br/>This movie doesn't leave you very optimistic and with a faith in your fellow man but it tells you a thrilling story of two very determined men who wont yield. Go see this movie - also to support a production who dares to venture into new territory with the risks this implies. It would have been so much easier just to follow the sort of premade scripts that exists for these kind of movies but, as we know, the Coen brothers have artistic aspirations that makes their movies such a thrill to watch.

","No country for old men currently has a very high rating. personally, I don't understand why so many people could give this film a 10/10. This movie has its effective moments, but they are simply not where they are supposed to be. I can tell you that at some moments, I felt what Llewelyn, but not when i should have. Chigurh is (as another put it) Death personified... this guy is terrifying, to say the least. he's the kinda guy that if he walks into your gas station, you want to close down so he can get the hell out of there without killing you first.<br/><br/>the problem with this movie is that it begins with a bore from tommy lee Jones, and ends with a bore from tommy lee Jones. however, we'll talk about the ending later.<br/><br/>the story line summed up is that a man named Chigurh is after a man named Llewelyn because Llewelyn found two million dollars a dead Mexican tried running away with as a drug deal went terribly bad. Llewelyn takes the money after leaving a Mexican completely on the brink of death to die in his truck. This is where the movie gets dumb. later that night, he decides to bring the (garenteed) dead Mexican about 2 gallons of water. and hey look at that! he's dead. shocker.<br/><br/>So Chigurh runs around killing people with a compressed air gun used to kill cattle jumping from car to car, killing dozens of people without so much of a peep from cops... with the exception of tommy lee who lugs his old wrinkly ass around whining about it.<br/><br/>Enter Woody. they introduce this character, as he makes NO sense. he apparently is also, another hit-man looking for the money. now, he is in about four scenes within the movie. one he's talking to some guy in an office. two he's talking to Llewelyn in a hospital bed. Three, he FINDS THE TWO MILLION DOLLARS AND LEAVES IT THERE. and four chigurh kills him randomly (big surprise) So how do you feel about spending an hour and a half watching Llewelyn for an hour and a half attempting to triumph over Chigurh and then, within about twelve seconds, you (the cameraman, and tommy lee) show up after a gun fight took place and you see Llewenlyn dead. never get to see how he died. Chigurh hides in that room as a paramedics and police run through a freaking hotel room clearing bodies, but no one seems to notice the nine foot seven guy with a silenced shotgun in his hand. Let's be serious, a toddler could've found Chigurh in there.<br/><br/>Chigurh then goes to Llewelyns wife and asks her to flip a coin to whether she lives or dies. she says no i refuse to, only you have the ability to choose, you don't have to do this. then he rants about ""you don't have to do this"" then it shows him on the front porch. did she die? probably, who knows.<br/><br/>He then drives down the street, and then gets in a really loud car crash. there is no meaning or purpose for this crash. the only reason why it was put in was a five minute warning (or wake up call) for all those that feel asleep to this boring, good for nothing movie. he walks away and tada! no one finds the nine foot seven guy all cut up and bleeding. what an expert hit-man huh? Then tommy lee sits down at a table and talks about his dreams. and then it ends. and then everyone throws their hands up in the air saying ""WHAT THE ****!?"" and then you ultimately leave your seat feeling robbed of your money, your time, and some brain cells.<br/><br/>This movie sucks. like i said, it has its effective moments where you feel for Llewelyn, but ultimately, you are left disappointed"

Javier Bardem is amazing as a cold blooded person. His face never even twitch a bit when he kills random people. However, the plot is a little hard to follow. There are many loose ends that are not explained. I am also a bit annoyed by the surrealistic ease of everyone finding everyone."

","This review may contain spoilers.<br/><br/>I saw this film the other day and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. This is a really solid film that keeps you interested throughout. Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones are superb. Next time I watch it I will try to pay more attention to Tommy Lee Jones though as he tends to go off on tangents during the movie. Great style, use of the musical score, and the element of suspense. I do have one issue with the film which is why I gave it 7/10 as opposed to 9/10. I was disappointed with the last half hour. The viewer becomes so immersed in the main character and following his story, only to be cheated in the end in my opinion. I won't go in to details as to ruin the film, but I must say that I was pretty upset about this. Aside from that, the film was awesome in my opinion. 7/10."
"BJBatimdb","8","1","3","25 January 2008"," Good but not vintage Coens
","But good Coen brothers is still a damned good night out at the movies, right? No Country for Old Men falls somewhere between Blood Simple and Fargo, with the gritty gore of the first and the dark humour of the second. But somehow the gore's too casual to be really interesting or shocking, and the humour's not quite sharp enough to make this a funny film to match Fargo.<br/><br/>It IS good. But I think the huge score here on IMDb really reflects the sheer relief of seeing the Coens back in the swing of what they do best post-Ladykillers.<br/><br/>NCFOM is deceptively simple, giving the characters room to develop and breathe in that unique Coen way. However, apart from the fantastic sheriff played by Tommy Lee Jones, none of them are quite up to scratch.<br/><br/>The killer is menacing, sure, but is SO relentless that I felt some of the threat dissipate, rather than increase. His indestructibility leaches some hard reality from the film.<br/><br/>Most of the parts are played wonderfully, with mostly no-name actors acquitting themselves well in possession of a very good script. The exception is the usually reliable Woody Harrelson, whose part here is two-dimensional, and who fails to convince in any context.<br/><br/>Personally I felt the absence of a smart plot turn. The Coens always offer up the unexpected, but here those twists are mostly about the characters, rather than the story. From a duo who built their early career on clever convolutions, this feels just a bit lazy.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a workmanlike, rather than inspired, effort from the Coens. But it still kicks most other movies' butts."
"Felix-28","7","1","3","22 January 2008"," Well made, but why?
","There's no doubting the skill with which this film was made, and if its intention is to send jolts through the audience at frequent intervals, it achieves it with ease.<br/><br/>However I question whether it's really as good as it's cracked up to be. There seem to me to be two fairly fundamental weaknesses.<br/><br/>The first is structural. The first half or two thirds of the film are a battle between two men: the likable, basically honest, self-reliant working class good guy, Josh Brolin, and the psychopathic, brutally efficient, almost superhuman bad guy, Javier Bardem. At this stage Tommy Lee Jones appears to be the character who is going to fix everything up in the end: the bad guy will die, the good guy will live, the wicked drug lords will be cleaned up and put away by Tommy Lee, and somehow the good guy will get to keep the money (or most of it). Everything is progressing very satisfactorily along this path until suddenly the good guy disappears from the equation, and it doesn't seem to be by the psychopathic bad guy, but instead by some of the wicked drug gang, who have hitherto done nothing except kill each other at the beginning and then disappear entirely from the film.<br/><br/>From then on the film doesn't really seem to know where to go. <br/><br/>Woody Harrelson in the meantime has very memorably appeared, making it seems as if there were going to be some kind of variation on the theme with him as an equally tough but slightly less lunatic and much more likable executioner battling it out with Javier Bardem; but Woody really doesn't get to do anything except sweat in a chair after he gets very easily taken by Javier. So much for the battle.<br/><br/>After Josh Brolin's exit, what does Tommy Lee Jones do? He retires. This is the cue for a series of scenes memorable in themselves, but leading absolutely nowhere. There's Tommy Lee's meeting with the old man in the wheelchair; there's the confrontation between Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin's wife; there's the motor accident complete with gory medical self- treatment by Javier Bardem; there's Tommy Lee's recounting of his dreams to his wife. Somewhere in the mix is the fat sheriff who bewails to Tommy Lee Jones the loss of moral standards in modern civilization; he's so fat and such a redneck that it's hard to know whether he's intended to be serious or comic relief.<br/><br/>So frankly, it's all a bit of a mess. It's not a satisfactory hunter vs prey film, which is what it appears to be for the majority of the playing time. With the kind of central flaws that this film has, there's hardly any point in mentioning more minor things, like the way there's always a convenient car passing when Josh Brolin needs a ride in a hurry, but two men can have a full-scale shootout in the middle of town, including the standard shooting at the truck cabin bit, without attracting anybody's attention, or the way a man can stand on a fence covered in blood and throw a case full of money over a fence also without attracting attention, or how the case can lie there for days, clearly visible from the street, without being discovered. If the basic plot were better structured, those sorts of things would be minor quibbles, but as it is, they really just serve as a kind of accompaniment or side-dish to the major flaws.<br/><br/>My second major problem is with the philosophy of the film. Its staging, right from the outset, tells us that while we are watching an action film, it's going to be a film with a point. Then, when we get to the end, particularly with the discussion between Tommy Lee and the old man, and the redneck sheriff, and Tommy Lee's dream, not to mention the coin-tossing scenes and Javier Bardem's utterly random car crash, it looks as if some great big point is being made. But what is that point? That society is in decay? That violent death is random and unavoidable? That we may as well give up the fight against evil because it's a hopeless cause? That we shouldn't give up that fight? That Javier Bardem is an indestructible angel of death?<br/><br/>God only knows. I certainly don't.<br/><br/>So those are the problems I have with the film. There's also a reason why I positively dislike it. Insofar as there's a philosophical or moral point being made by the film, it appears to involve some condemnation of the violence and lawlessness that seem to be overtaking society. In other words, the film seems to be saying that mindless, psychopathic killing is something to be condemned. However at the same time, the body count in this film is absolutely astronomical, and at least a dozen of the killings are shown in close, explicit detail. To be blunt, the Coens wallow in the gore. I don't mind a good old blood-fest, and I don't even mind it if it's accompanied by a bit of moralising about how bad all the violence is; with that sort of film, we know that the moralising is just for show, and we judge the film purely as a blood-fest. But I do mind it when film-makers as intelligent and skillful as the Coens, with the backing of truckloads of Hollywood mainstream money, make a big deal out of the philosophising and act as if they truly mean it, while all the time they are exploiting the gore-fest for all it is worth."

","It's a really good movie in many ways, but there are a couple of big problems that nag at me... keeps me from putting it way up there. For one, a huge amount of hype about how ""evil"" the main badguy is. yeah, he's an evil dude... but nothing out of the ordinary. As a matter of fact, his goofy haircut nearly ruined the whole menacing effect for me... it was so distracting I could barely get it out of my mind throughout his scenes. But a very solid performance by everybody... I enjoyed a lot of it. Especially the husband wife scenes... they were refreshing with the level of respect and understanding they had for each other, despite their odd imperfections. They obviously loved each other a lot, I'd say.<br/><br/>But again... main bad guy... coulda been scarier and more menacing. I'm sorry. That sticks out as the main problem with this film. I was so ready for the gas attendant to shoot him dead and end his magical hard to kill reign, it wasn't even funny. And for some reason I could totally picture it happening. I don't think the audience was ever supposed to feel like the little guys had a chance... but they totally did! Super bad guy was too careless in many situations, imo.<br/><br/>Anyway, good movie... very different. Bad guy not bad enough (close, but...). And the death of a major character was extremely under-developed. And the ending was at first shaky, but I think the dream recounting made up for it."

","In Cormac McCarthy the Coen Brothers have evidently found a literary equivalent to their own world view, so close is No Country for Old Men to the stories they've been telling for so many years. Sheriff Bell's near-despair at the cruel carryings-on in the world he's attempting to police is an echo of Marge Gunderson's astonishment in Fargo, as she tries to make sense of the actions of the psychopath she's just arrested. In Fargo, Marge goes home to normal Norm, and some semblance of equilibrium is restored: not so in McCarthy's universe, which is a bleaker place. <br/><br/>Everything about this film is top-notch. There are one or two moments in the narrative which fuel the conversation for the audience's journey home (how come Chigurh got arrested at the top of the film, and for what? how did he know Moss was heading for Mexico?) but really, these things are not important in the long run. The photography and the acting are terrific; the script - with, so I understand, significant chunks lifted seamlessly from the novel - is as dazzling as we've come to expect from the Coens. If I don't rate it quite as high as Fargo, I guess it's because, while I probably share the broad, bleak outlook of No Country for Old Men, I guess I must like a little bit of hope smuggled into representations of our brutal world. But that's just me. This is an excellent film, no doubt about it."
"ryanpenniston","8","1","3","21 January 2008"," Cohen brothers restore a little of my faith in modern cinema
","No Country for Old Men:<br/><br/>Been a Cohen brothers film I had very high expectations when I went to the cinema, and to be honest I haven't yet made up my mind. <br/><br/>The startof the film is superb, a mixture action, verging on gore, but always holding itself within the story rather than becoming just about the action itself. The casting of Javier Bardem was outstanding, his presence in every scene had you waiting for him too explode into another violent rage. But his character was filled with polar opposites, he would give people that seemingly had nothing to live for a chance of life while taking the lives of others that would seemingly have benefited more from his leniency. Tommy Lee Jones delivers a wonderful performance as the archetypal Texan cop who has seen it all and done most of it, whilst not been surprised or shocked and having an anecdote for every situation. If I have one quarm about the film it would be the under development of many of the main characters, Tommy for one but more importantly Woody Harrelson. I think this was the result of the fast paced switch between stories and focus on action at times rather than dialogue. The film built itself towards what looked like a climatic ending with the Hero and Villain on seemingly inseparable paths, but to most peoples surprise the ending was abrupt to say the least. Jones's speech to his wife/mistress at the end seemed to convey the inevitability of his own existence. I was sure that the film was leading towards a Falling Down ending with Jones and Bardem having a face-off, yet while this didn't happen I was still content when I left the theatre. My faith in the Cohen brothers has been restored after what can only be described as a two hour waste of my life in Intolerable Cruelty."
"poc-1","7","1","3","21 January 2008"," Understanding this movie without spoilers
","A lot of people dislike this movie when they see it first. I confess to being a bit shocked by it myself and left the theatre feeling a bit bleak. <br/><br/>However, this is precisely what is intended by the writer. <br/><br/>Anyone who has not read the book will be surprised and probably confused by certain events in the film. It is not that it is ambiguous per se, but it does not follow the conventional thriller/pursuit movie narrative, even if it appears to at first. If you are confused or a bit disappointed after viewing this movie, you are not an idiot or Philistine. It is a great movie, but there are problems with transferring it from book to screen, despite it being very faithful to the text. Firstly, the dialogue is one of the best things about the movie and unlike in a book where you can re-read a paragraph if you missed something, in a movie theatre once it is gone, you can't rewind. The opening and closing monologues are the most important parts to pay attention to and again, because it is a movie, you may not see the closing monologue coming or you may not be paying enough attention to it when it comes. <br/><br/>Again dialogue is more important in a book than a movie, where everything is highly visual. A movie like this can suck you in with its violence and suspense, so you start to ignore the dialogue, or at least let it wash over you. <br/><br/>That said here is a guide to understanding this movie to those who have not yet seen it. <br/><br/>Sheriff Bell is the principle character and he is only one given dialogue or monologue of more than a couple of sentences at a time. He is near to retirement and reflects on his life as a law officer at a time when crime has become so bad he describes it as a ""war"". In the opening dialogue, Sheriff Bell says ""Somewhere out there, there is a true and living prophet of destruction and I don't want to confront him. I know he's real. I have seen his work."" This is important, remember this. So you know it is coming, there is a closing monologue about his dreams, which you can find in the quotes section of this title. <br/><br/>Llewellyn Moss is a hunter who stumbles on a drug deal gone wrong in the desert and makes off with $2M he finds on a dead drug dealer. <br/><br/>Anton Chigurh is a killer hired to track down and recover the money. <br/><br/>The rest of the action is concerned with this pursuit and its consequences. <br/><br/>After this I will say no more about the plot, except that to say that if you are expecting Llewellyn Moss's great adventure, or a grand showdown between the good guy and the bad guy you will be sorely disappointed. This film is bleak and uncompromising. There may be a buried message of hope but it is communicated by allegory and allegory is not something we are used to seeing on screen. Like all great movies, it gets better with a second viewing."

","No Country For Old Men (2007)<br/><br/>Number 2 - 2007 <br/><br/>Rated R for strong graphic violence and some language <br/><br/>""What's the most you ever lost in a coin toss?"" Anton Chigurh <br/><br/>As the opening shots of the film examined the desolate, empty deserts of Texas over Tommy Lee Jones' restrained narration about how times are changing and the world is becoming increasingly violent, I was hooked. The film met every expectation.<br/><br/>Based on Cormac McCarthy's 2005 novel, this film is about a hunter who stumbles across a drug deal gone sour and finds a bag with two million dollars in it. Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) would have never touched that money if he knew what was coming. Claiming $2,000,000 from a drug scene never proved to be an easy task. Moss and his wife, who live in a trailer park must first escape the hands of the relentless, remorseless, emotionless hired hit-man Anton Chigurh who will do absolutely anything to get the money...<br/><br/>Anton Chigurh is terrifying, haunting; he walks around with a cattlegun killing anyone or anything that gets in his way. The person who is responsible for creating an unforgettable character is Javier Bardem. It would be a travesty if this man doesn't win the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.<br/><br/>On the other side we have Academy Award Winner Tommy Lee Jones as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell, a man whose family has been involved with the law for generations; Ed Tom does not like the new times, he thinks the world is too violent, too characterless. From the character and thoughts of Ed Tom you will get a great idea why the film is called 'No Country For Old Men'. Needless to say, Tommy Lee Jones consumes his role with his usual casual, sarcastic undertones that were responsible for his Oscar in 'Fugitive'.<br/><br/>This is a Coen Brothers film. From that I knew this would not be an ordinary film; their previous works, some of which are masterworks give you an idea of their style. The Coens direction is brilliant - we are shown horrors, landscapes, characters, times, thoughts with such focus and efficiency, probably the best directed film this year. And of course the screenplay, which is an excellent one manages to squeeze in some comedy at some unbearably tense moments in the film. The achievements in the film are not to go by without accolades.<br/><br/>No Country For Old Men, is a film about fate, evil and choice. How a world changes but some things really remain the same. As you watch those characters for 2 well worth hours of your life, you will think, question and admire the cinematic mastery that has gone in this film. This is no ordinary achievement, it is quite simply a masterpiece of modern cinema and of the best films of the decade. Unmissable <br/><br/>10/10"
"blanbrn","10","1","3","19 January 2008"," Well done. Exciting and entertaining crime drama epic from the Coen brothers that's intelligent and interesting.
","""No Country for Old Men"" is without a doubt one of the better films I've seen in a long time. It's well mixed with suspense, drama, action, and intrigue the entire time to keep the viewer on the edge. Yet many may feel like me and feel displeased at the ending, but the Coen brothers wanted everyone to form their own call and to think about the right closure. The scenes are well done too and the acting is super especially from veterans Brolin and Jones.<br/><br/>Set across the state of Texas mostly in rural sites and crossing over to some metro areas the film is a joyride from the start. Beginning with hunter Llewelyn Moss(Josh Brolin)who makes a gruesome discovery of dead bodies and also a stash of cash like two million from an apparent drug deal gone wrong near Rio Grande and the Mexican and American border. From then on the action and journey begins when ruthless and cold stoned looking criminal thug Anton Chigurh(Javier Bardem who plays the part brilliant)goes hot on the trail of the missing cash all across the state from car chases to even a hotel shootout. Many of the scenes are memorable like that of Anton's flipping of the coin to decide the life and fate of the store clerk by heads or tails! The Coen brothers use the cat and mouse theme so well between these two central characters so well it makes the film even more enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>Yet at a half point of the film it feels a little odd when Woody Harrelson enters as bounty hunter Carson Wells which in my opinion was a wild card character that the Coen brothers used but why who knows. The leader and weight of the film is carried by the Tommy Lee Jones character that of veteran and old timer type burned out Texas sheriff Bell. The film opens with narration and closes with narration from the Bell character. And as always watching and hearing Tommy Lee is special, as his character feels out of touch as time and life has passed him up in which many can relate and feel for when they watch.<br/><br/>Overall ""No Country for Old Men"" is highly enjoyable and entertaining to watch and intelligently done from the Coen brothers. In my opinion I didn't really like the ending, but many films leave the viewer to form their own take and make the call for themselves adding more suspense and intrigue to the enjoyment. Still the strong performances from Jones, Bardem and Brolin along with the films action and suspenseful journey of drama make it a clear winner and instant classic."

Its a story of a hunter called llewlyn who finds a group of trucks, corpses, heroin and a big stash of money. He takes the money and is then pursued by a mass murderer called Anton whose equipped with a deadly oxygen pump! Also involved is the sheriff trying to help llewelyn and his wife from being caught and killed by Anton.<br/><br/>This is a very continuous film which is at points very tense. The satchel that Llewlyn has the money in has a detector in it so that Anton would be able to locate it at anytime. This fact leads to a very tense sequence in which Llewlyn finds the detector and moments later hears footsteps outside his motel room which is Anton, there to kill him and take the money.<br/><br/>In theory, the story is very simple. A man being pursued for a load of money by a psychopath. But this is made original with the fantastic script and perfect direction by the Coen Brothers. My personal favourite scene was when Anton speaks to a shopkeeper in a small Texas shop. Its a conversation where Anton eerily explores the shopkeepers personal life and tries to play a game of luck with him by flipping a coin and asking him to call heads or tails. Anton says its for everything. The shopkeeper picks the right side but it was obvious that he was playing for his life and therefore it shows an early showing of how evil Anton is and that he is capable of anything. Fantastic Scripting and Characterisation! The film also manages to leave unanswered questions such as whether Anton actually killed Llewlyn's wife and what was Anton being arrested for in the beginning and furthermore, what is the significance of the car crash?. These are all questions that can only be answered by the audience by linking with the theme of the film.<br/><br/>Although the film is mostly dialogue, it still manages to entertain and keep audiences on the edge of their seat.<br/><br/>This will without doubt be in the top 5 films this year and is most probably one of my top 10 favourite films...unmissable film 10/10"
"stwfan19-1","9","1","3","18 January 2008"," Plenty of Country Left For These Men
","Since their arrival in cinemas in 1984 with Blood Simple, Joel and Ethan Coen have continued to make films about bad people doing bad things to, generally, other bad people. Since the arrival of the Oscar winning Fargo in 1996, however, the Coen Brothers have strayed from their bloody, dramatic roots in favor of comedies. While the films ranged from incredible (The Big Lebowski, O Brother, Where Art Thou?) to embarrassing (The Ladykillers), the Coen Brother's have returned to their roots in full force with No Country for Old Men. While the film follows a multitude of characters, the film focuses on close-lipped Texan named Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) who stumbles upon a multitude of dead bodies and $2 million dollars. The money is not without owner, and Moss starts getting tracked by a sociopathic demon named Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem). Armed with a silenced shotgun and a pressurized cattle gun, Chigurh hunts down Moss looking for his treasure and taking down anyone in his way.<br/><br/>Also on the hunt for Moss is Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), who discovers Moss' abandoned truck at the crime scene, and a former Lieutenant Colonel named Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson) who, because of an ambiguous past relationship with Chigurh, is hired to find the money as well.<br/><br/>In his performance as the stoic, murderess Chigurh, Bardem, who was nominated for an Oscar for his performance in Before Night Falls, is truly stunning and although he is surrounded by a terrific supporting cast, he is truly the star. His baritone voice makes both the speakers in the theater and the audience quake, and his sadistic intelligence puts him ten steps in front of every other character. Coming out of Cormac McCarthy's novel of the same name, the Coen Brothers' only comparable character is that of filthy bounty hunter Leonard Smalls from Raising Arizona, but Chigurh makes Smalls look like a sad puppy with a broken leg.<br/><br/>Another element to the film's credit is the scenery and setting that is explored throughout the film. Immediately opening to shots of the Texas desert, cinematographer Roger Deakins employs the border-towns into every outdoor shot. The desert and dust gives the film a light sepia tone and calmness that is only broken by splatters of blood and chaos.<br/><br/>The film is able to be successful in its storytelling because of its ability to stay so attached to its source material. In their first attempt at working from a published work, it is obvious that the brothers wanted to be sure to keep the integrity and veracity of the original piece. Events in the film are transcribed with care and conciseness not seen since The Maltese Falcon. Although the story is strictly dramatic, the Coen's are able to carefully able to place lines of dialogue that are either naturally funny, or so scary that you can't help but laugh from being nervous. While the tension is palpable, the audience cannot help but let out nervous chuckles when Chigurh is using a coin toss to determine a man's fate.<br/><br/>The special makeup effects, done by Brian Hillard, also takes a special place in this movie, as more bullets are put into people than food. Gushing bullet woods full of specially imported fake-blood look disturbingly real and makes the audience question what the directors are putting their actors through. In conjunction, the wardrobe and hair, including Bardem's strange doo, prevent the audience from viewing the people on screen as actors but simply cowboys from 27 years ago.<br/><br/>Jones, once again playing a cop as he did alongside Charlize Theron in Paul Haggis' In The Valley of Elah which came out earlier this year, stamps in a great performance as close-to-retiring sheriff who is slowly realizing the force of the competition that he is up against in finding Moss and noticing how these types of people were uncommon in the coming world. Jones sells the audience in his portrayal of Sheriff Bell and his performance is better than any other leading actor thus far this year, only Josh Brolin giving any competition.<br/><br/>As a Coen Brother's film, No Country for Old Men represents a resurgence and a return to the fierce blood and guts roots that their established so strongly from the mid-1980s to the late 1990s. As a standalone film, however, No Country is nothing short of an artistic achievement that everyone involved can use as a source of pride."
"katrowellpa","9","1","3","18 January 2008"," Slow Burn
","It may be hard to remember the title of this movie, but impossible to forget it. It is one of those slow-paced movies that stays with you for a long time--kind of like a chili pepper that has no effect at first, but comes on slow and strong until it burns your mouth. Go see it with someone else so that you have someone to talk to about it--you will need to process the film for at least a couple of days afterwards.<br/><br/>I am a huge fan of the Coen brothers and was not at all disappointed with this film. What is interesting about it is the fact that there is virtually no music at all--it is a very quiet movie in between dialogue and quite frankly, from about 3/4's of the way in, I started getting confused about some plot points, but it doesn't matter because the film is so great you can forgive the confusion towards the end. Here is one question I have--who ended up with the money? I have a friend who read the book and gave me the answer from the book, but I certainly couldn't figure it out from the movie.<br/><br/>I read one reviewer who stated that this was Javier Bardem's best performance ever. I don't agree--he was much better in the ""Sea Inside"", but his performance was very good and he is one of the best actors that exists today. I was more impressed with Josh Brolin's performance--he was the lead character for over half of the movie and did a really good job. Tommy Lee Jones was also very strong throughout. The success of the entire film really falls on the back of these 3 main male characters, so their strong performances really come through. Woody Harrelson also held his own.<br/><br/>As stated in other reviews, the pace of this movie is quite slow, but very methodical. It is not as funny as ""Fargo"", although it is just as dark and does have some comedic moments in it, in the line of dark comedy or ""black comedy"".<br/><br/>If you like the Coen brothers, you will like this movie. If you have never seen a Coen brothers film, this would not be a bad place to start. Not many great female characters in this one, but I guess I will forgive that too."
"mistarkus","8","1","3","16 January 2008"," Moody, Dark and Grim
","Coen Brothers created a moody film with a very grim, dark theme that will haunt its viewers who fully capture the meaning. The eerily grim mood is sustained from the dead desolate landscapes, minimal dialogue, sinister characters and a far from Hollywood ending that sustains and enhances the mood and resonates after the viewing.<br/><br/>The theme is that of the inevitability and randomness of death which is metaphorically represented by Javier's character that is more grim reaper than human, he stops at nothing and frighteningly appears out of no where. He is big, brooding, socially odd, cold, warped, eerily calm and apathetic yet confident in his power and his fear. His abnormal peculiarities become apparent as he interacts with people, the weapon of choice and his hair style. His interactions allow us to somewhat get into his warped yet interesting brain and to somewhat learn his philosophy behind his motivations.<br/><br/>Containing a Hitchcockian style suspense for our times is where this movie shines. The suspense is due to the hauntingly menacing character and the modern, masterfully executed suspense scenes that were reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock.<br/><br/>Extremely careful attention must be paid to Tommy Lee Jones' character since he expresses the ideas of the movie and challenges the audience to understand his mumbling southern drawl or dialect. .<br/><br/>The story is about someone finding some money and a psychopathic killer that wants to get the money back killing some people that get in his way. And that is it. There are holes in this meager plot and it is unclear what exactly is going on at certain points. Also, belief has to be suspended as to how these people always find each other in random locations. But the movie is not so much about the story as it is about the mood and the theme. You will either ill-fatedly cross death's path (metaphorically represented by Javier's character) and die, or you will eventually die anyway from growing old. Â– Bleak."
"PosyPods","8","1","3","14 January 2008"," Great movie!
","I just have a short comment for this movie. First of all, I really did enjoy it. It wasn't at all what I was expecting, but sometimes that can be a good thing. Although technically I felt this movie was outstanding, there were a few things I disliked. Personally, I enjoy a lot of dialogue (and perferably well written) in my movies, and this film obviously lacked that. However, it made sense for this particular movie, so I can deal with it. The one thing that just killed it for me though was when Woody Harelson appeared on screen. All I could see was, ""White Men Can't Jump"", and that severely affected my perception of the rest of the film. Of course, I realize it's not fair to judge his character on the actor's past parts, but I can't completely control my mind! That being said, I still loved this movie."
"EUyeshima","8","1","3","13 January 2008"," Heart-stopping Chase Drama Inhabited by Lived-In Characters and a Plot Focused on Accountability
","The unpredictable storytelling route at the heart of this intensely driven and thickly plotted 2007 film is what makes the ride a fascinating, often involving one. I had never read the acclaimed 2005 novel by author Cormac McCarthy, the basis of the film, but it's obvious that the story ambiguities, philosophizing tone and eccentric side characters were key draws for the idiosyncratic Coen brothers, Ethan and Joel, who again wrote and directed together as a team. Immediately familiar are the dark sensibilities that make an arid-looking West Texas a most unlikely place for a noir-type thriller, but the Coens' rich sense of character and place are certainly evident. At the same time, the relentless chase in the movie is so dominant that there is little time for them to showcase the quirky sense of humor that makes 1996's ""Fargo"" a modern classic. There are a few refreshingly amusing moments here and there, especially those involving the sheriff, but I have to admit that the lurid, heart-stopping scenes are what sear in my memory.<br/><br/>Set around 1980 (a point that isn't that clear until there is mention of Vietnam) near the Mexican border, Llewelyn Moss is out hunting in the sagebrush and comes upon the bloody aftermath of a failed drug deal. In the back of a pickup truck are a sizable payload of heroin and two million dollars. He makes off with the money, but through an act of unexpected and belated conscience, he becomes a man on the run by a number of different parties. Chief among them is Anton Chigurh, an unconscionable hit-man who escapes local police custody and closes in on Moss with unfettered conviction and unnerving calm. Surrounding both men is soon-to-retire Sheriff Ed Tom Bell, whose county is where the initial crime scene occurs. The characters' fates collide as the plot twists and turns, but the focus becomes less on the storyline and more on how they bring on their own dire situations through their own machinations. Given how the Coens end the movie (which apparently mirrors McCarthy's book) and some holes in the plot, the movie gains its emotional resonance as a tale of self-accountability.<br/><br/>The performances of the three leads are excellent. Sporting a hideous mop-top haircut, the versatile Javier Bardem manages to play Chigurh as the heartless killer he is by emphasizing the warped sense of honor that makes his acts reasonable to him. His manner is so discomforting that I was conflicted as to whether I should cringe vulnerably or avert my eyes entirely every time Chigurh shows up on the screen. Cast perfectly to type as the laconic Bell, Tommy Lee Jones is an assuring presence despite the drug-trading malevolence engulfing his territory, a development that makes his character realize that he has become a man out of his time (thus the movie's title). Usually a journeyman actor (with a famous wife, Diane Lane, and an even more famous mother-in-law), Josh Brolin conveys the precarious balance between opportunistic and decent with minimum fuss. As his worried wife Clara Jean, Kelly MacDonald has just a few effective scenes, and her final one attains a becalming power. The only fly in the ointment is Woody Harrelson, just too familiar a presence to be entirely convincing as a talkative bounty hunter who would be a compelling match for Chigurh. Of special note is Roger Deakins' masterful cinematography, which perfectly captures the rural setting."
"ad_upclose","8","1","3","5 January 2008"," A brilliant dark thriller!
","A great movie which works despite having a simplistic script. The acting is top notch all round, particularly Bardem's, who pulls off the best villain I've seen since Hannibal Lector. His expressions are chilling and dialogue delivery is fantastic (best actor award coming up?). <br/><br/>The film is gripping and has good dialogs. One of my favorite scenes in the movie is the motel one when Brolin discovers how he is being followed. It was intense and showed the quality of the directors. However, I wanted more from the ending of this film, but then again the director was merely following the book I suppose. But I feel it was not conclusive and satisfying enough, especially compared to the rest of the movie. <br/><br/>All in all this is the best Coen brothers' movie, one that could take the cake come Oscar time."
"jake-179","4","1","3","5 January 2008"," Good action movie with a terrible ending
","I will skip the plot synopsis, since I figure you already know what this movie is about if you are reading my review. I want to speak directly about the ending. So if you haven't seen the movie, don't read on because there will be spoilers. *****SPOILER ALERT******<br/><br/>I was really enjoying this movie right up until the ending. The movie centered on the conflict between two great characters: a seriously ruthless, relentless bad guy and a very likable ""everyman"", who was a clever underdog played by Josh Brolin. It was really great watching Brolin's underdog clashing with the terrifying hit-man, and the whole time you are rooting for Brolin to win because you like him so much and you hate the villain so bad. <br/><br/>Then, a little more than half way through the movie, the two characters become set to face off against each other. I was thinking, ""Wow, this is going to be awesome. We are going to see one hell of a showdown."" The two characters who have been chasing each other through the whole movie finally have a voice to voice phone conversation and they promise to kill each other. <br/><br/>But what you expect to happen is actually the opposite of what happens in the movie. The good guy does not win and ride off into the sunset with the girl. Instead, the bad guy wins and kills EVERYBODY! And he gets away with it! At the very end, Tommy Lee Jones gives some kind of rambling monologue about a dream he had regarding his father. I am sure it was meant to have some kind of a summary importance to the movie, but it seemed pretty vague to me. If anything, I got the feeling that the movie was trying to send a message, and I believe that ""movie messages"" should be implied, not imposed. <br/><br/>Bottom line, I don't like bad guys winning! I hate having a good guy character that I identify with get killed by a bad guy that I hate. That is a flaw that I cannot forgive in this movie. <br/><br/>I rated this movie a 4. I would have rated it lower but I really liked the action and the characters in the first part. They had a lot of tense moments and a lot of good gun fights. That was definitely worth seeing. But the ending absolutely ruined it for me. I know other IMDb users are going to say that the Coen brothers were trying to be unconventional, artistic, and they were trying to stay true to the book of the same name, etc. But I don't care about that. I care about GOOD MOVIES! And I am disappointed that this movie took such dumb turn at the end. <br/><br/>It could have been and SHOULD have been much better."

","I went to see this movie with my girlfriend because I love the Coens' previous tongue-in-cheek humor and engaging plots like Fargo and O Brother Where Art Thou?, and the Texas neo-noir of Blood Simple. I came into the movie expecting something like a mix of the three, but instead was treated to a masterpiece. Tommy Lee Jones plays the role he was born to play, Javier Bardem is utterly fascinating in his role, and everyone else is so incredibly human. The plot is perfectly paced and played out, so that no scene bears down on any other, they each stand as important moments. My girlfriend, who loves raunchy comedies and horror movies, and myself, a classic movie buff and crime movie fan, both left the theater speechless, thinking this movie was one of the greatest movies we'd ever seen."
"shortloc24","10","1","3","3 January 2008"," Superb!!! This Years Best Picture
","If last year was any indication of things to come, then I expect that this years Oscars will follow in the same footsteps. ""No Country For Old Men"" is an instant classic, a masterpiece in all forms of film-making. From the cinematography, to the sound, to the excellent acting, to the screenplay, The Coens have a unique style of directing, and are worthy of a spot among some of the best. In my opinion, even though Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin gave performances of a lifetime, I believe Tommy Lee Jones walks away with the glory. I hope his performance wont be overshadowed by the crazy characteristics of Anton Chigurh. Many people now a days, only look for pure entertainment. Although, this film is a gripping tale that keeps you glowed to your chair and contains plenty of action and violence, the one thing people in our days don't take into consideration is those scenes with important monologues. This film starts out with one of the best monologues I've seen in a film. Also another important scene in the film where Tommy Lee Jones' character visits a friend or family of his, not really sure, and discuss his retirement, this particular scene made me fall in love with this movie, the way it was directed, edited, scripted, and acted. To me this scene is the most important in the movie and I hope it goes recognized. I hope the Academy doesn't overlook this film because of its grittiness and tough to watch violence. I hope this film doesn't follow in the steps of other great crime tales as Pulp Fiction, Goodfellas, and Fargo to name a few. My Best Picture, and rooting for the Coens all the way. Lets bring that Oscar where it belongs"
"grinna","9","1","3","2 January 2008"," When this story ended, I started thinking I had missed a scene.
","The action and drama is fantastic, credible and non-stop.<br/><br/>The story ends......and you are partly blown away, partly convinced, but not left satisfied with what totally has unfolded, you are still left wondering, reviewing the pieces, what happened to this, how did, who did.... to a large degree you could make up your own ending to this movie....the director is playing tricks I think, he indirectly asks you to finish this movie's story - anyway you feel, or the way various pieces of evidence have been adjudicated by you (as his viewer) I have a complete different theory about this 'correct' ending, to any other I that I have read here: don't read this if you haven't yet seen the movie....SPOILER.....<br/><br/>I think there was a conspiracy between the Sheriff and Chigurh; just think about the little pieces of evidence...Sheriff Bell is told by Carla Jean that she is meeting Moss in El Paso; (my idea is that Bell tells Chigurh) later, after the Mexicans kill Moss, Chiguru shows up to get the money out of the vent, Sheriff Bell is sitting on the bed; he knows that the crime scene flat has been entered by Chiguru,he's come there to meet and share the loot. <br/><br/>Sheriff Bell retires almost straight away....then goes to visit his Old Uncle(ex-cop) Ellis, who poignantly tells Bell......"" we have to continue with our lives no matter how evil life gets."" (I took this as a code between the two, he was telling him to get on with his life and forget the deception (evil) he had done).<br/><br/>Chiguru, despite having the (best part) of 2 million, (obviously) executes Carla Jean...and why? Because she is the one who told Sheriff Bell to meet her and Moss in El Paso; Bell was the one she told, and this could have then provided evidence of a police leak, that is, that Bell had told Chiguru to get to El Paso quickly. Just my opinion."
"freaky_dave","9","1","3","1 January 2008"," A wonderful film with a weak ten minutes or so near the end
","I enjoyed this movie. I thought it was one of the best films of this year. Hands down I would give it the same grade I gave The Departed last year. It would've been a 10 and therefore better than The Departed, which I also gave a 9, if the final confrontation involving Josh Brolin's character hadn't felt rushed and sort of anti-climatic. I won't talk about that scene because it would be a spoiler for those who haven't seen it yet, but I can still give a quick synopsis of the story.<br/><br/>A man named Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) is out hunting when he stumbles upon a massacre. We soon discover that the massacre was caused by a drug deal gone wrong. While doing a search he discovers a satchel of money and takes it home. Not long after he is hunted by several different parties who have been hired by the real owner of the money. Their job is to return the money and kill whoever has taken it. One of these men is the ruthless and psychotic Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) who is relentless in his pursuit of Moss and the stolen money.<br/><br/>Most of the story is a cat and mouse game involving the two people above, but there is a third party who is out searching for these two as well and he was not hired by any drug dealer. He is the local sheriff named Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) and you can see by the creases in his face and the sadness in his expression that he has lived a hard existence as a sheriff who has come up against way too much evil in the world. This character is used in a sort of minor role which helps the narration of the story and allows us to understand how much harder life has become in a world filled with corruption, greed, and murder. Some people might have found it a little distracting because of how the plot absorbs you into the two main characters only to pull you away whenever Bell takes center stage, but I found it to be a major addition to the story. Bell may not be the main character, but his role adds structure to the depth of the plot and helps explain why the movie was titled as it was. This is a depressing and sad movie, but that is what it was meant to be.<br/><br/>The acting in the movie is top notch, and the pacing is frantic and moves relentlessly forward just like both Moss and Chigurh. One does everything he can to save his family and protect his self, while the other pursues menacingly and seems completely unstoppable. One thing that bothered me a little about all this is that nobody ever seemed to hear anything while all this violence is going on, but that is only a minor complaint that probably can be explained to the point that people really don't want to get involved anyway. It fits the profile of the storyline so I'll let it go. However something I cannot let go is the final showdown as stated above. I was expecting to see more than what was given, and the film didn't seem to offer a closure. As I left the theater I thought of another movie that I liked that had and ending that offered no closure as well. That would be the fantasy drama/science fiction film Donnie Darko. The scene with the Bell character at the conclusion was fine because it helped to explain what the movie was hinting at all along, but I couldn't accept that last confrontation involving Moss. After all the fantastic build up and great suspense which glued me in my seat for most of the film, I just couldn't accept the final battle as it was. So yes I felt a little cheated, but I will still give this movie very high marks for being creative and making itself feel genuine even though there have been many other movies just like it. I will also add that Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh gives us perhaps one of the greatest villains ever created since Hannibal Lecter from Silence of The Lambs. Also the lack of a music soundtrack is perfect for this movie. Natural sounds are the only thing needed because they make the film seem more realistic. A soundtrack for a film like this would've just been a distraction."
"janetsusan-1","9","1","3","1 January 2008"," No Music- None Needed; Remarkable Coen Brothers Work of Art
","This movie is based on a book written by Cormac McCarthy, one of today's most talented writers. The Coen Brothers took a big chance making a movie from the book of a great author, but the risk paid off. They aced the story to a tee. Every detail was picture-perfect, from the dry, dusty Texas country, to the grizzled sheriff, to the methodical and superstitious killer, to the suddenly rich but hopelessly outmatched regular guy. Every nuance of darkness and light, blood and dust and heat, flies and sweat, was meticulously delivered to the viewer in its raw form. There was plenty of violence, gore, and suspense. There was also the age-old story of good versus evil. Which one do you think won the battle? <br/><br/>Many interesting actors had parts in this movie. All in all, it was well worth the price of admission, since it most definitely needs to be seen on the BIG screen, nice and loud."
"Philby-3","7","1","3","30 December 2007"," The Coen universe is a scary place
","This latest bloody drama from the Coen Brothers has had a mixed reception and my reaction was mixed also. As they have stuck fairly closely to the original book by Cormac McCarthy, the improbabilities and loose ends are not theirs alone. But the way the story is told, with the outcome of some key scenes left up in the air, and the sudden disposal of key characters, is, frankly, playing with the audience. This is not a movie that stands up well to post-screening analysis. On the other hand, assisted by the harshly beautiful US South West, the cinemaphotography is gorgeous. There are three absolutely stand-out performances, plenty of tension, and a moral message. Though it is a drama rather than a comedy there's also the trademark Coen Bros wry humour, though there is a good deal less here than in, say, ""Fargo"".<br/><br/>Early on, I thought I was watching a ""crime procedural"" thriller where the director was focusing on how the hunter/assassin and the criminal/fugitive operated. Will Llewelyn (Josh Brolin), the poor deer shooter who has made off with the dead drug smugglers' $2 million manage to evade Anton (Javier Bardem) the hired assassin with the funny haircut? It becomes apparent that this is unlikely, and the focus shifts to Tommy Lee Jones' character, the aging Sheriff Bell, who is bringing up the rear. Towards the end, the ambiguities, loose ends and implausibilities mount up and the thrust of the story is lost.<br/><br/>Although set in a specific time and place (SW Texas 1980) the story has a timelessness about it. But there is no real hero and the Coen universe seems to have a random quality about it. It's a scary place, and it seems we don't have much say in how things work out. Anton the assassin, the embodiment of evil, is the most determined character in the film. All the Sheriff can do is tag along behind, counting the bodies, though at one point he seems to be close to cracking the case. As for Llewelyn, well, he tries hard, but you can't beat Fate, whether or not it comes with a bad haircut. Not a film for those who like tidy endings."

I intend to watch the film a second time to both enjoy the beautiful west Texas cinematography, top notch acting of Bardem, Jones, and Brolin, as well as concentrate on the implications of the ending. I recommend viewing the film with the mindset that film making in all of its intrinsic tantalizing elements is what's on display here, foremost and prominently."
"sirwootalot","10","3","18","11 November 2007"," The most amazing movie I have ever seen. New all-time favorite
","Almost all praises that I feel like heaping on this have already been said elsewhere - Chigurh's ability to make Hannibal Lecter seem like captain kangaroo, sound design that leaves your heart in your throat, beautifully desolate imagery, and quite possibly the most amazing editing and timing that I have ever seen in a film. However, much contrary to rbert65's review, the movie is an absolutely excellent adaptation of the book. I'd go to say it's the smoothest, most accurate book-to-film adaptation in years (especially with crap like ""Da Vinci Code"" and ""Goblet of Fire"" sucking out our wallets). The very few details that were left out added some to the story, but would have made the movie around 2:30-3:00 with almost the whole last half being much, much slower; it would have killed the (impeccable, marvelous, and gut-wrenching) pacing of the first 90 minutes. To focus on them would be truly extreme nitpicking - the plot, the dialogue, and the sequence of events is 99% lifted DIRECTLY from the source material. The ONLY detail that was changed, at all, was that in the book the woman moss meets up with just before the climax is a teenage runaway that he picks up from the side of the road and warms up to somewhat slowly (with some amazing dialogue in between might I add) - in the movie, she's a buxom drunken strumpet sitting by the hotel swimming pool that has her way with him fairly quickly. In short, were the movie any more faithful than its current 95%, it would have suffered as a film - The Coens REALLY know what they are doing. the editing was absolutely perfect, with not a single dull moment. The extra interludes of the sheriff would have bogged down the movie; they only worked in the book because the task of reading pages is VERY different from that of looking at a screen.<br/><br/>P.S. - drop what you are doing and SEE THIS MOVIE. if you want to read the book first, go ahead; it'll be just as awesome either way."

"lee_eisenberg","9","2","10","16 March 2008"," moral conundrums
","In Spring 2005, I took an ethics class in college. The teacher would begin every class by asking if any of the students could present a moral conundrum. That means a situation that that would seemingly be immoral no matter which way you go.<br/><br/>Well, had anyone in the class seen Joel and Ethan Coen's ""No Country for Old Men"", then the class would have had much to discuss. Granted, I expect from the Coens something as far from sugar-coated as you can get, but not even that can prepare you for what lies in store here.<br/><br/>The movie begins with narration by a man identifying himself as a third-generation lawman. We soon meet Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), a Vietnam Vet. A welder by profession, he seems like your typical trailer trash. But while hunting one day, Moss comes across what appears to be result of a violent incident. He steals from a truck a suitcase containing $2.4 million in cash. But what Moss doesn't know is that another person wants this money. That person is Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a heartless psychopath with a captive bolt pistol as a weapon. Chigurh has already escaped arrest by strangling a sheriff's deputy. Meanwhile, sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is investigating the whole thing, in pursuit of both men.<br/><br/>The focus shifts from person to person, so that we understand every man's motives. Bell will retire soon, and so he wants his final case to come out good. Moss remains the central focus throughout most of the film: we see his conscience eat at him (prompting him to bring water to the Mexican in scene of the shootout), and his subsequent desperation to avoid trouble. And even though Chigurh is a nasty sociopath - Evil Incarnate, if you will - he's merely doing what he can do to stay alive in this perpetually violent world.<br/><br/>Among the other characters are Llewelyn's wife Carla Jean (Kelly Macdonald), who still supports her husband suspicion about his actions; Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson), a bounty hunter hired to look for Chigurh; Ed Tom's wife Loretta (Tess Harper), who does what she can to support him; Ed Tom's uncle ex-cop Ellis (Barry Corbin, who played the general in ""WarGames""); and Carla Jean's mother Agnes (Beth Grant).<br/><br/>I thought that this was a very good movie. I didn't see enough movies last year to determine whether it was the best one, but I would say that it deserved Best Picture. Pulling no punches in what it shows, it also makes the audience question whether or not we can truly know who is ""good"" or ""bad"", as these are all multi-dimensional characters. And regardless of good or bad, the events portrayed are mostly results of happenstance, so it's not really anyone's fault. Equally as good as the acting is the cinematography. Set in the middle of nowhere in Texas, the camera-work shows a landscape bereft of practically anything, just as most of the characters' lives have been (as far as we can tell). <br/><br/>All in all, the Coen Brothers once again are not at all afraid to show what needs to get shown to make a great movie, no matter how unpleasant it is. Definitely one that I recommend. As Javier Bardem said when he accepted his Oscar: ""Esto es para ti, Espana!"""

One who is somewhat good and obviously poor and the other who is this maniac psycho killer. Im not even sure its his money, how he knows about it or why he even wants it. None of that was clarified.<br/><br/>The good guy is running with the money the bad guy is chasing him the sheriff seems like he is supposed to be chasing them but doesn't really want to and would rather be some sort of hillbilly philosopher about the whole thing.<br/><br/>Then the good guy suddenly dies. The bad guy escapes death by the skin of his teeth AGAIN the money disappears and the sheriff retires but not becoming so philosophical that the whole movie just ends right there at his dinner table with him rambling on about some dreams he had.<br/><br/>Again I would love to figure out this movie.<br/><br/>I am a 40 year old movie buff Academy Award trivia expert I own over 700 movies I've been a member here for 6 years And I have a college degree.<br/><br/>Maybe I ate too many milk duds or something but it went right over my head.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a Donnie Darko, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind MUST SEE A SECOND OR THIRD TIME TO FULLY UNDERSTAND kind of movie then go for it!<br/><br/>If you think you are going to see a Titanic, The Green Mile or Silence Of the Lambs kind of movie where the plot unfolds at a normal pace and doesn't make you search for answers and meaning then don't go see this thing.<br/><br/>Again, not a bad movie. Great acting, cinematography, pace.... the works... just incredibly difficult to understand after the first half.<br/><br/>In fact the first half is very good, suspenseful.. second half does not fulfil. Leaves you hanging and wanting more."

","Quite simply, the best film in a decade or more, and the new standard for modern movie making. A simple man-hunt in the hands of the Cohens unfolds beautifully, and searingly on the screen, all while captivating, and jolting the audience. The heroes are flawed, and yet the villainy of the film is complex and perfected, both of which add to the fatality that flows through its entirety. Tommy Lee Jones gives the performance of his life, in a role that the viewer can't help but feel he was born to play, and yet the film is dominated by a truly terrifying Javier Bardem. The acting by Brolin and Bardem gives the dramatic tone of the movie the upper hand over the dead to rights action that really peppers most of the scenes. The Cohens' masterpiece, it is precisely the tragedy that movie goers have been unknowingly pining for, since at least ""American Beauty""."
"somf","8","2","10","18 November 2007"," Rather faithful to the book and therein lies the problem
","I read the book about two years ago to the day, and I was very excited when I heard the Cohen brothers were filming this. It is my favorite McCarthy book until the last third when he hammers and hammers and hammers in the message about as subtly as Chigur's weapon of choice. I gave the film an 8 because Bardem is a sight to behold. Probably the best villain since 1991 when my two favorite villains of all time appeared on screen within months of each other. Lecter and DeNiro's Cape Fear character. The funny thing is I expect Daniel Day Lewis to outdo Bardem this year but I have yet to see ""There Will Be Blood"".<br/><br/>I was anticipating this film more than any other this year, so as a result I have to say I was disappointed. Tommy Lee Jones character of Sheriff Bell was hard to get a grasp on. I have to admit I had the same problem with the book. The Cohen's did not improve on that. At the end of the day, Bell is the star of both the book and the movie, though I question if both the book and the movie may have been better if the character did not even exist. I am not alone in this thinking. A lot of people in the theater I watched the film in were baffled and seemed to have felt cheated by the non-Hollywood ending. On guy yelled at the end, ""I want my 2 hours back."" and someone else chimed in, ""I'll just take my money."" Me, I didn't feel cheated, but I have to admit to slight befuddlement even after having read the fine book. You have been warned. Don't expect too much or a standard ending, and you won't be too disappointed. There is still a lot to like in this film. The Coen's are masters."

","The only, only reason to see this is as a showcase for Bardem's performance. And maybe some of the cinematography and killings.<br/><br/>Bolton does well, but it's meaningless, his character dies OFF SCREEN! Thanks for nothing.<br/><br/>Jones is Sad. A sherfiff who should have retired. He does nothing but talk and put people to sleep with his philosophy. GARBAGE. Starts with his voice over. We see him at a coffee/diner speaking crap about life. We see him speaking to some fat/big hat about nothing. We see him speaking to some dude in a wheelchair with cats, about nothing. He doesn't do his job. He doesn't catch the killer. Doesn't save lives. And the film ends with him retired, bored, has nothing to do, speaking to his wife about dreams he had. Great! Not. Jones is Sad.<br/><br/>The story is nonsense. At first I thought it was about some serial killer, Bardem. This guy kills indiscriminately. Even for fun. Then no. A drug deal gone wrong, everybody is dead except one guy dying asking for water. Bolton, a retired loser, while hunting deer comes across the killing field, steels 2 million dollars of drug money. Goes home, sends his wife to stay with her mother, then like a dumbass goes back to bring water to the dying guy, who is already dead. At this point some other drug dealers chase after him and wounding him. <br/><br/>Ok, still with me? Bardem, the psychopath serial killer also doubles as a hitman for the drug cartel. He's hired to get the money back. He kills his employers. Kills random people for their vehicles, way to be inconspicuous. The Employers then hire Woody to get the money. Where did this idiot come from? Seriously! More than an hour into this mess we see a shot of Woody. Why? <br/><br/>Tons of killing. Woody is killed. Bolton is killed off screen and so is his wife. <br/><br/>Then out of freaking nowhere, Bardem while driving, a car crashes into him. He walks out with his left arm bone sticking out. He bribes a couple of kids on a bike to keep quiet and walks away into the sunset.<br/><br/>Then we see Jones with his wife at the breakfast table speaking of boredom and dreams and just plain sleep inducing nonsense.<br/><br/>As stated earlier the only reason to see this movie is for Bardem's performance. Decent acting and scenes. But still not great. If you like this kind of stuff I would recommend an early 70s film Scream Bloody Murder.<br/><br/>The story is garbage. In the middle of chasing after Bolton, Bardem barges into an office and kills his employer. Where the hell did this come from. Bolton is killed off screen. I'm not even sure if Bardem killed him. After spending an entire film with these characters, we are left with a dud. If you're going to kill off Bolton, how about making it like in the middle shootout with Bardem where both are hit. <br/><br/>The only way I can recommend this movie is if you're studying film and reading the reviews. At first my rating was a B-, 6 stars. Then after reading the reviews and realizing the mess of a story, real rating is a 5, C. 1 star given for balance."

","No cop would ever just leave his prisoner on the bench in the lobby, handcuffed but not anchored to anything, and keep his back turned while he makes a phonecall. That's so movie-typical. Every thriller/horror that has a cop in the picture shows that scenario and no cop would be that dumb. It's common sense. Since this is, of course, how the movie kicks off and becomes a movie/story, it's not a good movie. Everything that happens thereafter (as in, 90% of the movie), shouldn't have. Even further, nobody being pulled over by a lit-up cop car would be so cooperative. For one, the guy knows he hasn't anything wrong so doesn't know why he's being pulled over. Secondly, the bad guy doesn't even remotely resemble a real cop. Third, a person would repel when the ""cop"" refuses to explain, just insists he get out of the vehicle, and even does something so bizarre as to tell him to stand still as he puts a really weird device to his forehead.

The Coens' No Country for Old Men steps beyond the pornographic in vicious repugnance and plunks down with a bloody thud in downtown evil. <br/><br/>Why would anyone feel a need to tell a story like this, and in such a way as to leave viewers filled with such contrived despair? I use the word contrived because I'm assuming the average Joe or Jane sitting down to watch an action/chase movie by the Coens is not expecting to leave the theater or living room filled with despair and feeling degraded. <br/><br/>Somebody--or in this case, some bodies--had to contrive/spawn/shat a situation where the sum of the optimistic parts of the audience has been diminished after exposure to 122 minutes of this villainous garbage. <br/><br/>If Hell had a movie studio, it would produce and distribute movies like No Country for Old Men."

Being dumb is one thing, but being unable to catch a psychopath who pretty much tells everyone where he is going to be is plain stupid.<br/><br/>And what's more stupid is USA's utterly flawed gun for everyone policy, which is the only reason that such crap can be made and justified, because yeah, everyone can kill everyone with no consequences, and police will typically judge who is the worse guy among the two and pretty much try to help the better one, and failing even at that.<br/><br/>So, why the right rating then?

Yes, there is suspense, but otherwise the film is a directionless meander.

"hptmbedra","5","1","4","16 April 2018"," Possibly valid idea ruined by plot holes and resignation
","People are trying to figure out what is the message of this film in many reviews. My take is that it tries to deliver an experience similar to Unforgiven (1992). Unforgiven is about giving up on the romantic idea of the life in the West back then, the black and white characters etc. and portrays this time period in a way it might have actually looked like, while it even brings attention to such details, although pretty iconic to conventional westerns, as the way the shootouts were potrait vs. how they really happened or what was required to kill a man. Along these lines, NCfOM tells us or shows us rather that a single man can't resist mafia and professional killers, that the death is not heroic and that there is no happy ending once you get involved in drug business.<br/><br/>This idea is fine and I must admit I like Unforgiven very much and was therefore ready to like NCfOM, but the problem of is the execution of the idea.<br/><br/>The first half of the film is actually pretty good and I was on the edge of my seat there. Especially at the moment where Chigurh was conversating with Carson or Llewelyn made me hope for other character dimensions to come out of these guys, which would have been very enjoyable because these characters were really interesting. But the second half lacks everything you expect at that point which peaks at the end where it fails to deliver any conclusion (though not necessary generally, this movie definitely deserves it) or explanation and at the same time it makes you wonder about the amount of plot holes (were there tens or hundreds? was I asking).<br/><br/>At certain point in the second half (trip to El Paso - won't tell you more, but you will guess it anyway once you see it) the film lost me and I made it to the end just thanks to the momentum of the first half. Seriously, towards the end, the nihilistic, resignated, given up tone was the biggest obstacle for me to finish watching the movie. Put altogether with the unnecessary violence on top, I gladly turned it off eventually and said to myself that I shall now go to sleep, which I should have done at least an hour ago."
"kenhew","8","1","4","16 April 2018"," What is the point of a movie?
","What makes a good movie? Maybe even more fundamental a question would be, what makes a movie? Is it the story? The acting? The visuals? The sound? Combination of a few, or all? Well one thing that this movie glaringly and purposefully show, is that, contrary to popular belief and academic and industry advice, you don't need to have a plot or a story, let alone a good one, to make a good, award winning movie.<br/><br/>Really, just have good cinematography, convincing actors, random vague dialogues, lots of blood and suspense scenes, you have an award-wining formula for any Hollywood movies. And if you'd argue otherwise, No Country for Old Men promptly shuts you up. This film was made to prove only one point, is that you don't need to have one when it comes to making a movie.<br/><br/>It is not a good movie in any logical, predictable, sense-making sense. Perhaps the cliche remark of ""it's so bad it's good"" would be used to describe this particularly unapologetic movie, but to call this movie bad is both undeserving and unjustified, for how is it a bad movie can be led to be called Movie of the Year, yet it will undeniably leave a bad taste in your mouth after consuming this 2-hour long movie right up to the end. So for those who have not watched it, it is, cliche-ly, a must watch, if anything, just to see how bad a movie can be to be an award winning film of the year."

I couldn't wait to see how the three main characters would interact when they inevitably came together. But the Coens yank the rug out from under the audience by wiping out the protagonist 75% of the way through the movie. Why waste so much time building Llewelyn Moss'(Brolin's) character and emphasizing his resourcefulness if you're going to kill him off so abruptly with no explanation? There's easily an entire scene missing. Fine, I get it: the Mexicans found him. I don't need a rosy ending, but at least reveal how his demise went down. I'm not even asking for a gory shootout sequence; just explain what led up to it. Yes, there is an underlying commentary on fate and humanity, but this movie is also an action/crime thriller where multiple peripheral characters are strangled or blown away by a sociopath's killer.

"SeakDub","6","1","4","4 March 2017"," Beautiful but Overrated.
","From mixed reviews this movie either goes 1 star or 10 stars on different views from reviewers. It lands in the middle for me with a 6 because it wasn't anything special. The movie is well paced, beautiful landscape even if it is desert. And overall an actually pretty violent movie. <br/><br/>I have seen many Coen movies but never payed any mind to who they were until this movie. This ""No Country For Old Men"" was quite a build up movie. Having a lone hunter finding a drug exchange gone wrong and finding some hefty cash. Hits the jackpot he runs home and from there has a change of heart and goes back to give a dying man some water. From there, that was his mistake and is then hunted by the drug dealers wanting their money back. But worse, a psychotic assassin comes into play killing anyone who basically talks to him. The assassin of course is after the money, leaving the lone hunter to jump from place to place to make sure he isn't next on the psychotic assassin's hit list. Then comes into play the sheriff of the town who seems to give more stories and philosophies than really do anything else. So sets into motion the rest of the movie of cat and mouse from the lone hunter being chased by the assassin and drug dealers while the sheriff is picking up pieces. An intense battle of who comes out on top of catching the cash. Ends up beautifully made and thrilling. But stops at the ending were it goes from great to disappoint. <br/><br/>Spoilers Ahead!<br/><br/>I believe the Coen brothers did a wonderful job on the movie, I actually thank them from what I hear is that they kept much of the book into the film. But the ending comes as a very big disappointment to me seeing how it ends without any answers. One of the make it your own ending feels. The assassin who seems to feel no pain randomly gets in a car crash and just walks away. The lone hunter who we think is going to have an epic gun battle with the psychotic killer is seen one scene fine, next scene dead and found by the sheriff. From the drug dealers so we believe they snatched the money and bail out. From the books perspective the assassin gets the money and returns it to the original owner. In the movie we don't even know if he gets the money and we guess the drug dealers do. Another question leads us to think why and how did he know about the money. Book may answer it, but for the film he just kind of shows up. So we can't say who he works for, if by himself, or really anything about the assassin expect that he likes to kill and wants the money. Finally the sheriff tells a dream of his father and how he is just too old for the things going on and retires. Which is a dull way of ending a book/movie. I can't blame the Coen brothers but I was so twisted and turn by the end of this movie that I started to hate on it. I don't care if the overall villain escapes or wins but this was just a confusing ending. And by confusing I mean why they decided to end it the way they did. You can see where they were going with it but it fails to leave you satisfied. <br/><br/>For the acting, I say it was boring. I couldn't get into any character. Love Tommy Lee Jones but the storytelling sheriff he plays puts people to sleep. Josh Brolin did a good job on his part of acting, it was his character I hated. From the random choices he makes and seemly being a smart guy did really weird choices. A good guy who ended up paying for the choices he made. I just didn't care for it. And finally the psychotic killer assassin played by Javier Bardem. Now that was a masterpiece character and acting. He played such a creepy guy that I swear I was getting the willies every time he came on screen. The role was perfect for him. A standalone perfect 10 for this guy, Javier deserves the win for the Oscar for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role. I also do have to mention Woody Harrelson's character and say that was the worse cameo? Pointless to me, maybe it made more sense in the book but it was such a letdown to have him appear only to boringly talk.<br/><br/>Otherwise besides the ending, the movie itself is a very intense build up that seems like it would be a slow movie which actually gets you hooked. I was enjoying it, scenery, action, and all. I don't even remember the music/soundtrack for the film. I can see why people either like it or hate it. I'm in the middle ground and say if it wasn't for such a rushed filling ending I would have agreed to saying this movie is a must see. But with the violence, character growth, and lousy ending. I have to say skipped the movie and enjoy another movie."

Sorry, but I don't get paid to do that, the writers do. The Scene at the El Paso motel was done too quick and without sufficient explanation. I understand that we were supposed to be seeing what the Sheriff saw, but it was to vague. The filmmakers had an excellent opportunity here to have a really nice gunfight scene, but left us wondering. Also the ending with the hit-man and Josh Brolin's wife was sketchy at best. This film could have been a lot better, but did not live up to it's potential. If I never see it again that's alright by me."

Boring, not intriguing and forgettable characters. The only not forgettable character is the psychopath with he weird hair. And he doesn't convince me as the bad guy. YES, I don't think he does a convincing job! They call it western. I've seen a lot better westerns, even modern time westerns. Is it disturbing? Not really. Cohen brothers always try to take a dark turn into the humanity of peoples choices. I will never get it,nor will I see the brilliance of there movies. I don't believe that human nature is that black and white in the core, with lots of shade of Gray in the everyday mans choices. It feels so simplified.<br/><br/>I like to compare the villain in NCFOM with the villains in the dark knight. Now, heath ledgers joker was a masterpiece! Even though it was never explained why or how he became the joker, he was believable and you believed the oriented chaos within him. In that aspect, the Mexican fails. It tries to be explained bit about the mental instability from the Mexican in the movie, but its so vague you never get invested to try understand him. In that sense I compare the Mexican to two face/Harvey Dent. Both have the ""create own luck"" by flipping a coin. However, Harvey Dent was explained and we invested a lot of time into knowing him. Try to imagine Two face without build up. You might end up with tommy lee Jones bad joker make over from batman forever. And this is my main problem with the Mexican. Although not a joker impression, he is thrown in to the movie, no sense behind it. And what we see is just an empty shell acting from a manuscript.<br/><br/>So would i recommend this movie? I have my thoughts about it. However, if you like the Cohen brothers then I would say watch it. If you don't, its not worth your time."

This is for the simple fact that the movie is near perfect but not perfect. It is only missing one thing: connection with it's audience. There is almost nothing for a normal audience member to connect with upon watching this movie. So though Movie buffs can sit there in awe at all the amazing shots throughout the movie, a normal audience member, so somebody who watches movies when ever they are in the mood rather then as a passion, would sit there and be bored out of their minds. The lack of in-depth character and plot development, plus the lack of musical score leaves the mouth tasting dry. I would never recommend this movie to anyone who does not find their passion in the art of movie making. It deserves a Oscar because of it's originality and fantastic acting but it does not deserve to fall into the list of 'must see movies of all time' so not to fool any average person into waisting there time on a movie they won't appreciate."

After literally two hours of build-up our cast of core characters are finally all going to meet at a single location. This promises to be a magnificently interesting show-down. Instead, the film takes a sharp turn towards the artsy by suddenly killing the main character off-screen and devoting the final 20 minutes to disjointed (though well-written) philosophy discussions.<br/><br/>This might be entertaining for the ""cinema"" crowd that views the act of subverting expectations and breaking convention as entertainment in its own right. But for the majority of movie-watchers (yes, even the intelligent ones) it's just disappointing.<br/><br/>What was the point of all that tension-building if nothing comes of it but abstracted dialog that would have been just as relevant when the movie began? Why devote ~hours~ building this character if he's going to be ingloriously killed off-screen by unnamed and barely-explained gangsters? Why was Woody Harrelson's character even in the film? In the end No Country will leave you feeling let down, and that's always a bad thing no matter how artfully it's done."
"Quebec_Dragon","7","1","4","23 May 2009"," It's good but didn't deserve the Oscar for best film
","I respect the technical qualities of the film but I can't say I particularly cared for it. How did it get hyped enough to win the Oscar for best film? I'm really not sure although perhaps because it plays constantly with our expectations and genre conventions but probably mostly because of the killer performance by the killer Javier Bardem. He plays a memorable character and it's probably what people will remember from the film 10 years from now. What also comes to mind is how street smart the main characters are and it does help to make things more convincing instead of always second-guessing the stupid actions of the protagonists in typical movies.<br/><br/>Although the parts with the sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) were obviously important (to explain the title of the film for one), I thought they were slow and rather dull (although it's likely a conscious choice to show how it's ""not a country for old men"" anymore). The violent scenes were short, tense and felt realistic, sometimes skipped altogether. Like the Texas state where it takes place, the film felt desolate and gritty. I should mention that in several places, including the ending, the brothers Coen went for the unexpected and/or anticlimactic. I generally like surprises but overall the problem with anticlimax is that it rarely leaves you satisfied.<br/><br/>Rating: 7 out of 10"

","I have been a fan of the Coen Brother's work, especially ""Fargo"" and ""Blood Simple"" and ""The Big Lebowski"". These movie are innovative and entertaining. I wish I could say the same for ""No Country for Old Men"", but then I would be lying. This movie was a complete waste. <br/><br/>That doesn't mean everything was bad. The execution was handled nicely, the cinematography looked stunning, and the acting was top notch. But the story led to no direction and I started to to become pretty irritable at what I was observing. The story, not once showed any signs of sympathy towards the characters. The bad guys seem to outwit the good guys in everything making them unstoppable. I like it when the good guys win, clichÃ©d yes, but I would've liked to see justice served much better. I wanted to leave the theater so badly, but I bought the ticket and I was hoping for something unpredictable to happen. It never did! <br/><br/>I ask myself, what was going through the Coen's heads to make an adaptation of this very disturbing novel. No insult to Cormac McCarthy, but through reading this book, the subject matter was too drab, cynical, and not very supportive of this dreary cause. The shooting of this film is noteworthy that it's set in blinding daylight. Not my idea of entertainment.<br/><br/>This is storytelling at its worst. The ugliness of this story is too much for me to handle. I advise you to avoid this movie at all costs. In the end you'll thank me for it."

Throughout the whole film, I really wanted the good guy to win - and this time he got killed in the last 15 minutes - but we didn't get to see it happen. He is just suddenly dead on the floor.

","When hunter Brolin stumbles across a drug deal gone bad, he decides to keep the money for himself. But he gets caught by some of the bad guys cohorts when he returns to the scene of the crime to get the drugs and they're already there. This sets the tone for the rest of the movie where everyone is trying to get their own hands on the money, while an aging lawman (Jones) stumbles around, trying to figure out what, exactly, is going on.<br/><br/>This film, in my opinion, was a little on the lame side. Although a fan of Tommy Lee Jones, I am, definitely, not a fan of the Coen Bros. I thought the plot was good, but the direction the movie took, sometimes was a little sidetracked and the dialog was, sometimes, too macho. I don't live in Texas, but do they really talk that way down there? Do they threaten people and put lives at risk with such little emotion? To tell you the truth, I feel like I've put more emotion into the fifteen minutes to write this review than the ""Brothers"" did in writing the whole film. Jones, alone, was the reason why this movie got six out of ten stars, and even THAT was questionable."
"JoeytheBrit","Null","1","4","25 September 2008"," Another good one from the Coen brothers
","Major spoilers.<br/><br/>The Coens certainly seem to be building up a head of steam as they head into their sixth decade, and looking back through their filmography there's only one film that never really made the cut for me. They're still bang on form here, that's for sure, with a slow-burning crime thriller similar in concept to A Simple Plan, although here there is no sibling rivalry but one simple man against one complex hit-man and a lawman who comes to realise that he is long past his best and far out of his depth.<br/><br/>Anton Chigurh is one of those creations that linger in the memory long after the fine details of the film have begun to fade, and is played with unnerving understatement by Javier Bardem. You definitely wouldn't want to make fun of his hairdo, that's for sure. Like Tommy Lee Jones ageing sheriff, Chigurh chooses not to use a conventional weapon, killing most of his victims with a captive bolt pistol that propels a retractable bolt into the head or body of his victim, leaving a fatal wound but few clues as to the killer. In effect, Chigurh is the nearest you can get to a human ghost, killing only those who 'see' him in the course of his duties.<br/><br/>Chigurh is hired to retrieve the money from a drug deal gone wrong, and quickly learns that the money has been hijacked by Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin), a resourceful good ol' boy with a conscience that proves both to be his undoing and the only real weak spot in the film. Of course, had Moss not gone back to the scene of the drugs shootout there would have been no film or, at least, the Coen's would have had to negotiate a more tortuous path to enable both Chigurh and the Mexican gangsters also employed to find the money to track their quarry.<br/><br/>With virtually no musical score, the Coen's effectively use silence as an instrument of tension. Where most films would try to ratchet up the tension with music designed to influence the viewer's senses this one simply places a static camera in front of an armed man staring at a seedy hotel door and effortlessly has your nerves twanging. But then the whole film is quiet. Tommy Lee Jones'  who looks as if he has aged 20 years in the past five  ageing sheriff's fear of the forces he is up against and realisation of his inadequacies compared to the heritage which he is trying to live up to creep up on him almost without us or him - realising.<br/><br/>The film's conclusion is completely logical and wholly uncompromising in its callous disregard for the traditional happy ending. Everyone ends up damaged or dead  just like in real life  and there are no tidy solutions. There is even a blurring of what is real and what imagined when Ed Tom Bell enters the motel room in which the enterprising Moss was finally gunned down. In many films this deliberate decision to avoid and even frustrate the viewers' attempt to attach rational explanations to all that takes place on screen would prove to be irritating, but with this film the technique is strangely appropriate."

I felt Coen's cheated me, fooled me using their strong reputation that was an excuse to make this abomination of a film. The start of the movie was really promising, done in Coen style that we all know and adore. But that is it. They give you the plot in the beginning and the rest of the movie is Bardem chasing Brolin over some cash with a wannabe deep ending that people think it's so great so they give out 10s. If there wasn't Javier Bardem who by the way did an excellent job. He saved the movie from being a complete flop. His cold heart acting was brilliant, and his hair rocks.<br/><br/>I think this movie is a half finish product. At least it would be if any other director did it.

"sc8031","8","1","4","23 June 2008"," No Money For Old People
","This movie is weird because: the acting and casting is great, the characters are great, the cinematography and filming is gorgeous, the absence of a soundtrack works in the film's favor, and the dialog and writing are great too; and yet the film is not particularly rewarding.<br/><br/>If you want clean conclusions or breathtaking innovation to enjoy a movie, look elsewhere because this movie doesn't have either of those. I found myself thinking of ""Way of the Gun"" or even ""U-Turn"" a little bit, for the locale, style, colors, and writing. Of course those movies didn't have the substance or character depth of this one, and maybe they were a little more openly violent, but this movie is obscenely violent too. This one's just more accessible because it's so minimalist, professional and easy on the eyes. Fair enough. Mondo points for environmental realism and aesthetic perfection found here.<br/><br/>A weird thing in this one is how the violence is shown to be grotesque for its nonchalance, but then there's this odd dark sense of comedy that creeps into certain scenes; like the way the killer Chigurh is careful about getting blood on his boots/clothes or asks people for information. Maybe it was the film-maker's intent, but those little flashes of dark humor make the movie even more depressing.<br/><br/>Chigurh started to seem way too much like the T-800 in ""The Terminator"" (the first one). You know, he just logically does things that are useful and accessible to him, without any emotional feedback. It works and is scary, but when he goes and does the whole self-surgery thing after being injured, the parallel is too obvious (intentional?). Also, I know the absence of a background makes Chigurh mysterious, but where does his wealth of knowledge come from? Who let him accumulate medical knowledge so that he could operate on himself? That just seems kinda far-fetched. Like, he didn't just decide to go killing one day. He is a freaking emotionless drifter who goes from point A to point B with random incentives that mean nothing! Chigurh is an archetype of contrast to society in general. He's an outsider not just to the West Texas locale, but to human beings of all stripes. Still, I felt like he was a bit too cartoon-ish, not in his actions, but in his mannerisms and motivations.<br/><br/>The other two male leads in this film are more interesting REAL characters. Haha, there certainly is a tough-guy, salt-of-the-earth, grizzled-badass theme going on here! Hence I suppose it is rather interesting that the directors do not play the character contrasts out as one typically sees them in westerns or crime films. In fact, many of the most climactic scenes here are not even shown. A Coen Bros. special twist!<br/><br/>""No Country"" is very good, but is typical of Coen brothers films, blending a few genres (typically crime, comedy and western) and doing it with substance and style. They do it here, but not with the same degree of success or originality of prior films. It's just masterful craftsmanship, rather than brilliant creativity. And I feel as if the open-ended nature of this movie makes people give it more artistic credibility than they should.<br/><br/>7.5"

He let's a guy at a gasoline station toss a coin. Everyone knows, if the clerk loses, he's going to die. The clerk is a lucky man. And then, this quote as the clerk is about to put the coin into his purse: ""Don't put it there, you couldn't tell, it's a special coin..."" Whaow, how beautiful!

One can feel Lancaster (Gattopardo) dying.<br/><br/>I felt that ""No country for old men"" tried to reach the same effect. But, sorry to say, the Coen's aren't as good as Visconti in this aspect.

","Here was a movie with great potential and lived up to it until about the last half hour. Where do I start? This movie had the potential to be a great movie but lost it in the last half hour. First of all, Josh Brolin was the star of this movie and should be first listing. He played a great part of a simple but witty and sharp cowboy.<br/><br/>Tommy Lee Jones downplayed his role and was not at his greatest as a mopey Sheriff. His role didn't affect the movie as any actor could have portrayed this character. He did have a couple of good lines though. And his star quality did help the movie as he does have a great presence on screen.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem excelled at his role with a stunning performance of a ruthless and truly psychotic with just a hint of and I mean hint of humanity.<br/><br/>You will love the first three quarters of the movie. Brolin played his part to perfection and I really liked his character.<br/><br/>Where did Woody Harrelson come from? He appeared near the end of the movie and had 3 scenes and was killed-off. I must say though, he played an excellent character and is a very good actor. His facial expressions at the time of his execution were superb.<br/><br/>Here is where the movie bombs. The movie spends all of its time building the character of Brolin ""Llewelyn"" and is then killed-off. Huh? At least if you are to kill him off, show it! Put some meaning to it. Just don't show him dead. You spent the whole movie building his character and then kill him off without any experience for the audience. Basically, you just sh#t on the movie.<br/><br/>The director let this movie die. I don't know what he was trying to do. I don't know if he was catering to Tommy Lee or what but he just couldn't put it together. Maybe it was time constraints but the movie was cut short with quicky solutions. Its almost like he spent to much time on the beginning and ran out of space and had to make a quick exit.<br/><br/>Viewers should not let this or other movies get away with it and give ten stars. This movie is not a 10 star movie!!<br/><br/>The premise of the title, I guess, must have moved this movie but Jones' character was not strong enough or created enough to propel the title.

We give the Coen brothers props for trying, but overall, this was one of the most boring films we have ever watched, and it would have been more so if we had not already read the book; therefore, we knew what was going on (what a character was thinking during one of the many scenes without dialogue). Sure, there was some superb acting, especially Javier Bardem, as no one I think could have done creepy, but in not such a creepy way, as well as he did (think Gloria Swanson in Sunset Blvd.).

As I watched Llewelyn Moss attempt to stay alive I was rooting for him all the way, the film wants you to invest in the character, otherwise why introduce him and his wife as so central to the plot.<br/><br/>The thing I'm complaining about is the unceremonious and unemotional end to Llewellyn the film delivers, never even verbally establishing his death as though the character we've come to cheer on never existed... The films cold distant way of dealing with the characters death seriously hurt the film, had it been an emotionally satisfying demise that led the story along (toward an equally satisfying climax) than it would have been okay...<br/><br/>They kill off the character, his wife, his wife's mother, and leave us with Tommy Lee Jone's character Ed Tom Bell (excellently played by Jones) to follow, but rather than have Bell struggle to and eventually catch or kill the villain he gets close and then retires...<br/><br/>Anton Chigurh, the killer, than goes free... the audience thinks karma will come around and are teased when Anton gets into a car accident, but he walks away...

"berrorg","5","1","4","17 March 2008"," Fairly Entertaining... Very Weak Script
","So I gave the Coens another chance. I'm one of those guys who after 2 or 3 disappointments always VOW to never watch another movie from such director(s), but then almost always fail and find myself watching the new stuff they bring to the table (I said almost, cause I've had it with Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez). The movie started and I had fairly high expectations after all the hurrays it's been receiving. My feeling that this was one of those movies that self-important critics like to put in the spotlight as THE new masterpiece was sent to the very back of my mind. The ambiance, I like, the pace at the beginning, was good. Bardem's acting convincing (not so chilling as I read everywhere, but good nonetheless). The whole story ahead seemed very interesting, until we find the Mexicans... The slow pace (which I liked... not every movie has to be a frantic teenage million shots per minute MTV video) gave me a chance to savor what was happening, and I was contemplating in my mind what would I do with the money found, with practically no witnesses (just that thirsty guy, most surely dead by now) and with a head start over everybody who would be looking for it. But then, out of WEAK writing, the character gets up from bed and goes to serve a glass of water to some dying man in the desert! What a STUPID idea. And I don't mean the character's idea. Unless they wanted to present the character as a mentally impaired person, or just a total moron, there was no way ANYBODY would have done that. I can think here of many better ways to give the Mexicans a way to know who this guy was: 1. Make him go back to KILL the dying man; maybe he gets scared that he may live long enough to tell his friends about the mustached gringo who came earlier, or whatever. Maybe he realizes that he screwed up by leaving that guy as a witness, but to come back many hours later to help a guy barely breathing? C'mon! 2. So, you want to make this character more likable, less dark than someone willing to kill an unarmed and dying guy just for his filthy money, OK, that's easy... make him greedy enough to come back for MORE money. Maybe the dying Mexican is armed and he has another bag full of money (split the 2 millions in 2 parts, he founds 1 million under that tree with that dead Mexican, and the other million is between the dying Mexican in his truck). So, he has the option of killing the Mexican and get the second million, but that's to mean for him, so he settles for just the 1 million he found. Goes back home, and figures that maybe the other Mexican may have died already and there's another million up for grabs.. yeah, it's pretty dumb to go back after so many hours (he should have stayed waiting for the Mexican to die) but not as dumb as taking water to the dying fella! From then on, I knew that the movie was going to be a series of illogical situations forced fit for the sake of whatever the directors wanted to show us. Fortunately, it wasn't so, but that spoiled the movie for me: illogical or inconsequential scenes/characters thrown in for the sake of nothing! So, we have Woody in a Texans suit, very bad-ass, he gets killed without showing us why he thinks he's such a bad-ass. We have Tommy Lee Jones acting the same character that he seems to know lately... is he a real sheriff nowadays? Because I've seen at least 3 movies lately with him and this character, the same one! He's after the killer, but I hardly think that he will get him sitting and talking nonsense in the local cafeterias. The bad guys, the ones who ""hired"" ""Sugar"" (whatever his correctly spelled name is). What kind of morons hire a psychopathic killer? Now, here's another stupid idea from this script. The Woody Harrelson's character is apparently thrown in to let us know that Sugar is a real crazy M.F. He will kill Death if the Reaper looks him in the eye, or so he says. Sugar seems to be a pretty bad ass but too psycho for the job (for ANY job), and everybody seems to know this, but they keep hiring him!? Gimme a break. And the Mexicans... well, they - SPOILER - kill the main character in a hotel in El Paso... but that seems to be of no importance for the directors. I wasn't expecting a big shoot-out, or a grandiose action scene where maybe he would get killed, but at least a little dignity to this character would have showed him being killed, not just dead in the floor... I actually didn't recognized him at first (I guess I'm bad at recognizing dead guys), and my wife was the one who told me ""they snuffed him already"".. I was like, what? no way, that's a Mexican, don't you see the moustache. But not only Mexicans wear moustaches in this movie... And at the end, the accident........... so, what? This movie is just a big pond of pseudo profundities that will make you feel that your watching the new big thing in crime drama... if you belong to the club of the ""critic's watch"". For normal people, if we wear sunglass to avoid the extra shining added by marketing, this is just a fairly entertaining movie."

","After the big Oscar win, No Country came back to the local theaters. The movie is about accidents and being at the wrong place at the wrong time and how being evil sometimes comes with a code of morals.<br/><br/>There are three major players: Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), who stumbles across a drug deal gone back, Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), who starts out chasing Llewelyn for the money and ends up chasing him because of the fact that his chase is taking so long, and Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), a sheriff who cracks up and becomes useless. It has a signature Coen brothers look: lots of dreary landscapes and very macabre characters. This is a great movie for all of those cynics out there.<br/><br/>I think of this movie as mostly a character study. It got an Oscar for screenplay, which I don't think was the strongest part of the movie for me. There was some fantastic writing, but the movie was uneven to me. On the one hand you had the chase and the evasion. On the other hand, you had all these monologues from characters that revealed things about their pasts. It seemed like a suspense mashed in with a Shakespeare tragedy. It didn't work for me. Some have compared it to the feel of a Hitchcock film and I couldn't disagree more. Hitchcock did blend suspense with characters studies but the suspense was always the strongest part of the movie. It never took a back seat to the character study. Rather, the character study was merely a tool for drawing the reader farther in. In No Country, you don't really care who gets the money, as long as you don't have to see Chigurh do another coin toss ever again."

I think there should have been more rhythm, I hoped there was more behind the actions, and not just the big evil against the powerless good people. I had they impression they wanted to look a bit like Tarantino, but didn't get it. They wanted to provide a social message, but too weak. In the end, I resume, it is not a bad movie, but from the two brothers I expected much much more, and for sure I cannot believe this is the best movie of the year"

","Well I have just finished watching the movie. And i should say that I am sort of disappointed. But it is mostly my fault cause normally i watch movies without having enough information to expect them anything. I knew I should see the movie before the Awards.<br/><br/>First of all even though i didn't like the movie that much i am not surprised about the Oscars. I should admit that the movie is a very good piece of art. The sound is used very effectively. Acting is also quite above anything we are used to see lately. So no big surprise about Academy Awards, since the experts don't see the movies like normal people see. And i think that point is very very significant for that movie.<br/><br/>Normal people go movies to enjoy. Enjoy! Thats the critical word. I have read some comments but come on people we should be more COMMON.. This is the point of this site. Otherwise everyone can buy a magazine and read what movie experts think about the sound or cinematography etc. The movie is not for someone who wants to spend two beautiful hours watching a movie which he most possibly would not understand.<br/><br/>For me.. I like movies, after which i want to be the leading character. When i saw a war movie, it should take me in itself and make me wish that i would be a part of this scenario. Unfortunately i cant say that for Coen Bro.'s movie.<br/><br/>To sum up, artistically the movie seems to be very good ( well i am no expert) but it is hard to follow, not easy to figure out the message, and doesn't provide a fulfilling end.<br/><br/>Cant understand the rate also.. Seems like everyone else here had that ""artistical"" taste.."

","Okay, the Coen brothers have made a near perfect film - O Brother Where Art Thou - but No Country for Old Men is a distinct misfire. It is terrific for the first 2/3rds of the film then simply goes off the rails. Unfortunately artsy-fartsy point-of-view choices up-end the story.<br/><br/>We come to the climax of the film (see other reviews for what came before) and Josh Brolin's character is being hit on by a pretty girl by a motel pool. Brolin's character has come to face down the hit-man after him for the money he opportunistically stole from a crime scene. This pretty girl says, ""Sometimes you don't see it comin'."" And the next shot is Josh Brolin's character - our film's protagonist - lying dead in a doorway - killed by much lesser characters (Mexican drug smuggler enforcers) as our second protagonist (Tommy Lee Jones's character) pulls in the scene. We see it from TLJ's point-of-view, and when we see Brolin's character's body laying there dead we don't even get a clear look at his face! Gimmicky!!!!!!! I'm at a loss as to why these assured and accomplished filmmakers, the Coen brothers, felt the need for this point-of-view switch and denied the audience the showdown. Third parties intervene and throw a monkey wrench into the works - we get it! It sucked the life out of the film - it was like that crappy ending fade-to-black on the Sopranos. What pretentious arty junk.<br/><br/>The whole Woody Harrelson subplot was useless and lent nothing to the story. Then the last three potential kills by the hit-man (played by Javier Bardem) we don't see the outcome. Since the character let the clerk at the roadside shop live early on we are left with some doubt as to whether he killed the girlfriend or the guy in the office. Lame. And a shame. This film started out aces and ended up a like a poker hand of a pair of 5s."
"adrongardner","8","1","4","16 February 2008"," No Country for Action FIlms
","I don't know if this was the best film of 2007, but it was gimmick-less, thoughtful and absolutely satisfying one. Much of the hits this film seems to take almost completely center on the ending. More than anything, I think that is an audience flaw, not one in the film or the original source material, namely the novel.<br/><br/>No Country for Old Men is a story about many things. The story can be dissected in numerous, and even possibly profound ways. But as any good novelist will do with things such as ""context"" and ""setting,"" and even ""language,"" as Cormac McCarthy has done, this is all by design of course. <br/><br/>Yes I am being sarcastic. But the point is, the story is what it is. The point isn't the tired cliché of chasing down a bundle of money, its about people. In this case, people who came home from the Vietnam war and in some fashion, brought the war home with them. The story is also, as the title implies, about as Dylan would say, how the times ""they are a changing.""<br/><br/>So there ends the analytical session. <br/><br/>The Coen's have really found a story made from the ground up for no other filmmakers than themselves. The caper story, qwirky characters and dialog recall just about every Coen Brother's movie in recent memory. Hell, there is even more than a touch of Blood Simple in there.<br/><br/>So If the direction is great, and the characters are there, what about the actors? Well Tommy Lee Jones is as good as he always is playing some old coot from way out yonder. Josh Brolin is convincing in every way possible. But it is Spaniard Javier Bardem that elevates what is just another Coen Caper to Art. Bardem's performance is absolutely unapologetic as the oxygen bottle carrying killer. I don't think there is a single criminal or killer since Arnie in 1984s Terminator, that has this much power and persona.<br/><br/>So this ending. Well I think most modern movie goers have been trained like dogs. They like a big bang at the end, and in my mind the movie delivered it. But the story was never about killers or money to begin with, it was about people and how times moves on, even if people don't. I don't think any shoot out, or handshake could do the movie any more justice than how it ended. Anything else would have been a damned cheat.<br/><br/>No Country for Old Men is a story about the desert. It's a story about greed. It's a story about killing. It's a story about people.<br/><br/>Heck, No Country for Old Men is about so many things, it is a movie that gives the audience something to do both during the movie and long after the credits roll---to think! How 'bout that.<br/><br/>Now there is something you simply cannot make up. I dare you to even try."

","Seriously, it felt like the producers got a budget of $10 to make this movie. It's pointless scenes, pointless characters, and loose ends were magnified by it's repetitive, not so exciting ""shoot-out"" scenes. The last 15 minutes of the movie drug out so long it was embarrassing. By the end of the film I was left feeling the way I did after the first 15 minutes; confused and having no idea what direction the movie was trying to take. The only thing that kept me from demanding a refund was the excellent acting displayed by Tommy Lee Jones. Unfortunately, I doubt that even Tommy Lee Jones can save this movie from ending up where it belongs: in the 2 for $10 bin at Walmart the day it hits shelves."

","In a world that becomes increasingly violent and harder to understand, people often get to a point of quitting. At times, the world can seem like a thankless and mindless place; often that is true. No Country for Old Men channels this current feeling.<br/><br/>A simple man comes across a case full of money from a drug deal gone bad and decides to take it. He is pursued not only by his hometown sheriff and a bounty hunter, but also by a serial-killing mad man. The game of cat-and-mouse that follows is one you won't soon forget.<br/><br/>Superbly acted, memorably written, and thrillingly directed, this is one of the best films made in a long time. This is the first movie by the Coen Brothers that I have watched- I'll have to see their other work now. Everything here is done with skill and purpose. The result is a Western thriller that wonders if maybe there is no hope for better times.<br/><br/>I have to talk about the acting again because it is astonishing. Josh Brolin gives a subtle and surprisingly tender performance, and Tommy Lee Jones is wonderful in his perfectly calculated role as a world-weary sheriff. But it is Javier Bardem who steals the show with his terrifying portrayal of pure evil in the form of a cold-blooded killer. This is an actor I just might be frightened to encounter on the street. Mr. Bardem will win the Oscar and deserve it.<br/><br/>In a year of few fantastic films, this one stands out. Do yourself a favor and see it on the big screen while you still can; it's well-worth the ticket price. 9/10 stars! <br/><br/>Jay Addison"

","Interesting comment overheard in the cinema on Saturday.<br/><br/>""No Country For Old Men"" had ended and the credits were rolling. I was getting up to leave when I heard a guy, who was sitting a few seats away from me, say sadly to his lady, 'Three quarters of that were great, but that last quarter was really sh*t'.<br/><br/>Hmm... Maybe, but only if you want a movie where everything is wrapped up for you in a nice bow and everything is explained. I don't think that the Coen's at full tilt want to give you that at all.<br/><br/>That gentleman in the cinema was missing the point. Really missing the point. Up until the last quarter of ""No Country For Old Men"" the Coen's are playing within the conventions of the thriller, albeit a beautiful looking, intelligently paced and well acted thriller. (Basically man finds money and another man tries to take the money off him. People die. Mayhem ensues.) During the last quarter of ""No Country For Old Men"" the Coens mess with the conventions of the standard thriller. Characters arrive late. Crucial events occur off screen. Life and death conversations take place in rooms. The fate of some of the characters is uncertain. A man thinks about how the world used to be.<br/><br/>Maybe. What do I know?<br/><br/>With ""No Country For Old Men"" the Coen's are back to the kind of form that has evaded them in recent years, with terrible, deliberate crowd pleaser's like ""Intolerable Cruelty"" and ""The Ladykillers"". I think that ""No Country For Old Men"" is a great movie and that it will win the Oscar for best film in 2008 and the Coen's the Oscar for Best Director(s). Trust me. It's going to happen."
"Kumarzone","10","1","4","27 January 2008"," Chance and Fate......
","A myriad of emotions hitting you, the feeling of helplessness upon submission to chance and fate and the doctrine of life by cause and effect summarizes this gritty masterpiece from the Coen brothers. The script, wonderfully subtle yet engrossing with visionary direction from the Coen brothers spins a tale with themes as timeless as life. The voice-over narration by Sheriff Ed Tom Bell brilliantly complements the story-telling, providing paradoxical reflections of a land laid with decaying morality. Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh provides the anti-hero persona of a remorseless killer yet laced with strong principles. The cinematography was razor crisp with clever manipulation of lighting, each shot so purposefully created to realize Cormac McCarthy's book. Arguably the best western from Hollywood in recent times. Highly recommended - 10/10"

","I found ""NoCountry for Old Men"" could have been possibly the best film of 2007 had it been some 15 minutes shorter as there were several scenes that dragged, and were very remotely connected to the plot. The photography was brilliant as the setting presented great opportunities to the Cinematographers, the lack of background music helped the suspense, and the acting of all the leads, in particular Josh Brolin, was exceptional. Sure, it is a very violent movie with more blood spilled in two hours than ever seen before (including Al Pacino's ""Scarface""!), but it was gripping throughout, with the ending very surprising. The Woody Harrelson part was a bit superfluous, but Tommy Lee Jones who makes a somewnat belated appearance was in excellent form. If there is a sequel, then Hannibal Lecter will only be a memory."

Did Anton satisfy the needs of his employer to their satisfaction? What were the ramifications of Anton's actions? (What was his motivation to use the cattle bolt gun as his weapon of choice?

"shanen-ceaser","6","1","5","23 March 2012"," Good Movie, not fantastic
","'No Country for Old Men' was highly acclaimed, but upon viewing though, one has to ask what all the fuss is about.<br/><br/>The story contrives to be straightforward and opaque at the same time; trailer-trash Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin) happens upon a corpse and a bag full of money in the Texan desert. As always happens in the movies, he decides to keep it for himself, thus attracting the attention of the extremely sinister Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem sporting an equally sinister pudding bowl haircut). The first three-quarters of the film are essentially about Moss trying to evade Chigurh's murderous clutches, whilst folksy but ineffectual Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) follows two steps behind. This section of the film works well as a thriller, with some tense and exciting scenes as Chigurh relentlessly pursues the resourceful Moss. However, much remains rather unclear; for instance the origin of the money is never really made clear and a bounty-hunter type character (a nice cameo from Woody Harrelson) enters and exits the story quickly and rather pointlessly.<br/><br/>Had 'No Country' continued in the thriller vein for its two hour running time, then it would have been a strong entry in the genre, but those Oscar nods would still have been rather mystifying. However the film literally loses the plot in the last quarter, with the abrupt, off-screen death of a central character and a slow, meandering and ultimately rather pointless finale. All in all, 'No Country For Old Men' must be one of the more disappointing and over-rated films of recent years."
"james-j-lee","8","1","5","22 January 2012"," Very watchable but lacking originality.
","A good film, well produced and some decent performances but hardly original. <br/><br/>Here we have an everyday man stumbling upon stolen loot and a massacre scene in the desert. Sound familiar? Yep it was an identical premise (and scene) to the plot for The Good The Bad and The Ugly. Only in the GB&U it was the ""tip off"" of where loot was hidden. Similar theme in It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World and Shallow Grave and many others.<br/><br/>Back to NCFOM and the main protagonist who takes the law into his own hands also has many parallels with too many other film characters to mention - but you could toss in the likes of D-Fens in Falling Down, Butch and Sundance, etc etc.<br/><br/>Enter the psycho who just kills everyone for the hell of it. Or as the bounty hunter Woody Harrelson says ""he'll kill you for the inconvenience"" Yep we've seen all these types before also - Arnie, Rambo, Mr Blonde from Reservoir Dogs, etc etc...<br/><br/>Then comes the straight Sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) who doesn't use a gun if he can help it - yep we've seen this type before too - see High Noon, Shane, etc etc.<br/><br/>So the characters are fairly stereotypical and the plot not the freshest to ever grace the screens. But there is an added dimension, the psycho is in fact haunting the Sheriff and in fact will haunt him forever - this is fairly well done but it is pretty odd. Why? Well the sheriff isn't the main protagonist in this film, he only really becomes ""part"" of it in the last third, by that time most will not really care about him. It would have been better and made more sense had the Psycho haunted the couple forever.<br/><br/>Cinematography is excellent, the direction pretty good but on the whole this is just a re-hash of several films with the Coen stamp over it.<br/><br/>There are a few very stupid moments. Like Josh Brolin waiting for the psycho to come into his hotel room. Josh sits on the bed right in front of the door. Surely the sensible thing would have been to lie down behind the bed or move over to the side of the room to reduce the risk of being caught by the bulletfire. Also in another later scene, the way Josh Brolin enters Mexico pretending to Border Patrol he is a drunk was silly. Only outdone on the silliness scale by him re-entering America with few clothes on having escaped from hospital. He tells the Border Patrol guard he's a Vietnam vet but shows no ID yet he's gets the all clear to enter. Very silly indeed but I am willing to retract these remarks and apologise to the Coens if in fact such occurrences do happen on the USA/Mexican Border.<br/><br/>Yet despite all the flaws this movie does work. It does create tensions and most viewers will get caught up in the cat and mouse games.<br/><br/>There are times when the dialogue is a bit slow and with no soundtrack sometimes it seems an age to get through a sequence especially when it is sometimes difficult to follow because the accents are so thick.<br/><br/>In summary,NCFOM is a bit overrated but is certainly good, watchable cinema and though the ending may leave some feeling cheated it is at least a bit different unlike the rest of the film which seems very similar to a lot of action films based on greed and lawlessness."

","In 'No Country for Old Men', the much feted Coen brothers attempt to do for taciturn Texans what they did for folksy Minnesotans in 'Fargo'. Cue deadpan farce, with a sense of humour as dry as the hot desert climate. The film has a certain style, charm and menace, and the Coen's certainly deserve credit for sticking with a story that emphatically rejects any sort of populist ending. But at the end of the day, it's a film about a psychopathic killer; and for all its undoubted class, I've seen enough of those before. While it's true that this particular killer is not so much human as a form of devil come to pass judgement on who should live and who should die, this idea is also less original that it sounds (most films about psychopaths attempt to play this idea, albeit few as successfully as this one). I have to confess that I've never quite understood why most of the Coen's films are so well regarded; they're certainly clever, and refreshingly non-mainstream; but I don't find them that hilarious and they're shallower than they affect. I liked watching this movie; but I didn't see greatness."

","Quietude. West Texas veldt. 1980. A lone gunman (Josh Brolin) hunting game comes upon a slaughter scene: a handful of Mexicans dead in their clustered cars on the barren plain. The gunman follows a blood trail to another dead man clutching a leather briefcase stuffed to the seams with cash.<br/><br/>Does he walk away? Does he call the police? Are you kidding? In THIS economy?! The gunman does the sane thing and takes the bag.<br/><br/>Simultaneously, on a lonely desert road, the most sinister villain since Hannibal Lecter (Spanish star and newcomer to American cinema, Javier Bardem) uses a tank of compressed air and a cattle gun to dispatch a lone traffic cop. Wordlessly. Emotionlessly. His bad Brady hairstyle making his murder seem all the more incongruous (the cattle gun a judicious weapon of choice if you regard people as no more than cattle).<br/><br/>It becomes obvious that the bag of money is his. His hunt for the gunman has begun.<br/><br/>Tommy Lee Jones, as a small-town sheriff, narrates in these first few minutes (in that Texas Hick that fits him like a pair of horse-breaking denim jeans) describing a teen he put away years ago, who killed his girlfriend (Jones pronounces it ""kilt""), who bragged he would kill again if they didn't give him the chair; a remorseless sociopath whose mind Jones could not begin to comprehend, regarding the teen like a herald for a new breed of evil.<br/><br/>That's got nothing to do with the rest of the film, but everything to do with what the film is ABOUT.<br/><br/>From the novel by Cormac McCarthy, screenplayed and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, in its first ten minutes we see why *No Country For Old Men* is so lauded  not through any explosions or car chases or ridiculous special effects  but simply through its controlled camera and tension-filled storytelling. Films like this are often called ""minimalist,"" but that's only because we have become so jaded and ocular-insulted with the *Spiderman*s and *Transformer*s - this is classic film-making in that bold Eastwood-ian vein.<br/><br/>The plot is almost secondary to the exceptional manner in which the story is told through movie MAKING; through the ""art"" of making the movie, framing every detail with utmost thought to light and shade, literally and metaphorically; each tension-soaked moment ratcheted to perfection; each scene a nuanced smorgasbord of directorial and acting skill.<br/><br/>A large part of the film involves Bardem hunting Brolin (who refuses to let go of the bag of cash), the stark realism of the hunt creating more compelling moments than all the plot twists and CGI that other movies use as distraction. Such interesting scenes, dripping with almost-nauseous intensity: the old man at the store who nearly ""buys the store,"" the dog chasing Brolin through a stream, the bruise that Brolin sustains from a door-lock exploding into his torso, the gruesome reality of a bullet wound and Bardem self-medicating and operating on himself; the awe-ful reality of a bone sticking through an arm after a car accident all these things never needed to be gussied up to hold our interest; there was no tweaking for ""Hollywood"" impact  and that is the screaming beauty of this movie. For an example of a movie that needlessly gussies and ruins its impact  *Jurassic Park*: the epic beauty of the dinosaurs would have been enough to give the movie legs, instead, Spielberg and Crichton demoted the things of beauty into things of convention, making them chase people, thereby becoming plot contrivances that were no better than monsters or zombies.<br/><br/>*No Country* defies every movie convention (which is why it leaves fully half its viewers boggled and/or disappointed): Woody Harrelson makes a cameo as a ""cleaner""  and is suddenly ""cleaned"" himself; Brolin's character vows he will turn the tables on the Brady-haired killer pursuing him - instead of that pat Rambo ending, Brolin's fate is a jarring departure from anything we are used to; the killer disappears without repercussion, without redemption  and without his money; even Tommy Lee Jones' ineffectual sheriff, who never quite picks up the scent of Bardem-hunting-Brolin, doesn't come close to any closure or capture.<br/><br/>Though Carter Burwell's score intermittently peeked through the large silences, the movie ends as it began. In quiet. Jones laments his directionless life to an old friend, ominously decrying how evil has outpaced good; how men like him are ten steps behind the new breed of killer.<br/><br/>And this new breed of movie  with its sharp turns and defiant originality - leaves us all feeling like there's a little bit of Danny Glover in all of us: <br/><br/>We're getting too old for this"

","Right off the bat, let me state clearly that I totally enjoyed No Country for Old Men. The craftsmanship is simply amazing. Given the story, it's hard to imagine the movie could have been any better. From the cinematography, to the tone, to the acting, the movie is nothing short of absolutely first-rate. It's a movie that lingers in your head for hours and hours. The screenplay is very efficient--with the slight exception of Tommy Lee Jones's monologue toward the end: not a lot is said, but every line enriches our understanding of the characters, their relationships, and the situations. And of course, the dialogue is sometimes so tastily funny, too.<br/><br/>Watching the movie feels like watching a haunting ballet performance--both elicit feelings so intense but subtle, disturbing but incomprehensible that mere verbal expressions can hardly convey them in full. In the case of No Country, it's how the seeming quietness of our life can be so fragile, so highly vulnerable to randomness. It is to the filmmakers' full credit that the movie feels so real that such feelings simply ooze rather than are jerked out.<br/><br/>That said, it's a movie that does not provoke--though I am not saying that all great movies should. Much like a documentary, the movie describes an incident from a certain angle. It does very well portraying the experiences of those affected. But it is a simple story, one that is a little too linear and straight forward. In turn, the movie is one that elicits feelings but doesn't provoke thinking. Again, continuing my previous analogy, the movie is like a great ballet performance--you go away with tonnes of feelings, but then you gain little insight or new perspective. It describes things, but chooses to neither shed much light on their nature nor offer new interpretations of them.<br/><br/>Of course, it's not the movie's goal to be thought-provoking. And with regards goals that it sets out to achieve, it achieves them remarkably well."

","The most central conceit of this movie - and it's a brilliant one - is its slowness. Life in Texas is slow, so this movie is slow, this heist is slow - even the psychopaths are slow. Someone has been watching ""Young Mr. Lincoln""! Only here the point is a rising nervous tension that is allowed an outlet, if not a release, as it is punctuated with random and unpredictable bursts of violence. Why are people so het up about Josh Brolin's anticlimactic fate? This ain't Sergio Leone - a conventional showdown would be as disruptively wrong as the third act of ""Juno"". Personally, it's Tommy Lee Jones who loses me - what's he on about? But that's more than balanced out elsewhere - by Javier Bardem, of course, and by the uncanny and eerily seedy production design, evoking a 1980 where an irreversible decay has already laid its killing roots."

""Fargo"" was much better. Maybe they gave it to the Coen brothers this time to atone for ""Fargo"". There were too few characters who were of little dimension and similar to each other. There was hardly any production design or production value. The story and screenplay can't be written better but is too simple to deserve such an honor.

","No Country for Old Men: Three out of Four Directed by the Coen Brothers, this intense roller coaster of a movie pulled the audience into a web and never let go. Although it's a simple thought story from a novel from the same title of Cormac McCarthy, the movie's themes are quite different from its simple plot. It deals with others fate, free will, and man's path of changing the course in one self. The film took a leisure pace constructing its theme with the characters'.<br/><br/>One-day a man named Llewelyn was hunting at the Rio Grande. He stumbled upon some trucks, which happened to be a drug deal gone wrong. Llewelyn found some heroin and two million dollars. While taking the money back home, he realized that there was a man still alive at the sight. Feeling guilty, he went back to the sight. When reaching to his destination, the gangster saw him and went after him. He then knew that he and his wife had to hide. The story unfolds toward another character Anton, a man who believes that their place and time are for a reason. His character uses the symbolism of a coin to represent life and death. Although hired by the organization to get the money, he went on a killing spree instead. Llewelyn, trying to keep Anton away, hides money in a motel. Llewelyn, being chased by this evil force, Anton, is trying to hide and escape. Another essential character is Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (played by Tommy Lee Jones). He is coming of age, losing his values through experiencing others violence, unable to explain criminals' actions, and coming to realize that some people cannot be explained. Caught in the tail end of Llewelyn's conflict, he tries to help Llewelyn get away from Anton, this force of evil that cannot be stopped. It's although Anton is a ghost that can't get caught.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin plays Llewelyn Moss. He's the character where you are placed. He is an average guy, married, and a simple man passing in time that deals with a very complex situation. Anton Chigurh, played by the very capable Javier Bardem, had very few words to speak on camera. Making up for a lack of words, his presence, body movements, expressions, and interactions with others made for an unsettling feeling.<br/><br/>Joel and Ethan Coen's use of very slick camera work, with both complex and simple shots, made for an intense ride. They used the atmosphere of the desert to show of things to come. The little details in the movie are what helped the film keep it's intense unsettling nature. An example is of when Llewelyn was at one of the motels, waiting for Anton at the door, and the shadows of Llewelyn and Anton's feet at the bottom of the door kept the scene intensely unsettling. The ending itself will leave many questions for viewers of why the Coen's ended the movie in the way they did. Some may find it a waste of time and others will like to debate its ending. There are many interpretations for it's ending and some people will watch it again and again for that reason."

","I really enjoyed this movie, but after thinking about it, there were too many similarities to Fargo and other Coen Brothers movies to give it a nine or ten, or for it to be considered a classic.<br/><br/>Much of the movie follows the same path as ""Fargo"". An offbeat law enforcement officer, a crime that escalates beyond what anyone could have imagined, and some quirky, ""everyman"" locals. But I don't find Chigurrh to be any scarier than the character played by Peter Storemare, and William Macy and Steve Buschemi added a humorous touch to ""Fargo"" that's missing from ""No Country"".<br/><br/>This movie basically follows the tried and true Coen Brothers template. It's a quality production, but lacks the originality that might have made it great."

","I saw this movie twice at the Belgrade film festival, and had very strange feelings after watching it. The first time i saw it, i was in a really bad mood, i felt the movie was painfully slow, sometimes boring, but i kinda wanted the story to last as long because it was strange and interesting. However, after the very end i had a feeling i missed something because it felt the movie had giant holes in the story. So, the second time (in a better mood) - completely different feel. The story was coherent (however i still found two BIG holes in the film, when Carson finds the satchel on the border, and when the hotel receptionist is shot), and the movie generally made sense. This is a minimalist thriller, packed with common folk philosophy about life, ""evil"" in today's life, problems of old age, and one man's influence on the world. There are some great, unusual feats in the movie, which makes it only better. 1) the music - there basically isn't any. The film uses real-life sounds to emphasize the tension (which has a big part in the film), and makes a few really memorable scenes. 2) long, static takes with views on the landscape and little dialogue, some people might not like it, i found it interesting here. 3) the film doesn't give you flat-out facts about the plot, if you watch it with your brain off, you'll probably miss something (like i did the first time), but yet doesn't require full mental capacity because the story isn't really complicated. I have only one remark (though it couldn't have been avoided by the filmmakers because the script is a direct book adaptation) - the Chigurh character should have been kept in the dark for at least the first part of the film, it would again emphasize the tension and the element of fear, as felt in the hotel eagle scene (remarkable)"

","I'm one of those who was mesmerized by this film from beginning to end. ""Juggernaut"" is the word that comes to me in describing the impact I felt. <br/><br/>You know from the very beginning that this will not be a happy ""feel good"" movie. Those who, like me, were heavily impressed by this movie, undoubtedly have the same morbid fascination. This is a bleak ""Nobody wins and only a fool would try to"" movie. <br/><br/>Possibly, the sanest character in this is the most psychotic appearing. He has a ""code"" of some sort and also some sort of a definition of justice while setting himself up as a judge of who is to live and who is to die, although it on occasion amuses him to let the flip of a coin determine a person's fate. <br/><br/>I'm writing this after only one viewing and that in itself isn't entirely fair. I would say that if you see this film, you will need to see it again, possibly several times. 2007 was a year of bleak films and that is possibly working against this one. Several films this year such as GONE BABY GONE, THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES, 3:10 TO YUMA, IN THE VALLEY OF ELAH among others leave one with a feeling of uselessness of life. And so in such a year, it's difficult to judge what is ""art"", what is ""honesty"" or what is ""truth"". <br/><br/>Again, this is a movie that must be seen before it can be judged, and even then may need to be seen several times before one can give a fair opinion."

Though filmed exactly in sequence from the book, the ending is a little dampening in the sense that it is not what we expected. However, this should not to take away the fantastic movie experience one gets out of watching this movie. The script and screenplay are tight and very well adapted to its core. Coen brothers again do wonders together. For a formative student who is learning movie making, watching the movie a couple of times would greatly help.<br/><br/>Among actors  Javier Bardem steals the show as a mean maniac killer.

"angelynx-2","9","1","5","26 January 2008"," Bleak, wrenching, haunting film
","This is a film that will make you ask some big questions. Questions like 'what creates people with no human feelings?' and 'what can one person do about the existence of true evil? is there anything? should one try?' Tommy Lee Jones' character, honest and decent Sheriff Ed Tom Bell, is a long-time lawman from a long line of lawmen, but the kinds of crime and criminals he faces these days have left him emotionally, mentally and spiritually exhausted and bewildered. (--Like, I dare say, a lot of us.) His helplessness in the face of the grisly handiwork of the superbly played, formal and ice-cold psychopath Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem--and I will throw things at the screen if he doesn't win Best Supporting Actor for this stunning performance) is for me the emotional bedrock of this movie. I know people are impressed by Josh Brolin in this film, and I agree he's good, but for me his performance had nowhere near the complexity and subtlety of either Jones' or Bardem's: one good man whose moral compass no longer gives him the guidance he needs, and one man so simply relentless that for him good and evil are decided by the toss of a coin. They're not so much adversaries as polar opposites, the forces of law and chaos playing against each other at a distance, and I'm glad the Coens didn't settle for some falsely conclusive confrontation between them. It's a movie that doesn't give answers because there may not be any, a movie with no winner or loser; a movie that sets these painful questions in a gorgeous southwestern landscape and just looks at them, and helps you look at them too.<br/><br/>I love the Coen Brothers' work (well, except for ""The Big Lebowski""), and I set this one right up on the shelf with their best. It's one I think no thoughtful person should miss."
"mr-selfdestructenator","10","1","5","19 January 2008"," The Best Film I've Seen In Years
","Powerful. Phenomenal. Dark. Thought provoking. These are just some of the words that describe No Country For Old Men. When the lights dimmed in the theater, I had no idea what I was about to see. Some people loved it, and some people hated it. The first half-hour of the film is slow and brutal, with minimal dialogue between characters. During those first thirty minutes about three people of the twenty-some that were there got up and left, so if you are looking for a fast-paced thrill-ride action film, don't bother seeing it. Not that there aren't parts that are tense, or that there's no action, it's just that these parts are separated by slower, less thrilling scenes. <br/><br/>No Country is done in much the same style as Fargo (another excellent Coen Brother's film). Though not near as much dialogue as Fargo, it reflects its grisly, dark style. Because of the grotesque and graphic nature of the film, I strongly recommend that you don't take your children (13 and under) to see it. The cast of No Country gives outstanding performances, and though sparse, the dialogue is often witty and always frank and to the point.<br/><br/>I can't recommend this film highly enough. It doesn't have the common Hollywood clichés, and the screenplay is just outstanding. See this film. Love it or hate it, you need to see it."

","I went into this movie with the highest of expectations, being a fan of the Coen bros and of several of the actors involved. This movie did not fail in any aspect of the those expectations. The movie examines basic and seemingly simple principles people have, one soon finds out however that things are not so simple. The backbone of this movie is Tommy Lee Jones, and while Bardem is the force that drives this movie Jones' character sheriff Ed Tom Bell really pulls everything together. Some people where disappointed with the ending and I can see where they are coming from but if you truly understand the movie the ending may not satisfy you but you will truly enjoy it. Bardem's performance and the principled psychopath Anton Chigurh will send chills through your body. Even when he is not on the screen you feel his presence weighing over not just the characters on screen but on your own mind as well.<br/><br/>Everything else fits in perfectly and makes this movie brilliant. The cinematography is flawless and the decision to go without a score adds to the already tremendous amount of suspense. The direction is of course brilliant as you would expect from the Coens. The screenplay which the Coens may in fact win an Oscar for is almost taken directly word for word from the novel, and why change something that is already perfect and I admire the Coens for not wavering from the book.<br/><br/>Please see this movie it will stay with you no matter if you think it is great as I do or if you simply think it is mediocre. Anton Chigurh will be in your mind for days to come. Call it friendo"

","I got to say... I had been waiting for this movie to come out for a long time. I had seen all the trailers and stuff for this movie and I couldn't wait. After seeing its reviews, I was expecting it to be either equal or better than their previous masterpiece, ""Fargo."" So when I first saw it with a friend, after I left the theater, I was so speechless. I felt somewhat disappointed and let down in a way. I stood speechless for about and hour without talking to my friend about it. Then I started talking about the film with my friend and we talked about some of the philosophical themes and motifs, and we when down into Biblical and mythological themes. After talking about the film constantly with my friend and thinking about the overall structure, style, and especially the ending. I realized that my disappointed and let down first impression of the film was exactly what the film was supposed to do. I literally had that heart-pounding feeling of the subtle but most sinister evil in the world, but I realized that my disappointed feeling made sense. Granted, I was expecting this to be an intensely done chase thriller with a deep meaning. But I just didn't realize how deep it actually got. So after thinking a long time about it, reading several critical reviews, and talking with friends about it, I concluded that this was a GREAT movie. It's hard for me to describe, but the film got so deep within me that it got under my skin into my heart. I haven't felt so in sync with a film since Apocalypse Now, American Beauty, or Raging Bull, which have made the ever most long lasting impressions on me. The core of darkness/horror in Apocalypse Now, the search for true beauty in the world in American Beauty, and completely painful downfall of a ruthless raging bull are all things that have touched me in so many ways, and the theme of the inevitably of death and the quiet/hidden, but ever sinister evil in the world in No Country for Old Men has made a permanent mark on me. The films that can do that are the ones that I love the most; the ones that make me WANT go as deep as possible to unravel its mysteries and intricacies. I just wanted to write this to get it out there, and I'd like to hear anyone's impression on the film (pro or con). I realize that for those who disagree that I haven't provided much facts or analysis on the film itself, but anyone who wants to start constructive criticism I'll be more than happy to contribute. By the way, I'm new, and I'd like to give people my list of favorite movies, just to understand something new about me. In no particular order:<br/><br/><ul><li>RagingBull - Apocalypse Now - Taxi Driver - The Godfather - The Third Man - Midnight Cowboy - Vertigo - American Beauty - On the Waterfront </li></ul><br/><br/>These aren't necessarily the films that I think are the best in the world, but these are the ones that just LOVE!!! Thanks for reading my post."
"fred-houpt","10","1","5","14 January 2008"," Astounding, jarring, jolting, deeply troubling
","As as big Coen brothers fan I had to go see it. Which I did last night on the big screen. I found myself walking out of the theater on trembling legs and queasy stomach. As a well crafted vehicle this is the Coen brothers finest achievement, even eclipsing the much lauded ""Fargo"".<br/><br/>I recall John Goodman's portrayal of a psychopathic killer in Barton Fink and how uncomfortable he made me feel; his hypnotically executed persona made your skin crawl.<br/><br/>In ""...old men""...Javier Bardem perhaps even surpasses Goodmans nightmarish and very frightening evocation of pure evil. Bardem lurches through the film and he reminds me now, when I think of it, of what I think the ""golem"" must have looked like. The ""Golem"" was a mythic creature, supposedly created by the Maharal of Prague in the 16'th century, in Prague. This creature was something that did not have a human soul but was sort of like a demon, conjured up and controlled by Kabbalistic means. In any case, Bardem looked like a demon who had not a single molecule of humanity in his blood.<br/><br/>There are several things that disturb when you watch. The need to make sense out of an action is what makes us humans rational. When you watch random and inscrutable acts of violence we are upset because it challenges our normative states. If you dwell on it, what is so off-setting is that this violence is so reminiscent of nightmares that scare us so badly we wake up in a heart pounding sweat. That's what you feel when you watch Bardem.<br/><br/>I read somewhere that Bardem is not an English speaker. If so, then perhaps he spoke all his lines phonetically. (I read the same of the two lead actors in ""Crouching Tiger..."" that they too did not speak the language of the film and they had to phonetically deliver the lines). Bardem's approach to his lines is to deliver them with a freaky coldness. His voice implies that he feels completely in control, completely sure of the outcome and not touched by any outcry from his victims. That he might kill randomly is something he cares nothing to notice. His character is a nightmarish ghoul come to life.<br/><br/>This is a very violent film and children should be protected from watching this at any time now or in the future. It is difficult enough for us adults to have our nerves jangled and shocked. This is a film with an excellent script, all actors working at their best, knowing, it would seem, that this was a momentous and very important undertaking.<br/><br/>Closing off for now, I would have to say that Tommy Lee Jones gives one of the most outstanding performances of his long career. What a fabulous actor's actor; our attention never leaves the baggy eyed face. That voice, so finely honed, so perfectly under his emotionally controlled output....we are in his grip. His grip is our conscience; the grip of Bardem is the grip of the unconscious. This film, this story is as about as disturbing as it gets. There is no resolution, but neither is there one when we awake from a traumatic nightmare. Not a film for the weak hearted or delicate nerves. A film that will haunt the mind for a long time. Not one I really want to see again too soon."
"vovazhd","9","1","5","5 January 2008"," Haunting investigation of humanity
","No Country for Old Men is the Coen brothers' adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel. It is a modern western about a man named Llewelyn Moss, who finds a suitcase full of two million dollars after stumbling onto the scene of a drug deal that resulted in the death of all but one thirsty man (who dies shortly after). Taking the money for himself, Moss is then chased by the Mexicans and private hit men (primarily Anton Chigurh) as he flees across the state. The story consists of many intriguing plot twists. It largely deals with dark themes and disturbing psychology.<br/><br/>The acting is great across the board. The most memorable character is Anton Chigurh, the main hit man that chases Moss. He is clearly psychopathic, but nobody is able to stop him from doing his job. A close second is Sheriff Ed Tom Bell, played by Tommy Lee Jones. He is a complete opposite of Chigurh. An aged veteran sheriff, he agonizes over the fact that he is unable to bring justice to the community, due to the fact that the criminals are much more adept (due to changing times).<br/><br/>The film creates an atmosphere that, during several moments, ranks among the greatest movies. The suspense centering around the inevitable encounters is reminiscent of the Godfather, but takes on a whole level because of the obvious mental derangement that is involved. An interesting feature is that the real plot ends about 80% through the film. After that, it feels like a free fall where the characters have no goal. And it ends suddenly, with several loose ends. But the beauty is that it is exactly what the film is about, adequately summed up by Sheriff Bell's decision about retirement at the end.<br/><br/>No Country for Old Men is among the best films of 2007. Although it will first need to face the test of time to see how it ranks among the all time greats, it certainly carries a lot of potential to secure a spot in history. Even if your hesitant about the genre or subject material, I recommend you watch this movie."

","I'm giving this film 9 out of 10 stars, because all the knowledgeable critics say this is a masterpiece, and I am an amateur reviewer with too much time on my hands, so what do I know? I may even post a second review once the dust in my brain settles......<br/><br/>I'm going to give one of my patented impressionistic reviews, random thoughts strung together by the sole coincidence of having sprouted from one individual brain! This film should have been a Western, rather than one set in c1980. I guess I'd have to ask Cormac McCarthy why he set the film in that era rather than something more suitable for the archetypes on display. It didn't have to be Mexican heroin, could have easily been some other contraband...but those were the choices made....<br/><br/>This is the first film that I have seen in a long while where certain audience members who actually come to movies to be entertained let off a chorus of ""boos"" as the film concluded with Tommy Lee Jones' somewhat droll and inconclusive narration. Life doesn't give us neat conclusions, so why should art be expected to? Too bad most high school lit classes teach us that good fiction has to have a beginning, middle and denouement that is satisfying to the reader/viewer! The Coens certainly do a great job of creating mood through their frame compositions, actors' direction, and quirky dialogue. And I do get Mr. Chigurh being a metaphor for unstoppable fate, and actually didn't have to read other reviews to understand this.<br/><br/>Bardem delivers a performance and character on par with Hannibal Lector.<br/><br/>Even though the Coens are playing with Western archetypes, they do leave room for the truly original. The set piece pitbull chase through the Rio Grande is well done, not scary to the audience mind you, though the audience can feel Mr. Brolin's fear as the beast approaches.<br/><br/>The selling of clothes is another metaphor that crops up repeatedly in this movie, through a number of characters. An assumption of identity, a reaching out for intimacy or caring? I'm not sure, but then art is supposed to push one's mind and leave room for ambiguity and multiple interpretations, rather than something that is paint-by-numbers and predictable.<br/><br/>Whatever the time setting, the Coens have succeeded in re-creating a mythical story with spiritual overtones, and a setting that is very disturbing, occasionally original, but hardly a crowd-pleaser. I look forward to the day when the Coens elevate their art further by telling an original story, not one written by another novelist. But this is an American film, where directors are interpreters of other people's 'material' rather than original storytellers...but I think Joel and Ethan Coen have it in them. Practice makes perfect!"

Things get set in motion when the poor man stumbles upon some dead bodies, a stash of drugs, and a loot of two million dollars that he decides to try and keep for himself, but unfortunately this makes him the target of the killer who tracks him expertly while leaving a jarringly brutal signature of violence and mayhem everywhere he goes. It's up to the weary local sheriff to try and resolve the crisis before it's too late.

","No Country for Old Men - This was one, like Babel last year, that everyone was raving about but the hype ended up being more than the film was worth. Well that's not totally fair. I LOVED the first half of this movie. Intense, minimalistic, and fantastic acting from Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem (who probably deserves an Oscar nomination at least for playing evil the likes of which I have not seen since the T-1000). Javier plays Anton Chigurh, a hit-man stricken with pure evil.<br/><br/>See it for Bardem, but about halfway through do yourself a favor and let the first half of the movie stay in your mind and forget that there's an end to the film (There isn't really. It's become the style to let films just float off like kites rather than give them a definitive or interesting ending, like the other film released a month ago, Before the Devil Knows Your Dead) The riveting first half of No Country involves a cat and mouse game. It is engaging, suspenseful, and a treat to watch.<br/><br/>The final third of the movie is cold, detached, and feels rushed, like a few missing reels were taken out of the film. Everyone keeps talking about ""an end"", ""how the confrontation is going to end"". Then they pick up right after the ""end"". What the hell? I thought for a second they had skipped a real. I liked the first half of the film, but kept waiting for the amazing reason this film is freaking 15 on IMDb's top 250. I did not see a reason. Fans of the Coen brothers are likely to enjoy this. I haven't seen Fargo so I can't comment. But I do know that the writer's strike must be working on some level if this is the sort of film the critics are looking to now as possibly the Best Film of the Year. I was really looking forward to this one, but the Hype was stronger than the end result. Maybe a second viewing will improve my feelings towards it.<br/><br/>B"

","The acting was fantastic, the scenes of the countryside were breathtaking, the dialog was great in places, with authentic idiomatic touches (I'm from the southwest and it was very familiar sounding). However, the plot became boring to my husband and me, because except for a few scenes, the violent tone was so monotonously uniform and the extreme tension so almost continuously relentless that the effect was to render us numb by about half way through. As a result we ceased really caring what happened.<br/><br/>There is very little thematic subtlety or complexity. Good man (sherriff) is pursuing Bad man (psychopath) who is killing everyone who gets in his way while he is pursuing Everyman (combination-of-good-and-evil).<br/><br/>The overall effect of the plot thus seemed to us about as entertaining as watching a 2 hour documentary of a shark picking off shipwreck victims one by one. I gave it a 7 only because the acting is so first-rate."
"rabrenner","7","1","5","15 December 2007"," No Country For Satisfying Resolution
","The first three quarters of NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN are great. It contains all the elements we have come to expect from Coen brothers movies: quirky characters, colorful dialogue, grotesque/comical violence, sharp editing, etc. Javier Bardem turns in an instant classic performance as psychopathic killer Anton Chigurh. (He reminded me a little bit of Alan Arkin's character in WAIT UNTIL DARK. Coincidence?) But then it goes off the rails. After steadily building up to a final violent showdown between good guy Josh Brolin and bad guy Bardem, the Coen brothers perversely refuse to, ahem, pull the trigger: Brolin is killed off screen (!), and world-weary sheriff Tommy Lee Jones always just misses Bardem. Bardem is badly injured in a random car accidentis God punishing him? and if so, for whathaving a bad haircut?but limps away to kill again another day. I'm sure this is suppose to say something deep about the senselessness of violence, and our complicity as voyeurs, but it does not, alas, make for a satisfying ending."

","Over a decade later, No Country for Old Men is the perfect companion to the Coens' 1996 masterpiece. Both films boil down to the tragic consequences of desperate measures people will take out of greed, and both are hilarious all along the way. Set in the 1980s, a time before internet and cell phones, Fargo and No Country follow the paths of characters on both sides of the law. Parallel scenes in each film involve murder investigations by the local law enforcement as they attempt to make sense of the mess; however, the body count is much higher in No Country. Each film displays the problem with everyday men trying to be criminals; they make a lot of mistakes. The white plains of Minnesota winter has become the tan Texas desert, but surroundings match the outlook of both films spot-on: bleak.<br/><br/>With No Country, the Coens' writing is at its best ever with top-notch dialogue and unconventional plot structure, but as much credit, if not more, is due to their collaborator, novelist Cormac McCarthy. This film is the first official novel adaptation for the Coens, and it was definitely a good move on their part. It's the sort of story you get thrown into, and before you realize what's hit you, you're on a bloody, unpredictable ride.<br/><br/>Chief Gunderson's optimism in Fargo gives that film a dash of hope, but No Country is as dark and hopeless as they come. The cynicism is all seen in Sheriff Bell's face (Tommy Lee Jones) as he stands in the morgue staring at a body, don't worry, I'm not going to spoil anything here. As the titular 'old man,' the shot is obviously meant to show just how wrinkled Jones has become in his old age. There are hard lines under his eyes, and the skin sags off his cheeks. He's seen enough."

it's doing good so far! but now you may ask why i gave it 6...it's because there's something missing here...i wonder what it is...
Story:???
it can't be a good movie if it doesn't have at least a decent story but in this movie there isn't any {and i wonder why they have gotten academy award for best writing adapted screenplay}... it falls flat in many ways as other reviewers said, the dialogues are just meaningless cuz you feel that the characters are a bit retarded except for the antagonist.So...here you have it."

","I finally got around to watching this one last night, and found myself bemused/confused.<br/><br/>The good bits first.<br/><br/>Unlike other reviewers, I really liked the way Tommy L Jones portrayed the sheriff. I also liked the mix up of Texan rural and urban settings. I thought the main characters dialog with his girlfriend was very good - so 'back blocks Texan' (to a non Texan like me).<br/><br/>So far it's an 8 out of 10.<br/><br/>Now the confusing/bemusing.<br/><br/>Okay I get it. The Uber baddie mows down everyone between him and the money, plus everyone who sees his face. Erm, wait? No he mows down SOME of the people who see his face; sparing the trailer park hag, the accounts guy and the two kids on bikes. Yep, go it - not.<br/><br/>The Uber baddie packs a silenced shotty - all good. Now why on earth would he choose to also wander round with a compressed air cylinder to power up his captive bolt air gun? It adds to the screenplay ... how? <br/><br/>Now we come to the good Mr Harrelson. Is this a case of a fine job of portraying a totally redundant character? Am I wrong? Just what did that undoubtedly expensive actor's character add to the plot, other than; being hired, speaking to the lead character, and then getting shot? You tell me.<br/><br/>The ending? I fiddled with the remote for ten minutes (that I'll never get back) assuming, like a fool, that I had somehow missed the penultimate scene. I'd prefer to believe that the editor sold that reel on eBay, rather than accept that a director, a producer and/or a writer would allow an actual, real movie to end like that.<br/><br/>It's a three out of ten from me, primarily as it gave me an excuse not to clean the house for 90 minutes or so. And yes, as others have mentioned, Tommy's ears are downright HUGE these days."

"gradyharp","10","1","6","16 March 2008"," 'To this we've come'
","Cormac McCarthy's novel NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN has been successfully transformed into a film in the skilled hands of Ethan and Joel Coen. The story is intact, the characters are given the dialog so uniquely McCarthy's invention, and the horror of the message of the book - that we have come to a point in time when crime, especially random murder, surrounds our lives - is, if anything, even more pungent than on the pages of the book. It is an amazing, and a highly disturbing movie, and while this viewer is one of the few who does not believe it deserved the Oscar for Best Picture, there is little doubt that it is a brilliant piece of cinema.<br/><br/>The story is fairly simple: on the raw plains of Texas a slaughter of men and dogs engaged in a drug deal is discovered by a simple guy Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin). Moss observes the mayhem, sees the drugs, finds the 2 million dollar payoff money, takes the money, and embarks on an escape, leaving his wife Carla (Kelly Macdonald) to escape the pursuit of a mad killer Chigurh (Javier Bardem) who in turn is being pursued by the local sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) and a hired hit-man (Woody Harrelson). The satchel of money contains a tracking device and Chigurh has the instrument necessary to follow the trail the device leads. The remainder of the film is the pursuit both in Texas and in Mexico, accompanied by countless brutal murders of all sorts by the crazed Chigurh, until a surprise ending.<br/><br/>But the toughest part of this violent film is more in the discussion of shared philosophies between the sheriff and his old cronies: they reflect on the sad state of universal crime that is so different and more malevolent than in the 'old days'. The conversations, in the superb dialog of these old men, bring our attention to some realities we would rather not confront, and those realities are even more disturbing than the repeated images of bloated bodies and senseless murders that fill the screen. Jones, Brolin, and Bardem are indeed superb in their roles, but the small cameos of the townsfolk of Texas are little gems of acting and direction. This is a difficult film to watch because of all of the violence, but the message is one we must heed. We may be allowing the creation of 'no country for any men'. Grady Harp"
"lambiepie-2","10","1","6","15 March 2008"," A film that leaves an impression
","No Country for Old Men by the Cohen Brothers is one of the best films of 2007 hands-down. This book adaptation was made for these two brothers to do, and I am awfully glad they did. All of the Cohen's styling were here, and that's what made this film the most horrific, 'down-home', violent, film of the year.<br/><br/>Like everyone else, the performance of Javier Bardem was extraordinary - scary, evil, horrific and just plain old gives you the chills like no other psychopathic murderer in film. Josh Brolin's was wonderful as the character of Llewellen finding the money also presents one with a dilemma - ""what would you do if you found 2 million in cash?"". But after this film I know exactly what I would have done, and that was leave the money where it was! And finally, Tommy Lee Jones as the Sheriff is also worth much note and accolades for his portrayal was exemplary. Many folks felt robbed of 'the ending' but let me say, I found it appropriate and...artistic. That's what I loved about this film. The Cohen's could have taken the ""easy way out"" at the end, but instead, they presented us with a different take - one that really works and leaves you discussing the film even after the credits start to roll.<br/><br/>No Country for Old Men had me doing something I rarely do at films: Talk to the screen. I was really scared for some characters, afraid for others and on the edge of my seat - many times. This was a truly good film."
"rlhaag","10","1","6","15 March 2008"," The Coen Brothers continue to exceed!
","I finally had the chance to watch this movie by buying the DVD. It was a great addition to my collection of Fargo, O' Brother where Thou. This movie is shockingly good. One of things I would like to point out is the actors uncanny ability to replicate real behavior of Texans and Mexican's I have lived in New Mexico and have friends who are native Texans. Obivously, Tommy Lee Jones being born in Texas was a natural but Woody Harrelson's performance was so good that I wished he would have more screen time. Josh Brolin the concept of him on the screen portraying a roughneck welder was a natural. However, I must not forget Javier Barden. So rare you find a character that so determined to stay with his basic but complicated principals of life it was a real. Details are everything to me in seeing a movie. This movie does not disappoint. It was an easy stretch to believe this movie was set in 1980. Where on earth did they find those Black and White TV's? Even the gun's were from the early 1980's No glocks here. I wonder what this movie would look like in Black and White. Would it have shown the bleakness in the countryside, where the first murder scene was shown. Comparetivley speaking, the setting of the movie in rural Texas gave me the same kind of desolate feeling that when I watched the Last Picture Show. In closing, the acting I feel was this movies strongest suit. Of course the directors has a lot to do with it."

","This viewpoint contains spoilers.<br/><br/>The day before the Oscars, we went see No Country for Old Men against my instinct to see There Will be Blood first.<br/><br/>The first half of the film was so slow that I was incredibly bored. The outcomes of each situation were treated with such meticulous care that they were obvious long before they happened. Then the film shifted into unpredictability and some obscurity.<br/><br/>The acting was fine, although the businessman? bounty hunter/ DEA agent, (No one is sure who he was) and the wife's mother were played for satire rather than seriousness.<br/><br/>The feel of the eighties in that place (South Texas) were excellent, the cinematography was excellent, the absence of any mood music handled well, (although, as an opera fan and a believer that films inherit more from opera than drama, I found it contributed to first my boredom and then to my emotional detachment), and the editing both in the particular sequences and the way in which sequences were alternated was very good.<br/><br/>The music-less sound, frequently creating mood with the sound of breathing should win an Oscar by itself.<br/><br/>I disliked the film. I was never surprised by it. Unlike my wife, who jumped a few times, I found myself as detached as the psychopath, although reminded at times of the gorier aspects of my work.<br/><br/>God damn-it! I like to be moved by a movie. To laugh and cry and feel an aching sorrow where I cannot control my emotions. A movie should be cathartic in some way, even if by the ridiculous as in Dumb and Dumber.<br/><br/>What a bummer that Saturday was. And then after-wards we had planned to see Juno, but the time was all wrong and we went to a bookshop next door instead, where I skimmed through the novel of the film, which was just as bad, but pretentious as well.<br/><br/>I know it's the film of the book, but I said the opposite as a sort of expression of crankiness.<br/><br/>The film's popularity expands from the notion of moderns that there is no room for we ancients.<br/><br/>The only parts I really enjoyed were with Tommy Lee Jones and Tess Harper and there was not much of them. The wife, Kelly something was also very watchable.<br/><br/>I thought Bardem over hyped, vivid, but not daring and Brolin was just a cypher.<br/><br/>Just one more note about the film: It was memorable.<br/><br/>A feeling of grumpiness about two film makers that I really admire still annoys me. Fargo is an incomparably better film on similar themes."

","When it ended, I was the only one in a crowded theater with accepting it was a decent movie, everyone was just hoping they would have just gone to another movie. And I find it interesting because I'm a movie aficionado and I make an effort beyond regular public to understand the whole movie. It certainly has bright and cool moments, metaphors and stuff to reflection about, but overall it's extremely boring to follow. Most characters don't make any sense at all, and they seem to be mocking Texas people more than developing a plot. And guess what, it could have been developed much better, but instead it just ends and they focus in some subplot no one cares about. I seriously doubt everyone enjoys this movie at an average of 8.5/10 (03/11/2008). Maybe the rating is there because only aficionados care enough to rate a movie on an internet site. This is definitely not that good. I also have a theory some people make an extra effort to like it because it won some awards and some respected critics liked it, so they want to get along. Then, and only then, you can put aside all the flaws and unnecessary boring parts of this movie, you can see it as a great movie. For me, this is not acceptable. The movie is just OK for me, the rest of my family thinks is one of the worst they've seen."

","Before I watch a movie, I always have to read what the critics are saying or what other people are saying. That is what got me to watch the movie in the first place. I don't understand why this film is getting so much praise and acclaim. I guess I'm too dumb to understand the artistry in a lot of the films similar to this; high praise from movie critics, yet I am in disagreement. I do agree with a lot of the critics with other movies, this one in particular just isn't one of them. It started off really well, lots of action and violence, which you really can't go wrong with. It was sort of like a modern day western, very believable story. For the most part the movie was doing well, and I was seeing what the critics were seeing; good acting, good picture, etc. Until the last twenty minutes. It was a total nightmare, very unpredictable, which is what you want in a film, but this was a complete 180 from where I was expecting it to go. I understand that this movie was based off the book, which was probably the downfall for me."
"agmoldham","6","1","6","5 February 2008"," A classic Coen movie
","The Coen's have been around for over 20 years now and whilst they may not be prolific they certainly have a string of fine movies. Like most artists there is certainly a Coen trademark on ""No Country for Old Men"". Anybody that has seen Blood Simple and Fargo will certainly not be surprised by the content or style of the movie. The Coen movies tend to have a bit of a contradiction. The films normally feature extremely psychotic characters and a high body count and yet the style of the films is very underplayed. In some ways the extraordinary becomes ordinary and maybe that is one of the objectives of the directors.<br/><br/>Anyway as mentioned this is another fine film and quite happily sits alongside their great movies of the past. In the acting stakes Tommy Lee Jones and Kelly Macdonald stand out, but the performances all round are excellent."
"Chris_Docker","9","1","6","3 February 2008"," Coens displaying their powers
","No Country For Old Men is almost like one of those Zen sayings. A frantic chase where nothing happens very quickly. A puzzle where the question is more meaningful than the answer. That sort of thing.<br/><br/>As if to disprove the title, old man Tommy Lee Jones is very comfortable, thank you. He's Sheriff Bell. Takes everything in his stride. The rolling hills of the Texan border country. The challenges of living close to the land. The bad hombres. He's seen it all. He is the land  it can't get one up on him.<br/><br/>Everyone one else has yet to reach this exalted state of initiation.<br/><br/>Like Llewelyn Moss, who stumbles on a large number of banknotes, cocaine and people who have ceased living. The bodies died naturally  at least in the noir-ish vernacular of the movie. Natural to their line of work. As attested by the large number of bullet holes.<br/><br/>Or Anton Chigurh, the most philosophical of our characters. He hunts down prey with less room for mistakes than The Terminator. He is completely at peace with what he does. And human too  sometimes he will give a victim a chance to life based on the flip of a coin.<br/><br/>Now Carson Wells is above all this. He wears a nice suit and talks like a senator when he goes about his clean-up business. Messy details like Anton being his business.<br/><br/>Carla, thankfully, is quite human. And quite worried  if not a little excited  when husband Llewelyn suggest they will be better off - with the two million dollars he happened to find when out hunting. But who is better at keeping promises  loving hubby or homicidal Anton?<br/><br/>No Country for Old Men is the Coen Brothers at the height of their film-making powers. Although the story is superb, we are held in suspense for the end of each double entendre. Was it a true story? At one point the sheriff, to inspire Carla to help him, tells her an unlikely but rousing tale about some neighbours. Later on though, she begins to doubt and asks him if it was a true story. ""I couldn't swear to every detail,"" he tells her kindly. Then, with a bit more of a glint in his eye, ""But it's certainly true that it is a story."" If the story and dialogue are arresting, the photography is even more so. We watch with fascination as Anton calmly and methodically does something with balls of cotton. What is he up to? The camera works in loving detail, framing each action in close-up. The result will probably be hilarious or horrific. We are dying to know which, but we have to wait for the camera to tell us in its own good time. Llewelyn is just as mysterious hunting down some tent poles. The hardware store kindly offers to order the correct ones for his tent, but we know he wants them now. Desperately. Realising he's not going to get any, he asks for a tent instead. What sort of tent? The one with the most tent poles of course . . .<br/><br/>This Coen-esqe humour continues unabated throughout. It is supported by characterisation and acting that is little short of awesome. Javier Bardem (Anton) is the year's best psychopath. Woody Harrelson always brightens up a movie by the sheer force of his personality. But if there is a flaw it is maybe a lack of emotional substance. One comes out of the film dazzled by the technical perfection, trying to remember the jokes, recalling favourite scenes and the way everything was framed as if in a masterclass. But it could have benefited, I felt, by more warmth. The glow that Frances McDormand brought to Fargo. Or the lip-synching of George Clooney in O Brother Where Art Thou that made you want to jump out of your seat and join in.<br/><br/>Non-cinephiles may feel it is a bit too self-consciously artistic for a crime story. Why can't they just tell the tale instead of breaking their backs to be witty? And what exactly happened at the end? Film fans will adore this movie. A few people will wonder why they spent two hours watching it.<br/><br/>I hope I've helped you decide whether it's for you or not."

","Unlike some other posters, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie because, among other things, you have to actually think about what's going on (in my case, I didn't figure some things out until I was thinking about it on the way home, which was OK by me) and the ending is unexpected (also OK by me).<br/><br/>If you just forget it's a Coen brothers flick, go in with an open mind, and expect to have to think a little, you'll be pleasantly surprised (in more ways than one).<br/><br/>I don't deny there are parts that don't make a lot (or even a little) sense, but overall I don't believe these take away from the story. Kind of like westerns where six shooters are fired 12 or 15 times without reloading...that kind of stuff.<br/><br/>This is not a date movie to be seen by teenagers for fun (not most teens, anyway), but if you want to sit and watch a movie that has your attention all the way through (OK, there are a very few slow spots), go see this one.<br/><br/>Love it or hate it, you'll be thinking about it long after it's over.<br/><br/>In my case, I rarely (maybe twice in my 52 years) see a movie more than once in a theater, but I'm going to see this one again."
"MOscarbradley","10","1","6","26 January 2008"," ... or young men, either.
","Anyone who despaired of the Coen Brothers after ""Intolerable Cruelty"" and ""The lady-killers"" need worry no longer; they have returned, not just to their finest form, but perhaps with their finest film. This time they have gone to an established work of fiction, unlike previous original screenplays, although it seems to me Cormac McCarthy's novel was written for them. In many respects this is a perfect companion piece to their own ""Fargo"", (they would make a splendid double-bill); they both deal in cold-hearted killers, in botched crimes, they both have a philosophical sheriff whose wisdom, nevertheless, seems to emanate from fortune-cookies and they share the same grisly sense of humour. For while ""No Country for old Men"" is a palm-sweatingly, seat-edgingly exciting movie from its opening shot, it is also very funny in that very dark Coen Brothers fashion.<br/><br/>The story is simplicity itself and there isn't a single lean moment in the film or a single redundant shot in sight. Josh Brolin is the trailer-trash hunter who stumbles on a drugs deal gone horribly wrong. The dealers have massacred each other leaving a suitcase of money behind. Brolin skips off with the dough pursued by Javier Bardem's psycho-killer while Tommy Lee Jones is the sheriff caught somewhere in the middle. So it's a road movie and a chase movie from the word go and it's unbearably tense, yet it transcends the formulaic restrictions of the thriller genre to become something of a meditation on the savagery of human nature. Bardem kills not because he has to but because he wants to; killing is almost ingrained in his bone marrow. Jones wants to pull out of his job as a law enforcer because he feels the law can no longer be enforced. He has become despairing for his country and for those who inhabit it.<br/><br/>None of this is treated in any way heavy-handedly by the Coens but with humour and an entertainer's brio. Sure, they make us think but not at the expense of a good tale well told. You hang on every word and you wait expectantly on the next set of events to unfold and when Bardem's on screen you really do feel the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end. His is a superb performance, showy certainly but full of subtleties and unexpected little twists as well and he is matched both by Brolin's weary hunter and Jones' even wearier sheriff. But then, as in all of the Coen's films, all the performances down to the tiniest part are beautifully judged and played. This could turn out to be the most deserving Best Picture winner in years."
"frankenbenz","10","1","6","24 January 2008"," Top of the Coen's already impressive heap.
","So much more than a mere genre pic, the Coen Brother's No Country For Old Men is a masterpiece buoyed by sparse dialog, restrained performances, stark imagery and endless volumes of subtext.<br/><br/>Without a doubt this is the Coen's most mature and accomplished film to date, an impressive feat considering how many great films are already behind them. What makes NCFOM so rewarding is the Coen's willingness to paint outside the lines, to throw convention on its ear and to remind audiences that the greatest movies always leave you with more questions than answers.<br/><br/>After watching this film six times, I'm as captivated by it now as I was during the first viewing. Because NCFOM is so dense and so subtle, seeing it again has allowed me to pick up all the little pieces, confirming how tightly constructed, thought out and perfectly executed this film is. One particular scene, Llewelyn Moss' (Josh Brolin) death scene, caused a debate between a friend and myself. He felt cheated, arguing the Coen's had mistakenly left the footage of the actual killing on the cutting room floor. There was no doubt in my mind they never shot the scene for if they had it would have betrayed one of the principal themes woven into the story. I haven't read Cormac McCarthy's novel of the same name, but I know his work well enough to safely assume this ending fits into his fixation with unrelenting realism. In other words, in real life you don't always get the money shot since you never know when its going to come (no pun intended).<br/><br/>In defense of my argument I cited the scene previous to Sheriff Bell's (Tommy Lee Jones) discovery of the freshly killed Moss. In this scene Moss' impending doom is foreshadowed when the girl at the pool asks him what he keeps looking out the window for. He answers ""lookin' for what's coming"" and she shoots back ""but no one ever sees that.""<br/><br/>The entire film is peppered with references to fate/destiny and the road that leads you there. Most telling is Anton Chigurh, brilliantly brought to life by Javier Bardem, who is obsessed with fate. When pitted against Moss' wife Carla Jean (Kelly Macdonald), Chigurh's frustration is stapled to his face when she refuses to let his coin decide if she should live or die. The very next scene, a surprise car crash that bludgeons Chigurh, is yet another reference to the universe blindsiding you at any moment's notice.Prior to Carla Jean's meeting with the Grim Reaper, Sheriff Bell tells her the bogus story about the guy who gets messed up by the dead steer: ""even in the contest between man and steer...the issue's not certain."" He then tells her about how air guns are now used to kill steer and they no longer know what hits 'em. The epilogue proves to be the final brush stroke, using Bell's dream to articulate the one and only absolute: that, one day, we'll all be dead.<br/><br/>For once the Academy awarded the best film and best directing Oscars to the film and filmmakers most deserving. Time will tell, but I'm confident future generations will not debate this choice...in fact, I'm sure NCFOM will go down in history as one of the best films ever made. Now that it's on DVD, I look forward to many more viewings in the weeks, months and years to come.<br/><br/>http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/"

","The screenplay and acting capture the sinister cruelty and suspense of Cormac McCarthy's fine novel. While not his best work, this film complements it well, with a standout performance from Javier Bardem, and solid ones from the rest of the cast (although I do not know why Woody Harrelson's character was included, as it added little to the plot, outside of some backstory). Tommy Lee Jones was born to play the lawman in this film, and I am hard pressed to imagine anyone else doing it. What is particularly refreshing about this effort is its unconventional treatment of good and evil, with just enough dialog on the subject to let you ponder it yourself without being hit over the head with the director's viewpoint. While quite violent, that never felt gratuitous, at least to me. My belief in reality was never asked to be suspended, a thing for which I was very grateful, as far too many directors/writers make that request without much regard for a viewer's willingness or ability. On the whole, I highly recommend this film, and may well pay the theater price to see it again."

","Or Kissing your Cousin. Use whichever cliché best describes the final thirty minutes of this film. Some of the most deflating and frustrating minutes you will have on this earth. But let's start at the beginning so you understand why. <br/><br/>No Country for Old Men is Set-up as a taut, B-movie thriller with a mad man on the loose trying to track down his stolen money from a guy way in over his head. The killer Cigurgh even has a gimmicky way of getting into people's houses and a cool gun. That it aspires to so much more in its first 3/4 is a true testament to the style and wit the Coens display when they get behind a project. The problem is that the excitement and promise of a final showdown is put aside literally in order to make some points about world weariness. According to a friend who read the original book -that's how the novel ended too. Yet after watching the mind-blowingly awesome set-up, you wish the Coens would have realized what their movie needed and not what the novel demanded they do. Because it wasn't just a matter of choosing the ending, the problem lies in how it was executed and how they integrated switching narrative perspectives. <br/><br/>What starts as a thriller eventually becomes a campfire story about the boogeyman and the people too tired and too world weary to stop him. <br/><br/>You can't have your cake and eat it too. But there are far worse things to be than daring and ambitious. And nothing the movie does wrong is a deal breaker. I still recommend it. <br/><br/>No one but the Coens can make a candy wrapper look so menacing."

"The_Amazing_Spy_Rises","10","1","6","21 November 2007"," The Coen Brothers craft a masterpiece with the help of a terrifying Javier Bardem.
","Here we have 'No Country for Old Men', a perfectly assembled drama that has Coen Brothers written all over it, yet at the same time retaining the spirit of the novel. Joel and Ethan Coen weave the stories of three men together with seamless ease and expert touch. Gripping photography and 3 outstanding performances take 'No Country' to the upper echelon of all time films and the top spot for 2007.<br/><br/>Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) is hunting one day in the western outback, only to stumble upon a massive stash of drugs, more dead bodies than he'd know what to do with, and most importantly, $2,000,000. Little does he know, ruthless and psychotic killer Anton Chigurh(Javier Bardem) is following his tracks.<br/><br/>I still cannot get over the incredible performance of Javier Bardem, who gives the truly scariest performance I have ever seen. It'll be a travesty if he is not at least nominated for an Oscar. He embodies the very idea of evil and soulless, taking on a character who has almost eery similarities to the Holy Ghost. It is an iconic villain. Most villains you can watch and almost root for, but this is a performance so utterly scary that he will make you move back into your seat, almost wanting to run away. It's kind of ironic that he bases his kill decisions on a coin flip, when Tommy Lee Jones, who played Batman nemesis Two Face (who did the same thing), is also in the film. Jones is also terrific, though not as prolific as Bardem (no one this year has been). Jones has a great character...a truly good man dedicated to doing the right thing, yet he is tired. This role really allows Jones to stretch a different acting muscle, and it's one of the best performances of his career. The true surprises of the film are the lesser knowns Josh Brolin and Kelly Macdonald. Brolin's character didn't seem very deep at first, but Brolin (he has the most screen time) takes it and turns Moss into a very likable and admirable hero. Great performance...he should get some votes come Oscar season. Kelly Macdonald...where did her Scottish accent go? She swaps it for a southern accent here and it totally works. The true depth of her performance really isn't realized until the end (whereas with Bardem, he terrifies you the minute you see him).<br/><br/>The Coen Brothers have made a wonderful film that deserves to go down as one of the best of all time. The shots are real, the scenery is brilliant. The atmosphere created by these remarkable brothers is great. They even manage to insert some comedy into the film in the denouement. Woody Harrelson's character does most of the work. They are taking film-making to a whole new level with 'No Country for Old Men'. You should see this film as soon as you can."
"RJGodin2","6","1","6","20 November 2007"," very good but too long
","The Coens craft another excellent study in the randomness and ruthlessness of crime but this time they should have used a little more knife.<br/><br/>The entire section involving 'Carson Wells' could be cut with no significant impact to the movie. This would take the run time down to somewhere around a tight 90 minutes and greatly improve the overall effect.<br/><br/>Also, the lack of closure while daring does not produce a good ending. Unlike 'Blood Simple' or 'Fargo' where bad things happen to bad people, 'No Country' just ends with characters going on (or not)."
"annoman","Null","1","6","19 November 2007"," The best of the Coens since 'Blood Simple' and 'Fargo'
","Joel and Ethan Coen created one of American cinema's landmark films in 1996the superbly atmospheric, very bloody, and painfully hilarious 'Fargo', which cemented their elevated status in Hollywood. Sinceaside from 'The Big Lebowski' and their characteristically moody noir, 'The Man Who Wasn't There'the two have danced around their obvious forte with films like 'O Brother', 'Intolerable Cruelty', and 'The Ladykillers'. As you'll hear or read all too much about No Country, it's truly a reflection of their greatest works, and it's perhaps their most engrossing and dangerous one yet.<br/><br/>In the Coens' guileless and forthright screen version of Cormac McCarthy's 2005 acclaimed novel, Josh Brolin puts in another great performance in his second of two films released within a month of each other ('American Gangster' was released on November 2) as Llewelyn Moss, a welder and inhabitant of a small Texas town who stumbles across an apparent drug-deal gone sournearly a half-dozen bodies, an equal number of bullet-sprayed pick-ups, a truck bed-full of unclaimed drugs, $2 million in cash, and a near-death Mexican who begs him for aquawhile out hunting. He claims the money for himself (as anyone would) and heads back to his humdrum trailer, where he's bombarded with inquiries by his concerned wife, Carla Jean (Kelly Macdonald).<br/><br/>Later that night, he returns to the bloody site with a jug of water, wherein addition to learning that the only left survivor is now deadhe is shot at and chased by a vicious canine into a streaming river close by. When he staggers to safety, drenched, exhausted and wounded, unbeknownst to him he is now the subject of a plethora of pursuers, most notably Sheriff Bell (played very well by the baggy-eyed Tommy Lee Jones) and a mysterious and terrifying killer named Anton Chigurh, whose murders are provoked by anything from pre-designated assignments to random encounters tothis is greata coin flip (in which case he asks unaware civilians to ""call it"" for their right to live).<br/><br/>Javier Bardem ('The Sea Inside') is given the part of Chigurh, an unyielding psychopath whose moral principles rival Hitler's. He is the epitome of evilemotionless, nonnegotiableand is absolutely horrifying to even think about. Chigurh is so ominous on his own, in fact, that the Coens don't even bother telling us his name until the last half of the film's final actand by then we've learned why: because any who knew it are already dead. Bardem's portrayal of the murderous villain is as dark and scrupulous as his character (it could garner an Oscar nod), and is one of the most memorable of any in Hollywood history. With the support of his accompanying cast (which also includes Woody Harrelson as Carson Wells, a smug conciliator for the drug cartel from which the payoff slips away), Bardem drives this film far past one of the best offerings of recent years and qualifies it as an all-time classic and one of the Coen brothers' best, alongside 'Blood Simple' and 'Fargo'.<br/><br/>I'm not saying 'No Country' is the greatest movie everit's not, at allbut it does to viewers what few films can: it makes them wary and fearful of the world's very darkest realities. Through the desolate presentation of the Old West (captured impeccably by veteran cinematographer Roger Deakins), and an ingeniously sparse score by Carter Burwell, viewers are given the opportunity to live in the story itself. Though, upon sight of Anton Chigurh, they quickly appreciate their existence as it is: in a movie theater, frozen still and blown away."

The final scene is when Ed Bell's wife is blandly looking over the table at him, brings down the curtain. He is all out of action. The action figures in the story,(plot integrity is unessential) have played their hands, and there is no where to go; like Steinbeck's case for ""westering"", after the men came to the edge and ran out of land, or Sam the Lion in The Last Picture Show talking about the land, or like the hired killer in The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, when the victim offers to pay him ""more"" than the man who hired him. The killer takes the money and kills the man anyway because he always ""finishes the job."" There are long quiet spaces punctuated by gunfire, Sergio Leone-like. The characters are a mix of gods and demigods. The more mortal you are the more tenuous your place. I would have had Carla Jean shoot Chigurh, just for laughs. Not enough laughs in this picture for all the process, tent poles and hiding the bag of money, and the transponders wrapped in a wad of one dollar bills? Remember process in Night and Fog? That had more laughs."
"Horror-yo","5","1","7","1 June 2016"," Extremely overrated, good first half average overall action flick
","Unfortunately in a review it is essential to talk about the movie's terribly over-exaggerated positive reception, rather than just the movie in itself. The pretentious pseudo-intellectual clique has done it again: they've taken a terribly flawed piece and because of context and strong bias (a Coens film...) they've made it out to be this timeless masterpiece. Which honestly is ridiculous. The film plays out great for about the first hour plus. The plot is very light, some major elements never explained; but we're in this thriller and our attention is commanded. Eventually, the thin plot never seems to thicken, our hopes for fulfilling symbolism/meaning or at very least answers never satisfy, the dialog is completely bland, vapid and uninteresting all the way up to the last scene which is somehow supposed to hold a powerful weight apparently. The film totally lacks rhythm overall with, again, a strong first half but it seems the entire film settles with being told in the one same breath, utterly boring and insufficient towards the second hour. We're just given event after event, with the same old tone and no depth ever supplied. Added some details about the action sequences are very unsatisfying and badly carried out, and this thriller of a film isn't even convincing from that point of view. So very remote in its entirety, so very void of any genuine purpose, and quite average if not mediocre at what it's even supposed to be. It's not even fun spanning over 2hrs, it really feels long."

The fact that this movie doesn't have any composed music until the credits shows it's power. It's as if composed music isn't needed. The problem is that the scenes make you want to see what's going to happen next, then as the movie progresses it's as if you're taking a mid afternoon nap. It's a movie that when it ends you'll go like, ""What? that's it? Well that was a big waste of time.""

"Agent10","10","1","7","24 January 2008"," Oldschool Coens at their best
","After some real clunkers (Intolerable Creulty, The Ladykillers and that bad Superbowl ad), it looked like the Coens might slip into the subconscious of Americana. But they came back with a vengeance in No Country For Old Men. Tapping into their earlier, much darker work like Blood Simple, Fargo and Barton Fink, they once again crated a work that will nicely compliment body of work.<br/><br/>The truly brilliant detail in NCFOM was the story the Coens didn't tell. Sure, we are engrossed in a cat and mouse game between a simpleton and a cold-blooded sociopath, but it is the other little details that allows you to create your own conclusions about the characters and the story. Why does it seem that everyone is constantly running from the past? Why is Anton Chigurh such an introvert? And why did Llewellyn Moss give up his simple life so easily to essentially become a bum? These are all questions that are not asked but are created when watching this movie. <br/><br/>I especially like the fact that all of the characters back story was reveled more in their voices and dialogue rather than being explored through contemplation and back story. One example is Tommy Lee Jones, who's character is so devoid of strength and conviction that the horrors of the real world seem to shake him to his foundation. His retirement at the end only prove that he didn't have what it takes to take someone down like Chigurgh. This is where I believe the title's significance comes into play. His character, due to his gage, was no match for a man that was far more prepared than he.<br/><br/>But the most amazing aspect of the film was the Coen Bros. belief in leaving a lot of the story up to the viewer. In the end, the overall lesson is that money will corrupt any situation, much like the little boys at the end fighting over a bloody 100 dollar bill. This film is truly a revelation, and second only to There Will Be Blood as the best of 2007."
"thecowardlylorin","9","1","7","22 December 2007"," A sheep in wolf's clothing
","""I don't want to push my chips forward and go out and meet something I don't understand."" NO COUNTRY is a powerful film about the consequences met by a man whose reach exceeds his understanding. More broadly the film seems to ponder how we choose to function in a world that we discover to be less predictable than we think it ought to be. Basically, how and why do we embrace conventional wisdom in a world that's proves itself so unconventional? I stole most of that line from Built To Spill, but I think it works. A misconception about NO COUNTRY is that it is an action movie. The assumption is fair considering how the film is marketed but it's really an unfair label. The film is a literary drama that incorporates a lot of violence. This violence is used exclusively to disturb the viewer and never to arouse or incite any cheers for the protagonist. The violence that chases Llewellyn Moss across Texas is relentless and though he manages to evade it temporarily he selfishly places many others in its path. He is not a romantic hero, and is therefore not treated as such by the filmmakers. He is a simple man who is not as powerful as he believes he is. He is 'over matched', to quote the film, and pays for his 'vanity' in a fitting manner. Many I think will have a problem with the way the film side steps any sort of climactic confrontation, but this is not a story of two warring parties. It is the hunter and the hunted; the catalyst and the inevitable consequence(s). That the film deviates from more predictable genre formulas makes it, in my opinion, all the more interesting. This may be a dumb analogy but I think the film is kind of a sheep in wolf's clothing; a grim, pessimistic sheep, yes, but nonetheless impressive and provoking if you can get past the vicious exterior. It is hard to shake a film like NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN and I don't intend to. It is worth seeing, remembering, and revisiting. Be prepared to get a bit sad though."

","The basic premise the Cohen Bros. seem to be working with here is that evil can't be stopped. It's possible that some of my views here might be interpreted differently, but the film seems pretty clear with Antone's character.<br/><br/>So here's what happens (I won't give away the ending): A man called Lewellyn Moss(not sure of spelling) find's a drug deal gone bad where everyone is dead or left for dead in the deserted Texas plains. He comes across a suitcase full of money brought to the deal and sneaks it back to his place. Once he realizes he's being sought after and tracked by a sadistic hit-man, the cat and mouse game begins. Lewellyn tries to hide his wife and his own identity from the hit-man, but as the chase continues he realizes he might be out of his league.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Tommy Lee Jones is the sheriff in the county where this all started. He just be a small-town cop, but he's a good one with a dark sense of humor that seems to blend perfectly with his crime-solving abilities. He realizes early on that Antone is not simply a hired gun, but someone who enjoys his work and is quite crafty. Jones's character wants to prevent any further death and devastation and even with his experience and skill as detective he feels he's up against some sort of evil that may overtake him.<br/><br/>It's a dusty, dirty world that seems real and harsh when you realize that you're rooting for Lewellyn because Antone is coming after him and is a force that can't be stopped. To root for him is to live that Dylan Thomas poem ""Do Not Go Gentle."" But you root for Jones's character too, and Moss's wife. Most of all just hope that that dark evil that seems to trap everyone wont' win in this case. The money's really not the issue, and this is shown through Moss's reactions, but especially the supporting cast. Moss is more subtle and keeps his cards closer to his chest.<br/><br/>Every line is delivered with just the right amount of weight and there never seems to be a word wasted. While watching this movie I couldn't help but think that the script was so good that it could almost be transfered straight to radio with little narration and still be very effective. The photography is just about as good though. It's a thinking man's movie, but there's plenty of action, swagger and suspense in how this is shot. The backdrop of the desolate Texas towns of 1980 or thereabouts is so real you feel surrounded by it and almost as if you're going to walk into it when you leave the theatre.<br/><br/>The message sinks in slowly but surely. Antone is a badass in the very very ""bad"" way and you hate him for it, even if you love watching the chase. Every lesser character like Woody Harrelson's, the convenience store clerk (the Cohen's have a knack for finding perfect roles for gas station attendents) the deputy and Moss's mother-in-law add to the stew.<br/><br/>It's fascinating, well-paced, leaves you thinking and just pulls at you. You feel like you've faced just what the sheriff faced by the end and you'll probably come to the same conclusion. Watch it."

","I was hooked when Llewelyn (Josh Brolin)ambled across the wide-open brush to track an antelope he'd failed to kill in one shot and came across other prey that had been successfully dispatched. Is he any better than the sinister Shirgurh (Bardem), failing to help a dying man asking for water, or watching ""the last man standing"" die under a shade tree? No Country gives us complex characters and a slow-drip plot spiced with shots of violence and humor. You recognize some patterns from Fargo--the wise Sheriff and his dolt deputy. And then the poor sap who really doesn't grasp the nature of the beast stalking him. The comic wife who is ultimately sacrificed because of the decisions of her spouse. But this is not cold, snowy Minnesota--it's a frontier, an old western frontier visited by the same kinds of violence that inhabited it originally. McMurtry's Lonesome Dove springs to mind--the evil stalking the frontier--Blueduck, or later, the blue-eyed Indian.<br/><br/>Most comment on Javier Bardem's force of evil performance. I myself found him too much like the mindless Jason of those 13th flicks who always gets up no matter how many bullets you pump into him and who always disappears into the night. The real character in this film is Llewelyn whose smarts aren't smart enough ultimately, whose simple plan turns out to be everybody's downfall. No matter what anyone says, this is Josh Brolin's film and his subdued, ego-less acting might fool you into thinking that Bardem stole the film from him...but its Brolin's role that leaves the taste in your mouth.<br/><br/>Tommy Lee Jones can do this type of role in his sleep. I would have preferred a more imaginative casting for the sheriff--Clint Eastwood would have been an intriguing choice, having to play an anti Dirty Harry."

Never before have i seen such presence on the screen in a character, every time you see his face or hear his slowly approaching footsteps, the tension overflows almost instantly, and you are simply shaken to your core by his incredible performance.<br/><br/>And let's not forget the pseudo-dogmatic humor encrusted character of aging sheriff Ed Tom Bell played ingeniously by Tommy Lee Jones. Echoing dark humor elements from past films such as LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, the overly down to earth, quick humor of Bell, in all its simplicity, somehow balances out the raised suspicion and even fear of seeing Chigurgh appear on the screen once more.<br/><br/>Essentially a music-less film, except for minor builds in tension here and there, the Coen bros. really created a movie-going experience unlike any other, focusing on making the film grimly realistic, from the analysis on the human soul and motivation toward realizing what right and wrong actually means, to the intelligently placed, not-to-overly done violence of the film, which when it occurs, usually acts as a balloon instantly popping the built tension of the preceding scene.<br/><br/>Its a film that leaves many threads for the viewer to piece together in terms of the film's meaning or morals or what it is trying to somehow say or perpetuate, but remember, if a film causes you to think long after the film itself is over, than it has more than left its mark on your thought process."

There's Josh Brolin, flush with millions after coming across a drug deal gone bad - leaving him holding the bag - and as not the sharpest tool in the Coen wood shed he is soon chased after by Mexicans, a corporate hit man (Woody Harrelson), and a burnt out Texas Sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones; with a ten miles of bad road facial landscape), but most of all by the coolest, craziest, baddest sociopath to tread the Coen fantastic: Javier Bardem, sporting a nice Hispanic American accent, and an Oliverian Richard III hairstyle. Apt.<br/><br/>Many Directors have been down this worn path before. Peckinpah in ""The Getaway""; John Flynn in ""Rolling Thunder"" (with a younger, less loquacious Tommy Lee); Jay Lee Thompson in ""Cape Fear."" And countless westerns. This movie is also a western; a modern one. Gone are the Cattle rustlers, the Bank robbers and in their stead the Drug runners. But this time there is no heroic Marshall to track them down. Just tired old Tommy Lee Jones who seems to see the end long before Josh Brolin does. He doesn't do much tracking, just coming on the scene of too many killings, and getting more and more philosophically confused by what he sees.<br/><br/>He waxes philosophical, and his metaphors are as subtle as Mickey Spillane's, just couched in a Texan drawl. Javier Bardem also waxes philosophical, only his are borrowed from the grim reaper, and grim he is. As Woody Harrelson's character says: ""he lacks a sense of humor."" His weapon of choice is an air drill, perhaps borrowed from an abattoir. He uses it to open doors and men's souls.<br/><br/>To watch the Coen's is to watch Americana crafted at it's finest. The dialog is the hub of the wheel. They use it to bring in characters straight from a Bruegelian America that we all have come in contact with when we wander away from our home turf of normalcy. No character in a Coen movie is allowed too much silence. Many of them seem to be people they met along the way and invited in for a spot in the movie, and they make the movies ring true, if quirky.<br/><br/>The only complaint I have is that the movie has all the air sucked out of it near the end, as the Coen's deliberately beg off the requisite mano a mano ending.<br/><br/>Tommy Lee is fantastic and yet he's a minor player to Brolin and Bardem who get the biggest scenes. Brolin as a trailer denizen, who seems smarter than he acts, is destined for minor stardom. Bardem is already there for those of us who have watched him cut his teeth with Almodovar and moved from character to character like a chameleon."

","What do you know - the Coen brothers done grown up. Don't get me wrong: I've always been a fan. But I can't deny that in every movie up til now, they seemed to be winking at the audience. Not this time. In case you don't already know, this one is about a guy who finds a case full of money, and the guy who comes after him.<br/><br/>That's the plot, anyway; anyone expecting a conventional thriller will be disappointed. The movie is certainly very suspenseful, but if you're the type that needs narrative closure, this one isn't for you. The movie took me by surprise in its last act, when it sheds its thriller trappings to leave you gazing at what's been underneath them all along. I need to have another look to fully grasp what that is.<br/><br/>The only false note for me was Woody Harrelson's character. You could surgically remove him from the film, and you wouldn't be missing anything. I suspect the character played a more crucial part in the book, but he's kind of useless here.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem scared the crap out of me. And not just because of that haircut."
"christophe92300","4","1","8","30 October 2013"," Doesn't feel like a thriller
","Right from the start, you're immersed in this assumed slowness distinctive of the Cohen brothers, which wouldn't be annoying if it was justified, but here, and also in other productions of theirs, you're under the impression that it's just the reflection of a flagrant lack of substance.<br/><br/>The movie ultimately boils down to a banal settlement of scores story, a very conventional and linear Southern style manhunt. It is labelled as a thriller but it's hard to believe since the codes of the genre aren't perceptible: apart from a few very good scenes, the film as a whole doesn't convey any tension, any suspense, there's no build-up, and that's what's prejudicial.<br/><br/>What will be remembered is the excellent performances of Josh Brolin and of course Javier Bardem, because for the rest, it seems the Cohen brothers blew hot air."
"ellisonhorne","5","1","8","8 March 2008"," Kelly MacDonald Gives Outstanding Performance
","Kelly MacDonald was outstanding and to her I give 10 starts! The way she was able to embody the personality of her southern character was mesmerizing. In my book, she gets the Oscar for Best Female in a Supporting Role.<br/><br/>As for the film itself, well, not very interesting. However, I would have enjoyed the story if they had taken more liberties based on the book. For example I would have enjoyed it more if the story had more to do with Ed Tom Bell, played wonderfully by Tommy Lee Jones. As it was, the film was too much a paint-by-numbers effort. Also, it is sad that a story like this can be so popular given the state of our culture these days."
"smacking_yakima","10","1","8","27 December 2007"," No Country For Hackneyed Filmmakers
","Though a simple plot outline of the Coen Brothers' new film, based on Cormac McCarthy's spellbinding novel, sounds like a thousand others you've heard before (guy stumbles upon briefcase full of money, keeps it, is hunted by men with guns who will stop at nothing to get the money back), NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN stands out as the best film I've seen this year. It's also one of the most exciting films in years, and will go down in history as one of the few cinematic masterpieces of the new millennium's first decade.<br/><br/>Here's why: It's made clear within the first few minutes that nothing in this film is safe, and no character will be held in the delicate care of the filmmaker's protective hand. Once this is established, viewers are suddenly lost at sea in dangerous waters, no longer able to rely on past viewings of traditional thrillers, westerns and horror films--all genres from which NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN draws its influence--to prepare themselves for what is traditionally supposed to happen next. It's a wonderful and thrilling sensation. The people in this film must rely on their wits and their plain dumb luck to survive, both of which, the film seems to suggest, will eventually run out for just about everyone. There's a feeling here that the director is at the mercy of actual events, constantly struggling to keep up as the story unfolds in ways that surprise and frighten even him. And the film IS frightening. One of my favorite chilling scenes takes place when Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) finds himself chased onto the deserted main street of a small Texas town in the middle of the night. Though his life is being threatened in the very center of town, there is nobody he can turn to for help.<br/><br/>Brolin, Tommy Lee Jones, Woody Harrelson and Kelly Macdonald are all excellent in the film's key roles, and a number of terrific bit parts played by actors of various shapes and sizes help paint a convincing, sometimes humorous picture of rural Texas in the early 1980s. But it's Javier Bardem's menacing turn as Anton Chigurh that sits at the center of the film. At once soft-spoken and polite, bullying and ruthless, Bardem plays Anton as equal parts Michael Meyers, Buster Keaton, The Joker and Sonny Bono. There have been few villains in cinema that can compare.<br/><br/>There will be people who will dislike this film, of course, precisely because it does confound expectations that have made audiences feel comfortable and complacent throughout the years. Others may find the story unrealistic or too far over-the-top. But as Tommy Lee Jones' Sheriff Ed Tom Bell says, just open the local newspaper and read what sorts of horrors are taking place in this country every day. You'd hardly be able to make this stuff up and be believed."
"king-8","10","1","8","24 December 2007"," Great film-not because of loose end
","I love this movie, not because the ending was ambiguous but because of the great characters; Llewelyn's endearing resourcefulness, Sheriff Bell's growing pessimism, the killer's frightening, socio-pathic logic and finally Carla Jean's way of deflating the killer's grandiose logic. Yes, the killer wins in the end. And the final speech (Jones' dream about his father) is so poignant and touching and epic, that final speech makes the movie great. The glimmer of hope (fire waiting for us ahead in the coldness of a winter night)...then we all eventually wake up.<br/><br/>Another note: Chigurh is an extension of long line of Coen bros. 'monsters'. Beginning with Blood Simple's P.I., Raising Arizona's Killer biker (a film that is closest to No Country...in terms of plot and themes), Barton Fink's Charlie the salesman, Fargo's Gaear, a sociopath who is not as invisible as Chigurh. These characters all share a trait of being overly-grotesque, otherworldly, almost supernatural. Their grandiosity rises above mere human traits and move into metaphors of moral decay of civilization. In Raising Arizona, the movie suggests that H.I. has created this biker killer out of his nightmare and the killer even shares the same woodywoodpecker tattoo with H.I. <br/><br/>This movie is the Coen's most pessimist film but it is as if all the films before it had been working towards this masterpiece."
"OntoLeCabaret","10","1","8","13 December 2007"," The Coen Brothers stir up a Tex-Mex food chain in their latest Tour De Force.
","""I don't want to push my chips forward and go out and meet something I don't understand,"" says Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) in the first few minutes of the film as he describes the stupor he feels towards the crimes newer generations have invented for themselves. His narration drifts across shots of rural desolation, a familiar setting for directors Joel and Ethan Coen. In No Country for Old Men the Coens work with author Cormac McCarthy to adapt his novel of the same title for the big screen.<br/><br/>The setting is 1980 in Texas, somewhere north of El Paso. The story centers on Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), a welder for Roberto's Mechanic Shop, who stumbles upon early retirement in the form of a drug deal-turned O.K. corral while hunting antelope in the Texas desert.<br/><br/>Here the brothers Coen retrace their steps a decade back; quietly sneaking by career flops like Intolerable Cruelty and The Lady Killers, to arrive at their 1996 magnum opus Fargo. In that ""homespun murder story,"" they showed us what happens when would-be-criminals get in way over their heads. Here again in No Country they create a world where evil men have laid down a set of terrible circumstances, and an average Joe is willing to tip the first domino over.<br/><br/>""Where's the last guy? Ultimo hombre. Last man standing, there must've been one,"" Moss asks a dying man at the scene of the gunfight. With no help from him, Moss presses on, knowing that if the 'ultimo hombre' did stop, it would be in the shade. Surely enough, under a lone tree nearby Moss finds a dead thug clutching a satchel, which just happens to be loaded with more money than he's ever seen. The only thing that could ruin this bizarre fairy tale for Moss is a man named Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem).<br/><br/>Anton is man so intimidating that you would forget your own first name if he came up and asked you for it. He is a cold hit man for his glutton of a boss (although his actions make him seem more self-employed). As Sheriff Bell says, ""He has some hard bark on him."" Moss ships his wife Carla Jean (Kelly Macdonald) off to stay with her mother while he lays low for a while. Sheriff Bell, having discovered the crime scene in the desert, goes to warn Moss about the people that he's up against. But it's too late, Moss is long gone and Anton is hot on his trail.<br/><br/>Everyone involved gives the performance of his or her career. Javier Bardem drains all trace of humanity from Anton, leaving behind an organism whose only function is to calculate his own best interest. Tommy Lee Jones puts on the face of someone trudging through an arctic wind, just trying to stay alive. And the character of Moss fits perfectly on Josh Brolin who dishes out recycled tough guy responses with amazing control so that we can see his trembling beneath.<br/><br/>The people that inhabit No Country are men of few words. Which is appropriate because the real genius of the film is in its subtleties. Amidst the action sequences lies the theme of tension between generations of men, and the Coen brothers employ many motifs to drag humility out of all the violence. When Moss is in a Mexican hospital he is visited by Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson), another bounty hunter sent for him. Carson tries to connect with Moss, telling him that he was also in Vietnam, to which Moss asks, ""So what does that make me? Your buddy?"" With that Moss shows us a generation with no sense of camaraderie, only contempt. This is contrasted with Moss' attempt to re-enter the US after his recovery, where his veteran status persuades the old man at the border to sympathize with his plight. The old man and fellow veteran gets Moss a taxi back home. Apparently camaraderie has skipped a generation.<br/><br/>This sentiment is coupled with Sheriff Bells' inability to keep up with Anton and Moss. ""I feel over-matched,"" he says to his Uncle Ellis (Barry Corbin, in his first noteworthy role since the demise of Northern Exposure). Bell spends the majority of the film applying conventional wisdom to cold trails. Uncle Ellis, further along in his old age, sadly tells Bell that, ""You can't stop what's coming. Ain't all waiting on youthat's vanity."" The film cuts out after a brief monologue from Sheriff Bell, in which he recounts a dream from the night before. In the dream he and his Father are riding through a snowstorm on horseback when his Father charges ahead carrying fire. When the credits rolled, everyone in the theater under the age of twenty five collectively went, ""What! You call that an ending?"" Maybe in doing so they proved the film's hypothesis, that there is a communication barrier between men of different times. Obviously they were sad to let the old cowboy have the last word, but if you pay close attention to his speech you'll see that the movie is anything but a cliffhanger.<br/><br/>There is a lot that washes over the viewer throughout the film's two-hour runtime. Some may latch onto the movie's engrossing action sequences and miss the real themes being studied, which are just as powerful as any ridiculously big firearm that Anton uses to open the door when he's feeling lazy. If you're just looking for a powerhouse of an action flick, you'll certainly find it here. But if you watch closely, you'll also see the Coen brothers create a world of generations pushing against each other slowly like two shifting continents. No Country tops any previous effort from the Coens, and any fan of Fargo will have no trouble calling this the best film of 07."
"tonymurphylee","Null","1","8","7 December 2007"," The Best Movie of 2007, and the Most Horrifying.
","The Coen brothers have outdone themselves with this crazy and unforgettable masterpiece of a film. Based on the book, the film tells the story of the discovery of $2 million, heroin, and a lot of dead bodies. When an outsider cowboy type dude discovers these things, his whole life is in jeopardy when an extremely dangerous mass murderer armed with a cattle retracting gun comes after him. Meanwhile, a police man gets on the trail of the killer, but doesn't take into consideration that this man is impossible to get in contact with without dying. The film also has three perfect performances from Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin, and Javier Bardem. Tommy Lee Jones is delightful as the old timer who isn't up to the times so much as he doesn't get what is going on. He contributes a solid supporting performance. Javier Bardem is creepy as hell as the demented killer. There were parts where he was so ratty and nasty, he reminded me of Nosferatu. He gave me the chills. Josh Brolin is the main character who finds the money and the dead bodies. He contributes a character who always has to be on his toes ad who could die any second. The scenes in which he must evade the killer are extremely suspenseful. I had to shut my eyes at one part in which the killer is about to blow his gun through a lock on a door that Josh Brolin is directly on the other side of. Add to all this one of the most chilling endings in recent years and you've got yourself an entertaining, unforgettable, and extremely suspenseful masterwork of a film that also happens to be funny and that also works in what it represents. It represents the generation gap between the old and the young and how ill-prepared both are, the fact that Vietnam veterans deserved to be treated better than they were when they got back to the states, and also the fact that life is funny and that the most unexpected things can happen, even to sick people. This was the craziest and most intelligent film I've seen in years!"
"tnrcooper","10","1","8","7 December 2007"," Coens bringing their A-game
","Wow, if you want to see some talented filmmakers operating at the top of their game, check this one out. The unusual thing is that, uh, I think one can make a case that they've been operating at the top of their game-well, I suppose it depends on how much you like their work. Certainly I'd say since Fargo; I can't comment on films too much before that because I am not as familiar with their work before that time. Anyway, this film is a cold-eyed, intellectually honest, unshrinking parable of the bleakness of life in the US these days. The film is set in 1980 but its coldness and cynicism would seem to ring true today. It's based on a Cormac McCarthy novel which I must read. As has been widely documented, there is a lot of violence, but also healthy servings of trademark Coen brothers humor. The film is about the aftermath of a drug-smuggling transaction gone wrong and how welder Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin-in a performance for which he should receive an Oscar nomination and an award would not be out of the question), a hard-eyed, perhaps in over his head Regular Guy who realizes he's very lucky and perhaps also realizes how much trouble he is in, even if he doesn't want to admit it to himself, is caught in the crosshairs of a lunatic bagman (Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh in a role to, uh, kill for) who is trying to retrieve the money. Bardem's hair is, as many others have noticed, styled rather ubiquitously. His coldness and focus is identified by Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson, who turns in a fair performance, but whose acting range seems limited) who is hired to attempt to retrieve the money for the other side but whose manner is much more laconic. It is difficult to think of more intense characters than Chigurh in recent movies. His intensity may be a symptom of desperate times, but Chigurh displays some humanity in a scene in which he engages rather more intensely in convenience-store banter than is normal. The inevitability and fury with which Chigurh pursues the money is broken up by his philosophical encounter at an out-of-the- way convenience store.<br/><br/>The Coen brothers keep the plot moving along briskly and they refrain from music which might tip their hands as to how the audience should react. The movie is ultimately a metaphor for a rather fractured and lonely era in the United States and the seeming inevitability of disaster in the film is only broken by random, seemingly insignificant scenes such as a good deed Llewelyn which is thwarted early in the film, and by a scene featuring Tommy Lee Jones (perfectly cast as a world-weary and mystified sheriff, aghast at the untrammeled evil with which he has to deal) as Sheriff Ed Bell and his wife (Tess Harper). Jones also provides narrative framing of the film which sets the tone of horror at the depths to which people have sunk. The Coen brothers really pace the movie beautifully though, enabling it to progress without dwelling excessively on one scene. <br/><br/>As a parable for the modern era, this film cannot be beat. Come Oscar time, it's quite possible that Brolin, Bardem, the Coens, and their breathtaking film, will be honored."
"the_Poppuns","10","1","8","30 November 2007"," No Movie for Old Ladies
","There were 3 old ladies in front of me at the showing I attended. I had to tell them to shut up twice and they couldn't seem to stomach the scenes with people attending to and giving other people wounds. So if you're an old lady, stay home for the sake of your fellow movie fans.<br/><br/>Somehow I was still able to focus on what I consider to be one of the best films of this year. I'm a fan of the Coen brothers work. I think most of us are. I think this is one of their best films and the thing is they've only got a couple bad ones, otherwise everything is excellent. This one is part 'Blood Simple' and part 'The Man Who Wasn't There' and a pinch of 'Raising Arizona'. But also it's completely new and very much it's own movie.<br/><br/>What we have here is a bad guy, a truly bad dude, played by Javier Bardem, who is also a type of hybrid. Half Michael Myers and half Leonard Smalls. Honestly if someone cut my hair like that I might turn out like that too. But Mr. Bardem does a great job playing this psycho, who is compelled to be exactly the way he is. I could get into what I think his motivations are but I'm not into spoiling things.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin is having a great year. He is the star of this film and you find yourself rooting for him, but I'm not exactly sure why. He's no boy scout either. He gets himself into a whole mess of trouble and most of this movie is spent seeing how he will get out of it.<br/><br/>Tommy Lee Jones does the best acting I think I've seen him do. He plays the local law enforcement and seems just gobsmacked by how quickly the world around him is advancing in the wrong direction. He sees the big picture in all of this when most people would probably just look at this as a case of one crime and one psycho. I expect an Oscar nomination for Jones at least.<br/><br/>Then there is Kelly McDonald who I thought did a great job playing Brolin's wife. I think she should also be recognized mainly for one scene late in the film. She's Scottish and you'd never know it watching this.<br/><br/>The Coen brothers have created a classic film here. The reason I say that is that apart from having an overall story and movie that is outstanding, in my opinion, to have a classic film you have to have iconic scenes. There are two scenes that as a movie fan I was very impressed with and that are going to stay with me for a while. One comes early in the film when Josh Brolin his being pursued aggressively. Another comes toward the middle in a tension-filled showdown, where the audience has to read the signs of what's happening and what decisions should be made moment to moment as if you're going through it yourself. At least I felt that way. And this film is full of subtlety, which is why it reminds me of 'The Man Who Wasn't There'. That film was so deliberate and really beautiful and I believe they've gone one step further with 'No Country for Old Men'. This has great acting, it's suspenseful and even thought-provoking.<br/><br/>I would suggest this film for people who can handle some violent scenes and who can sit still and really pay attention for a couple of hours. If you can, you shall be rewarded."
"movieman430","10","1","8","29 November 2007"," A Force to be Reckoned With
","No Country for Old Men is a strange and wonderful kind of film. The movie creeps along at an unsettlingly slow pace and yet you will be glued to the screen every moment. No Country for Old Men may be the Coen Brothers masterpiece. Does it rival Fargo? I say it surpasses it; which might not be fair because they are totally different film, Fargo being much lighter, NCFOM being much grittier. <br/><br/>Without going into the finer details, the movie begins with Llewelyn Moss, masterfully played by Josh Bolin stumbling upon what seems to be a drug deal gone bad. After finding two million dollars in a satchel, he finds himself on the run for his life from various drug runners and Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem). Tommy Lee Jones plays Ed Tom Bell, the local sheriff who catches on to what trouble Moss is in and attempts to help. This is the setup for one of the most riveting, layer, and bleakly wonderful movies ever made. <br/><br/>And so much of it rests on the shoulders of Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh. NCFOM is definitely a character driven piece, all of them inspiringly complex and human. But none are as profound as Anton Chigurh. Javier Bardem has succeeded in created what I believe to be the most frightening character ever played on film. I have seen more horror movies that I can count, yet I have never felt as tense as I did whenever he came on screen. His role is positively brilliant, a true personification of pure evil. This is a man who can make a quarter the most frightening thing you've ever seen. Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones also give masterful and both darkly funny roles. Seeing these characters entangled in a deadly chase for money that begins to lose it's value as all the characters begin to see how damned they truly are.<br/><br/>In the end, No Country for Old Men is a staggeringly power, beautiful, and haunting film that is unrelentingly brilliant. One aspect of the film that many will hate is that it leaves so much up to interpretation, when you leave the theatre you won't want to talk about anything but this film. The true beauty of No Country For Old Men is that it's made up of seemingly unimportant moments that end up holding so much weight, not unlike all our lives. The film also contains a scene with Chigurh at a gas station which is one of the greatest scenes I've ever had the pleasure of viewing. The movie is gritty, bloody, and can't be ignored. No Country for Old Men is a forced to be reckoned with. Destined to go down as an American Classic."

","I'd have to say that it's the best film i've seen in the theater this year. It's weird how the Coens work,...either this awful comedies like big Lebowski or great intense dramas like Miller's Crossing. This is in the 2nd category and their best work since Blood Simple. It simply pulls you into this weird barren landscape and you don't leave. Amazing work from both Javier and Brolin and of course Tommy Lee Jones.<br/><br/>I loved the atmosphere and locations used, so bleak and so barren, just like real life. The fact that there was no music soundtrack added to this. It was like an art-house film filtered thru Sam Peckinpah. The violence and evil vibe was prevalent throughout the entire film and it really kept my eyes from even blinking.<br/><br/>Masterfully shot and edited....some have argued that the 3rd act is a let-down but what where they expecting, Josh Brolin is killed offscreen and makes for a very anti-climatic finale.<br/><br/>Just like real life, there's no real pay-off.<br/><br/>It works"
"nazdar_britches","10","1","8","26 November 2007"," Quite a serious return to the serious for the Coens
","I must express very intimately that No Country For Old Men is a masterpiece. Easily the most suspenseful movie I've seen since Se7en, and that was twelve years ago. The best of all worlds here: acting, dialogue, editing and camera-work, sound, and music (or in this case, total lack thereof). This film made me genuinely afraid to walk around corners last night in fear of coming face to face with Javier Bardem and his cattle-killer. Bardem's portrayal of Chigurh is the scariest villain ever committed to film. His eyes...his eyes.<br/><br/>The Coen bros continue to make the most interesting and entertaining movies of anyone making movies in America. It's like they're directing and writing with their left hands and simultaneously holding their right hands up towards the west in a very indifferent flick off to Hollywood - but somehow they do it with the most professional of middle fingers. Sitting in the theater taking this film in made me feel sad and ashamed. Of what? I do not know. The subconscious jabs that this film's themes took at our generation were felt by this film-goer's tubby belly. I was mesmerized; I was appalled. Is there a more volatile combination for the mind to try and wrap itself around? Bloody though the message may be, it's still visible in spite of and because of it. A violent film to be sure, but these are violent times.<br/><br/>I once thought that the original Texas Chainsaw was a bleak film; perhaps the bleakest I'd seen. No Country, humorously enough set in the same region of the US, achieves that bleakness without the outlandish band of murder happy psychopaths and minus the ""the whole world's going to hell in a handbasket"" feeling. The Leatherface family would fear Chigurh and as far as No Country is concerned, Hell is already here...friendo."

","""No country for old men"" is quite possible the most gripping movie i have ever seen. It takes what is a fairly simple story and through the complexities of Chigurh and the sheriff makes it deep and fascinating. Bardem absolutely deserves an Oscar for Chigurh. What makes the movie so appealing is that it doesn't sacrifice it's suspense and action to be deep, and as a result you don't want to look away, and throughout the movie you continually wish there was still at least another hour left. It isn't a crappy thriller where the action is the only thing that keeps you watching, or a horror movie where you want to look away but cant. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen and i can't stop thinking about this movie."

"ferguson-6","9","1","8","14 November 2007"," You Don't Have to Do This
","Greetings again from the darkness. Far and away my most anticipated film of the year, ""No Country ..."" does not disappoint. So many are complaining about the ending. Personally, I couldn't care less. The journey made this one fulfilling and extraordinarily satisfying. It is remarkable film making from the Coen Brothers, who stay faithful to the source material while injecting their own style and fiendish touches.<br/><br/>In the mode of ""Blood Simple"" this film moves along at a torcherous pace and offers up some of the most gut-wrenching, tense scenes ever filmed. The visual aspects of the desolate Texas countryside (actually New Mexico) compliments the isolation of each of the three main characters: Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin. Additionally, one must enjoy the amazing sound production here from the smallest of details (coin flip) to the surround sound overload of Bardem's air gun.<br/><br/>The acting is among the best we will ever see on film. Tommy Lee Jones' hang dog face is so perfect as the dry and sly witted sheriff. Even the way he seems defeated by good news is purely a pro in action. Javier Bardem is not as well known to American film audiences, but to understand his greatness, check out ""The Sea Inside"". His Beatles haircut and stoic evilness are chilling to watch as he holds true to his code and his mission. He defines relentless, even through the final scene. Although the film is filled with terrific performances, Josh Brolin really stands out. This man is certainly on a career roll right now thanks to ""Grindhouse"" and ""American Gangster"". Here he is just an everyday guy who stumbles on a drug deal gone way bad. His own personal code ends up creating havoc in an otherwise bland world. Just the way he moves is tells us all we need to know about his thoughts.<br/><br/>Each of these very different men stay true to their own code. They are true blue men who lead very different lives but in their heart know there is one right way to be a man. Just great stuff from great filmmakers.

","Much has been made of the newest Coen Brother's installment. I sat down to watch the film with my new girlfriend. I really like her and she likes movies so that helps. No Country... was our second film together. I have long been a Coen Brother's fan and for one reason or another their films seem to speak to me on a level that most fodder does not. The richness with which they craft their characters and the unparalleled consistency stitched into the fiber of their story-lines have long been what I admire about them as filmmakers. In this film I see a clear distance from any particular genre which is not to say the film isn't a homage to the hard West or an unrelenting pursuit of inevitability. <br/><br/>It's hard for me to determine whether Lewelyn Moss is whom I would describe as a hero but I see sketches of a man who prefects a true and balanced affection for his wife and with skill and playful adoration, expresses as much as any man beset with obstacles that have made it difficult to provide a life that befits his character. Lewelyn is a man rife with conviction and a reassurance in the belief that if we all stick to our business and did right where we could, the slide toward the great devoid might not be as harsh. That was until he came upon a bloodbath of a scene while hunting across the flatlands of the Texas panhandle. It takes a true staunch personality to remain unaffected by all that death and an insight to continue beyond in hopes of finding the end of the line and possibly a new beginning for himself and the woman he loves and if not for his inability to resist the challenges presented by evolution of modern criminality set against his own bull-headed humanity, his inevitability might have been a life he deserved. <br/><br/>All else, including the emotionless, psychopathic, cattle gun wielding Anton Chigurh played brilliantly by Javier Bardem were the effect of one man who held steadfast to his own sense of humility (the single gesture to return to the scene of the massacre) and met his demise as a result; leaving nothing but questions and reflection behind to be examined by an iconic old West relic played stirringly by Tommy Lee Jones. The best film of the year... <br/><br/>Oscars!!!"

"Buddy-51","9","1","9","8 December 2007"," a near-masterpiece
","In the stylish new Coen Brothers' movie, ""No Country for Old Men,"" the violence is both graphic and coy, both in-your-face and strangely demur in the way it is portrayed. Bit players are frequently blown away in full view of the audience, while key characters often meet their ends off screen, away from the spotlight of the prying camera. For this is the theme of the movie, that violence is arbitrary, capricious and unpredictable, and that things are only going to get worse in a culture that has grown increasingly coarse and indifferent to human suffering over the years.<br/><br/>The ""old man"" of the title is Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), a small town Texas sheriff who, as he nears retirement, has seen a depressing spike in violent crime in his jurisdiction, thanks, primarily, to the recent proliferation of drug-running from Mexico (the movie takes place in 1980). For this is a ""new time"" in America, one in which an all-out criminal ""war"" is being fought, as much on the open plains as in the crowded cities. It is the ""old men"" like Bell, the last in a long line of old style Texas lawmen, who can no longer recognize their country and who are left to recede into the background bewildered and frustrated by their inability to do anything to stop it.<br/><br/>As the story opens, a group of men lie dead in a windswept field, victims of a drug deal gone terribly awry. The perpetrator is a psychopath by the name of Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) who is now wandering the countryside on a random killing spree, dispatching human victims as casually as the rest of us would a mosquito or fly. Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin) is a ""retired"" welder who stumbles upon not only the carnage-strewn scene but a suitcase filled with millions of dollars in unmarked bills. When Moss makes the fatal mistake of taking the loot, he becomes the prime target of Chigurh, who will stop at nothing to get what is rightfully his.<br/><br/>Based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy, ""No Country For Old Men"" is less notable for its story and characters than for its cinematic naturalism and impressionistic style. Despite having made some truly exceptional films in the past, Joel and Ethan Coen have never been as thoroughly in control of their medium or as supremely confident in their film-making as they are here. The first hour, in particular, is such a flawless masterpiece of composition and tone that it will probably be studied as a model in film school courses for years to come. Not since the films of Terrance Malick has landscape been used to more brilliant effect than in the opening section of this work. The setting - so brilliantly captured in Roger Deakins' incisive cinematography and Craig Berkey's stunning sound design - becomes a palpable presence in its own right and a key player in the drama. The Coens have done their own editing on the film, which explains why the pacing feels like an exquisitely honed piece of music, built on finely calibrated beats and rests, meter and rhythm. The hypnotic, dreamlike quality of the film-making carries the story into the realm of archetype and myth which matches perfectly the surrealistic nature of the piece.<br/><br/>Bardem provides a bone-chilling portrait of a human killing-machine whose sole purpose in life is to destroy that which gets in his way (not that he doesn't enjoy killing just for the sheer pleasure of it as well). In Bardem's hands, Chigurh becomes the true incarnation of evil in its darkest form. Jones brings a world-weary gravity to the role of the sheriff, while Brolin, who gets the majority of the screen time in the film, does some of the best work of his career as the man desperate to keep one step ahead of his pursuer.<br/><br/>Perhaps predictably, the movie is not able to sustain the same level of greatness all the way through its running time and there are moments when the filmmakers seem to lose their way somewhat (particularly when Woody Harrelson shows up as a comic-relief bounty hunter). The unresolved ending may frustrate those who don't like any loose ends hanging around at the end of a story, but the inconclusiveness of the conclusion actually adds to the verisimilitude of the movie quite a bit.<br/><br/>Still, even if the movie falters a bit towards the end, there's no denying that ""No Country For Old Men"" is one of the outstanding films of recent times. In fact, that first hour or so is about as close to perfection as film-making is ever likely to get."

Anybody that likes non-stop chills, and strong scary realistic violence with one of the best assembled casts ever, you'll love this film. Add the the Academy Award worthy acting as a bonus for the experience! <br/><br/>PS. there were so many people in the movie theater, that there was just as many people in the walk-way and up and down the stairs, as there were in seats. And half of them didn't even have tickets for this movie!"
"NetSplinter","10","1","9","29 November 2007"," Great movie, grim but worthwhile
","This is a great movie. Josh Brolin's character is great -- a man of few words, a man of action, he's not fearless, but he's used to taking care of things himself. His self sufficiency and courage get him into trouble, sure, but he's basically a likable character, and one whose conscience can get him out of bed at night. The fact that he's a Vietnam vet turns out to be helpful, and he definitely has his MacGuiver moments.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem's character creates a lot of suspense in this movie. He is an unstoppable, malevolent force. His power is almost otherworldly -- you'd almost rather be trapped on a ship with Alien than be allowed to wander Texas with him on your tail.<br/><br/>Tommy Lee Jones is also very good, and does a superior job occupying the middle ground between fear and fearlessness, confidence and self-doubt, hope and despair.<br/><br/>This movie is a bit grim, and those of you that don't like to see bad things happen to good people might be a bit put off. The movie is violent, and keeps you on the edge of your seat from about 10 minutes in until the end of the movie. But if you like action / suspense, you'll likely consider this one of the best movies of the year. One of the good things about this movie is that it does not glorify the violence it contains and does not ask you to step back from or assent to the bad things that are going on. It is also is a nice reminder that all your fantasies about being able to handle yourself if you find yourself suddenly thrust into the underworld are childish -- the underworld is definitely a place you do not want to go."

Bardem plays a one-note amoral psycho who kills people for no apparent reason. Barbara Streisand's step-son plays a village idiot who finds money he didn't earn.
Tommy Lee Jones plays a philosophy major. Good thing he's so deep because he couldn't solve a crime to save a life.
Woody shows up to inject some levity into things and Stephen Root knocks it out of the park as usual.
But it doesn't amount to anything. The final scene was surely an outtake meant to appear earlier in the narrative. It gets tacked back on to the end of the movie to give the preceding two gruelling hours an arc it doesn't deserve."

","Watching how Bardem's character executes his role in this story is a full time job. It requires your attention and your emotional participation as you fear getting too close, but you can't avoid looking, even as we know what his mission is, and how horrid his actions can be.<br/><br/>There is much more to this very good film, but at the very center of a disintegrating society is evil, and how it takes different shapes, pulling men into obsessive chases for money and possible escape from a miserable existence. There are very few opportunities to sit and ponder what is going on, as we know it already, and little by little, we are given several opportunities to see how the different participants eventually meet their fate.<br/><br/>The directors/producers/writers have managed to develop a style where sometimes style took over substance, that not being the case anymore, as this time heart and soul are always present. We are fully aware of the plight of every person who has come into contact with the drug money. We might not support their goals, but we still feel for them, as the angel of death approaches. Bardem's character is a puzzle, one that we might might not want to put together, he is a very repulsive creation, one that performs a function without much of a heart. It is possible that he might never had one. He toys with his victims and shows outright disdain for them, giving them choices, much like an angry God would. Eventually he derives pleasure from what he does, and even when he loses in his game of chance, he knows he has tortured his victim just enough to scar them for life. Bardem's monster is truly impressive, as much of it is never explained to us. He keeps him human enough to show how truly evil he is. He is not a perfect executioner, as he encounters several bumpy moments along the road.<br/><br/>Lee Jones is very interesting but remains secondary to the two people in the main conflict, as he watches and tries to become more involved in solving the situation, only to discover that his actions might not amount to anything fruitful. In the end, we see his frustrations as his life has been reduced to a domesticity that might be worse than facing Bardem's criminal. The worse thing is that such encounter would have been more rewarding than anything else that ever happened to him, and there is one moment in this story when we develop a bit of frustration, as we see that this might never happen.<br/><br/>The ending is anti-climatic as we see that life doesn't necessarily follow the standards rule of a Hollywood movie. This film will not make everyone happy as much of what is expected never happens. The level of tension is heart stopping, and then, it never seems to have a pay off. There is a lesson to be learned, or is it just a lesson to be reviewed? It never quite explains itself."

","This movie is indeed the most significant movie of all time. It certainly exposes the limited intellect of critics who fail to see the endless plot nonsense because um let's see:
1. Because the film is a Western as he wears a cowboy hat, or not a Western, how mysterious is this film leaving critics in wonderment.
2. The film has Tommy Lee Cooper saying things have got worse but at the end his uncle saying America's always been violent. Wow, how much deeper can you get? Has any film ever probed the darkness in society as deeply as this?
3. I daren't risk damaging my brain further to investigate any more into why this film has been praised to the mountain tops by those elite geniuses who alone properly understand film, and who are so sorely needed to educate the hoi polloi finally having a chance on this site to express their views.<br/><br/>As for plot holes, after pinching a fortune from murderous drug dealers, Moss goes back hours after the theft to give a then dying man some water (a gallon of it, presumably he thought the chap would have got more thirsty) in the middle of the night. wtf? Couldn't he have phoned an ambulance, anonymously on his way back home after his theft? And that's after his callous behaviour with the wounded Mexican.<br/><br/>Then Moss goes on an endless Motel tour to apparently launder the money in air conditioning ducts.

"skepticskeptical","6","0","1","30 January 2020"," Portrait of a Principled Psychopath
","No Country for Old Men accurately portrays the comportment of a bona fide psychopath, whose intransigent inner logic and ¨principles¨ drive him to eliminate human beings as though they were flies. The film smacks of Tarantino in its extreme and unsettling violence but carries the Coen brothers´ peculiar stamp of smugness. These filmmakers love to make fun of hicks, losers and lowlifes, which always makes me wonder whether they might be fundamentally petty, a bit puerile, and not quite as intelligent as they take themselves to be. Their targets are such low-hanging fruit that there is really no point in illuminating such persons´ pathetic qualities. Yet I suspect that through this ploy the Coen bros lure many viewers into believing that they, too, are superior, since they can laugh along with the insults and insinuations. This may explain part of their success. Of course they are also highly competent filmmakers who know how to follow and break the rules in creative ways, which naturally charms critics and (therefore) wins them awards. But there is no denying that their sense of humor nearly always involves a profound snarkiness which lures the viewer into identifying with the tone, leading them to believe they they are closer to the filmmakers than to their objects of ridicule.<br/><br/>The story of No Country for Old Men is about as nihilistic as they come. There are only losers and lowlifes and bad guys, in various degrees. Perversely, the Javier Badam character, who is the bad bad guy against whom everyone else is opposed, is the best bad guy in the sense that he acts on principles, while everyone else is just winging it. What makes the story quite creepy is that we know that in reality murderers do get away with murder--one of every three cases in the United States is never solved. So the more proficient and ¨principled¨ a psychopath is, the less likely it is that he will ever be tripped up.<br/><br/>I do not believe that this is a great film. It certainly is a clever film, but it strikes me as a symptom or sign of our ¨banality of violence¨ times, when governments snipe suspects using lethal drones (often from thousands of miles away), effectively ¨convicting¨ them of capital crimes (without indictment or trial) through state execution. A very ¨principled¨ and sociopathic practice (just like that of serial killers), but accepted by many (most?) people today as a part of ¨just war¨, even though it smacks of the Nazis. This is about as unromantic a view of the world as there could possibly be. Is it harshly realist or somehow decadent? Perhaps this creation represents, more simply, a surrender to nihilism."

","[Warning: May Contain Spoilers?]<br/><br/>So, seeing that this was my first time seeing this film, I have a lot to say. Seeing that I have five pages worth of notes written down here. First of all, Josh Brolin, Tommy Lee Jones, and Javier Bardem all portrayed their respected characters expertly. In recent years, Josh Brolin has easily became one of my favorite actors and Tommy Lee Jones has always been of my favorites, though I do like his more recent stuff better. Javier Bardem, who I have not seen much of, does nothing but great in the roles I have seen him in. He plays the role of homicidal hitman so perfectly, it almost scares me. I also love how each character has differences in their personality but at the same time they are all the same. Anton is a homicidal hitman, Llewelyn is man who is just trying to make some money while protecting his wife, and Ed Tom is just your local lawman trying to keep crime out of his great town. But at the same time they are similar in the fact that they are all not very big fans of people and they all don't say much. Speaking of that, this film uses silence expertly. There are scenes in which it is completely quiet and yet, that silence speaks volume. When there is dialogue, it is greatly written and performed. I believe the biggest mistake that could've been made with this film would've been making a sequel. This movie keeps you second guessing the whole time you are watching it and when it ends there are still unanswered questions. I think the worse mistake they could've made would be answering these questions with a sequel. No Country for Old Men is great as a standalone film and it should stay that way. Other than that, the camera work is great as well as the design and production. The Coen Brothers and Cormac McCarthy made such a great film, and I appreciate that.<br/><br/>For me, It's a 9/10."
"mshackletonchavez","7","0","1","1 December 2018"," Great Coen Brothers Film.
","A most interesting feature, a masterclass in directing and acting. The editing is done in such a way that great tension is sustained for elongated periods of the run time, this is highly engrossing and masterful for the film to have achieved.<br/><br/>While all performances were of a quality standard unseen by most features, I particularly think that Javier Bardem is astounding as the sadistic and psycophatic fellow he portrays, due to this gluttal voice, uneasy footsteps and building of 'creepiness' - it's a wonderful performance. Also I believe that Tommy Tee Jones, Josh Brolin and Kelly MacDonald all deserve great praise.<br/><br/>Roger Deakins cinematography, along with the Coen brothers directing and the editing, brings a very vivid, tense and strangely colourful palette. One truly feels as if they are in Texas and Mexico, coupled with the lighting brings a very clear and timeless image.<br/><br/>However, I must come to what I did not enjoy, while I enjoy most Coen brothers motion pictures, this one is slightly weaker in my opinion, simply due to my own personal preferences about story and characterisation, which this film differs in. Therefore while this film is a masterclass in certain aspects, it is not of my personal taste entirely, dare I say there was things I did not enjoy: yes. I found that the music was relatively absent, or forgettable, while I understand that this is a styalistic choice, I feel that in retrospect that it somewhat weakened the film.<br/><br/>I feel that while I write this after having just seen it, not a few minutes ago, that in time it will grow on me, and I will appreciate its masterclass and excellent craft more than I already do, and it's pitfalls in my own personal opinion will be overlooked. But I think that right now, it's a 7/10."

","The Coens never disappoint and No Country for Old men is a great film by the talented duo siblings.

The location of dry and dreary Texas adds to the visual appeal and even motifs and themes. Although slightly on the longer side this is one film you will be thankful you sat all the way through.

","Is this the Coen Brother's best movie? Not an easy question and far too many contenders in their filmography to choose from. This is my personal favorite. It is a slow burner and that's way it works. The cinematography is pristine, the performances are subtle and as the viewer, you know exactly who you're dealing with from the get go.
 
The adaption from Cormac McCarthy's novel is a smooth one. It is pretty much verbatim and just as atmospheric. As a fan of the novel, I often wondered what Chigurh looked like. After seeing him portrayed by Javier Bardem, I cannot imagine anyone else in the role. His performance is chilling to the core. He is a killing machine that just so happens to bleed, yet still seemingly unstoppable.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin is excellent as the cowboy who makes a decision to take the money that doesn't belong to him and accepts his fate as soon as danger presents itself. <br/><br/>Tommy Lee Jones is the glue that holds the narrative together, and lest we forget the wonderful Kelly McDonald who if I told you was Scottish, you wouldn't believe me!<br/><br/>Overall, a fascinating insight into these three characters and their unique outlooks on the events unfolding around them. <br/><br/>A well deserved 8/10"

This film really works itself out in case the viewer gets lost. I'm still shocked the villain survived at the very end, I was expecting somebody to blow his head off as he was walking down the street, at the very end. This movie for what it was, actually was pretty decent and I liked the idea the villain was hunting the main character down.

"dom-lerose-8","Null","0","2","30 June 2014"," 'No Country for Old Men' has a mesmerizing story and shows the history and future of international crime.
","The good, the bad and the victims of crime have always fulfilled the cycle of crime throughout the history of mankind. There are always heroes trying to prevent crime from the ones who cause it. Then there are the victims, the people who are helpless against crime. 'No Country for Old Men' tells the story of three men who all show the cycle of crime. Tommy Lee Jones plays Sheriff Ed Bell, an old lawman in west Texas who is disgusted by modern day crime and fears the damage it will do to him. He represents the good hero in the crime world. Javier Bardem gives a blistering performance as a psychopathic bounty hunter named Anton Chigurh who represents the evil figure in crime. He is after Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin) a man hunting Pronghorn in the desert who stumbles across a brutal crime scene and happens to find a case of $2 million that he keeps. Moss represents the victims of crime due to being hunted down by a ruthless criminal, and being a witness to the drug cartels and finding the money that set him off into a terrifying survival test. Anton Chigurh is at full speed in trying to get the money and kill Moss before Sheriff Bell can stop him. The three men are all 'No Country for Old Men' for various reasons. The similarities between these fine characters is brilliant! Even though they all represent different figures of the crime world, they all have the same connections and realizations about their roles in the crime world that make this story impossible to stop thinking about, and tricky to firmly understand. There are many other supporting characters that have the same roles as Sheriff Bell, Anton Chigurh, and Llewellyn Moss that provide a story that keeps moving forward and an interesting theme about how everyone has their own role in crime once incorporated in it. Besides the brilliant similarities and title that connect the main characters, you have world-class film making by The Coen's. The directing is so rich in every shot. Many scenes involving Chigurh hunting down Moss are extremely scary and intense, and the reality they provide in their film makes this film even more powerful and important. Not a scene in this film is useless or unimportant. Every single action and statement can be used to better understand the plot and themes of this deep story, which calls for acute attention by the audience. The tendency of persistence and roles in the world we live in are acted on to show the nature of humankind by all ages, not just the meek. The motivations of all types of people (good, bad, reckless, hasty)are all reflected on to show how evil people go for greed, good people want justice and peace, and victims want safety. The true message is how crime will never end, and how there will always be good and bad, and people will get caught up on the never ending cycle of crime. Joel and Ethan Coen have written a monumental story that has boldness in every way. If people give this film the credit and time it deserves, then they will realize why every character is 'No Country for Old Men' and how each character relates to one another. Besides the confusing aspects, you'll get full-throttle action and intensity with brilliant characters and performances that deserve to be called groundbreaking and classic. This is the greatest story ever told and by far one of the best films of all time. See this before you die!"

","There is a chilling bleakness to No Country For Old Men, a solitude to the extent that when there are signs of civilisation, it is almost a shock. The rolling dunes of West Texas cast dark silhouettes, there is very little music and when it is used, it is minimalist and non- invasive. This is a Neo-Western with no saccharine elements.<br/><br/>Whilst hunting, Llewelyn Moss (Brolin) stumbles upon a botched drug deal, takes the money and sets in motion a chase across Texas from a psychotic killer Anton Chigurh (Bardem) and a sheriff Ed Tom Bell(Lee Jones). Moss' change is symbolic, he goes from hunting pronghorns to being hunted himself by hit-man Chigurh, so it is not so much the loss of innocence as its realignment. Chigurh is in turn hunted by police, and the sheriff by age with his advancing years, giving the film's tag-line 'there are no clean getaways' a definite pertinence.<br/><br/>Dialogue is very sparingly used, there are almost no monologues and it is smart and philosophical, with Chigurh's considerations on fate particularly thought-provoking. With reflection, few lines stand out which sounds like a criticism but is actually a great credit to the film's naturalism, it does not at any moment feel forced.<br/><br/>Bardem is electric as Chigurh, whose hair with its ghastly yet calculated look adequately summarises his character. He is genuinely terrifying, what kind of monster would sport that hair? It is easy to overlook the strength of Brolin and Lee Jones' performances. Moss has a macho sternness with glimpses of humanity and Bell is world-weary and battered by time like the villages and dunes themselves.<br/><br/>Praise has to be given to the Coen Brothers for their loyalty to the source material and not submitting to the whimsy of Hollywood and changing the ending. There were a lot of complaints about it but they are misjudged. Again, the film's tag-line is apt enough description, it is a philosophical end, one that leaves the audience contemplating. Anyone who claims not to understand, good. This is exactly what is encouraged. Thought. Discussion.<br/><br/>No Country For Old Men is designed to resonate. there may be a sense of dissatisfaction from some quarters but it is carefully structured in order to be as impacting as possible. It is like life, which is scarcely neat and tied with a bow."

","Alright, there's a lot to say. I'll be fair and I'm gonna keep every side of the argument.<br/><br/>-I enjoyed it, very actually, specially the first 70 mins; it was more thrilling and would keep you waiting for more of badass well-shot scenes with some neat twists... well, hopefully. -Javier Bardem has made a remarkable performance for life and nobody could deny it. -I didn't really think I would adapt with a movie that has no music, but I actually loved it thanks to the sound mixing and editing neat tricks and usage of daily life materials. -I have no problem with realistic storytelling and that it's not always about how the good defeats the evil. -Awesome directing and guiding techniques for the scenes.<br/><br/>Every screenplay has got two major jobs on its shoulder, it's the writer's burden to deliver a written-before-visualizing material (the scenes), AND what these scenes are about through them. I could give you hundreds of well-written powerful scenes, but you wouldn't really get what the whole thing is about. This movie would go with an A+ for the first half, but leaves you confused about the second one. Same goes to the direction. The directors, besides visualizing the screenplay, they gotta keep the plot on your mind, what keeps the engine going.<br/><br/>So.. Was it too deep or too pretentious?<br/><br/>Was it deep because of how realistic the story is? Aka how the guy you dislike harms innocent people or the people you like? Because of how psychotic, without any kind of sympathy Javier was? Because old men can't fight and spend their last days just some deep thinkers, dreams-interpreter philosophers? I honestly wasn't following Tommy Lee most of the time, he didn't seem that interesting to me. Because the writer of the screenplay was like ""Alright, they ain't gonna get nothing about the whole story but what I want them to know""? Not even talking about hints.<br/><br/>As the Coens brothers, the writers of the screenplay are the directors in the same time, I think they got more busy with the techniques and visualizing the scenes more than elaborating and explaining more of the core of the work.<br/><br/>I did enjoy it, but I was left unfulfilled nor satisfied.

This is a film of a kind we've seen before and there are others who do films of this genre better. It's also a genre I don't care for. I don't want to get down in the dirt with psychopaths and wanton sick killers when I watch a movie. And I don't think their depiction requires all that much talent. We've got Quentin Tarantino and others of his ilk doing those movies. What makes the Coen brothers great, for my money, is their comic brilliance - as seen in The Big Lebowski, O Brother Where Art Thou, Intolerable Cruelty and so many other films prior to this one. That's where their genius and uniqueness lies. I feel they've lost their way - and this film was the first in their diversion off the path of greatness. What a terrible shame. Can they ever recapture their earlier greatness? I'm still waiting - but will forever revere them as two of the greatest movie makers of all time."

I was hoping there was an alternate ending on the DVD but no joy. This is why I only give it a 7/10. This film lost 3 points for letting itself down with a stupid ending.

"JamesHitchcock","6","0","6","30 August 2011"," ""If it ain't a mess, it'll do till the mess gets here""
","2007 will go down in history as the year when two major contenders for the ""Best Picture"" Oscar were both in the Western tradition. (The other one, of course, was ""There Will Be Blood""). Despite being set as recently as 1980, ""No Country for Old Men""- a title borrowed from W B Yeats's poem ""Sailing to Byzantium""- is essentially a modern-day Western, both in its setting (the desert landscape of West Texas) and in its themes.<br/><br/>Llewelyn Moss, a hunter, comes across several dead bodies in the desert, together with two million dollars in a satchel; a drug deal has gone wrong, leading to a shoot-out. Moss decides to keep the cash and takes it to his trailer home, but by doing so he puts himself in great danger. A hit-man named Anton Chigurh has been hired to recover the money, and can trace its whereabouts through a transponder hidden inside the satchel. Chigurh is a ruthless man, lacking in any conscience, and would have no compunction about murdering Moss or anyone else who gets in his way. Other important characters are Moss's wife Carla Jean, local sheriff Ed Tom Bell and Carson Wells, a rival hit-man who offers to protect Moss from Chigurh in exchange for the money. <br/><br/>Apart from ""Fargo"", which I greatly admired, I have not always agreed with the critics about the Coen brothers. I have, for example, never been a great fan of the highly-praised ""Miller's Crossing"", seeing it as just another variation on the overused gangster theme. On the other hand, I loved ""Intolerable Cruelty"", even though most of the critics seemed to regard it as one of their lesser works. So it is with ""No Country for Old Men"". It was widely praised by the critics and won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Yet it has never been a particular favourite of mine, and I certainly would not have awarded it Best Picture ahead of ""There Will Be Blood"", one of the greatest films of the present century. <br/><br/>""No Country for Old Men"" certainly has its good points, notably the contribution of Tommy Lee Jones. A few years ago I wrote in one of my reviews that I felt his career was stuck in a rut, after seeing him in disappointing films from the early 2000s like ""The Hunted"" and ""The Missing"". ""No Country for Old Men"" is the film which convinced me that I was wrong on that point, as Jones delivers one of his best performances. His Sheriff Bell is an ageing man, close to retirement and disillusioned by rising levels of crime and violence, but who nevertheless retains a certain humanity and decency beneath a laconic exterior. There is some striking photography of the desolate West Texan landscapes, which are used as a symbol reflecting the pitiless cruelty of some of the characters. There are some other good performances, especially from Woody Harrelson as Wells, and some effective dialogue. (Sheriff Bell, surveying the carnage after the shoot-out between the drug dealers, and hearing it described as a ""mess"", laconically replies """"If it ain't, it'll do till the mess gets here""). <br/><br/>I was less taken with the performance of Javier Bardem as Chigurh, even though it won him a ""Best Supporting Actor"" award. It was a very one-dimensional wooden-faced performance, more a personification of some abstract quality like ""Death"" or ""Evil"" than a recognisable human being. Bardem's Chigurh had a robotic quality about him which put me unhappily in mind of Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator, even though the Coens said that this was a comparison they were anxious to avoid, or even of Frankenstein's monster. <br/><br/>John Patterson, critic for ""The Guardian"" praised the film on account of the Coens' ""feel for a landscape-based Western classicism reminiscent of Anthony Mann and Sam Peckinpah"". I would to some extent agree with this quotation, although I felt that in this film the Coens never match the depth of characterisation and character development achieved by Mann in his best films like ""The Naked Spur"". Both Mann and Peckinpah, however, frequently portrayed the Old West as a violent, amoral place, and the Coens here portray the modern West in very similar terms. (Peckinpah also frequently set his films in the deserts of the South-West). <br/><br/>Nevertheless, if the film shares some of Peckinpah's good qualities, it also has some of his weaknesses. Patterson's use of the word ""classicism"" was an apt one, as the Classical style of architecture, although well-suited to grand, monumental buildings, could also be cold and impersonal. ""No Country for Old Men, although it is (like some of Peckinpah's) a grand, monumental film, is also a rather impersonal one, with the emotional temperature turned down too low. In this it contrasts sharply with the passion and intensity of ""There Will Be Blood"". Jones's performance is a fine one, but even it is not in the same league as truly magnificent one from Daniel Day-Lewis in the other film. In 2007 both the Coens and Paul Thomas Anderson made films about murder and bloodshed, but Anderson, unlike the Coens, also made one about the human passions and emotions which lead to murder and bloodshed. 6/10"

","No Country for Old Men is a great film for 2/3s of it after that the movie really does leave you hanging on WTF. This is a Coen brothers film which almost automatically means it will have a great story and clever writing. Which is true through most of this movie.<br/><br/>So the story is about a guy named Llewelyn (Josh Brolin) finds the aftermath of a drug deal gone bad almost everyone is dead. But he just happens to find a suitcase with over 1 million dollars in it. So like any normal human he takes the money, little does he know a psycho named Anton (Javier Bardem) is also wanting the money. So the rest of the movie is Anton hunting Llewelyn down to kill him and take the money.<br/><br/>The acting and characters all are just amazing my personal favorite was Javier Bardem as a psycho killer because he is so damn subtle it is unreal. One minute he is talking to you the next your'e a corpse. Tommy Lee Jones is great as a sheriff. He plays his role how a old man who has seen just too much and is just saying to himself I don't need this.<br/><br/>The writing is phenomenal each scene has that tension in it the feeling like you have no frigging clue what is going to happen.<br/><br/>The biggest yet only problem is yes the ending it just ends with no real conclusion and no sense that the story is truly over.

A kind of slow pace movie with an slap you in your face ending, wasn't really good. The movie was moving along pretty well, then 'bang, bang', the guy is dead and the man is gone. Wasn't mad that Moss got killed, it does add a different taste for a movie, (same reason on why I loved the Vanishing) I just hated how it happened, wasn't smooth on getting to that point. We are moving along, then he is dead, in the most boring way possible. It wasn't like The Vanishing in how the guy died, he died by...surprise, getting shot in broad daylight. Then the movie had about 15 minutes of crap that wasn't really necessary. The man dies, the bad guy gets the money, kills the wife, and get away. All that other crap with Tommy Lee Jones should have been left out. Great acting and story line made this movie good. This movie is far from great though. Terrible ending(the ending always makes the movie), it is like the directors wanted the man dead, then they realized that they still have some time left so they added some other crap. Also, nothing is really nothing great about this movie. I put it on about the same level as The Fugative.

He is on the run from that moment, pursued by a hired gun (Javier Bardem, who even with a Beatles-type haircut is scary as hell). A sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) who has already had one run-in with the hired killer, is slowly figuring out what is going on. The film is a little on the long side, and requires patience as it is not told in the straightforward manner we are used to with most movies. In fact, at times it's downright weird, sort of like a David Lynch movie. That's because it is a Coen brothers flick, and these are the folks who gave us BLOOD SIMPLE and RAISING ARIZONA. Based on a novel, this will best appeal to fans of Coen brothers' movies and lovers of violence and gore. And there's plenty of that to go around. It certainly is several notches above the awful THERE WILL BE BLOOD, which came out around the same time.

Whine whine whine.<br/><br/>The only saving grace of this movie was being able to watch the dry sardonic humour of TLJ. Love him to death no matter how boring the movie."

","It is a suspense-filled film (at least the first 2/3), and had great cinematography and casting and such. But this movie had nothing to say, except that there are some bad-guys out there, and some good guys, and hope that you never run into someone like Anton Chigurh...<br/><br/>I think the other low reviews said it well. I think that overtime the IMDb ratings on this movie will wane. Perhaps the novel that it was based on is at fault. I would hesitate to read the book, now in case it had the same parallel outcome as the movie. <br/><br/>This is a typical over-hype from Hollywood, and the depressing outcomes for the characters of this movie left me drained. I think that Chigurh exemplifies the craziness that is ever present in our culture...the total disregard for the value of life."
"Gunn","8","0","2","16 April 2009"," A Good but not Great Movie!
","First off, I was surprised by all the negative comments, but I kind of felt that way after the first viewing of this film. It's typical Coen Brothers fare which means you come out of the theater saying, ""Huh?, What was that all about?"" This one definitely ended before the end, in mid-story. Did Chigurh get away or does he die halfway down the block? Where is the money? Why did Sheriff Ed Tom Bell quit the chase? What happened to Carla Jean Moss? Did she win or lose the coin toss? I'm sure there are more questions but these would be the top questions. I, for one, am not fond of movies that you have to figure out. Those with multiple plot twists or flashbacks & flash-forwards. I favor a simple story well told. Still, I found value in ""No Country... The casting and acting was superb, from Javier Bardem's chilling Chigurh, Tommy Lee Jones' Sheriff Ed Tom's frustration at the world of the 80s to smaller roles like Barry Corbin's Ellis and Beth Grant as Carla Jean's cynical mother. The cinematography by Roger Deakins and the music score by Carter Burwell were topnotch as always. It was pretty gory but so was Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, and many other popular films. I think a second viewing helps the film a lot. Many films that I found mediocre on first viewing became some of my favorites after further viewings. Did it deserve its Oscar for Best Picture? No, but the Oscar was awarded for Fargo which lost its Best Picture Oscar to, of all things, ""The English Patient"". The Academy always gets it wrong."

"hall895","7","0","4","4 September 2008"," Powerful but oh so depressing
","If you're looking for a feel-good movie you most certainly have come to the wrong place. This is one seriously depressing film. So if you're not in the mood for that sort of thing perhaps you'll want to pass on this one. But if you do skip it you'll be missing a film which, depressing though it may be, is undeniably powerful. There may not be much inherent drama in the plot. The movie is essentially just a slow-speed chase. Will the bad guy catch the good guy? That's the movie in a nutshell. But somehow it all seems rather captivating. Perhaps that's because the bad guy is one of the most memorable, menacing and impossibly frightening movie villains we've ever seen.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem plays Anton Chigurh, the villain. Anton is pure evil personified. But somehow this completely inhuman character is utterly fascinating. Full credit to Bardem for creating a simply unforgettable character. Anton Chigurh may well haunt your nightmares for a while after seeing this film. He is a sociopathic assassin and in this film Llewelyn Moss has the misfortune of being Chigurh's prey. Moss, who is played by Josh Brolin, comes across a drug deal gone bad in the wide-open Texas plains and with everyone around lying dead he is able to make off with a satchel containing two million dollars. Moss is the good guy, so to speak, but he's certainly not the typical movie hero. But when hit-man Chigurh is sent after him to retrieve the money you can't help but root for Moss. And that's basically it. Moss on the run, Chigurh chasing him and a whole lot of bloody violence along the way.<br/><br/>Unfortunately there are many times during this movie where things slow down and not a whole lot of anything is going on. Chigurh chases Moss...and chases him...and chases him...and, well you get the point. Occasionally we cut to Tommy Lee Jones, playing the small-town sheriff Ed Tom Bell investigating the botched drug deal and its aftermath. Bell is old-school and world-weary and prone to homespun philosophizing about the new brand of violence he must confront. Jones is very good in the role but in all the scenes in which his character is the focus it is as if the movie is just biding time until the next violent outburst. And there are certainly plenty of violent outbursts. Other characters wander in and out but the movie is really all about Moss and Chigurh. And while Brolin is fine in his role it is Bardem you will long remember in his depiction of unrelenting evil. A great character but one great character does not make a great movie. There are some great pieces here. The movie is beautifully shot, there are many moments of almost unbearable tension and drama and Bardem's performance is breathtaking. But there are too many moments where the story drags, the plot is rather bare-bones and the whole thing kind of peters out at the end. For a film which had so many incredibly tense moments throughout the ending is rather mundane, very much abrupt and somewhat disappointing. All in all No Country for Old Men may be depressing but it's still a good film. It's just not a great one."
"Knownowt","5","0","1","27 August 2008"," Not as good as some, not as bad as I thought.
","Having read most of the comments prior to watching the film on DVD I was prepared for a disappointing experience. It was not so. OK it was not the best film I have ever seen, but certainly not the worst. I agree with many comments that the ending left many unanswered questions, but I don't mind that. Like life some things are always likely to remain a mystery and make you think. As for the violence, in particular the strangulation of the deputy, I felt this was necessary as it made clear in a dramatic sense, the ruthlessness of the character, especially as he smiles as he kills. As for the captive bolt weapon. It is known as a Humane killer as it is quick and painless. It also leaves no cartridge cases as evidence and is quiet. The fact it does not look like a weapon also allowed Chigurgh to approach his unsuspecting victim. As for Woody Harrelson's character. It seemed obvious to me that he was a private detective who had links to Chigurgh and also showed Llewelyn Moss how easy it was to both trace him and his family. Many comments indicate that the Police were not involved or showed little interest. There are a number of comments made about DEA agents and other departments being involved in the investigation. As for Sheriff Ed Tom Bell, I thought the acting was brilliant. The portrayal of a cop coming to the end of his time with all the quirks of one who has seen and heard most things summed it up for me. He was always a step behind, but never the less almost caught the Mexicans at Llewelyn's killing. So all in all I enjoyed the film. OK not everything was neatly tied up. Things occurred out of shot, but do we have to see everything, there can be room for imagination or do we have to witness everything. So it is not a 10/10 movie nor is it a failure. I found it interesting, not a film to watch without 100% attention. It will keep you thinking, and maybe if being watched on DVD could do with a second viewing."

","The Coen Brothers, after a decade of middling productions following the (highly overrated, in my opinion) ""Fargo"", hit a major success in 2007 with their adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel. It racked up awards, ultimately winning Best Picture at the Academy Awards, among other Oscars. I did not see it until February 2008, when in arrived in theatres on Prince Edward Island.<br/><br/>The film functions on two levels: the first is as a pure thriller, and on that level it is an all-but-unqualified success. The Coens are tremendous filmmakers on a technical level, and so they are able to conjure up a series of stunningly tense set-pieces, pitting various characters against Javier Bardem's stone-cold killer Anton Chigurh. One, particularly, is brilliant: Josh Brolin's character, Llewelyn Mars, sits in his motel room, having found the tracking device placed on his person, and listens as the ominous beeping of the tracking device (which the audience has previously observed in action) approaches: the audience is on pins and needles. A great thriller needs a great villain, and Chigurh is as good a filmic foe as I have seen in many years. He is determined, and his ability to continually keep on the trail of his opponents and absorb pan is almost Schwarzeneggerian. The Coens supply him with some grisly signature weapons as well, from a nasty-looking gun to the prominent air-fired cattlegun. Bardem's performance is quite intimidating. Elsewhere, Josh Brolin and Kelly Macdonald are strong as as his most prominent targets (the latter has a particularly fine scene right at the end).<br/><br/>Then there is the second level, that of a more existential drama, and on that level I am less certain. There are issues of fate, chance, and the like in play here, and the nature of evil (incarnated in Chigurh), and none are really resolved, or, as far as I can see, amount to much. The title refers to Tommy Lee Jones' character's belief that the world is becoming less and less civilized as time passes. However, the movie welcomely bucks this, as Jones' elderly uncle relates that the world has always been a cruel and hard place, and criticizes his 'vanity' at thinking he could really change it. The end is inconclusive, and I could tell that many of the audience in the theatre were not satisfied by the movie's climax (which basically avoids anything climactic). The ""evil wins"" motif is rather banal.<br/><br/>This is a gripping film experience most of the way through, but the ending does not work as the ending of a thriller, and I never found the other themes particularly well-developed; ultimately, I give it a seven, since it is still first-rate most of the way through, and I know a great many people saw more in the movie then I did."

","I'm a huge fans of the Coens and have enjoyed every one of their films, going back to Blood Simple. Having read rave reviews which referred to this as 'their masterpiece', my expectations were very high, and possibly this is why I was disappointed  maybe I was expecting too much. Make no mistake, this is a very good film, in a different league from the majority of thrillers. The cast selection is very interesting and the performances excellent. Tommy Lee Jones is at his best, and Javier Bardem is a truly memorable villain, something really special. The cinematography is excellent, typical Coen standard. The story starts well, a tense mystery and sure enough the suspense builds. So why my disappointment? Well, as others have said, the latter part of the movie doesn't quite live up to the promise of the first half and the ending is something of an anti-climax. The movie doesn't quite fulfil initial expectations. It seems to finish rather than end. Other critical comments are that Woody Harrelson is rather wasted, a relatively brief 'walk on' appearance. Some of the dialogue I found very difficult to understand. The characters have a tendency to mumble  OK, I'm a Brit and maybe my problem in not understanding 'Texan'. On reflection, the ingredient I missed most was the (black) humour, found in Fargo for example. See this film by all means and you're hopefully enjoy it but I don't believe it to be quite the masterpiece that many have said, just very good, which is better than most productions manage."

","A modern day Greek tragedy...without a flawed hero-more of a flawed anti-hero. Josh Brolin plays Llewelyn Moss the complex man with more than one flaw and with some of them being a bit contradictory. He opportunistically comes across a large sum of money after stumbling across a drug deal gone wrong and he makes away with it. Now, you could argue which flaw of his is the most culpable or primary, but in any case he ends up having to watch his back as he is now being pursued by a similary complex crime syndicate gun for hire-Anton Chigurh, played by Javier Bardem.<br/><br/>On the 'good guy' side of the equation is law enforcer Sheriff Ed Tom Bell, played by Tommy Lee Jones. He has to nut out exactly what transpired at the scene of the awry drug deal and how people fit into the puzzle.<br/><br/>This is a superior crime drama with fine, subtle performances by Brolin, Bardem and Jones. Garret Dillahunt as Sheriff Bell's sidekick, Deputy Wendell, provides some comic relief, as in the writers' other crime drama ""Fargo"". Kelly Macdonald, who plays Carla Jean Moss (Llewelyn Moss' wife) has a lovely, wifely Southern charm. The only false note in this film is by Woody Harrelson who plays Carson Wells, a peer of Chigurh, the man hunting Llewelyn. Harrelson seems to be playing a young Colonel Sanders or some such-a bit too showy for my liking.<br/><br/>It's the strangeness and surreality of the characters which makes this movie so appealing. You can't help wondering what certain characters were thinking-Llewelyn for instance...or the guy stopped by Chigurh when he is driving a police car ""Would you stand still?""..what the? Come on man...if you saw Chigurh in that situation wouldn't you wonder....<br/><br/>There are some gory scenes in this movies but it's more of a dramatic thriller with great characters.<br/><br/>Since the performances were so wonderfully subtle, I can't say that any performance in this movie screams ""Best Actor"" Academy Award (unlike, say, Sean Connery in ""The untouchables"").<br/><br/>I enjoyed this film, but can't really say that it is the masterpieces it is being described as."

We are told the story of a bag of money and drug dealers by the Mexico - USA border but not much details are given about who the bosses are and the way the business takes. In this context the movie is well made and well acted. The Coen brothers always had a special predilection for anti-heroes like those here performed by Tommy Lee Jones the old but very wise sheriff and Kelly Macdonald the wife of the man who tries to run away with the money while chased by Javier Bardem (the psychopath killer). These both characters are the more balanced ones, the more ""normal"" if we can say so. The end of the movie (if it can be called a true end) proves what I said above i. e. that the plot is secondary here, just only a conducting thread of the various scenes and sequences.

"smithj-27","8","0","5","22 March 2008"," A film worth renting
","Films with screenplays based off of novels are generally good movies, simply because the story is already created. However, that was something the Coen brothers never had any trouble with. The use of more slow, complicated actions, and little dialogue, is signature to their dark films with that subtle comedic attitude. This movie was a good example of how they tell a story through character development and odd circumstances. In the case that a west Texan, who didn't have much, stumbled upon money from a drug deal gone awry, the situation was probably told quite accurately. The darker Coen films I feel are more well done than others, like Raising Arizona or Intolerable Cruelty.<br/><br/>They had are able to somehow make a slow story board seem fast paced, based on direction and behavior development of the characters. Everything from wardrobe and the adaptation of the early 1980's to the cinematography and set were outstanding as well. The acting was superior to other films of 2007. Javier Bardem gave a superb performance. It's easy to say he's a good actor. For him, this role was more than words and interacting with other characters. Much of it was solitary, or little physical or vocal interaction. His facial expressions and consistent mannerisms make it evident he really grasped the role. Tommy Lee Jones also, had the same way of play the role. For him, as a Texan, it was much as role playing, but as returning to his roots and adapting them to this situation. Something, he did very well.<br/><br/>I found Stephen Root to be oddly casted in this film. Something about having Milton from Office Space, as a serious and dramatic billed actor didn't make much sense. It's not to say he did a poor job, in fact it's quite the contrary. Simply, it was difficult to get past his exterior and see him naturally in this type of scenario. He did play a role in The Ladykillers with Joel and Ethan Cohen, so they must have been aware of his range. The Coens have used actors typically seen in comedies before. Steve Buscemi was casted in Fargo, but has been seen in several voice character roles and a few Adam Sandler comedies. Yet, he was my favorite character in Fargo, and gave one of the best performances. He too, has been casted in multiple Coen Films.<br/><br/>My only real problem with this movie was something beyond the control of the script writers. The story itself seemed a bit scattered. Not enough of what happened was explained in a way that I expected to the Coen brothers to. I also wasn't satisfied with the ending. It didn't have to be happy, or sincere in any way, but absolutely nothing is resolved. What became investigation of the string of crimes Bardem's character committed? Tommy Lee Jone's retiring leaves the impression that he simply gave up, and the investigation is left open and unsolved.<br/><br/>If that is how it was intended, then it was shown perfectly. But because I found it hard to follow for literary reasons, I won't purchase this movie to add to my Coen Collection. It is, however, worth renting, if only to see the solid acting and the typical brilliant script and direction you often get from these two."
"Cary_Barney","7","0","3","17 March 2008"," Fine but no ""Fargo""
","""No Country for Old Men"" has so much of what the Coen Brothers at their best are about -- minutely calibrated suspense, sudden jolting violence, an unerring eye for quirky Americana, every frame and sequence and sound effect precise and just right -- that it takes a while after the film is over to put your finger on what's missing: the Coens. They've been too doggedly faithful to Cormac McCarthy's vision, and it's a vision that is finally less interesting than their own.<br/><br/>McCarthy is, at bottom, a deeply conservative writer. In novel after novel he paints a man's world where a man's gotta be a man and walk through the valley of death and face Evil with a capital E. The bleak, biblical language and laconic dialog elevate what is essentially pulp, and the problem with ""No Country..."" as a novel is he seemed to realize this two thirds of the way through and trash a perfectly good thriller setup as if it were something beneath him. The Coens follow in his footsteps, and to their credit the final section of the film makes the best of the derailed story; it's beautifully crafted and even moving. But one wonders what they might have done with the material had they let the story play out as it should have -- i.e., not suddenly killing off the protagonist off screen and giving over to the Sheriff's elegiac musings (though Tommy Lee Jones gives them fine voice).<br/><br/>The Coens have also created more interesting baddies than Anton Chigurh, who in the end is a cipher, another of McCarthy's stilted Embodiments of Evil. Javier Bardem has an amazing physical presence, which the Coens exploit wonderfully, but his English has a ways to go before his delivery can be as expressive as his face. He's finally only scary in a bogeyman sort of way, without the human complexity of a really compelling baddie. The movie inherits from the book the need to mythologize him into an invincible force, but it doesn't wash; there doesn't seem to be any reason why Josh Brolin's character, or even Woody Harrelson's, shouldn't be able to contend with him.<br/><br/>Once upon a time the Coens made ""Fargo"", which was everything this film is and more. There, they followed their own vision and offset the greed and blood with human sweetness and stupidity. William H. Macy's descent into the underworld was as close to true tragedy as anything portrayed in American film, and it was funny, too. Cormac McCarthy could learn a thing or two from the Coens."

","The first thing I'll say is that I enjoyed the movie. Why ? The chosen actors and their performances were good. Every thing else was just good as well. I was not so taken with the "" No Country for Old Men "" theme though. I just did not buy into it but I did not need to to enjoy the movie. I guess you could have titled the movie "" The Good Old Days "". The main Character was excellent in his execution of his role as well as all the other actors and that's what carried the film as far as I am concerned. The filming was sufficient for the actors to have a place to do their jobs and that's about it and the editing was adequate.I for one think that movies are a visual medium of entertainment and on that point the movie had little to offer but it did not subtract from the movies quality or my enjoyment of the movie.I would have liked a different ending but I guess I'd have to make my own movie to get that. I highly recommend this movie"

","Did you like the way the ""Sopranos"" ended? If not, you'll be as equally disappopinted in how this much anticipated film ended, in very much the same way the final episode of the Sopranos ended. Only the last two minutes of this otherwise very fine and well-crafted movie disappointed, but for that very reason, and that reason alone, would have to disagree with the Academy Award that it received for best picture.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem is nothing short of ""The Terminator,"" in his cold-blooded, relentless, almost machine like pursuit of the money, but he portrays a character that is more about blatant evil that is about the money. The money is secondary to his basic, driven, and enternal need to kill. He is frightening and horrific as a villain.<br/><br/>Tommy Lee Jones could have easily shared the ""Best Support Actor"" Academy Award with Bardem, particularly if his character had been better expanded at the very end of the film, which again, I found terribly disappointing.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin, too, deserves Oscar mentioning, but didn't get it, nor did we, at the end of the movie, find out what happens with his character, another big disappointment I had with the movie.<br/><br/>Not having seen the movie when it was first released, while anxiously awaiting its release on DVD, I had perhaps too high of expectations when finally viewing the movie at home. For me, it was the best movie I've ever seen, with the worse possible ending, taking this movie down perhaps two notches. Still, YOU'VE GOT TO SEE IT."

","The first time I watched it, I was taken aback by the brutality and seemingly over the top violence and so on. I enjoyed the suspense elements though, which are about the best 'jump out of your seat' experience on Blu-ray with lossless sound. I got lost towards the end and it ended up making me think this perhaps was overrated very badly.<br/><br/>I watched it again with an older person today, and they identified a lot with the Jones character. I started to as well. I was starting to think that Anton and Ed Tom were maybe the same ala Fight Club.. But after enough though, they are not. This is simply a multi-level story of insane violence and quick kills, while Jones is outside it, aged and ready to retire. Even if he does, he still has his fears and nightmares.<br/><br/>There's a good style lately, Departed and this. On the surface they're just a violent mess, and are treated as such. Deep down, there's enough to watch these movies many, many times. Soemtimes you need to watch a movie more than once to catch it all. Usually those are better movies, like Departed before this. On the second view, it's clear this is, like Departed, is a modern classic."

What were they (Academy) thinking? Someone needs to take the politics out of the voting. Javier Bardem won for Best Supporting Actor. Okay, that's a coin toss at best. Anyone could have won, ""but let's pick someone no one has ever heard of.""

The problem I had was the movie time was mostly watching the running and killing. That took up most of the 2-hours. The Sheriff was an afterthought and came on the scene intermittently in a tired way. Maybe that was what he meant by being ""overmatched"" (his words) when it came to keeping up with the bad guys. But, since most of the movie was watching the running, hiding, shooting and killing I thought the title should have been reflected there for the most part.<br/><br/>This is a good movie, and, the title would have made more sense if the Sheriff's perspective was told after the fact, but here the story was told in the present. And, after the opening narrative by the Sheriff, the narration left us. See? And, the Sheriff's catharsis - in the present - at the end closes the loop? Hmmmmno.<br/><br/>This is a good movie and the performances of all were excellent. I would say there was parity among Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, and yes, Woody Harrelson even though his part didn't last all that long.<br/><br/>This is a good movie and the pace was more than fine because I was kept on edge the whole time, and the scenes shifted often enough that nothing dragged.<br/><br/>This is a good movie, but in my opinion, not Oscar Worthy for Best Picture.<br/><br/>Violence: Yes; Sex: No; Nudity: No; Language: No"

","Search IMDb for this phrase using Word Search, Plots and among those listed will be ""No Country for Old Men."" Also listed are ""The Fugitive"" TV series and ""Les Miserables."" Surprisingly ""The Terminator,"" ""Kill Bill,"" and ""Hard Candy"" aren't in the list.<br/><br/>While NCFOM is much simpler in its story line than Les Mis, it's unique among this sub-genre of thriller/suspense films in its skilled direction and lack of Aesopian conclusion.<br/><br/>I've long been a believer in the artistry of direction. The actors, cinematographer, cameramen, grips, script girls, and caterers are managed by the director to produce his/her vision of the story. Every actor, who's appeared in a leading or supporting role in more than a couple of films, has one or more fine performances buried within, to be drawn out by the right director. In NCFOM we see a fine example or three.<br/><br/>Beyond the acting is the supporting imagery, pace, sound, and obviousness of presentation. In NCFOM we're dropped into one of the stark, arid parts of North America. Sitting in an air conditioned theater (be it a cineplex or at home) one knows that this is a harsh piece of country, despite the actors seeming unusually cool for the atmosphere.<br/><br/>Something has taken place, parts of which are obvious - parts not. A man, of whom we learn as the story unfolds that he is self sufficient and of the region, stumbles across this scene of violence and finds what might be his pot-at-the-end-of-the-rainbow. Although he already knows what will happen if he takes the pot, we soon learn that it's someone else's and they want it back. One of the men chosen to recover it is the Terminator - perhaps without a metal exo/endo-skeleton nor a databank brain, but seemingly just as indestructible and relentless in mission - except when he whimsically allows fate, or chance, to be tested.<br/><br/>Sarah Connor's would-be savior this time is a sheriff, who never actually comes in contact with either Sarah or the Terminator but plies us with terse procedural observations, possibly some unpracticed country wisdom, and obscure lessons couched in apocryphal stories.<br/><br/>Along the chase we slowly discover some of the truth behind some of the mysteries but for the most part none is resolved completely nor satisfactorily. This is not a bad thing, it merely points out that the story lacks a moral. It's a conceivable piece of life, it's violent, and difficult to understand the antagonists motivation (if any) and, thankfully, does not have a Hollywood ending. It's clear who the bad guy is but are there any good guys? Yes, if good is a relative term.<br/><br/>It is superb film-making, evoking peak performances on both sides of the lens. By all means see this with someone who likes to talk about film and art.<br/><br/>Was it the best picture of 2007? Was the best picture even nominated? The jury decided differently from the box office? IMDb votes are indecisive. Like NCFOM, we'll never know the answer."

","Admittedly I am spoiled when it comes to the Coen Brothers films. They reek of professional lensing, production values, etc. The set their own bar for comedy with ""Raising Arizona"". And ditto for serious, violent films in ""Blood Simple"". Am I a fan of No Country...? The jury's still out. However those things opined, it was the most captivating of all their films I've viewed (R. Arizona is at least on bar). And it was the most pointed story they've told yet. But, and I should state here I neither read the book upon which it is based, nor have I ever believed reading the original printed matter a film is based on should be done to enjoy or at least digest a movie- but, it just tapers off, with no satisfying resolution. And maybe that's OK. Carpenter did it with his film of the complete ""The Thing from another World"" movie ""The Thing"". That story like this could conceivably just go on and on. And in terminating No Country when they did I suppose they showed more of how the real world of violence and crime is then almost any film one could name. Nasty events do go unsolved and unresolved. But as I said I am spoiled- most of their films that are described as ""comedies"" leave me not laughing. Raising Arizona could never be that way I was convinced new masters of comedy had been unleashed. Nope. After waiting some time to see No Country I was excited- the ads, the talk, the Oscars- I was ready. I went, I saw, I laughed at times and was similarly urged to be repulsed. But. But- No Country as it turns out IS a good tale, with fine performances and the usual fine camera work. I'm just a tad programed to see a film not hang, but conclude. Hey! Maybe in the sequel, huh?"

","The Coen Brothers have crafted quite a film. It has terrific performances, great photography, and a good deal of suspense. Fortunately I was able to see this movie on Sunday before the Oscars, later that night they were announced the winners for screenplay, directing, supporting actor, and picture. So why does this movie fall short of a masterpiece? <br/><br/>Well it has a blend of action and drama. Josh Brolin finds a suitcase of drug money. After being chased by dealers and a murderous psychopath, He runs away to Mexico with his wife at his mother's house. Moving from motel room to motel room, Josh Brolin encounters several life and death situations. Just when it gets good Josh Brolin's character gets killed off-screen at the start of the third act. So I was let down that the man to root for was killed off, but what also contaminated the ending was that the bad guy didn't die. Sure he gets hurt in a car crash and then limps away. But that's it, we don't know if Brolin's wife was murdered, and it looks like their ending is left open for a sequel. A sheriff played by Tommy Lee Jones searches for Brolin. After failing to save him and catch the bad guy he gives up. Making it one ending anti-climatic ending. <br/><br/>So while this movie is not on par with ""Raising Arizona,"" I still believe this was a top notch effort with Bardem, Brolin, and Jones perfectly cast. Hope the Coen brothers have better work to come."

","I'm a big movie buff, but books are my first love; so when I see film adaptations of books I've read, I've often been disappointed. ""No Country For Old Men"" is an exception to the tired clichÃ© 'The book is always better'. The movie left out quite a lot, such as the teen runaway that accompanies Lewellyn on his trip to El Paso; but the movie captured the maudlin tone of the book. Many have commented on the odd ending of the movie; and the book is the same way. The book was an engrossing cat-and-mouse chase, but bogged down in the end. The somber ending of the movie captured the theme of the book, that the good does not always vanquish the evil.<br/><br/>The Coen Brothers are great artists, and when I heard they where doing this film, I knew they'd do a great job. And they did. They deserve the Oscars they've won. All the performances were spot on. I just find it odd that it was the best movie of 2007. Is this movie in the same league as ""The Godfather"", ""The Lost Weekend"", ""Schindler's List"", et al? Regardless of my opinion, it is now. Must have been a mediocre year, I guess.<br/><br/>As for Cormac McCarthy; I think he's a good writer, but some of his books (i.e. 'Blood Meridian'), were boring to me, but his greatest achievement, ""The Road"" will soon be a film. It is one of the most emotionally devastating and powerful literary experiences I've ever had. If it's done right, it too will be an Oscar contender. I'm on pins and needles waiting for that film, but I have doubts that it will be as good as the book. If the Coen Brothers were directing it, I might have higher hopes. Wait and see, I guess."

First of all, especially in Texas, if you kill a cop, your face will be plastered everywhere and they will hunt you down. In this movie, we have this psycho just driving around with no cares, getting into shootouts in a motel room and then in the street and NO ONE cares to call the cops? I mean, this psycho shoots three people in a motel room and then just sits down and relaxes without any notion that ""maybe I should leave the scene""? Where are the cops in this town? Also, the ending did not tie anything together, Tommy Lee Jones, who is a sheriff looking for this psycho, talks and talks about a dream he had and then all of sudden the movie just ends. Okay, so, what was the point of having Tommy Lee Jones character in the movie? I would have given this a ten, but those few things I pointed out prevented me from doing that. I still give this a 9 because of the great performances, story(for the most part), and the shootout sequences. All that was done exceptionally well, but it just needed a stronger ending."

The films is stunningly shot, set against southern deserts giving you a sense of helplessness as the heat beats down on our protagonist.

","This movie is a lot of imagery and metaphor. But make no mistake, it is all about Tommy Lee Jones' character.<br/><br/>Jones' character is a man who is the exact opposite of the antagonist. The antagonist, Chagur, is a master of killing. The ultimate comic book villain. Death incarnate. Jones plays an aging Superman. Someone who was a master at catching comic book villains back in his day.<br/><br/>However, in the end, Jones' realizes that even though he is Superman... that he is old and probably would die trying to catch Chagur... who is probably the strongest super-villain he's ever come across. So rather than try to catch Chagur, Jones' character decides to retire. Ultimately, to be haunted by dreams of a protagonist who should have died chasing evil... and chose not to. Jones turns from a powerful Superman into a gutless coward.<br/><br/>As I said before, there are tons of cool allegory in the movie. Even without it, the story is good. I only give it an 8 due to the ending, though. The movie really ended when Jones' character decides to retire. Perhaps the Coen brothers thought that showing how evil (Chagur) continues after good dies is important... but I didn't think it was necessary. Still a decent movie, though."
"tourproven","8","0","5","1 February 2008"," A brilliant film! One of the best in a long time...however-(Spoilers)
","Then why you ask do I only give a rating of 8/10?...To leave room for perfection. I should start off by saying that if you have not seen this movie yet, do not read anything about it or any of these reviews; just go see it you will be pleasantly surprised at the realism (despite the nature of the content). For me, a great movie unfolds in a way that I want it to. Thats not to say that it should be predictable, just that things happen in a way that is pleasing to you. Just like in any movie when the bad guy gets his just desserts. You don't have to know how it is going to happen, just that it happens. However, you also don't want the impending doom of your bad guy to be implied either. For me, I want to see every step of his demise. This movie gets it first bad mark in the way that it handles the hero's exit from the film. The story behind the hero's demise is quite good, and quite believable. The problem is how it was shot on screen. As a viewer you are going to miss out on this entire scene. It was like showing up to a scene of a crash the day after it happened. Sure there's skid-marks and broken glass, but how did it unfold? I want to see. The second mark against this otherwise perfect movie, bringing this movie down to an 8/10 is two smaller issues I had. The first was the fact that the hero went back to the scene of the crime at all; then didn't go through all the money and change the money into his own duffel bag. His decision to go back at all wasn't congruent with his clever thinking the rest of the movie. The guy wanting water was an obvious goner. Additionally, I was hoping that Woody Harrelson's character (who is seemingly brilliant) would have not been so easily compromised. Having said all that, the bad guy is fantastically evil and the sound (or lack there of) in this movie is awesome. Silence proves to be much more sinister than any music score would have ever been. It is still one of the top movies of the year."

","A. O. Scott of the NY Times said that, and I can only agree. In trying to think of flaws in this film, my only qualm is that it could have been a little less gory--do we really need to see, in extreme close-up, various wounds being attended to? I had to avert my eyes.<br/><br/>However, there were other equally bloody scenes in which the gore was actually funny (think wood-chipper from ""Fargo"").<br/><br/>Aside from my squeamishness, I thought this film was perfect. I can't recommend any improvement. And I can't say that about many films, ever.<br/><br/>What most impressed me was that the Texas dialogue was perfect. Perhaps Texans don't always speak in such shockingly beautiful words, but they could have. Tommy Lee Jones' character was authentic, and could have said those exact words. But aside from the script, what Tommy Lee Jones added is incalculable.<br/><br/>The same is true of Javier Bardem. His lines were few, and were not poetic. His non-verbal interpretation of the part is a breathtaking accomplishment on its own, and he is ready for the Rogue's Gallery of the greatest villains of all time.<br/><br/>Until I checked the credits afterwards, I was not sure who played Llewellyn. OMG. Josh Brolin? Who would have thought he had such talent within him? I could go on and on, but this is the best 2007 film I have seen so far.

It might be just the tale you get told by a broken man at a bar instead of just something that happens on the big screen.<br/><br/>Some characters could have done some better if they had gotten some more screen time though.

","Filmmakers Joel & Ethan Coen might be called ""freaky little people"" by Josh Brolin the leading actor of their critically enamored ""No Country For Old Men"", but it's all in awe respect for their craftsmanship, nonconformity, and originality. The Cojones Brothers, I mean the Coen Brothers, did again have the cojones to architect an unconventional American tale about the quest for wealth even when violence & crime is presented as an unbreakable barrier to reach the monetary goal. Those are the same underlying themes that the Coens masterfully delivered to us a far decade ago in the 1996 gem ""Fargo""; which was based in Minnesota and North Dakota. This time the Coens set their sights on the lone star state. ""No Country For Old Men"" follows Llewelyn Moss, a thickheaded Texas hunter who stumbles upon some dead bodies in a drug deal gone bad, and with it a huge chunk of change in a bag filled with $2 mill. Could it be no mas overdue credit card charges for Moss? Well, not when you have a no-holds-barred vengeful psycho named Anton Chigurh also in pursuit of the money and will liquidate any ""head or tale"" that gets in his way, got it friendo! Town Sheriff Ed Tom Bell realizes the hot water that Moss has gotten into and tries to stop Llewelyn from feeling the Anton wrath. However, Moss' ignorance and stubbornness do become vital deterrents in his seek to take the money and run freely. Will Anton kill Llewelyn? Does Sheriff Bell come to the rescue? Why the Anton ""heads and tales"" coin shenanigans in deciding to kill people? I am not going to provide answers to those questions in my review because it will be a ""no country for spoil men"" in film reviewing if I spill the T.M.I. beans. I must ground in that ""No Country For Old Men"" had a cavalry of country bold acting men. Josh Brolin kept rocking and broling and did not escape ""money acting"" as Moss. Tommy Lee Jones was once again in the valley of stellar with his performance. Javier Bardem was a tour-de-force in portraying one of the top antagonist characters of all time in the hardcore ruthless Anton Chigurh. Let's just say that Chigurh caused a lot of chigore in his coined victims. Woody Harrelson, Tess Harper, and Kelly Macdonald also did lasso up some fine supporting work to the country. But back to those little freaky people called the Coen Brothers. Their well-respected sibling talent has brought well-deserved bling bling to the Coen finances. Joel and Ethan's screenplay and directorial configurations of ""No Country For Old Men"" proficiently state many beliefs on violence themes from the simpleton law enforcement of the early 1920's to the complex serial killer realities of the latter part of the century. ""No Country For Old Men"" is a movie experience that will stay engraved in your cerebral movie land for a long time, so I do highly recommend a viewing.

","I don't mean to seem condescending by explaining this movie, but it bothered me how bothered people were over it.<br/><br/>I think this film can mostly be explained by the dream the sheriff had in the end. The dream about riding at night with his father. He mentioned that he was 20 yrs older than the age at which his father died. In the dream his father rode ahead of him and he imagined that his father would be setting up camp for them somewhere in the distance. The point is that we all expect our future to happen a certain way and we are comforted knowing this. The fact is the future hasn't happened yet and its stranger than you can ever imagine. The world had turned into something the sheriff didn't recognize or expect and he felt lost in it. When he is speaking with the man in the wheelchair who had been shot while on duty, the man in the wheelchair says something to the effect,""you try hard to get back what you lost or what's been taken from you that while your busy worrying about it you lose so much more"". He goes on to tell a story about their uncle that was killed on his own porch maybe 50 years in the past. The point of his story is not that the world is an awful place, but that it didn't just change before the sheriff's eyes, or despite him or because of him and that it is egocentric to believe so. Its about growing old. Hence the title. The Sheriff is the protagonist. Its quite beautiful actually. Assign whatever symbolism you want to the rest of the characters.<br/><br/>It makes perfect sense to me."

","Okay no film is perfect and no film ever will be. But No Country for Old Men comes Damn close to perfection. The Coen Brothers are among the greatest filmmakers that Hollywood has ever seen and it shows with this amazing work of art. Everything was stunning. The story, the acting, the cinematography, the suspense. There were very few flaws with this film. And the few flaws that are in this film are hidden so well you barely even notice them.<br/><br/>Plot: Well this film is basically a lock for Best Adapted Screenplay and you'll see why when you see the film. It's adapted almost exact from Cormac McCarthy's novel but they bring to the screen so well and that is where the strength comes from.<br/><br/>Acting: The acting was spectacular. Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin, Woody Harrelson, and Kelly MacDonald were all fantastic. But the biggest surprise easily came from Javier Bardem who played the ruthless assassin Anton Chigurh. He played the character in a way where I was completely frightened by the character whenever he came on screen. Kudos NCFOM cast.<br/><br/>Production Quality: The cinematography in this film is just like all of the Coen Brothers' films. It is beautiful. From Blood Simple and Miller's Crossing to Fargo and now NCFOM they excel every time at making a beautiful landscape and picture. The music is not very noticeable but the lack of doesn't hurt the film at all. In fact it almost helps it. It feels more real and hard hitting without the music. This film is very violent but it never gets over the top or tries to glorify it. In fact it makes you scared of it. The violence is represented by Anton Chigurh and he scared me. He bases his moral decisions off of the flip a coin showing a man with no morals and no real feeling for any human being. Nearly everyone he comes across is murdered by him showing how quickly violence effects us all as a society.<br/><br/>Again this film is probably the Coen Brothers' most violent film but it never gets over the top and I suggest that you see and have an open mind and listen to what they say and interpret. Because this is a very faithful literary adaptation and is not in anyway a Hollywood film.<br/><br/>For my final verdict this is an excellent film and it gives me chills just thinking about how amazing it is. Everything was nearly perfect. The last two films the Coen Brothers have made have been less than decent but I really felt their heart in this film and felt that every little detail was handeled with care and attention.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Aguas","8","0","3","28 January 2008"," Solid effort at a Cormac McCarthy tale
","The characters in the movie were excellently portrayed by all actors. The only thing that keeps this from being a 10 is Tommy Lee Jones relationship to the main plot line. If the characters were better tied together I would have given it a perfect score, but there was too much left for interpretation by the movie goers. This fault aside, Bardem is clearly the muscle in the movie. Although his exact motivation appears to be money and greed, you get the feeling that there is something more primal to Bardem's path of aggression. Bardem's cool calculating ways are contrasted by Josh Brolin's gritty understanding of his precarious situation. The grit shown by Brolin is typical of the modern day southern Texan. Woddy Harrelson makes a bit more than a cameo appearance, but his small part accomplishes what the Cohen's intended. Bardem's confrontation with Harrelson shows just how competent the maniacal killer really is."

Enough with the praises, now to the point, Whats so special about it? I would say everything. Perfect direction & brilliant acting, & the thing that should get the most recognition is the evil portrayed by Javier Bardem. This man seems so evil that if he's around, be in a different city or country altogether! You wouldn't want to say good morning or hello to him, even if he's in a good mood. Pure Evil. I will not spoil it for you by giving anything away but can only say if you truly want to watch a brilliant & excellent movie, go for it.

","The Coen Bros have done it again with their trademark use of finesse and cleverness in film-making. No Country for Old Men is about the chaos that ensues after a Texan hunter discovers a stash of heroine and a case of money at a drug deal gone wrong.<br/><br/>As with other movies from the Coen Brothers-Fargo, The Hudsucker Proxy, Miller Crossing- they play with the highfalutin theme of fate. It would be oversimplifying to say that in this movie, the hunter becomes the hunted. It is much more. It might be saying slightly more to say that the Texan hunter represents the bravest of people while the psychopath that hunts him represents the terrifying frivolity of fate and death. There is also an aging county sheriff who closes the theme loop but you will have to watch the movie to know how.<br/><br/>This movie has very high ratings on IMDb.com but that isn't always meaningful with regards to recent movies due to the total lack of taste and intellect in the avid movie-goer. In my high opinion, however, this time I am inclined to agree with the movie website. The basics of movie making come from live theater- good script, good casting, and good acting; sound and special FX serves primarily functionality and credibility. This movie does just that. It is classic movie making treating modern themes.<br/><br/>No Country for Old Men is very violent and quite unabashedly nihilistic; it is not for the faint at heart. You have been warned. For these reasons exactly, this movie is only moderately popular.<br/><br/>-G.G."
"j-lacerra","10","0","2","27 January 2008"," The Right Country for this Old Man
","This is a terrific movie, which has almost everything going for it: great performances, mesmerizing characters, suspense, gore, humor, philosophy, great cinematics. Josh Brolin is perfect as everyman given opportunity to rise above his lot in life, Javier Barden is the best conscienceless assassin seen in years, Tommy Lee Jones as the aging sheriff tired of his job and humanity in general, and even Woody Harrelson as a cock-sure tracker given his comeuppance.<br/><br/>The story weaves a web around these characters, who are developed well enough for one to care about them, and, while not overly complex, demands your full attention. We are rooting for Moss to carry off his scheme to keep the money. We want to see Barden get his. We want Jones to do it. In this the Coen brothers do not let us have our way. They opt for an ending more consistent with some other classics that allow us to wonder.<br/><br/>I will take a chance and make a few odd connections that most reviewers here seem to have missed. I think the Coens borrow from some other great movies in putting together this wonderful pic: Clearly, the Peckinpah influence of the Getaway (Steve McQueen and Ali McGraw) is overwhelming. In fact, the hotel in El Paso appears to be the very same one as that used in the Getaway (presided over by Dub Taylor then). And then it's out the window and into a beige pickup on the way to the border, just like the Getaway. The oft hidden bag of money is also a Getaway touch, as are the gun store visit and the fire outside the drugstore.<br/><br/>The Terminator is present in many scenes and themes regarding the relentless assassin. Even the girl's mother contributing to tipping off the baddies about the whereabouts of the hero is right out of T1. See also the murder of the young cop in the station, and the hijacking of several cars, including a police cruiser.<br/><br/>Of course, Scarface contributes the drug premise and one motel room massacre. And there is even a bit of Easy Rider in the windy desert dope scenes. Several nods to Crash: trying to save the injured person in a vehicle, and several well done auto collisions.<br/><br/>With the Coen brother's skill and this cast, it is all woven into a unique and great movie. I accept the ending, but would have preferred another ... no biggie."
"bseagrave54","10","0","2","27 January 2008"," Get Blown Away with No Country for Old Men
","Violent, clever, gritty, brilliant, intense and genius: these are all words that can be used to describe Joel and Ethan Cohen's latest movie No Country for Old Men. The film is based around Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) and Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) as their fates are intertwined by the events that unfold. Llewelyn finds a satchel filled with $2 million from a drug deal that went horribly wrong. The problem is that Anton, a cold-blooded killer, is on the hunt for the money. The film follows Llewelyn as he attempts to stay one step ahead of Anton and his attempts to reclaim the money.<br/><br/>The Cohen Brothers do an outstanding job of capturing the chaotic events that take place within the film. They use dialogue sparingly, which causes the conversations to be that much more effective. Every exchange is memorable and remarkable. <br/><br/>Javier Bardem won a golden globe for best supporting actor for his role as Anton Chigurh, and he deserved it. There was not a moment in the film in which he was not Anton Chigurh, the psychotic mass murder. Some of the ways in which Anton off's his enemies are horribly disturbing, yet immaculately clever. Anton is a man on a mission to get the 2 million dollars back, and nothing will get in his way.<br/><br/>The Cohen Brothers pull off another great movie to go with their stellar catalog that already includes O Brother, Where Art Thou?, The Big Lebowski, Fargo and Raising Arizona. The movie pulls together a great cast including Javier Bardem (Collateral), Josh Brolin (Grindhouse: Planet Terror), Tommy Lee Jones (Men in Black), Woody Harrelson (North Country), and Kelly Macdonald (Nanny McPhee). No Country for Old Men has been nominated for eight Academy Awards, tied for the most this year with There Will Be Blood. The nominations include best picture of the year, best achievement in direction, best supporting actor (Javier Bardem), and best screen play. <br/><br/>Ninety percent of the movie is excellent; however, the end is confusing. If you are going to watch this movie, watch it at least twice before you make a final judgment on it!"
"joebloggscity","9","0","2","27 January 2008"," Intriguing and intelligent story of a chase for one man, the money and the bodies piling up in its wake.
","The past year (2007) has not been vintage for great films however there have been the odd exceptions and this violent story is one that really sticks out from the crowd. This maybe a Coen Brothers movie but unlike the bulk of their previous output, this is no comedy.<br/><br/>Story centres around two men, one (""Llewelyn"") who finds a bag full of drug money whilst another hunts after him to retrieve it. The catch? The hunter is a violent amoral killer who just piles up the bodies in his wake to get to his goal. Add into this, Llewelyn's wife, small-town sheriff's and a host of bewildered town folk just trying to get on with their lives.<br/><br/>The chase goes from the back-country to the towns to over the Mexican border, and along the way the audience is taken on an unpredictable journey. This cat and mouse game between hunter and hunted never lets up, and the grizzly deaths along the way highlight clearly for all the depths to which the hunter is willing to go to to get what he wants.<br/><br/>With a story like this it won't appeal to all. However, I still strongly recommend it. Javier Bardem as the hunter is nothing less that sensational and plays the part to perfection. There has probably not been a more successfully unsettling character on the big screen since The Silence of the Lambs. For me he must be a favourite for the best acting Oscar. He is more than ably supported amongst others by Tommy Lee Jones (as a local sheriff) with a very notable performance by the lovely Kelly Macdonald as the poor suffering wife of the hunted man.<br/><br/>Add in some wonderful scenery and camera work, as well as some great script writing, and you get nothing less that a vintage piece of cinema. <br/><br/>I can't recommend this highly enough, it really is a great movie. Some may not stomach the unsettling atmosphere, but I would say it is worth the effort."
"espenshade55","10","0","2","27 January 2008"," It took some time to ponder
","Due to the lateness of this comment, and due to the fact the movie will likely soon be out of theater's and on the DVD shelves I fear this review will be seldom read. I saw the film opening day, then three more times during its run at the box office and only now do I feel apt to give it the praise it deserves.<br/><br/>I would go so far to venture that this is a perfect film, this is the only time that I have said this, and might be the only time I ever will. This film is crafted beautifully in all aspects of the film-making process from the opening shots to the ending monologue. Some have said that this is the Coen's best film since ""Fargo"", I would say ""Fargo"" was training for this film. ""No Country"" has a far more pessimistic view of the world, and is secular in more ways than one. The film resonates with a feeling of controlled chaos, in the end I feel it's because the film is ABOUT chaos.<br/><br/>""No Country"" boasts some of the most intense, gut wrenching scenes ever crafted and its built out of specificity. The simple creaking of floor boards, the sound of a light bulb being unscrewed, the movement of a crumpled candy wrapped unfolding all add to this world that the Coen's, with the help of Roger Deakins' flawless photography were able to build from top to bottom.<br/><br/>The most prominent criticism I hear from my peers in film school, or from the general public comes from the confusing ending. I feel obligated to address this because I truly believe that the ending is what made this movie what it was. What ultimately made me fall in love with this film was the fearlessness in the story telling and the clarity of mind which allowed Joel and Ethan to see deeper into the world than the rest of us choose to, or want to see. In the end, the film is about chaos, the antagonist is fate, age, and finally circumstance. Thus I believe it to be a misinterpretation to say the ending came out of left field, or was simply erroneous to the plot, because I believe the real plot lies beneath the obvious one.<br/><br/>It is a film about the way humanity deals and copes with an ever changing world that may eat us whole or simply leave us behind. Its a pondering with little commentary, its existentialism in its truest form. It questions without fear, and bravely leaves the audience to question."

"TonesH","9","0","2","24 January 2008"," The Coen Brothers at their Best
","I have to admit that I am not the biggest fan of the Coen Brothers. Though I enjoyed the BiG Lebowski and Fargo, I didn't think that they were the greatest pieces of cinema. But what I have noticed in their work is an exploration of the idea of characters existing in a moral miasma, where their sense of morality does not quite fit, or where there is none altogether. We see the comedy of a man with simple morals in The Big Lebowski, a man with dreams of raising people to greatness in a world of distanced mediocrity in Barton Fink. Fargo and Miller's Crossing come closer to this work, the former being trying to be not too bad in an immoral world, and the latter just trying to have things turn out alright in the same. All of these films however missed out on something which I think they capture incredibly well in this film; I just don't think it's any one thing. This is a pure exercise in existential cinema, and every feature contributes towards it.<br/><br/>The first thing I took note of was the character of Anton, who immediately struck me as a sort of Hannibal Lector type character. He is so exceptional at what he does that the wise know they cannot beat him, and the foolish fail in trying. Yet Lector cannot sustain believability because he is not human; he is so good that he never gets hurt. The Coens did exceptionally well at showing that he is not invincible, and in the end it is the simplest scenarios that challenge him the most, as shown in the story told by the Sheriff about killing the steer. Even something as simple as his haircut, which is so boyish, is used to great effect. He is simultaneously real and unreal.<br/><br/>The Sheriff and Moss are both excellent counter-points to the world in which they live in. Anton is an amoral killing machine, and these other two could hardly be considered moral. Moss knows that what he is doing is wrong, and yet he never feels any guilt for having done it. In this situation he is thrust into the raw need to survive. And the Sheriff, despite being a man of the law, has no lofty principles. His only concern is to protect a man who isn't even his friend because he can. All of the characters, and the actors who portray them are terrific in this film.<br/><br/>The pacing contributes to this film brilliantly. In an amoral world no event is more important than another. Nothing is built up, and nothing is lingered upon. In a film with a high body count every death, though gruesome, seems to be just a matter of fact. This person dies for this reason. Whether this is a shame or not is not really at issue. The audience, not the movie makers, choose whether to care for the drug-dealers who come after Moss, or the man in the truck he asks for help, or many of Anton's innocent victims. The Coens seem to have taken a page from Kurosawa and Leone by not lingering on violence itself, but they seem to go a step further and not linger on the build-up. Violence occurs as paced and as simply as the horse-ride or the hunt in the mountains.<br/><br/>The visuals provide an interesting contribution to the film. The landscapes are sweeping and desolate, as are the gritty urban scenes, where caravan upon caravan, bungalow upon bungalow flow into the horizon. This is the world in which the action takes place, and it is a world in which monumental events are shocking up close, and yet lost in the horizon. The lawmen never have a chance of catching Anton because he destroys everything near him, and then disappears into the distance. HIs weapons capture this perfectly, being silent and quick, leaving no further evidence that the bodies they leave behind.<br/><br/>Everything in this film contributes towards this being a truly inspired piece of cinema. I recommend that everyone watch this!"

","If there's one thing that the Coen brothers do best with their latest project ""No Country For Old Men,"" it's prove to Hollywood that good crime films don't necessitate flashy action with awesome stunts or insanely intricate mysteries. This is also, in a sense, what the film speaks to.<br/><br/>""No Country"" (which takes place in 1980) is about a man (Josh Brolin) who appears to be a poor southerner living in a trailer that comes across a drug deal gone wrong. He finds and takes a briefcase with a couple million inside. Little does he know that a serial killer (Javier Bardem) is on his trail and the film tells the story of this pursuit. Also in the background yet central to the film's ideas is the story of an old, small-time sheriff played by Tommy Lee Jones who is trying to follow their trail. <br/><br/>The Coen brothers make every shot count in the way these two men go about getting what they want and it's very straightforward--no tricks--there is nothing up the brilliant script's sleeve. In other words, what you see is exactly what you get with ""No Country"" and naturally the Coen brothers don't feel obligated to explain. It makes the film difficult to truly understand and appreciate with just one viewing, but once you stop worrying about what the characters are going to do and start paying attention to how and why they're doing it, that's when ""No Country"" really stands out as a film that undoubtedly speaks to this time and likely all time to come."

","Tommy Lee Jones, as always, delivered a convincing portrayal of a 'Tommy Lee Jones'-character. Big surprise for me was Josh Brolin. Living in the South, my kinsmen and I always have a good laugh at those actors who attempt to pull off the Southern dialect. In the last few years, more and more actors are starting to get it down. Prior to that, it was pure comedy--almost like trying to get Brett Favre to pull off a British accent. Brolin, however, really delivered a convincing performance of someone you might actually run into in the South (Texas, more specifically).<br/><br/>Call me old-fashioned, but I've had enough of the movies without any sort of closure at the end of the film. I can deal with the blur between protagonist and antagonist in some films, but this one really wasn't one of those. Good guys and bad guys were pretty clearly defined during the film from a traditional values perspective. I realize that in the real world the bad guys don't always pay for what they've done, but I'm going to the movies to escape the real world. I get enough of that on the news. Let me leave the theatre with a good feeling instead of feeling angry. There's nothing creative about stirring that emotion in film-making (or writing)...that's easy.<br/><br/>Despite the ending, there were scenes that I loved and/or to which I could relate. One pivotal scene--defining the film title so vividly--was the one between Jones' character and that of Barry Corbin. If you're a Southern man, you may find as I did that this is perhaps the most definitive scene of your identity in the modern film era. This simple little scene alone made the film to me; otherwise, I'd have given it a 6."

","If it's a Tommy Lee Jones movie, I figure to get my money's worth in entertainment value. ""No Country For Old Men"" gave me every penny back and some more. It is as though I felt it rather than saw it. Some titles seem added at the last minute--not this one. Ed Tom Bell, Anton Chigurh, Llewelyn Moss, and Ellis are proof that old men have been rendered obsolete and impotent by the violence and emptiness of the culture. Jones plays a man coming to grips with that reality while Bardem and Brolin play men who haven't begun to consider that truth yet. Character after character adds to the grit. Ellis and Carson Wells add some humor and insight, but you know there is no hope for them either. How about a madman who carries a compressed gas cylinder and has a man stand up willingly to take a metal rod to the brain? Even the border crossing felt real. And in the end does the SWAT team show up to save the day? That's not real so it doesn't happen. Who knows what happens to Chigurh as he walks away from the boys arguing about who lost a shirt? That's the feel of reality in a country with no room for old men. This is one of the most satisfying films I have seen in a very long time. The only weak spot was the off-screen death of Moss, but the Chigurh ""call it"" encounter with the old man at the gas station more than covered the blemish."

","I want to address my comments to future viewers of this film. I believe there are two types of moviegoers. One wants to go with the flow and go wherever the movie goes; the other type of moviegoer wants to be challenged all the way and have points of discussion at the end. (I suppose I am both type; I am not saying one type of moviegoer is ""better"" than the other.) <br/><br/>""No Country of Old Men"" is a challengingmovie, and would definitely intrigue the second type of moviegoers. Moviegoers will not be able to access all its elements in one viewing. The plot is particularly challenging as evidenced by all the controversial comments herein. But more changing is the theme of the movie. If I may add a comment: the title of the film is particularly relevant. Be advised that the plot is totally separate from the theme.<br/><br/>This movie is breathtaking. There is too much to absorb on the first viewing. First the direction; I don't suppose Hitchcock could better the Coen brothers during the suspenseful sequences. The cinematography is magnificent. The entire acting ensemble is wonderful. And the wonderful, wonderful script.<br/><br/>There really is no wasted moments in the film. But please be forewarned: this film is not immediately accessible. But it is ultimately more satisfying. I can't wait to see it again!"

","No Country For Old Men is a very refreshing film, especially for its courage to be non-formulaic. There is indeed much to like about the picture as evidenced by the many great reviews it has received.<br/><br/>However, in replaying the film in my mind there were two things that I thought were problematic beyond redemption.<br/><br/>Firstly, the killer, Anton Chigurh, had zero character development. It's fine that he speaks little and certainly his actions convey a lot, but I desperately needed to know more about him, how he became this unique psychopath.<br/><br/>Secondly, Chigurh does not face any resistance to his many acts of violence, except once. In fact, whenever he strikes it is as if he is in a ghost town or the whole world has turned its back on him to give him privacy. This could happen a few times surly, but not constantly like it does.<br/><br/>I really was rooting for this film to work completely, but unfortunately these holes were more than I could circumvent."

","The Coen brothers ""No Country for Old Men"" is a wonderful thriller. It deserves to be nominated for Best Picture and is deserving of a nomination in a number of other categories. The acting, directing, writing, and cinematography are all excellent. The standout performance is from Javier Bardem who plays the relentless sociopath Anton Sigur. He qualifies as one of the greatest villains in cinematic history. The film ranks up there with ""Fargo"" as the Coen Brothers best. The film is incredibly suspenseful and intense. There have been comments from a number of people in regards to the ending being weak.

","It's almost like, after all their films the Coen brothers have finally had their ""Saving Private Ryan"". This film has none of the illusions of youth present in all of their previous work.<br/><br/>The characters make up the story, the plot is almost irrelevant. Each character has a small story to tell, and the plot just moves along between these little stories. The actors playing each character do a near perfect job. Not any one stand-out performance amongst such great performances.<br/><br/>The bitterness, joy, sorrow, greed, love, hope, despair in the lives of these people give way to the sort of randomness that life brings all of us. Everything that defines our journey left up to a coin toss. I can't stress how much this film showcases that life and death is often left to chance and luck.<br/><br/>Jim Jarmusch has been doing these kind of films for years, hopefully now those films will start to resonate with audiences as well as this film has. Somewhere along the way filmmakers decided that the story mattered more than the characters. Most of those filmmakers are wrong.<br/><br/>Maturity comes at a cost, however. The humor and absurdity so apparent in previous Coen films is almost completely gone. What's left is tragedy on a Shakespearen level. Don't expect a ""Fargo"" or ""Raising Arizona"". You won't feel good after the movie's over. There is no sense that justice is done and that ""good"" prevailed over ""evil"".<br/><br/>I've seen thousands of films, and I now have a new entry into my top ten.

The performance by Javier Bardem was very convincing and enhanced the film significantly. Tommy Lee was an interesting casting decision, but turned out to pay dividends as he fit his roll perfectly.

"ennyman","8","0","2","1 January 2008"," Powerful Book Adaptation with Fumbled Ending
","Cormac McCarthy's book No Country for Old Men is an incredible story so very well told. I listen to audio books and this one made me want to keep driving. I could hardly wait for the morrow's commute.<br/><br/>It's one of the classic thriller story lines. An ordinary person accidentally gets caught up in extraordinary circumstances. Dustin Hoffman in Marathon Man is a nail-biter example of this genre. A Simple Plan, with Bill Paxton and Billy Bob Thornton, is another.<br/><br/>And like any exceptional story, No Country has memorable characters. Llewelyn Moss is the unfortunate man who while hunting comes across a dope deal gone bad in the expansive back country of South Texas, and ends up with a satchel containing two million dollars in cash. There's a lesson here, though it is never stated as such: if you ever find a couple million dollars that are not yours, it's best to just stay out of it. Even though everyone involved in the transaction appears shot up and pretty much finished off, Moss knows that there will likely be others coming for the money. Little does he know how bad one of these others is.<br/><br/>The guy who keeps you sitting straight up in your seat, and may keep you awake at night after, is Javier Bardem as Anton Chiguhr. Think sugar and chigger, and you have this pathological, human version of The Terminator, relentless in pursuit and seemingly indestructible. Nothing sweet about this man whose conscience is dead and determination unstoppable. Your heart rate increases every time he's on the screen.<br/><br/>No Country for Old Men has been receiving fabulous reviews. The Coen brothers (Fargo, O Brother, Where Art Thou?) wrote the screenplay and directed this first rate film. Like another current book adaptation, Charlie Wilson's War, there is much that has to be sifted out and only hinted at, lest we have something tiresome to watch after a while. The Coens were successful at creating the emotional tension that is generated by the book.<br/><br/>How did they do it? One noteworthy item is the total absence of a music soundtrack. They deserve high praise for avoiding the commercial temptation to make a music bed that would generate additional revenues afterward. Instead, they went the direct opposite way with this film. No music, no sound at all in the opening or closing credits. No fake strings section to tip viewers off that something bad is coming. The tension is created totally by the intersection of characters and circumstances. And it does get intense.<br/><br/>In terms of execution the film was flawless. Congrats to the Coens for their ability to bring everyone together and pull off this kind of feat.<br/><br/>But there were a number of problems for me with this film adaptation. First, Tommy Lee Jones as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell. I mean, I just couldn't get past that this was Tommy Lee Jones playing a caricature of himself. He has been in too many movies where he's this hard boiled veteran whose seen too much of life. It is through his eyes that we see the story unfold. As a central character he plays this role well, but I know him as an actor from The Fugitive to Men In Black and, gosh, couldn't we find anyone else to do this? Sorry, guys. That's how it was for me.<br/><br/>Second, some have criticized the short amount of time Woody Harrelson is on screen. Yep. He is a more important character in the book. Like William Hurt's brief appearance in Syriana, it was not necessary to have such star power here. O.K., it maybe sells more tickets at the box office? I really liked this character in the book, and Harrelson does play Carson Wells the bounty hunter very well, but I just don't know.<br/><br/>I consider both of these criticisms relatively minor compared to my one major criticism. It simply ended too fast in too confusing of a manner. I think a tight, fast ending is usually great in films so that they do not drag on after the final rush. The problem here is a tight, fast and confusing ending. If I had not read the book, I would not have known what happened. And I am not talking about the scene where Chiguhr is hit by the car. I'm referring to the preceding homicides that end the cat-and-mouse drama.<br/><br/>The reason this is a problem is that, in my opinion, the last emotion one should have after this kind of a thrill ride is that same relief you get when the roller coaster slams back into the station and they unlatch the mechanisms that keep you in the car. Relief. Catch your breath. Instead of a big ""wow,"" I left the theater perplexed and disappointed, with jumbled thoughts. Instead of being in awe at the way they created such a fabulous film, I walked out baffled, dampened by the lack of clarity in the films last scenes. This should not have happened.<br/><br/>I still think it a powerful film and worth seeing if you like this kind of story. It will put you on the edge of your seat."

"Pavel-8","8","0","6","28 December 2007"," What's the most you ever lost on a coin toss?
","""No Country for Old Men"" is a not an over-hyped blockbuster movie. If you have seen the trailer, you probably thought it looked rather strange. You would be right, but in a wonderful way.<br/><br/>The movie is difficult to pigeonhole, but the story, set in 1980 in rural Texas, is fairly straightforward. Josh Brolin plays Llewelyn Moss, a rugged native who stumbles across a deserted murder scene where he discovers and absconds with a case full of money. From that point on, two men head up two very different methods of pursuit. Tommy Lee Jones is small town sheriff Ed Tom Bell (phenomenal name), who is trying to figure out what happened. Javier Bardem, whom you might recognize from ""The Sea Inside"" or a small role in ""Collateral"", is a ferociously single-minded individual who has been hired by less than scrupulous people to track down the missing cash.<br/><br/>The movie is directed by the Coen Brothers, who have put together high quality offbeat films like ""O Brother Where Art Thou"", ""Fargo"", and ""Blood Simple"". In those movies and many of their others, the brothers combine familiar movie elements into a single amalgam that defies being defined as a single genre. With ""No Country for Old Men"", they have done the same thing, creating a movie that might be best described as a neo-western. Its deliberate pace, scenic framing, and South Texas location call to mind classic westerns. The tagline for the movie is that ""There are no clean getaways,"" which implies that this is a heist movie. There are parts of that genre, and there are major components of a chase picture, all tweaked to fit the technologically crude era of 1980.<br/><br/>Now, that's the setup, but is this offbeat movie any good? The critics sure think so. Plenty of critics societies have already named this the best picture of 2007, including groups from from New York, Chicago, Boston, Dallas, D.C., and the National Board of Review. It's also probably the current favorite to win the Best Picture Oscar, for praiseworthy reasons that are easy to spot and completely justified.<br/><br/>The three lead performances have grabbed the headlines, and understandably so. Javier Bardem is absolutely terrifying in his atypical villainous role. There is no gimmicky mask or superpower, just pure evil. With merely a look or a stride, he exudes menace, more force of nature than mere bad guy. He is a bad dude, both fantastic and frightening. Because Bardem is so good, he overshadows Josh Brolin, who disappears into his self-confident Texas denizen, playing the chasee with a confidence that makes him an excellent anti-hero. Tommy Lee Jones is stellar as usual. He embodies a world-weary sheriff with one of the best combinations of drawl and lingo that you will ever hear. His drawl is accompanied by a script that is taken in large part directly from the book on which the film is based. The words are rife with a vernacular that could not be more perfect, eliciting grins from the viewer with both their humor and suitability. Even when you don't know what is said, you know precisely what it means. Of these three turns, Bardem has won many awards already, and will almost certainly be nominated for and win an Academy Award. Even though Brolin and Jones have not yet received many accolades, both are worthy of such honors; the problem being that that they are frequently eclipsed by Bardem's chilling portrayal.<br/><br/>Due to the magnetic acting of the leads and the character actors, who are great as they look and sound as though they have spent their entire lives baking in the dry heat near the Mexican border, the movie is extremely compelling despite a deliberate pace and almost no background music during its two-hour running length. Most chase-type movies are fast-paced and action-packed, leaving little time for suspense to grow; this is the opposite. There are no quick-cutting action scenes, but instead heart-pounding scenes that slowly ramp up the tension. Those intense parts are complemented by quieter scenes of conversation or investigation that maintain a foreboding dramatic undertone of upcoming conflict. While the film loses some of its building momentum late in the story, and the denouement does not quite match the brilliance of the preceding hundred minutes, the closing moments remain appropriate for a movie that doesn't offer any easy questions or answers.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a movie that is definitely worthy of the countless honors that it is receiving from critics across the country. Assuming the writer's strike doesn't waylay the Oscars, I suspect that this will be the front-runner for Best Picture, and I'd bet a good chunk of money that Bardem will snag a Best Supporting Actor trophy. His performance and the film on the whole stand out from the year's crowd and are worth seeing, not for the popcorn movie crowd, but for fans of good, well-crafted cinema and story-telling.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: One of the best of the year. 8 of 10."

","Fans of FARGO will likely enjoy this quirky, subtly comic tale of crime in the American southwest. A case of drug money causes most of the tragedy, and cop Billy Bob Thornton is always just a step behind. But while FARGO was set in rural Minnesota, most of the action here is on the Border. There's no music on the soundtrack (until the film ends) - and nor is it the kind of tale that mixes well with music.<br/><br/>Oscar handicappers will probably be disappointed that NCFOM - with its grim fatalism - will likely be passed over a for less able film.

","Watching this film at a multiplex was an absolutely fascinating experience. After wading through the crowd of mouth-breathers knocking down the doors for Nicolas Cage's latest ""epic"", I was transported (with very few other audience members) to the rapidly eroding Southwest of the early '80s. Much more than simply a chase movie, the Coens (with brilliant source material by Cormac McCarthy) have made a wistful homage to the Texas of an earlier time, when people respected the law, their elders, and each other, even as greed, drugs, and mindless violence begin to overtake the culture. Powerfully acted, particularly by Tommie Lee Jones (in probably the sparest performance by a lead actor in, well, forever) and Javier Bardem as the monstrous Anton Chiguhr, a man who simply embodies menace. A lot of folks, looking for the standard good-guy-wins-bad-guy-loses Hollywood malarkey, will hate this film, particularly the ending. That's OK, though- there are plenty of choices for them. This was a movie for the rest of us; it's a miracle it got made."

","""No country"" is a beautiful and tense thriller. This is not just a simple plot of man finds money, gets into a whole bag of trouble as a result.<br/><br/>There are a number of elements that lift it out of the ordinary: exceptional dialog, characterization, and filming.<br/><br/>For me, it was impossible not to be swept along by the surprises and the overall melancholy of the piece.<br/><br/>What lifts this so hugely out of the ordinary is a clever trick: the characters are all slow, thoughtful, philosophical, even existential - but the action is fast, violent, and the combination produces a thriller of a very high class indeed.<br/><br/>Tommy Lee Jones gives, I believe, a career best: laconic, hang-dog, the sheriff who is not fazed by anything. Javier Badern plays a psychopath with no limbic pathway whatsoever - he just hasn't a human emotion in his body - and yet his own logic is impeccable. Just like the poster suggests, and the Coen Brothers want, he lingers on and a superb cinematic figure.<br/><br/>Rather like ""Paris, Texas"" even the desert and its surroundings are a major character here; and the film is brilliant at marrying both the landscape and the moment into one. <br/><br/>But above all it is the story and the way that it's delivered - marvelous performances from all the leads and minors, tense action, and even humor, and above all a sense of uncertainty as to where we were going next.<br/><br/>Never boring, and a superb plot, never wrong-footing itself this is, without a shadow of a doubt, simply the best thriller of 2007.<br/><br/>Absolutely recommended."

Today's movies don't have great characters like older movies use to have. Today's movies are about how many cars can blow up, how many scenes can be shot in slow motion and fast paced action. For me it felt like this movie brought back what use to be good about movies but with a perfect mix of today's way of filming. This had so many good movie elements and at the same time it had so many new movie elements. The characters were so believable. The bad guy was honestly the greatest bad guy I have ever seen in a movie. I've never seen a character like that. Not the way this guy was. I honestly can say that this is one of my favorite movies. I knew it the second I woke up on the morning after I saw it. I just can't believe how cool and smooth the film was and at the same time how ruthless and cold it was. The ending by the way... was just like the rest of the film... perfect. I've never seen a movie play out so realistically.

"Robert_90","10","0","5","27 December 2007"," Masterpiece
","I haven't really seen that many of the Coen brothers' movies - No Country marks the fourth one I've seen, and it may be the best of their movies I've seen at the very least.<br/><br/>No Country is best described as a modern-day Western - taking place in the Tex-Mex area, it focuses on three characters and their actions in relation to a huge drug deal gone horribly wrong. Josh Brolin's Llewellyn is ostensibly the lead character, a regular Joe whose discovery of the deal (and subsequent theft of $2 million worth of drug money) drives the story. Also after the money is psychotic murderer Chigurh (a brilliant turn by Javier Bardem), who leaves a thick and bloody trail of bodies as he pursues Llewellyn. Rounding out the trio is Tommy Lee Jones as Bell, the world-weary sheriff whose presence in the film is best likened to a Greek chorus as he is very loosely involved in the movie's action.<br/><br/>From now on it gets tough to write about No Country - my expectations were high for this (after all the five-star reviews I'd heard about). Not only were my expectations met, they were defied. I honestly was not ready for the movie - not because it was more than I'd hoped for, but because it was less. No Country is deceptively simple - the best aspect of it is that it does not try to be overly dramatic. Unlike a large number of thrillers, mood-building music is practically non-existent; what little there is goes largely unnoticed. The suspense is built extraordinarily well - even in some of the more clichéd scenarios on offer. You'll probably spend at least two-thirds of the movie on the edge of your seat. I know I did.<br/><br/>If I had to find any fault with the film, I'd consider it a trifling one but I will say this - the other third of the movie. If Brolin and Bardem's cat-and-mouse arc is responsible for the more intense parts of the film, then Jones' part is responsible for the more quiet (and I may even say, slightly boring) moments. I don't see the breaks in the suspense as much of a problem - rather, Jones' philosophical musings provide much-needed breathers and, if anything, the true heart of the film - how his life as a modern-day sheriff is very different to the ways of his lawmaking ancestors, and how things now are not necessarily for the better.<br/><br/>There's a reason No Country for Old Men has been getting fantastic reviews everywhere you look. It's a tense affair that really does suck you in right from the very beginning and doesn't let go, hitting you with surprise after surprise after surprise. This is the breath of fresh air I've been looking for."
"refresh_daemon","9","0","5","26 December 2007"," Suspenseful, masterful Western
","Once Llewelyn Moss finds the site of the shootout, No Country for Old Men kept me in edgy suspense for the rest of its running time. While at the same time finding the decisions that many of the characters make unreasonable, I could easily find myself being so captivated by greed or so driven by code that even the strangest characters in this adaptation of a Cormac McCarthy novel are yet somehow understandable.<br/><br/>Featuring a number of solid performances, a terrifyingly minimalist soundtrack and some of the finest (and most straightforward) direction that the Coen brothers have ever brought forth, this story of cat and mouse, of greed, and the following consequences is perhaps the most chilling film I've seen in 2007. The madness of the Anton Chigurh character, who lives by a seemingly rigid and yet flawed code, coupled with his unblinking resolve and his calmness in getting everything done, creates one of the most quietly menacing villains I've witnessed in cinema.<br/><br/>Honestly, I went in with a critical eye because of the amount of praise heaped upon this film by critics, but left, convinced like them: this is one of the best (non-comedic) works ever produced by the Coens, a marvelous drawing of the Western genre, and a true tale of horror. The only thing that I find missing is a stronger tie/resolution to the three or four story lines and a deeper look at the motivations of some of the characters--something I imagine you can find in the novel. But as a film, this is a wicked and dark story, and a highly recommended watch, if you can take the suspense (and the graphic depiction of violence and wounding). 9/10."
"Mik_Cal","8","0","2","25 December 2007"," Good but a little bit over-hyped
","I went into this movie expecting great things, given all the critical praise and high Metacritic marks. I don't necessarily love every Coen brothers movie but respect their work.<br/><br/>I gave it an ""8"" because of the amazing cinematography and beautiful locations and some mostly very good acting. On the other hand, in some of the monologues I thought the pacing dragged perhaps a function of the direction.<br/><br/>The main problem I found with the movie is that it didn't really stick together for me. The two parallel sub-plots really didn't hang together well, the story of the guy who takes the money and the story of the sheriff who observes the proceedings. The sheriff is supposed to function as a philosophical observer on violence and sociopathy but he seemed in some ways to be inessential to the main narrative.<br/><br/>I think the Coens may want the images and the mythic Western context to speak for themselves in ways that they don't at least for me."

","One interesting facet of your kids growing up, is that it broadens the definition of what might be considered Family Entertainment. Gone are the days of anodyne kiddie films for my guys.<br/><br/>So it was, that my entire family decamped to the Santa Cruz Del Mar Theatre the day after Thanksgiving (my favourite movie house in the whole world with its exquisite Art Deco interior) to see No Country for Old Men. Mum, dad, son, daughter and daughter's boyfriend, complete with mini van and popcorn. It may not be Disney, but my family were definitely entertained (but broke  do you know how much it costs to take 5 people to the movies? Whew!) Welcome to the brave new world of grown up family entertainment; murder, violence, sex and swearing. And the only one cowering under the seat during this movie, was my husband, gentle soul that he is.<br/><br/>This is the Coen brothers' film of the Cormac McCarthy novel, and whilst I've read and enjoyed several of his novels, I haven't yet read No Country for Old Men, so I'm not going to comment on the relation of the movie to the book, but consider it solely as a movie. The plot is not complicated. It's 1980. A guy out deer hunting (Llewelyn Moss played by Josh Brolin) stumbles by accident on the scene of a drug related massacre. Amongst the shot up cars, bodies, dead dogs and drugs, he finds a briefcase containing $2 million. He keeps it, packs his wife off to her mom's, and then tries to dodge the psychopathic killer Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) who is sent to get the money back. Also on the trail is Sheriff Bell close to retirement, played by Tommy Lee Jones, who has patrolled this rough border country for decades but is having trouble coming to terms with the degree of violence that drug smuggling has brought into his world (hence the title) and, briefly, an over confident bounty hunter Woody Harrelson's Carson Wells.<br/><br/>Describing Bardem's Chigurh as psychopathic is being nice to the guy. Early in the movie he strangles a sheriff's deputy with his hand cuffs, and it goes downhill from there. He has a novel method of killing  compressed air. He blows neat holes through his victim's head. The canister he totes also comes in useful for taking out door locks, and he appears to be immune to pain and utterly without remorse. This is not a nice guy. Bardem plays him wonderfully, and I found him convincingly chilling. Tommy Lee Jones is suitably grizzled as the sheriff, and brings a certain resigned irony to the part. Has the world always been quite this bad. he wonders? There is a degree of black humor to the movie which stops it taking itself too seriously, which I hadn't expected, and there is, thank god, very little ""Look  here comes the bad guy"" type music. Brolin's wife is played by Kelly Macdonald, an actress seen far too little on the cinema screen here in the USA. She shone in Gosford Park, but I first noticed her in Trainspotting. She is excellent.<br/><br/>The movie rolls along nicely for the first two thirds, but then rather loses impetus after the hero, Moss, is abruptly killed. I felt it really lost focus at that point, because up until then, the audience was rooting for Moss to succeed in evading the killer Chigurh. After that, it was merely a question of when Chigurh would get the wife, and whether Tommy Lee Jones would give up and choose early retirement. I guess the moral is ""don't pick up strange women at hotel pools"", but killing off the hero too soon was a big mistake, even if it was true to the book. And everyone in my family party felt the same. The last third of the movie let it down.<br/><br/>I think we may celebrate the Christmas season together with the murderous barber of Fleetstreet. Violence, song and Johnny Depp. Perfect family fun!"

","No Country for Old Men (2007) <br/><br/>Review: The Coens are back. This is not your kooky movie or silly humor or silly accents. This is a truly sadistic tale. Time to get serious.<br/><br/>No Country for Old Men is a good movie. The plot is that an ordinary man winds up finding a gruesome scene of possibly an aftermath of a drug deal gone wrong. Along with the deceased and many weapons, there is a briefcase filled with tons of cash. From here, his life is forever changed. For the better, or worse? This movie works in so many ways. First is the scenery is terrific. If you like the southern Texas desert, then this is for you. Just breathtaking. Second is The wonderful casting From Josh Brolin(who has been making some great decisions lately), Tommy Lee Jones and the psychopath, Javier Barden who gives a truly chilling performance as a fiendish air gun wielding maniac. And lastly the movie has no background soundtrack. NONE. All you will hear is either the footsteps, the guns, the telephone, the wind, or vehicles nearby. This gives the viewer the feeling like you are there at the same time! It adds the suspense by a huge margin than the usual ""shock"" value that does nothing for me.<br/><br/>The suspense....this movie has a death grip on suspense. You cannot deny how gripping this truly is. Many scenes had me on the edge of my seat...really! Just get ready to hold on when we get a excellent scene in the city streets.<br/><br/>The Last Word: Solid. As for the ending....I did not get angry or anything. Don't hate this because of that. You cannot deny the level of suspense that this movie carries. We have not seen suspense like this in years. Kudos, gentlemen, kudos."

","I don't see it so much as a film of violence as of fate, and choice. That runs through the movie time and again. About the rule, the rule that got you here, and so what good is it. And the coin toss for life: the bad guy is nothing more than the same chance as a coin toss: ""stuff"" is out there all the time. Both he and Lewlyn have to buy shirts off of kids to escape and both times the kids, initially innocent, to some degree, turn avaricious at the presentation of money. The guy is a ""ghost"". People are warned that getting killed by this guy is a sure thing, and get, they toss the coin, the choose to go after the guy, and they all get killed. All of them. But not the sheriff. I'm not clear how the sheriff escaped that fate, and I don't know why Lewelyn goes back to the scene of the massacre with water... if he hadn't have gone back, he might have been free and clear. He knows it's a bad idea, but what was the idea? Did he go back to make sure the guy was dead? To keep him alive with the water? Surely, the guy is long dead."

","I came away wondering what the point was.<br/><br/>The technical aspects of the film (acting, direction, camera, etc.) was, I thought, very well done. I'm still puzzled as to the intent of filmmakers who put a bunch of gore and some very unseemly characters before us.<br/><br/>** Some mild(?) spoilers follow ** <br/><br/>In addition, in this case, I was perplexed by Jones' character and little hints along the way that make me wonder what he was about, what he knew. For example, he is never proactive in the investigation yet he follows (as opposed to pursuing) the trail. In the final scenes when he returns to the motel, I noticed he took what seemed to be a large step across the threshold. Did he know that someone else was there? There are clues that he did and that he expected someone to be there. Had he become a nihilist and, by returning, was hoping to get shot to get out of his life? And had the sheriff made the connections between evidence and weaponry as he talked earlier about the abattoir? And what was the point of having names which can be confusingly similar: Ed Tom and Anton (in fact, somewhere late in the film, I thought someone did call the sheriff ""Anton"").<br/><br/>So, Full marks for the technical film but... I'm not going to try and solve the riddles."

","The rest was lame. If it wasn't lame it was extremely dull (Especially the scenes with Tommy Lee Jones. Shame, shame.) But like the summary says, Javier Bardem saved it from being a just plain horrible movie. He was absolutely amazing. One of the greatest villains I have seen in a long time. I loved his weapon of choice-it was different. And the one part that has stuck in my since I saw this film a few weeks ago is a shot of him sitting and staring, half his face completely in shadow the other half visible. He definitely gives you the ""oh, I would hate to run across that guy"" feeling and I love it. If you're the kind of person who roots for the villain periodically go see this film. And if you run out of popcorn you won't miss a thing if you go for refills when Bardem is not on the screen."

The movie is a movie lovers film; if you are a casual fan, it probably won't tickle your fancy. And this is definitely a movie you watch time and time again to catch all the little details the Coen bros put into it.

"Strider_1978","10","0","5","10 December 2007"," The Tyranny of Evil men.
","The title may be a slight cliché .. I was tempted to use another, but I will mention the other within this review.<br/><br/>Firstly, this film will not appeal to anyone who likes the younger generation of 'actors' and celebrities. This film may not appeal to those who like to munch popcorn whilst they view the screen with wide eyes. I do not recommend this film to anyone who was wildly entertained by films like Transformers or Spiderman 3.<br/><br/>Why do I say this? I will try to keep this as short as I may. To be as succinct as I may, I'll say that this piece of cinema, for those of the right mindset will walk away from this one thinking about what they have seen . .perhaps even unable to think of anything else for a while.<br/><br/>The plot is very simple, most of the film is spent watching the films bad guy pursuing the leading protagonist. Yet this is no ordinary bad guy. No, this character is perhaps the most authentic embodiment of true, realised evil. This character quite rightly, as I believe other reviewers have stated (though not using the same words) makes Hannibal Lecter look like a care bear. To use the word psychopath would dilute what this person perpetuates.<br/><br/>There is no music, or certainly little music in this film, but that is just fine; less is more. I spent a good deal of viewing time listening to my own heartbeat in what could be best described as one of the most terrifying movie experiences of my entire life.<br/><br/>Looking at this man, this creation, is with real sincerity, not the same as looking into the face of a serial killer or angry gun wielding maniac. There is no real emotion or theatrical anger etched on his face as he takes the lives of others. To look at him, his palid face, his dark soulless eyes is to look at a manifestation of an angel of death. Not a simple case of the tyranny of evil men, this is, as the original title might have been 'two hours with the arch angel'. <br/><br/>To view conversations with the character that completely steals the show is to look at a demon in a dark shirt. A demon that looks upon mere mortals with contempt and distain as they try to barter with him for things that he has absolutely no use for. There is no conscience, no emotion, no sense of any form of moral. Even such baddies as Darth Vader were eventually un veiled as having some concentration of good in them. . no such luck with this. . and I'm glad it is this way.<br/><br/>The whole cast give solid performances, even the bit and minor parts have gravity, such a refreshing rarety in modern cinema. Kelly MacDonald sheds her kilt and sporan for the Texan trailer girl. Bronin is great, and Tommy Lee plays the perfect old town sheriff. <br/><br/>I won't say much more, words can't really describe it, it just has to be seen. My advice to you.. understand that you are not going into a happy movie experience, there is no hero in the sunset. This is a thought provoking film that will and should stay with us, making us think and consider, and question.<br/><br/>It would be an injustice if this piece of cinema did not make it to Oscar nominations next year."
"tpcomputerman","10","0","5","10 December 2007"," Not what I was expecting
","Every once in a while I see a movie that is really hard to explain. A movie that kind of stays with me hours, even days after I see it as I try to absorb what I just saw. No Country for Old Men is one of those movies.<br/><br/>Explaining the plot would be almost pointless because the movies is so much more than the plot, there were so many levels to the movie that I'm sure I missed most of them. On the surface, the movie is about a man, (Llewelyn) who, while hunting, comes across a drug deal gone bad. While investigating he finds a case filled with money, about 2 million dollars. He takes it for himself and tries his best to keep it from the people who it belongs too.<br/><br/>Hot on is trail is Chigurh (pronounced Sugar, or shugar) a man who, according to one character, has no sense of humor. That's almost like saying Tiger Woods can sort of play golf. Most of the movie focuses Llewelyn trying to keep one step ahead of Chigurh, but that's really not what the movie is about, that's just what you see on the surface.<br/><br/>Chigurh, played by Javier Bardem, is one of the most evil characters I've ever seen. Every time he was on the screen with another character I wondered if that character was going to survive. The movie opens with Chigurh killing a deputy in a very ugly way, by strangling him, the look on Chigurh's face as he did it was one of pure evil. Chigurh isn't just a man, he was sometimes an unstoppable force of nature.<br/><br/>In one of he more intense scenes I've ever seen you have Llewelyn waiting in a darkened hotel room, he knows Chigurh's nearby looking for him and he just waits. I don't think I breathed until the scene finished playing out, the tension was just to thick and so well set up and executed I was totally drawn in.<br/><br/>Tommy Lee Jones plays an aging cop trying to put the pieces together and he sparkled in every scene he was in. I think this is his best performance since The Fugitive and I thought he was fantastic in that movie. If he's not nominated for best actor I'll be shocked. What I really enjoyed was how totally out of his league he really was. This wasn't a cop who was hell bent on finding or stopping a killer, he was an old cop who thought he's seen it all but, once he realizes he's up against someone as evil as Chigurh, he gets afraid. He wants to do the right thing but he just can't fathom this kind of man, this kind of evil. Of course, it's not all played out that black and white, (levels, remember, levels) it's just something I thought while watching it. You might think something else.<br/><br/>It's hard to talk about this movie without saying something about the end. I won't go into details because I want everyone to see it untainted like I did. For me, I was confused, then angry, then confused again, then finally I accepted what had happened and moved on. I love that the Cohen Brothers did something different, something you'd never, ever see in a Hollywood movie.<br/><br/>My prediction, this movie will be nominated for Best Picture, Javier Bardem will be nominated for the best actor, Tommy Lee Jones for Best Actor, Cohen's for best adapted screen play, and probably best director.<br/><br/>So yeah, I'd highly recommend this movie, just leave your preconceived notions of what a movie should be at the door."
"mike-925","9","0","5","10 December 2007"," No Movie For the Squeamish: Coens Return to Their Blood Simple Roots
","The Coens are back and at their primitive best. They've taken Cormac McCarthy's novel and changed it into a novel of details like the novels of Jim Thompson. Most of the film is without dialog. Characters don't get to talk much. They act, think, strategize, hide, enter and leave a dizzying array of motels and hotels and then leave them. There are more doors opened and closed in this slow character study than any film since Mr. Blanding Built His Dream House.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin is a new fixture in films to me. He reminds me of a younger, grittier Harrsion Ford. I first saw him in the one of the Tarantino-Rodriquez Grindhouse double feature B films in the spring playing a mad doctor. I think he may have played another role in the other film. Then he was even better in American Gangster as a wonderfully corrupt detective. In No Country, he surpasses himself. If he didn't have to share billing with Javier Bardem and Tommy Lee Jones,he'd be up for best actor honors this Awards Season.<br/><br/>Tommy Lee Jones seems almost to be repeating himself in Missing and the Three Burials of Elquiedas Estrada. In each succeeding film he wears less makeup, the face is more lined, the acne scars more visible. His character is more like a commentator than the cop catching the bad guys of audience expectations. He is more like the Walter Matthau sheriff after Kirk Douglas in the 1960 film Lonely Are The Brave. Matthau mostly comments on the out of place cowpoke making critical remarks to his deputy rather than seriously chasing Douglas into the Mountains. Jones embodies the idea of a present too violent for 60 year old peace officers like himself to referee and regulate. Tommy Lee has conversations with two old character actors, one, Barry Corbin, who appears to be a fatherfigure. Jones' father and grandfather were lawmen, neither lived past 40, but all of them were tougher birds than he. Instead of seriously confronting the malign Javier Bardem, Tommy Lee's character mainly just tries to think along with the serial killer and hit-man and with Josh Brolin. He's not thinking too well either. He certainly should have offered police protection to Brolin's wife on the two occasions when he interviewed her. <br/><br/>The movie starts when Brolin, hunting antelope, wanders on the scene of a revenge shooting and massive drug buy, discovering five roll-barred trucks and dead men with Uzis and machine guns scattered all around. He finds bricks of cocaine among the strewn bodies, spent shells and weapons. There's a Mexican man still barely alive and wanting water, but Brolin has none. And in a valise, between $1 and $2 million in $100 dollar bills. Brolin takes off with the satchel, tells his wife nothing, then wakes up in the night feeling the need to get that still living Mexican the drink of water he craved, a fatal mistake for Brolin. Because it is when he returns to the scene that the panoply of bad guys led by malign monster Javier Bardem first get a line on him. If he hadn't returned he'd a gotten clean away. <br/><br/>Hype about the film suggest the Bardem character is a monster. But I was not convinced by the film itself since I had seen him a few years back playing a fearful and fleeing Cuban homosexual. Bardem weighs a few more pounds for Old Men, but he didn't scare me any. I thought he was pretty predictable. The Audience was pulling for Brolin against Bardem the collector of the lost loot. The film never did show who gets the valise with the money in it though it seems likely Bardem did. <br/><br/>Instead, three ironic scenes were shown as epilogue to the showdown over the money, the last featuring Tommy Lee talking to his wife about dreams he'd had the night before about his father and grandfather.<br/><br/>The film ends without the kind of easy moral of most thrillers and westerns of which this is both. If you want to see the Coens as they were in the beginning, this is the film."
"dcw-12","9","0","5","8 December 2007"," A film about romanticism, illusion, greed, and the consequences of ones actions
","I think the main theme of the film is romanticism. Its certainly an American trait, nostalgia. Nostalgia distilled down is romanticism. Romanticism is fantasy, illusion.<br/><br/>The Sheriff played by Tommy Lee Jones goes on and on about the old days, and about how great things were. Like evil is some modern invention, one that he is scared of and doesn't want to understand. He is always one step behind the murderer in the film. And when he's closest to the murderer. When he finds out he's too late, he isn't upset, he is relieved. This tells us a lot about the character.<br/><br/>The father of the Sheriff offers the best advice to the Sheriff and exposes his truth. The Sheriff not wanting to accept reality is vanity. The Sheriff is exposed as a weak and almost childlike character that refuses to grow up and accept reality. How can you fight crime if you refuse to accept and understand evil? Its a poignant analysis of aging, and how romanticism and nostalgia can stop your development as a person.<br/><br/>The other main part of the story is about easy money, and greed. The Moss character is a welder who is thrilled with the prospect of 'easy money' despite the incredible risk he puts his family in. In fact the hit-man tells his wife of this at the time of her death. And as blunt as it is its true. <br/><br/>The killer in the film is more like a force of nature than a real hit-man. He is like the dark side of people they refuse to acknowledge. Most of the characters in the film have set out their own course of destruction. They just don't have the capacity to understand the forces they have set against themselves. <br/><br/>Overall very good film, escapes all the clichés of modern Hollywood. This film is reminiscent of 1970's style cinema. Gritty dark stories, with a solid framework of allegory, and an exposure of all sides of the human condition. Hopefully this is the Coens leading the charge to a return to true, free, Cinema.<br/><br/>Who better to lead than the Coens? Great stuff, this is a film I wont soon forget."
"rhinocerosfive-1","9","0","2","7 December 2007"," ""I got here the same way the coin did""
","Bardem's Law states that Javier Bardem will be the most exciting part of any film in which he appears. This isn't such a feat in COLLATERAL, but to be the best thing in a Tommy Lee Jones movie and a Coen Brothers movie at the same time may be the neatest trick he's pulled yet. <br/><br/>What's your motivation to act in a world predicated on chance? NO COUNTRY explores the choices of a few very motivated people, and answers all of its questions with a flip of the coin. Yes, it's an easy out to take, but it's not easy to take it this far. The protagonist is doomed by his one selfless act: after he's already got away clean, he goes back to aid a dying stranger and gets hellhounds on his trail. This is the only gesture the story makes to a moral lesson, as the engine of God is a narcissistic psychopath who might kill you, and might just try to scare you to death. Lately, Cormac McCarthy likes to pepper his villains' philosophy with nihilism, and so have the Coens often done. There is no hope in religion, in law, in justice. The land is toxic and sterile, the towns deserted, the roads an endless stretch of good places to get shot. <br/><br/>But the story does not discourage hope. Like all good fairy tales, it reminds you that you might get lucky. You might just make it. If you don't try, you get less than zero anyway. So if you try, try hard. You could win everything. As Yeats tells us, it's no country for old men because in a world this dynamic, ""Caught in that sensual music all neglect/Monuments of unageing intellect."" You must change with the times; act like the quick or be counted among the dead. <br/><br/>Josh Brolin is as credible a young cowboy as I have seen since Steve McQueen; Woody Harrelson is perfectly glib; they both find out that being clever may not matter at all. And Tommy Lee Jones gets to say, ""Even in a contest between man and steer, the issue is not certain."""

","Doing what they do best, the Coen Brothers bring us another grim picture of people behaving badly. One difference this time is there are no just desserts, no cunning people working the right angle, and no hero to ride in, figure it all out and save the day.<br/><br/>In less capable hands, this might turn into a real downer of a movie, but the way the Coen Brothers tell a story, it comes off less as an indictment against humanity and more a roller coaster of a tense, cautionary tale.<br/><br/>You know that sinking feeling you get when you realize that things are not going to end well? And then there's the already-sunk feeling, like when you drive past a car accident and you can see that it did not end well. This movie gave me a mix of those two feelings, gripping my stomach, through nearly every frame.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem and Tommy Lee Jones (and Josh Brolin, to a lesser degree) give shockingly good performances. The wrinkles and lines on Jones' face are like a character all to themselves. And it's Jones' sheriff, along with a few moments of perfectly wry humor, that lift this unpleasant story up and allow you to believe that although it's certainly a mess, perhaps all is not lost for our human endeavor.<br/><br/>But maybe it is. Or not."

Is it possible that anyone once they have taken a certain path can actually change their destiny or is it really hope that gives it the chance to succeed. A movie with a simple and out of the mainstream world that leaves the characters bare and exposed on their plight because the struggles within and what anyone face are really also very bare to them. Youth has the strength and conviction to overcome but the old have traveled the road too long. And as people's lives go there way, will they cross the path of ""death"" too soon or just by chance ""escape""? An ending very anti-climatic but is it...for it makes you think about yourself and the path you have taken."
"mm-39","7","0","6","5 December 2007"," Not bad, but could have been a better ending
","I believe the movie is about the randomness of life. All the random events, and choices lead to each character's fate. Order through chaos is the movies theme! That is why the antagonist flips a coin, and gives people the choice of head or tails. The coin toss reflects fate and fates effect by choices one makes out of free will. That is why the antagonist went after the other characters wife, even when there was no reason for it, because the antagonist gave the character the choice to come in or his wife will die. The movie is interesting, and the story is good. I like how the two characters who let's call trouble shooter are disjointed with the world. Good at what they do, but are a Little out of touch. Just like this movie. 7 out of 10. A good rental. Maybe that is why the ending is so disjointed."
"dmasursky","7","0","2","3 December 2007"," Good but not completely satisfying
","Tommy Lee Jones deserves all the accolades that he's getting - he really is the heart and soul of this movie, though it's very much an ensemble. And Josh Brolin is a revelation - he's one to watch. It's a very dark film, but with some clever and frankly charming humor (rather typical of the Coen Brothers). However, despite some great moments, my film-going companions and I agreed that while we liked it, the end was very unsatisfying, and the last 10- 15 minutes almost seemed unnecessary.<br/><br/>Of course critics are raving and predicting Oscars all around, but we agreed that this is exactly the sort of movie that critics swoon for (very arty and important), but that people stay away from in droves. It deserves a viewing, but not many people want to invest in a movie that is so completely lacking in escapism, and has such a dismal view of humanity."

","Wow...<br/><br/>Great acting, great directing... The film deals with some complicated issues that has the audience cringing from time to time as the Coen Bros. skirt the ragged edge between real life and fantasy. You will be curious from the beginning. You will be entranced by the middle and you will be stunned by the end. Bottom line, you will be entertained.<br/><br/>Growing up in a rural Midwestern community I found the dialog and acting to be spot on. Javier Bardem plays the perfect bad guy (Antone Chigurh) to Tommy Lee's masterful depiction of Ã¼ber sleuth Sheriff Ed Tom Bell. While our hero, Llewelyn Moss (played by Josh Brolin) brings a down to earth quality that will have you rooting for him even after the opening scene. Trust me you just have to watch it to understand."

","OK. Cormac McCarthy is one of my favorite writers and the Coen brothers are my favorite filmmakers. No Country for Old Men is one of my favorite books and the deck was stacked before I saw it tonight. Rather than gush on with lavish kudos, let me just sum it up. Everything works. The action is fast-paced; the dialog is sparse, ala Cormac McCarthy; the layouts are fantastic in their meager presentation; the costuming is minimal; the music is not missed; the tension comes through the exquisite timing; there are no wasted moments, no wasted film footage and the transitions between scenes move like a well oiled clock. The acting is excellent, from the extras to the main characters. The scenery is believable and while there are some bloody moments there's no resorting to hitting the viewer with a lot of gore. Javier Bardem's ritualistic understated killer is chilling; Woody Harrelson's Wells is cocky, overconfident and tragic; Josh Brolin's character is pragmatic but outclassed; Tommy Lee Jones's Sheriff is a salt of the earth prototype-- everything works. Leaving the theater, I heard the grumblings about the ""non-ending."" To those comments and also to those included in these reviews here, all I can say is, it is an ending. It's just not the one you would expect. Cormac McCarthy and the Coen brothers aren't John Wayne."
"Fewtch","9","0","8","26 November 2007"," Near-masterpiece marred by mediocre ending...
","""No Country for Old Men"" is nearly a masterpiece IMO, but is marred by several minutes at the very end, where Tommy Lee Jones gives what I call a ""speech."" The reason I call it that is: (A) I was deep in thought from the previous scene (a certain car accident, where I feel the movie should have ended) and didn't hear a word that was said, and (B) it was probably a blatant Oscar stab that didn't fit too well with the rest of the film. I'm not sure, because I didn't pick up a single word.<br/><br/>Perhaps my opinion of the film will improve on second viewing, but I recall almost panicking that this film was about to be spoiled by a flood of Hollywood nonsense. That says a great deal positive, but to my mind it also speaks of a flaw.<br/><br/>My viewing ended at the penultimate scene, where I genuinely feel the film should have left well enough alone. 9/10.<br/><br/>P.S. ^^^I have since read more reviews, and understand that the film followed the book closely; the above offers my gut reaction, first impression, whatever you want to call it, going in ""cold."" If you think I'm complaining loudly, I'm not; IMO the film is indeed nearly (or perhaps fully, I'll decide later) a masterpiece. I find it telling that one negative reviewer opined that the film would have made more sense if it were released 30 years ago: The setting of the film is in fact supposed to take place just that long ago. Something about that increases my esteem for the film even more."
"hderksen","7","0","2","26 November 2007"," don't try to outsmart a psychopath
","I am judging this movie without having read the novel (and of course, the movie should stand on its own). I'd say that this is really a B-movie about a psychopathic criminal, albeit a good B-movie. Javier Bardem is wonderful as a psychopathic killer. He is scary as hell, with his bizarre weapon: an air gun (typically used to kill cattle). The best part of the movie is the cat and mouse game between Bardem and Brolin. Bardem is very intelligent (as psychopaths usually are), but Brolin is pretty smart himself. Of course, the big mistake Brolin makes is that he thinks he can actually pull it off to steal 2 million dollars from Bardem. Bardem portrays an exceptionally interesting psychopath, but I have seen too many psychopath movies to really appreciate it. Woody Harrelson is also wonderful as a bad-ass bounty-hunter. It was really a shame that he was killed prematurely. The epilogue by Sheriff Tommy Lee Jones suggests a deeper meaning in all the events. He feels deeply frustrated by the injustice that the psychopath Javier Bardem is still a free man. The movie ends with the sheriff trying to come to terms with his lack of power to catch Bardem. I don't share the sheriff's pessimism. A person like Bardem leaving such a bloody trial would soon make it to the ""most wanted list"" and the feds would pull out all resources to catch a guy like that. In the whole movie it seems like just the sheriff and his dimwit deputy who are looking for Bardem."

","Twenty-three years after their collaborative film debut, Blood Simple, and seven years from the last break of comedy productions with The Man Who Wasn't There, writers/directors Joel and Ethan Coen return to their second comfortable genre--noir--with the unflinching No Country for Old Men. Taken verbatim from Cormac McCarthy's 2005 novel, the story unfolds on the parched terrain of isolated, southwestern towns so typical to these stories of greed and consequence; these settings outline the borders of hell where righteous humanity is scarce. ""The Old-Timers never even used to carry guns"" begins the nostalgic narration of Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) who, throughout the film, offers the commentary of the uncontrollable taint of Man. This is no longer a country for old men. <br/><br/>Lewewlyn Moss (Josh Brolin) is not the typical noir protagonist. Nothing in his character suggests much previous innocence, nor even moral judiciousness towards the choices that set events in motion. While hunting antelopes in the mountains, he stumbles across the failures of a Mexican heroine deal. In something like a circled wagon train. The ground is covered with shells. Bodies lay in pools of blood drawing flies. And the trucks are covered in bullet holes and shattered glass, some of the drivers laying slumped over the wheel. And amidst the carnage, an unclaimed satchel full of money that Moss collects. <br/><br/>Moss has such a matter-of-fact approach to his gamble. In modern noir, redemption is not always a guarantee. And, at least here, it is not even an option. Viewers are likely to reason that stealing from a drug dealer, and especially a villain who lays everything to waste without question, is not really a damning fault. Though, it can be a very stupid thing to do. And, in classic noir form, where greed and conscience are often odds, Moss's inclination towards the latter, pose the challenge for his own survival. <br/><br/>Moss's crucial worry is not the aging Sheriff Bell (Jones) nor the understanding federal drug agent Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson), but rather his black-hearted personal reaper, Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem, closely resembling a young Raul Julia). ""He won't care if you return the money,"" Wells explains to Moss when he is recovering in a hospital from the men's first face-to-face encounter. ""He'll kill you just for inconveniencing him.""<br/><br/>The story of the greedy man turned drug dealer's prey has been told countless times before and yet, Joel and Ethan Coen have produced a film of such immediate applause (already achieving a top 40 spot in the IMDb top 250 movies list as of this writing). The initial lure is likely the solid starring and supporting cast. The film itself draws on the love affair for retro atmosphere that directors like Quentin Tarrantino have made a trademark, and the only real reference calling audiences back to this century is the comical mention of an ATM machine. But this nostalgia appears to offer a more primitive playing field for the characters. The fancy digital packages that worked for characters in Disturbia, for example, are of no use in this dusty arena. They're not even an option. But perhaps the most effective device in this film are characters cut from a more convincing reality. Lewewlyn Moss is an intelligent man who suspects early on that someone, whether dealer or the law, will come for his claim and he is quite adept in protecting himself. Perhaps his only idealism is that he is convinced he can killed Chigurh. <br/><br/>Chigurh, on the other hand, is the unfathomable mold; the man without conscience. And worse, he seems indestructible in ways that suggest nothing will end as we expect, much to the chagrin of audiences expecting easily manageable explanations and showdowns as the final marker in this narrative spectrum. That is not to say that we are left with overwhelming complexities and uncertainties. But, the audience will have to do some of their own work to understand how this tale ends and it almost requires abandonment of typical frames of moral logic."
"TOMNEL","10","0","7","24 November 2007"," An amazing movie.
","The Coen brothers are known for making very good movies, and this is no exception. The Coen brothers are also known for making strange films and screwing with the audience, and this does that more than any of their other movies. And because of this, some people will not like this, and even though I was angry from some choices the Coens made, I still loved this!<br/><br/>Llewlyn Moss (Josh Brolin) finds 2 million dollars out in the desert, from what appears to be a drug deal gone bad. What he didn't expect (and who would) was Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), one of the worst villains the screen has ever seen. Meanwhile, the town sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) is trying to figure out exactly what's going on, and how he'll deal with it. This movie is amazing in every sense of the word. The direction is perfect. It's almost as though the camera is following people around in their everyday life, which makes this movie feel very real. The acting is wonderful, with the cast being led by Josh Brolin as a redneck who's in a whole lot of trouble. We get next to no background on him (or any character), yet we still care about them. Their characters are revealed through their actions, which is very rare in movies. The writing is my only gripe. I loved the dialog, loved everything about this writing, but the ending. I suppose the ending was effective in conveying a message, and it got it's point across, but along with that, it almost felt like a fade out, with no real ending. My only gripe is that ending, which will bother most of the people who see this. Everything else was amazing, making this one of the best movie-going experiences in years for me.<br/><br/>My rating: **** out of ****. 120 mins. R for violence."
"tomrito","8","0","2","24 November 2007"," Good film, no more, no less.
","It is good to read the passion in the reviews on IMD when it comes to a Coen brother's film. People either really love it and can't wait to explain what a great piece of quality cinema it was, or people really hate it and can't understand how anyone could like this violent distortion of life. Unfortunately, I can not be that passionate about this film. The movie was entertaining and the Coen brothers know how to get the best out of their actors. The best performances were turned out by Tommy Lee Jones as a laid back Texas sheriff, a part he has down pat by now. Josh Brolin as a south Texas ex-Vietnam Vet whose actions put this whole story in play. Kelly Macdonald who is surprisingly good as his emotion filled, but somewhat naive wife. And the incredible performance of Javier Bardem as the very scary psychopathic hit man. Unlike Fargo, this Southwest Texas case study was not wholly believable. Maybe the brothers needed to spend some more time there. I don't know, but it seemed to me like law enforcement was a little like the keystone cops, Mexicans road around in trucks with automatic weapons always at the right place at the right time and people were getting killed everywhere and no one did anything. Well I have been there and that is just not the case. Maybe the Coen brothers were using all this as symbolism, but it was just a little too much for me to say this was a great film."

","When I first heard about this movie, I though ""Big whoop, it's just another horror/action movie"", then I saw the trailer, I was stunned. It captured me. I asked my dad if I could see the movie, he said no, because I need to be 18 to see it (weird because he snuck me in to see The Matrix Revolved). So I told him that it got high ratings, and I finally convinced him to see it with me.<br/><br/>When we saw it, not only was I amazed, but he was amazed as well. So let's take it with the basics: We usually expect from a horror/action movie (though it isn't really horror) is that they will try to make it all on one genre, but don't focus on another. Well, this movie denied it. They took it into level proportions and didn't try to rush the story. The dialogue was excellent, they chose the right words, and it made sense. They didn't focus on good special effects, they focused on development.<br/><br/>Though, the movie was excellent, the ending was un-resolved. When it was done, I thought, did I miss something? Because it wasn't fully resolved. I bet by that ending, I guess they are going to make a sequel. I hope it's good."

","I love reading through the negative comments on IMDb. Obviously the lion's share of these reviews are left by dimwitted folks who really ought to leave movies made for adults TO adults, and the others are left by plain old idiots who wouldn't know quality cinema if it bit them on the arse. Being a huge McCarthy fan, and a huge Coen Brothers fan, I went into the theater with incredibly high expectations, and I was given more than I expected. That's no small feat. Perfectly cast, perfectly lensed, and perfectly scripted, this might be the Coen's best film, which is a MAMMOTH statement. I'm hoping that some other good film makers will take heed, and we'll see a rash of McCarthy novels brought to the screen at long last. I see Ridley Scott is taking on Blood Meridian, which certainly has some promise. Meanwhile, run to the theater to see this. Completely disregard the negative reviews that are on this site. Take those comments for what they are. Misguided opinions from fools who ought to stick to Michael Bay films."
