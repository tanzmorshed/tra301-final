"naveen64","7","232","275","14 August 2019"," An original homage that helps break the current biopic trend
","After being subjected to a number of films documenting the lives of musicians - most notably ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", ""Rocketman"" and ""Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story"" - it is truly a pleasure to be presented with a film that sheds light on the work and life of an artist while not adhering to the strict (though desirable) biographical approach. That is exactly what makes the piece so marvellous; I came out of the cinema with a greater appreciation of The Beatles, and their music, through a fictional story that did not feature the four men we are familiar with at all. Quite often the film achieved my admiration for the band without me consciously noticing.<br/><br/>On another level, the film made a satire of the modern music industry. It revealed how the apparent ""solo"" artists are far from their titles; with huge teams of people pushing them in a preferred, and more commercial, creative direction, taking the musicians' creative power. This was done in a humorous light (as most themes are presented in the film). The romantic aspect of the film is evident from the beginning and is a dominant aspect of the story, possibly shifting the focus of the piece a little too much. However, it still helps provides a satisfying ending.<br/><br/>The film pays a great amount of respect in a fresh way while cleverly interweaving other conflicts."
"TheLittleSongbird","7","36","42","3 December 2019"," Troubles seemed far away after watching
","There were three main reasons really in seeing 'Yesterday'. The alternative world scenario sounded truly fascinating, one of the most fascinating concepts in recent years to me and a refreshing change from the remakes and sequels constantly made today. Like to love a lot of Danny Boyle's previous films and find him a talented director. The Beatles are not all time favourites but do appreciate him highly, understand their influence in music and like a lot of their songs a lot.<br/><br/>While it could have done more with its concept, 'Yesterday' turned out to still be entertaining and charming that put me and my sister in an uplifting mood leaving the cinema. Had not had an easy day, or week even, up to seeing the film, so 'Yesterday' was a much needed and appreciated antidote. As far as films released in 2019 go, it is neither one of the best or worst in a hit and miss year and somewhere around solid middle if having to rank.<br/><br/>'Yesterday' is a slick looking film, not exemplary but never cheap. Lily James looks great and the camera clearly loves her. The music of course is fantastic, it is The Beatles after all, with some of their greatest hits exuberantly performed, making one want to sing along regardless of whether they know all the words or not. ""Hey Jude"" is one of the most memorable examples. The script balances amusing comedy and never over-sentimental drama without making it too cartoonish or mawkish (well mostly).<br/><br/>Story-wise, 'Yesterday' captures the feel-good spirit affectionately and the portrayal of the music industry was fun and didn't get over the top. The John Lennon bit is a highlight. Boyle has done better and more inspired direction, but still directs at a crisp pace and balances things quite well. The performances are good, a truly charming James coming off best. Himesh Patel has come on a long way since 'EastEnders' while Kate McKinnon is riotous in the manager role.<br/><br/>On the other viewpoint, the concept was so fascinating and while it is always engaging the story is predictable and a bit too ordinary. Especially the final third, which is pretty much exactly as one would expect.<br/><br/>Ed Sheeran's ""extended cameo"" for my tastes was rather puzzling and didn't seem to gel with everything else.<br/><br/>All that aside, it was an enjoyable film on the whole and worth seeing. 7/10"
"oshanda","6","496","664","1 July 2019"," Could have been great
","The original premise of the movie was fantastic - only one man knows that The Beatles ever existed and brings their music to the world.<br/><br/>It could have been really really great. Unfortunately the idea was under developed, it felt as if the film's makers weren't quite sure what to do with it.<br/><br/>It ended up being ""nice"" and ""sweet"" when it could have been brilliant."
"leobryan-03453","6","250","329","13 July 2019"," Interesting concept. Awkward execution.
","It was a great idea and in some ways the film made the vision work. I just don't think they did enough with it though and instead fell back into the traditional love story formula. The music helped carry a lot of it through (unsurprisingly). What they missed was it wasn't necessarily the songs themselves but the era in which they came out and the meaning of the time. Movie just presented it as almost instant stardom if today's world heard the songs which lets be honest today's generation wouldn't understand half of it. It didn't really present a clear vision of ""why"" which I was looking for towards the end to help tie things up. Lights go off on the planet he takes a bump on the head then the Beatles never existed? Alternate universe? Dream? Thought there would've been something more there. There were a few things that bothered me with the story that the movie made it seem like they were pieces to the puzzle but then never did anything with them. First is through the film he also finds out other things don't exist as well such as coke, cigarettes, the band oasis, and Harry Potter. It seemed like these things were going to connect into the story and why the Beatles music isn't present but they just left it there and he kind of says ""oh well"" and nothing comes of it. The second was he finds out there are two others that also know the Beatles music and again seems like this should be a big part of the story to tie things together as to a bit of ""why"" but they just have a conversation about it she gives him an address and then that's it. His conversation with what I think is supposed to be John Lennon didn't make sense either. Does that mean the other 4 exist? Did they never meet to make music? Just all added up to a great idea that worked early in the film but didn't follow through properly. All my opinion of course"
"jkanderson-74461","10","352","470","29 June 2019"," The antidote to sequels and super heroes
","Refreshingly original and entertaining. The story flows and the characters are relatable and well developed. Not what I expected from the trailer but I liked it better than what I expected. So nice to see someone take a chance on an original story."

","I went into this wondering if they were going to explain the whole premise with it being a dream or such? Was he going to get caught and crucified for it? Was he going to get the girl, lose the girl? So many movies are fixated on realism and difficulties and negativity. Yes, he faces several difficulties. But, the movie is light and beautiful with fantastic music. If I want realism, I watch a documentary. This is what I go to the movies for. Really well done!"
"bob-the-movie-man","10","292","407","21 June 2019"," ""Well, I'll bet you I'm gonna be a big star"".
","There are some movies that when released simply don't need a big marketing campaign. Just a few words of description of the plot are enough to put it on your ""must see"" list: ""A struggling musician has a cycling accident during a freak global blackout and wakes to a world where noone other than him remembers the Beatles or any of their songs."" When I heard this I said to myself ""yes, Yes, YES""! But would it live up to my expectations?<br/><br/>This is a Richard Curtis penned film, and that's immediately enough to put a tranche of movie-goers off. All his movies have an accent on the uplifting, the positive and/or the whimsical, and I can understand why that winds some people up. If ""Richard-Curtissy"" was an adjective, and I think it should be, many of these films can be so classified.<br/><br/>Here, although again very Richard-Curtissy, I think he gets the mixture JUST RIGHT.... ""Yesterday"", for me, was a complete joy from beginning to end.<br/><br/>I imagine Curtis getting this story from a rowdy dinner party round his gaff. He asks his guests, over the third bottle of dessert wine, to play a wild and fantastical ""what if"" game (in pursuit of the ""very good"" spare brownie of course). At this particular event, I guess it was co-story-author Jack Barth (in his movie-writing debut) that made the successful attempt to ""hog the brownie"". For the premise of ""Yesterday"" is quite brilliant, whilst at the same time being utterly bonkers too!<br/><br/>That being said, the story is not completely original. I thought there were many similarities to the Ricky Gervais vehicle of 2009, ""The Invention of Lying"", where Gervais alone finds he suddenly has the ability to tell lies, and finds ill-gotten fortune and fame as a result. Much like that earlier film, much of the joy here is in the recognition of the gift given and the dawning realisation of what this might actually mean to him. As such, I found the first half of the film a lot more enjoyable than the second.<br/><br/>The conundrum facing Jack is to remeber all of the Beatles songs and their lyrics (without having Google as a reference), and much fun is had with him stumbling into situations that suddenly remind him of a new track or a particular snatch of lyric.<br/><br/>There is of course an obvious explanation for the whacky storyline, since the hero has received a potentially serious head injury. But would the film go there? (No spoilers here).<br/><br/>Himesh Patel is from TV's ""Eastenders"" but here makes his movie debut. He is perfectly cast as Jack Malik: in the film, he's a name about to rise from utter obscurity as a Lowestoft retail assistant to global superstardom. Patel is charming and believable as he squirms with his conscience. A surprising and touching beach scene in the final reel of the film is exquisitely acted.<br/><br/>The ever-watchable and utterly gorgeous Lily James here goes brunette: she was actually unrecognisable to me from both the trailer and the poster! Here she makes a very believable high-school teacher with a side-line in management and roadie-ing.<br/><br/>I found Ed Sheeran's cameo in ""Bridget Jones Baby"" to be excruciating! But here, in what is quite an extensive part, he is much, much better. I think he's been getting lessons.<br/><br/>One of the slight disappointments with the film is that it is a Danny Boyle film that doesn't FEEL like a Danny Boyle film. Aside from some inventive on-screen titles, I didn't detect much of the stylisation that I would expect from one of his films. Yes, there are occasional flashes of genius - for example, the scenes where Malik is desperately trying to remember the lyrics of Eleanor Rigby, and those of him watching, big screen, his own social-media led rise to super stardom. But otherwise, the visuals and storyline are pretty linear in nature.<br/><br/>Although there are cloyingly gooey bits of this film, the element that weaves it all together - such that ""all is forgiven"" in my book - is the magical music and lyrics of McCartney, Lennon and Harrison.<br/><br/>Was there a better year to be born that 1961? (Well, possibly the mid- to late- 50's so you were old enough to remember more of it). But although only a child aged between two and nine during their album releases, I felt the benefit of three older siblings who WERE able to fully embrace Beatlemania. And the film delights with its modern day recreations of the classic tracks and, as already mentioned, Himesh Patel belts them out wonderfully (especially, I thought, with ""Help!"").<br/><br/>I can't not give this one 10 stars. I simply loved it, and can't wait for its general release (in the UK, on June 28th 2019) so I can go and love it all over again. Is it technically a 10-star film? Possibly not, but sometimes you just have to go with the way a film makes you feel, not just as you walk, whistling, out of the cinema but for the whole of the next 48 hours and (I suspect) longer. In summary, he loves it. ""Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeeeeeaaaaaah"".<br/><br/>(This is an edited version. The full graphical review is available on ""One Mann's Movies"" on t'internet or Facebook.

","Yesterday<br/><br/>So much of this movie was charming, brilliantly acted, and inventive, however somewhere around the middle of the movie, (the missing the train scene) it just turned into a big farce. The plot just became unbelievable, it also turned corny and over-sentimental. Of course I accept the whole movie was built on supernatural premise but what follows must hang together and keep the audience rooting for our hero.<br/><br/>What was good:<br/><br/>1, I loved the music, I think this made the movie.<br/><br/>2, Jack Malik, played by Himesh Patel, did a fine job, he has mastered irony and deadpan, we were all wanted this antihero to have his dream.<br/><br/>What was challenging;<br/><br/>1, the plot was either so corny or so contrived, some plot twists were just unnecessary and added nothing.<br/><br/>2, Elle, played by Lily James, lost our sympathy, she was presented as needy and pathetic and just as the culmination of him achieving ""their"" dream, she tries to make him choose between his dream and her.<br/><br/>3, The conclusion was unsatisfactory, he wanted to be a musician and was fabulous at it, he ended up a teacher, big mistake.<br/><br/>Overall, the was an overly contrived feel good movie, I enjoyed whilst I was watching it, but feel cheated and unsatisfied at the end."

","Just left the TriBeCa Film Festival where the film premiered, and I have to say, the film was superb. Everyone in the film is outstanding and Danny Boyle does a brilliant job handling some of the greatest songs ever written. Speaking of that, The Beatles legacy will forever live on with this film."
"matthewssilverhammer","4","148","226","5 July 2019"," What a waste of a great concept...
","Yesterday is pure cinematic fluff with a lightning-bolt of an idea. In moments, those substance-less joys earn their cuteness. But, as with writer Richard Curtis's other films (About Time), there's a unique ethical question underscoring the surface: what rights does an artist have over a creation they didn't create? Should we be honest about ""reality"" when that reality isn't reality? Confused? Don't worry; that complexity is all but completely brushed under the rug here, opting instead for cheap explanations and corny romance.
Because of unimportant and uninteresting reasons, an aspiring musician (Patel) discovers he is the only person in the world who remembers The Beatles. Patel is great in the lead; with impeccable timing and effortless charm, he manages to steal all these classic songs without losing our sympathy. He's supported by a handful of genuinely funny and sweet moments: jokes at the expense of Oasis and Ed Sheeran, the reveals of other erased cultural touchstones (Coca-Cola, Harry Potter, etc), even a surprisingly moving reveal of others who remember the past. Unfortunately, the story doesn't do much to help. Lazy storytelling shortcuts are taken at every turn, making a fantastical concept even more difficult to believe.
Curtis is usually quite adept with this type of rom-dramedy, but he's not at the helm here. Boyle is, and he's known for his hyper-stylized direction, which proves problematic. Where he spends time working on montages of ridiculous metaphorical storytelling devices, he should be fleshing out character motivations and ethical conundrums. Yesterday makes me glad we live in a reality with The Beatles, so we can ignore this movie and stay home to listen to Abbey Road."

","Hey, there is a moment in every one's life when you need a break, and you need to remember that life can be simple, can be romantic, can be wistful, can be about remembering what matters and why.
This movie is not about fixing the world or fixing the audience, it is about bringing a smile to your face while providing a special pleasure that we did not know we were missing out on: the one that allow us to revel in the sound, poetry and consciousness of one of the most iconic band the music scene has known.
I enjoyed the movie with my kid, who used to sing the Beatles when she was a toddler and that turned into a teenager not particularly interested in the music her parent enjoyed, who had as much a blast as I did during the movie.
The acting rand true, the emotion were genuine and the music was a blast, there is absolutely no reason to miss out on this cool concept and movie."

","I liked it. It was a refreshing change from the blockbuster superhero genre that is choking society.
Jack's struggle with the dishonesty was obvious throughout the film. The music was superb. Ed Sheeran's portrayal of himself was super cute.
I was a little worried the writer would take it over the top and Ed would decide Jack was better than he and decide to stop making music. I am very glad they didn't go there with the story.
Jack coming clean near the end and the way he did it, was a good ending for me.
Also the fact that The Beatles were not the only thing/person to disappear during the blackout was a fun touch.
All in all, It was an emotional, fun, twist of a movie."

","After Bohemian Rhapsody and Rocketman. Yesterday is the next movie based on the classic song sang by a classic musicians. But unlike Bohemian Rhapsody and Rocketman which are biography movies. Yesterday is a fantasy comedy movie which is a different take from the previous two. Did the movie deliver or did the movie disappoint. After seeing the first trailer back in February I was very interested in the its unique concept of the movie.<br/><br/>The plot for the movie centers around Jack Malek who is a struggling musician until he had a bus crash while power was turned off about 12 seconds he then finds out that he is the only person who knows the songs of the Beatles.<br/><br/>The movie delivered on its premised in a lot of levels. The performances by Himesh Patel and Lily James was excellent they had great chemistry and you can feel their friendship grew throughout the movie. I thought Ed Sheeran wasn't that bad in the movie and he was a lot better than I expecting considering that most real life musicians acting was mostly bad. The movie featured lots of classic Beatles which was great even though Let It Be was on briefly I was expecting a full version of the record in the movie. But that didn't ruin the whole movie. The ending of movie was very moving and emotional don't going to say anything about the ending but it was lovely ending.<br/><br/>Overall the movie was excellent it was original but unlike a lot of original movies that has a great premise but didn't deliver this movie does deliver with great performances and a wonderful ending this movie is to enjoy by everyone who loves the the Beatles or just want to have a great fun time at the cinema.

The acting is wonderful, the direction seems to be having as much fun as the actors are, the music is, well, mostly The Beatles, but with new and fun arrangements that pay so much honor to the originals.

Childhood sweethearts never expressed love for each other, then something happens, their relationship gets strained, until love wins and is declared publicly.<br/><br/>This isn't a whodunnit, you can guess the ending from the trailer. You will have seen countless films like this and you come to expect everything that happens to happen. Just as you expect a chorus after a verse in a Beatles song. Or any other pop song.<br/><br/>But within that outer layer there is a very interesting subject that the film explores: what if we lost something that brings us all together? What if we didn't have a shared cultural experience to which we all give the same meaning?<br/><br/>When the blackout happens, the Beatles are not the only thing that disappears from public memory: Jack googles ""coke"" and the search engine - which is what gives Meaning these days - displays a picture of Pablo Escobar. So when Jack asks a waitress for coke, it is not a ubiquitous beverage that the woman thinks of.<br/><br/>And so Jack finds himself with the opportunity to gain fame and riches by appropriating what had been a pillar of our post-war popular culture globally: the Beatles catalogue. Because the true premise of the film is this: everyone likes the Beatles. And Beatles songs therefore can be used by us all to communicate with each other.<br/><br/>Soon though Jack finds that the music has lost its universal meaning for the people who now appreciate ""his"" music. He is confronted with the ruthless pragmatism of the music industry, all the while being isolated by his alien cultural baggage and climb to fame.<br/><br/>So when he reunites with the only two other people unaffected by the blackout, he finds that meaning again, and the plot finally twists.<br/><br/>This isn't a film about the Beatles' music, it isn't a documentary about their legacy - it's a film about a world suddenly losing shared experience, about losing a ""consensus"" that brought us together.<br/><br/>That's why I thought the ending, the other part of the ending, the one I'm not going to spoil, was so uplifting and progressive.

"seige-hound","5","120","224","24 June 2019"," Decent movie that doesn't quite live up to its great premise
","Yesterday tells the story of Jack, an amateur musician who is trying to break into the industry with the help of his best friend Ellie, but when he gets hit by a truck riding his bike home one night, he wakes up in an alternate universe where several things have turned out to have never existed, but most importantly the Beatles and their songs. Jack decides to take advantage of this, and uses the Beatles' music to launch his career, becoming the most famous pop star in the world.<br/><br/>That premise sounds great, and I was looking forward to a surreal comedy, but to be honest, it doesn't quite live up to it, instead getting distracted by what the actual main plot turned out to be: a cliche romantic comedy with the childhood friend that is secretly in love with the protagonist, only for him to figure it out for himself later.<br/><br/>The best moments of this film are to do with the central premise of the alternate universe, where Jack would reference something, only for the people around him to say ""what's that?"" I mean, it's the same joke in different words basically every time, but hey, the way they execute it is pretty good. There are also some decent satirical moments with Jack interacting with the music industry, personified by Jack's manager, and an extended cameo by Ed Sheeran, who falls victim to some self-deprecating jokes, but overall seems to be the secondary 'star' of the show besides the Beatles' music.<br/><br/>Speaking of the Beatles, you'd be surprised by how little they actually contribute to the plot. For a film that is named after one of their more famous songs, you'd think that their music and impact to society would be more than just a plot device for the main character to achieve his success. There's no real commentary as to why the Beatles music is so great, you're just told, over and over again, that they're the greatest band ever, and that a world without them ever existing would suck. Sure, that is something I would agree with, but the film doesn't really add much of their own perspective to that side of the story, it just takes that idea as fact.<br/><br/>The romance is decent, but cliche and overall unremarkable. Screenwriter Richard Curtist definitely knows how to write romances, having written several well regarded romcoms, like Love Actually and About Time, but I would say that Yesterday isn't quite up to that standard. Same goes for Danny Boyle and the other films he directed compared to this. The direction isn't bad, but it's bland and doesn't really add much to the story. There are some weird shots, like some weird dutch angles near the beginning of the story that seem out of place, but nothing else unusual or amazing about the camerawork either.<br/><br/>I guess if you like romcoms and Beatles music, this movie will definitely be watchable, but for me, as a person who doesn't actively seek out that genre, this film didn't stand out to me in either direction, and overall I'm disappointed that they didn't take full advantage of the great premise."

"Lonnis_Cult","5","49","86","20 July 2019"," Lacking substance
","I saw Yesterday a few weeks ago, I wasn't surprised by what I saw. Very average and missed opportunities are really my general thoughts on it. The interesting places that the film could have gone were wasted and replaced by a boring romance and a sappy ending. Jack Malik could have been so much more interesting as a character if he actually made mistakes and did bad things. Since the very beginning of the film, he's a good person that knows stealing the Beatles music is bad. That's boring. The two other people that remembered the Beatles should have had much more conflict with Jack and not just thank him for ""sharing the Beatles to the world"" as soon as they met him. The film would be ten times better if Jack had gone ahead with becoming famous, resulting in him becoming rich and arrogant, and the two people who remembered the Beatles try and expose him. Jack's friends and love interest grow to dislike him, and Jack realises that he needs to change and come clean. Something like that.
Oh, good God, Ellie was the absolute worse. The romance between her and Jack was so generic and lame. If Ellie loved Jack so much, than why didn't SHE ask him to a date? Why was she waiting for Jack to ask? She was annoying and entitled.
And speaking of romance, what the hell was up with Rocky ending up with the other woman we saw at Ellie's house? I saw them together in montage at the very end of the film, but they're never seen talking to each other during the film. You can't just add some romance between too characters who don't even interact through the film.
The humour was pretty weak, too. But if I'm being honest, I'm probably too young to find the humour funny since the adults around me were laughing, and I'm definitely not the target demographic. However, why the hell was Jack's friends laughing at him when he was hit by a bus?? Do they know that he could have been severely injured or killed? Imagine seeing the person you love in a hospital bed, all bloodied up and you just laugh? That's horrible.
The only reason I didn't give the film a 0/10 is because it isn't unwatchable. There are some cool and pretty shots, decent acting and the very rare moment where I smiled. Other than that, the film lacks substance and interesting characters. I guess it works as a love letter to the Beatles, but definitely a wasted opportunity for an interesting concept."
"spm08588","8","88","166","4 June 2019"," Beatles tribute gets lost in love story and is saved by Beatles music
","Vi and I made it out last night to a preview of Danny Boyle's most recent which contemplates what the world might be like without The Beatles. Or rather, if nobody remembered The Beatles, except the former teacher, protagonist who also happens to be a struggling singer songwriter who is nearing the 10,000 hour mark of his up to now futile music career.<br/><br/>Was it 'merely' the underlying brilliance of Lennon and McCartney that propelled The Beatles to stardom in the 60's? Is it simply catchy tunes and meaningful lyrics that led to the perennial relevance of The Beatles catalog? Is this an ongoing cultural phenomenon demonstrated by the passing of love of Beatles music from parent to child, fan to the uninitiated, that continues, fervently, even today? These might be a few of the questions that ran through my head as the plot unfolded manifest in another question: could one guy with a guitar replicate The Fab Four's success?<br/><br/>As a bit of a Beatles fan, the subtext to the film, contrasts the roles that a select few beyond the fab four played in The Beatles success with the movie's equivalents. As a snarky jab at the music industry, Brian Epstein's meticulous eye for detail is hearkened and contrasted with Kate McKinnon, whose performance is at once spot on and over the top. Her character is undoubtedly the tip of the iceberg for those archetype 'gonna conquer the world' southern California denizens, yet rings hollow in a few spots. The distinction is poignant for a Danny Boyle movie, normally the complete opposite of tone deaf, and while I chose to include it here, the scene(s) I reference may be cut from the final release version. (For edification purposes: the music studio in L.A.)<br/><br/>Speaking of the studio, The Beatles, simply would not be without the mastery of studio producer George Martin. The orchestral arrangements, the sound story mentality, the embracing of The Beatles' desire to embrace the latest technologies are a few of the ways in which Martin guided the manifestation of magic conveyed on vinyl. The film, in this regard, is light on the complexity and development of the sound over time and focuses instead, even acknowledges, that Jack's is a lesser reflection of the brilliance of The Beatles, with a few laugheties about lyric selection.<br/><br/>Which is not to say that the interpretations of the songs chosen are not without merit. The sincere portrayal of 'Yesterday' provides a solid framing for the rest of the movie. 'In my Life' plays a vital role in driving the movie forward, and appropriately so. And the at once nuanced, yet in your face pleading of 'Help' is a true reading of the song's rarely spoken meaning appropriate to the character and plot. Patel's rendering, spoken and sung, is true.<br/><br/>What is a bit muddled is the inability for interpersonal communication in a world without a common language of love, alongside earworm hooks, impeccably delivered by John, Paul, George, and Ringo. Instead it takes a plot twist I didn't anticipate, to initiate the third half of the movie resolution.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the movie succeeds at contemplating how a struggling musician / teacher might navigate the complicated waters of being the one person in the world who remembers and can perform The Beatles...A Long and Winding Road indeed!"
"a_nella","1","56","104","6 July 2019"," Bland love story masked by a unique idea
","The movie is essentially an extremely bland, boring and predictable love story hiding behind the Beatles music. The characters in this movie are borderline insufferable. I only knew one of the characters name by the end of the movie, jack malik, and that is only because his name appears in almost every scene. any other character i could not even guess a name because they were so one dimensional it wasn't worth my time to remember. Most of the characters were bland, with no true motivations and awful chemistry. Jack malik, the main character, seems so unenthusiastic about everything. He doesn't enjoy making music and doesn't act like he loves the female lead until the plot requires conflict. Additionally the movie shoves the idea of ""big corporate media is bad"" down your throat when it would be much more interesting if it had an ounce of subtly to it.<br/><br/>The technical aspects of the film are all average, the cinematography had some unique shots, but nothing spectacular.<br/><br/>I can honestly say that the only aspect of this film someone could find any ounce of enjoyment from is the Beatles music, and even then it only takes up a small portion of the film."

","If this movie used a fictional band instead of the Beatles it wouldn't be in the movie theaters or talked about. The irony of this movie is the main character profits off of the Beatles not existing the same way the creators of this movie profit off of the Beatles to sell this boring movie. Just a bland copy-pasted love story with boring characters you don't care about. 90% of the profits should go to Paul, Yoko, Ringo, and Georges family because without the Beatles name this movie is worthless and when you take the Beatles out that's exactly what it is, worthless. Just more nostalgic non sense to sell a movie in 2019, sad."
"Derache","5","26","45","5 September 2019"," Okay concept, cheezy movie
","So this movie really didn't have much to do with the Beatles, It was more of a background plot that was happening to progress the real story, which was a romance between a guy and a girl. Of course, the whole concept of everyone forgetting was cool, but most of the movie was obnoxious and filled with crappy jokes. The remade Beatles music was done very well, however I feel like the movie was preying on nostalgia and really just selling a mediocre love story. It wasn't terrible but it wasn't good either. I would recommend against watching it."
"jeff_dickey","8","12","19","10 August 2019"," Not perfect, but perfectly charming
","For the less than Jedi Nerd-level Beatles fans, this is a treat. Himesh Patel sings and plays well and with lots of heart. With two exceptions, the songs are near-original-quality covers of the comfortable, famous originals.<br/><br/>It's wrapped in a love story that feels heartfelt and charming, and follows the classic formula: boy grows up with girl, in love with each other but too shy to say it; boy grows into man whose closest friend is the girl-turned-woman who _almost_ leaves as he gets rich and famous and more distant from her; man realises that he's going to lose the woman (to his childhood best male friend) and it nearly drives him insane before he gets her back. One of the two variations on the original songs, _Help_, is a frenzied, nearly acid/hard rock primal scream for help, directed to his love. (The contemporary-to-us crowd, of us crowd, of course, eat it up.)<br/><br/>About the second variation on an original song, I will just say that it reminds anyone in a creative field why even the most well-meaning non-creatives (including managers) should have their input sharply curtailed. A one-word change takes the song from a heartfelt, nearly spiritual song of encouragement into a parody of itself. While the substituted word was likely in the Beatles' individual vocabularies, I don't recall it ever being used in their songs. As a plot device helping to illustrate two of the relationships involved, though, it's brilliant.<br/><br/>Listening to the (original) Beatles' albums in chronological order leads the listener to appreciate the maturing, pain-and-happiness roller-coaster of the writers' (mostly John's and Paul's) lives. We lose that in the movie; Jack is less concerned with (and has far less time to) presenting a continuous arc than simply ""writing"" and arranging enough songs to meet commitments. That's sad to the purist but, stepping back a bit, should be entirely understandable as an illustration of Jack being 'Under Pressure' (did Queen exist in the alternate timeline? Do we care?)<br/><br/>What we _do_ care about, in the end, is Jack and Ellie and finding how, exactly life works out. It turns out you really _can_ ""get by with a little help from (your) friends"".<br/><br/>So why not 9/ or 10/10? Really only two dings grated on me: the portrayal of Jack's parents, and one or two of the other supporting characters who regularly jerked me out of the magic. It is difficult to imagine a talented, intelligent young man growing up, being able to coherently express himself and coherently socialise, with that sort of upbringing. Yes, they mean well, and yes, they obviously love him; what isn't at all obvious is how he managed not to need a decade or two of psychotherapy. Hopefully, with his (in-story) earnings, he'd avail himself of help if it was needed.<br/><br/>Jack was a 9.5 out of 10. Ellie was a 9.5 out of 10, including two bonus points for beyond-saintly patience. More of them, please!"
"JuanFrancisco-Merino-1","7","6","8","14 September 2019"," Hello, goodbye.
","A movie having The Beatles as a central part of the plot will always bring a lot of expectations. Add the participation of Danny Boyle and Richard Curtis and you wouldn't want to wait to watch it on cinemas.<br/><br/>Unfortunately only in theory.<br/><br/>Reality, however, slapped me on the face. As you can guess, the music of the four of Liverpool is magical: the only idea of not hearing these wonderful songs made a big hole in my heart. This music is the soundtrack of my life and, for sure, of many other Beatles freaks. Sadly, the performances and the script do not elevate the movie to the levels one expects.<br/><br/>Himesh Patel is fine. He makes a good job singing. Problem is that he acts like a terrified child during 99% of the movie. In my opinion, he could have given a deeper and darker tone to his character, considering the moral dilemma of having success with not much work, geniality and inspiration (a common situation in today's music business).<br/><br/>I love Lily James in other movies, but I feel that the presence of her character in this one is utterly unnecessary: blame it to Mr Richard Curtis' belief that any movie MUST have a love story, no matter how stupid the characters might be.<br/><br/>What to say about Kate McKinnon? I will just point out that the flop of casting this lady in a could-have-been-great 'Ghostbusters' repeats in this movie. She's a terrible actress who goes always for the easiest way.<br/><br/>There are memorable moments, however: the introduction of Sir Paul McCartney and George Harrison in the James Corden talk show nightmare sequence, the mocking of Jack's ideas to the variety of names suggested for his debut album in the politically correct world of the XXI century, the concert on a terrace to make Jack's formal presentation to the world and John Lennon's appearance performed by an always impeccable Robert Carlyle.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 7/10, mostly due to the wonderful soundtrack, an excellent premise and the good intentions of Mr. Boyle and Mr. Curtis."

Curtis is smaltz, but Boyle, I expected better as it was on his name got me to the cinema. The story was awful, the main actor was awful, all of it was just awful. Then when I thought it couldn't get any worse, Robert Carlyle appears as the forgotten John Lennon, hard to explain the story but let us just say John never reached fame with the Beatles and was a reclusive artist living on a beach painting seascapes......Poor Lennon and Harrison will be turning in their graves...Apple, McCartney, Starr, Ono and Harrison's widow will rue the day they allowed this tosh to go to the screen.<br/><br/>If there were ever to be a Beatles reunion in Heaven, allowing this movie to be released will have scuppered it's chances."

","Himesh Patel channels Russel Brand to great effect as an indecisive singer songwriter who can't tell that his gorgeous manager is crazy about him. Like Charlie Chaplin Patel probably isn't attractive enough to justify the personal magnetism the movie ascribes to him, but who cares? The movie is such fun, with such a great score nobody minds about the plausibility of it.
Like a Jane Austin period pic, Yesterday uses classic visual motifs to move our subconscious along with the plot, like the rooftop concert that was the Beatles last public appearance, the running fans at railway stations and desperate taxi rides.
The English speaking world erased the Beatles from the radio waves after they broke up, replacing them with Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin and endless 70's Glam-Rock acts: Yesterday is an act of penitence and restitution by the rock / pop establishment, designed to lay the ghosts of George Harrison and John Lennon to rest before Sir Paul and Ringo join them in that rock and roll heaven."

","I'd consider myself a huge Beatles fan (I'm 20 y/o so not exactly my generations kind of music), I was so excited for this movie. For me, the movie didn't have to be great, but hearing the music in the theater would be remarkable in and of itself. But this movie exceeded my expectations. Is it a perfect film? No, absolutely not. But in an age of superhero movies and musical biopics, to have such an original idea be brought to life about a band that is seemingly larger than life was a joy to watch. There are a few sequences and jokes that don't hit their mark, but the theme of the movie certainly does. Love. It was more of a romance than I thought it would be, but the undeniable chemistry between Jack (Himesh Patel) and Ellie (the lovely Lily James) turned this movie from solid to a very good movie. You begun to wonder halfway through the third act how they're going to tie this together and let's just say, you won't see it coming. All I have to say is: Wow. The movie also reminded me how timeless their music is, being a fan I have to say you come to re-appreciate the genius of Paul and George and Ringo and John, in a way that cut's even deeper while paired with the romance with Jack and Ellie. If you are not a Beatles fan (how can you not be?), the movie will undoubtedly lose some of it's effect and charm, but it will still carry itself through guest appearances by Ed Sheeran (who did a very good job) and funny sequences. All in all a 7.7/10, the feel good movie of the summer with great performances and original story, that is paired with some of the greatest songs ever written!

","2019 Oak Cliff Film Festival
Greetings again from the darkness. A world without music from The Beatles? It's hard to ""imagine"". It's not as simple as never having their classics played on the radio, as the number of musicians influenced by their work is roughly the size of the list of every musician who has ever written or sang a song over the past 60 years. Of course, that's a bit too much to tackle in a movie, so director Danny Boyle (Oscar winner for SLUMBDOG MILLIONAIRE) simplifies things by serving up a 12 second global power outage.<br/><br/>Jack Malik (Himesh Patel, ""EastEnders"") is the epitome of a struggling musician. He plays kids' parties and pubs where the only applause is from his small group of friends who enjoy busting his chops over his ""summer"" song. His lifelong friend Ellie (Lily James, BABY DRIVER, MAMMA MIA!, PRIDE AND PREJUDICE AND ZOMBIES) is also his manager and roadie ... his only true supporter. There is an unrequited attraction between the two, and since the script comes from Richard Curtis (LOVE ACTUALLY), we know where this is headed.<br/><br/>When the global power outage hits, Jack is on his bicycle and a collision with a bus puts him in the hospital. During recovery, he stumbles on to the fact that he is the only person who remembers music from John, Paul, George, and Ringo. Quickly capitalizing on the opportunity, Jack frantically tries to recall the lyrics to the songs, and in short time is replacing his playlist post-it notes with the familiar (to us) song titles, and blowing people away with ""his"" formidable songwriting and incredible music.<br/><br/>Fortune shines on Jack and his new songs, and soon Ed Sheeran (playing himself) is helping Jack's career, while at the same time being humbled by these songs. It's at this point where Kate McKinnon joins in as the money-grubbing talent agent who recognizes a gold mine when she hears it. Additional comedy is provided by Joel Fry as Rocky, Jack's new roadie; and a trip to Liverpool follows, as does a world tour and album recording session.<br/><br/>Danny Boyle is known best for his likeable, easy to digest films that are typically crowd-pleasers, but leave me wanting more depth and substance. This one fits right in. It's funny (""Hey Dude"", Abbey Road is just a road) and has amazing music (of course). However, where Lily James plays her role perfectly, Himesh Patel - despite a fine singing voice - simply lacks the charisma and screen presence to carry the film. We rarely feel his inner turmoil in living this whopper of a lie, and the film never really clicks as a Rom-Com. In fact, the only thing we should be loving here is the Beatles music. The film plays a bit like Rod Serling decided to take ""The Twilight Zone"" into comedy. The real impact would be lost, but it would still likely draw a crowd."

The trouble is the film pretends to be about a concept, namely, a world where the Beatles never existed but one man inexplicably remembers all their work, but is actually just another implausible rom com with some excellent, excellent songs on the soundtrack. Other than these songs, the only reason to see this is to see Ed Sheerhan defy critics who said his cameo in game of thrones was the worst performance on film since tommy Wiseau. Thanks to his role here, it's now only second worst."

","It's hard to put into words how enjoyable this movie is. Yes, any film containing this much Beatles music is bound to be good, but the premise is incredibly clever and the acting was great as well. Combine that with Danny Boyle's brilliant directing, and a few surprises, and you have a truly great movie!"
"deandsouza15892","9","21","43","29 June 2019"," A unique experience
","To set your expectations straight, there's very little Beatles in this story. I feel like people are going to expect something the likes of Bohemian Rhapsody or Rocketman, but that's not the case.
This story is more about the lead character, with the sprinkled essence of the Beatles.
Now that we've got that out of the way, this was an absolute delight.
It's been some time since I've seen a Danny Boyle film, but I'm glad he's still got that unique touch.<br/><br/>This movie feels different. It's shot quite well (beautiful cinematography), the humor is brilliant (I burst out laughing multiple times), the story is fun (absolutely childish), the themes are subtle (but impactful) and the character satire is on point. Everyone has memorable moments in this film.<br/><br/>The story is a weird mix of unpredictable and cliche, but it's paced well. The first two acts fly by, leaving you with a slightly long,but acceptable climax. It's also riddled with meta-references,so if pop culture is your thing, entertainment is guaranteed.<br/><br/>If you appreciate the following, you will enjoy this film - British dark comedy, the music industry, irony and anti-humor, the love for Beatles (in that order)<br/><br/>I know that this is a relatively minor film in the summer scape,but it's worth your time,if you choose to see it. It's most certainly the funniest movie I've seen this summer."
"theseusrori","3","25","53","27 June 2019"," Nice premise which doesn't quite come together
","Not to be confused with the South African movie of the same name. Our hero is an Indian gentleman named Jack Malik. He can sing a little and plays guitar (mostly on the streets of London). The movie starts with this street busker who somehow possesses a manageress (played by the pretty Lily James (Zombies) who is actually his childhood sweetheart.<br/><br/>Jack unfortunately has the charisma of an insect compared to the real Beatles who all were bursting at the seams with stage presence and charisma. Fact is they could attribute part of their world-wide fame to having oodles of charm coupled with some great song writing skills and great harmonies.<br/><br/>Our hero sits with a few problems. He isn't making headway with his attempts at forging a musical career and he doesnt know how to express his love to his bff/manageress. It would take a consultation with a dead Beatle (somehow resurrected in this new dimension to which Jack gets transported) to put him on the ""write"" track with some sage advice.<br/><br/>A collision with a vehicle and a power outage somehow sees Jack transported to another dimension. Another realm where no-one has yet heard of
the fab four. No-one that is except a select few people who accompanied Jack into this other realm. How is possible is never explained.<br/><br/>A recurring, and rather flat, joke is one about Coca-cola. Apparently Coca-cola (""He shoot Coca-cola"") has never been heard of here either.<br/><br/>Jack can't be doing too badly as he has money for expensive dental surgery to replace his broken front teeth<br/><br/>No one has heard of the Beatles in this other dimension he enters, so Jack decides to record the Beatle catalogue and present it as his own.
For a guy who was a Beatle fan it's seems strange he forgets the words to Nowhere Man. He also struggles a lot with the words to Eleanore Rigby but has no problem remembering and playing all the chords. Speaking of chords, you never see him playing any lead guitar parts like George Harrison (whose name appears surprisingly in the closing credits).<br/><br/>This movie stretched the limits of credibility to a high degree. Ed Sheeran presence does little to recue this dross from the doldrums. In one scene an impromtu writing music challenge between Ed and Jack shows Ed who ""beats all"".<br/><br/>At the end he informs his audience (thousands of them at Wembley stadium) he is actually a fraud and had been plagiarising all his hits. Not that the admission ever hurt musicians in the past (eg Led Zeppelin who
practically built a career on doing other people's stuff, like Willie Dixon's, without any consent).<br/><br/>I score this movie 3 out of 10 stars. Recommended for
love-lorne teens (the movie has an underlying romantic theme) but serious Beatle fans will leave a little unfulfilled.<br/><br/>Sanjeev Bhaskar (The Kumars) provides little comedic relief. He plays Jack's proud father (who also has no memory of the Beatles).<br/><br/>The one song I truly loved appeared over the credits. The real Beatles singing ""Hey Jude"" (not ""Hey Dude"" as Jack did)."

","I was just so pleasantly surprised by how wonderful this film was and the feelgood factor it brings. My family (46,43,18,16) walked out of the theatre all chatting about little snipets that we each enjoyed and the interpretations of the songs, how great Hamish Patel was and how gorgeous Lily James is ! The desperation of Help! and the frustrations of Let It Be. Of course for me it helps to be British and to have roots in that part of the world to add even more to the storyline and to have parents who were born in 1950 and 1952 in London who lived and breathed everything the 60's had on offer! I loved the russian guy stood there after the first gig in Moscow long after the end when the roadies are cleaning up trying to understand what he had just witnessed...All sooo good."

","Yesterday: A struggling singer/songwriter Jack (Himesh Patel) is transported into a parallel universe where The Beatles don't exist. The transport McGuffin is well handled: a global power outage during which the cycling Jack is struck by a bus. Waking up in hospital he is comforted by his roadie/manager/agent Ellie (Lily James), there is unrequited love between them which is central to the film's narrative. Jack first realises something is odd when he discovers that none of his friends recognise the song Yesterday. This scene is beautifully shot at a riverside location with a setting sun capturing the mood of the song. Going online he finds no mention of The Beatles, this universe has a good side as well though: there is also no Oasis (it also lacks a few other things).<br/><br/>So jack sets out to rewrite the songs of The Beatles, not always getting the order of words just right. Indeed Ed Sheeran (himself) persuades Jack to rename Hey Jude as Hey Dude. Jack gets to open for Sheeran on a World Tour and his road to success seems assured when Sheeran's manager Debra (Kate McKinnon) agrees to represent him. McKinnon is crazed and quirky in the role but very convincing. The move from busking and playing in bars to incipient Superstar isn't easy for Jack, director Danny Boyle effectively uses devices such as having an awestruck Jack surrounded by multimedia images of his growing fame and shows him dancing through the Mersey Tunnel as he researches songs. The capstone is perhaps when Sheeran describes himself as Salieri to Jack's Mozart.<br/><br/>A witty, touching, enjoyable film of potential greatness thrust upon an ordinary person who is riven by self-doubt. Great cameo by Robert Carlyle as an elderly John Lennon. Wonderfully delivered by director Danny boyle from a screenplay by Richard Curtis. 8.5/10."

"tooner2004","1","59","141","30 June 2019"," Does anyone else see the irony in this disaster?
","The premise of ""Yesterday"" is that the Beatles no longer exist. The irony is that the filmmakers have made a movie that treats the Beatles as if this was REALLY the case. There is absolutely no attempt to show the incalculable impact that the Beatles had on the world. Instead, we get a global society that's pretty much the same, but bereft of the Beatles music, as if music was their only contribution to life as we know it.
This ludicrous script is basically a ""romantic comedy"" that presents a litany of every cliche in the genre, with an ending that is so saccharine, and so contrived, I almost walked out of the theater (If I were closer to the aisle, I would have). There is also a ""cameo"" towards the end of the film that is beyond tasteless. How in the world can Apple, the Beatles and their heirs have signed off on this?!
If you love the Beatles and their music, avoid this insult to everything they stood for. Hopefully, it will disappear quickly and be forgotten. If you truly want to know who the Beatles were, I recommend Mark Lewisohn's brilliant biography, ""Tune In"".

Sure you can pull it apart and be a high brow armchair critic, but this film isn't trying to pretend to be anything it isn't. It is a fun, happy, well acted (OK Sheeran may be the exception here!) film with great songs (obviously). Lily James is exceptional in this. Even dressed down she looks like a goddess.

"Prismark10","6","9","16","18 September 2019"," The Frog Chorus
","A film full of The Beatles songs cannot really go wrong.<br/><br/>Danny Boyle has made a whimsical fantasy. What if we live in a world where The Beatles did not happen. John, Paul, George and Ringo never amounted to much because they never got together. Gosh it would mean somebody else narrated those early episodes of Thomas the Tank Engine.<br/><br/>Jack Malik (Himesh Patel) is a struggling singer in a small seaside town who is going nowhere. About to call it quits the only person who believed in him is best friend from school, Ellie (Lily James.)<br/><br/>One night when all the lights go out throughout the world, Jack is involved in a bus accident and wakes up in a world where no one have heard of the pop group The Beatles or their songs.<br/><br/>Jack writes the songs from memory and wows the audience with Hey Jude, Back in the USSR, Here Comes the Sun, Yesterday and Let it Be. These songs find an audience for the first time.<br/><br/>Unfortunately Richard Curtis's screenplay takes some interesting ideas and then diverts its attention to a soppy and unnecessary romance. This is a rom-com and you see Jack and Ellie only ever had a platonic relationship so far, all through childhood, to those teenage years when their hormones were raging to the present day. Jack it seems never had a girlfriend and never romanced Ellie, the woman who has always believed in him. Suddenly Jack realises he needs Ellie when she has found someone else.<br/><br/>I would like to have known more about this world that had no Coca Cola, cigarettes and Oasis. The joke about Oasis was funny, a band so influenced by The Beatles, they could never exist if the Fab Four had never happened. Then again without The Beatles there would had been no Bruce Springsteen, The Eagles and Brian Wilson would not have strived so hard to create Pet Sounds. Some young filmmaker called Robert Zemeckis would never had made a movie called 'I Wanna Hold Your Hand.' It does raise an issue, The Beatles were more than just the songwriting. It was also the music, the harmonies, how they sang and the production by George Martin.<br/><br/>Some ideas are explored such as the music industry sanitising the product they want to sell. The White Album has diversity issues according to a marketing executive. However Curtis goes for the default romance story in the second half which lets it down."
"danielriveray","1","15","30","23 July 2019"," What a way to butcher The Beatles' legacy

What a complete waste of an opportunity to show the youth who don't know The Beatles (yes, it's a thing) who they really were. Next is The Doors and Bieber by Guy Ritchie.<br/><br/>I do not want to extend myself more because I don't want to think about this film anymore.<br/><br/>PS: what is up with the John Lennon part? Do these guys validate ideas?
Acting by Patel and James is good. My point is for them"
"pulp2","3","12","23","22 July 2019"," Missed opportunities
","What if... the Beatles songs hadn't been published until today? Would they have the same impact in 2019? The songs were all written in the 60s and 70s, in times of free love, anarchy, rebellion, and also without much musical competition (apart from the Stones). Would they have the same success today, detached from this social context? I have my doubts. In addition, they were written and performed by 4 wild, charismatic and talented musicians - attributes that the main character in this film completely lacks (on a side note: the typical polyphonic Beatles choruses are only recorded monophonically by him... what a mess!)<br/><br/>Back to the actual movie: It lacks everything: logic, depth, an interesting story, good characters... Even in a phantasy premise, a certain conclusiveness could be expected. If the Beatles never existed, why do the other 2 people remember them? So they existed anyway? And if John Lennon is still alive but has never been a musician, who wrote the songs? And where are the other three? Also, Harry Potter, Coke, cigarettes got lost in oblivion - a random sequence of popular western world consumer goods? Not that it matters - they mention it, and forget it again.
And the power failure / accident at the beginning: The bus has no head lights on during the crash - which makes no sense, because the bus is run by fuel, not electricity. But who cares...<br/><br/>The main character has the depth of a sheet of paper, zero charisma, is a professional loser, still lives with his parents, has nothing to tell - and suddenly, he is supposed to come up with those amazing lyrics? And everyone buys it? A little credibility has never hurt. Throughout the film, Jack doesn't evolve, he doesn't make any decisions himself, but is constantly thrown back and forth by fate and circumstances. No backbone, no will of his own, nothing. But Ellie falls head over heels for him - why? And after she leaves him, she replaces him with an equally lax loser. What does that say about her?
Oh, and the parents: Completely meaningless roles. They don't care about their son whatsoever, even when he suddenly becomes a world celebrity, they're more interested by the tuna sandwiches than him. The father is familiar with Ed Sheeran, but can't find the pickels in his own kitchen? Come on! Is that simply to show us that Jack is a descendent of a loser family? Rocky and the Kate McKinnon character are just unbearable in their slapstick superficiality.<br/><br/>The fact they abused the Beatles tunes and lyrics for this nonsense is almost a sacrilege. Not that they really mattered. While in Mamma Mia, the songs were meaningfully embedded in the story, here the lyrics are completely irrelevant: they could have interchanged them or used any other tunes from any other act, without affecting the story whatsoever.<br/><br/>Too bad, they could have made something nice out of a really interesting idea. But they pretty much missed every opportunity they had."
"stevejco","8","21","45","29 June 2019"," What if.....
","What if you could have it all, but simultaneously lose it all? What would you chose? That's the question posed to Jack, when he has the chance to live his lifelong dream of becoming a megastar musician, by ""re-releasing"" songs from the Fab 4 which, by freak circumstances never existed! Only problem is, it's either that or lose the girl who's loved him for almost 20 years. A fascinating storyline based on a ""what if"" scenario which leaves you thinking. Excellent acting with a typically ""no nonsense"", light-hearted British script. This movie also plays wonderful deference to the music of The Beatles, re-interpreted and replayed so as to make us realise why they were indisputably the most influential band in pop music history. A movie for music lovers and thinkers with a sense of humour."

First of all it wakes up a deep part of me that brings to the surface the realization of how much the Beatles have meant to me and my own personal life. Secondly, the acting is just awesome. The actors and actresses drew me right in on every level. The scene with the actor portraying John Lennon really nailed it. In all honesty, I'm sure that was the case for the remaining Beatles as well in their having seen the film. Had John not been a Beatle, and pursued art instead, that outcome is completely believable. Being the John Lennon fan I was and remain, and considering his assassination makes the short list of among the darkest days of my life, part of me almost wishes he would have chosen that path. The conversation John has with Jack is completely believable. I can easily imagine John Lennon speaking that way and giving that advice.
The one thing that seemed unbelievable given the premise of the movie, is that without the Beatles, everything else is relatively the same, culture, music etc . . . That is not possible. The Beatles were such a major, major bridge for the world to cross in so many ways, I think the world would be very different without them, culturally, musically, you name it. Overall though, it was an awesome movie. I rarely go to the movies, and for me to have seen this one twice (so far) is saying something."

I couldn't tell if he was trying to act as the character, or if he was trying to be himself.<br/><br/>The comedic bit aren't even that. They're such incredibly awkward moments that happen in the movie, that it almost felt like we had to have a person hold up a sign that said ""Haha"", JUST to specify that they were meant to be comedic scenes! If I have to sit there, and wonder ""was that meant to be funny?"" then it clearly failed.<br/><br/>Pacing. This movie is rushed. It's fast in all the wrong ways, and it's slow, in all the wrong ways. It never takes a moment to breathe, nor does it take a moment for us to take in the scenes. And the scenes that SHOULD be rushed? Like all the awkward scenes with Ed Sheeran, and Jack's bland, stereotypical (insert greedy manager here)? They drag on for forever!<br/><br/>And yes, the elephant in the room. The pointless subplot romance with his best friend/manager Ellie. I'm sorry, but I thought it was just..unnecessary. And there isn't much chemistry between the two of them. I'm sure there's people who thought it was okay, and that's fine, but me, personally? It just slowed the ""energy"" (what energy the movie even had), and just brought everything to a halt.<br/><br/>TL;DR: The movie is not worth spending money at a theater. It's a one-and-done movie. It's boring, both rushed and slow, it's just not an interesting movie. Honestly, I'd only spend $4.00 to rent 'Yesterday', and say 'Alright, I saw it'. Basically, I wouldn't recommend this movie."

A complete opposite to the style and spirit of the best rock band in music history. The actor (Himesh Patel) has a sweet beautiful voice which is appropriate for Ed Sheeran cover songs but is very very far from the character of the Beatles songs and their voices and unique character.

This is an interesting concept about what if no one had ever heard of the rock group The Beatles or their music. It reminded me of the old Marvel comic book series called 'What If?'. Himesh plays a struggling musician that gets hit by a bus when power all over the world goes off for about 12 seconds-there is a quick explanation given as to the cause. When he wakes up, nobody has a clue as to who the Beatles are. There are several other things that have magically disappeared from everyone's minds, too-except for Himesh's-such as the soft drink Coke. Lily is Himesh's manager/chauffeur-she drives him everywhere since he can't drive-and is one of the first people that stuns him with the lack of knowledge of who the Beatles are. When he plays a Beatles song, everyone thinks he is a genius song writer and he even tells Lily that he didn't write the songs but she doesn't believe him. Ed playing himself, becomes friends with Hamish after hearing one of his masterpieces and offers him a job as his opening act. Kate is Ed's manager and tries to get Hamish's business by taking over as his manager, too, squeezing Lily out of a job. Hamish feels bad about taking undue credit but things keep escalating. It has lots of the Beatles songs-I think I read that it has 17 songs they got the rites to-and there is a couple of cameos, including one big whopper.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for suggestive content and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 56 minutes.
I really enjoyed it and if you are a Beatles fan, you probably will, too. I would buy it on Blu-Ray."

","What if a global power outage caused you to get hit by a bus in the dark, and you wake up discovering there's no sign of anything The Beatles have ever accomplished?<br/><br/>
There was a time when Danny Boyle was a director who's projects were considered edgy and each one of them had their own style. What if just like in Yesterday, he all of a sudden forgot about his previous work and decided to work with screenwriter Richard Curtis (Love, Actually) to makes the most dull film we've ever seen of him? Well, that scenario doesn't seem too crazy..<br/><br/>""Yesterday"" stars Himesh Patel (Eastenders) and the usually very energetic Lily James (Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again) to play a struggling singer-songwriter and his manager/love interest - yet Patel's character is completely clueless to the moves she makes.<br/><br/>
Jack Malik (Patel) is ready to give up his dying career as a wannabe singer, when he gets knocked down by a bus in the middle of a global electricity outage. He wakes up in the hospital and soon finds out nobody has ever heard of the legendary band The Beatles (as well as some other brands/objects, which is clearly a perfect opportunity for the filmmakers to incorporate plenty of product placement.. Michael Bay would be proud.).<br/><br/>When Jack sees an opportunity to make bank, he knows just the way how to get people's attention by writing down the lyrics of every song The Beatles have ever released - at least the ones he can remember. He claims to be the sole writer of these songs and after appearing on a morning show on local television, he gets discovered by Ed Sheeran and invited to accompany him on his upcoming world tour as the singer's opening act. When Sheeran's crazed agent Hannah (Kate McKinnon) approaches the rising superstar to sign him to her label, he has no idea where this rapidly progressing voyage will take him.<br/><br/>Not only will he discover how fame can blind you from what's right in front of you, he will also learn the true meaning of the phrase ""the grass isn't always greener on the other side"". Girl-next-door Elly (James) was his rock from day one. Seeing her being pushed aside by his own greediness makes him realise what he's really been missing in life: love.
It's supposed to be a very British romantic comedy with a highly original concept that leans towards fantasy.<br/><br/>
Yesterday could've been the sweet antidote in a world filled with sequels and blockbusters, but nothing is more disappointing than to see a well-accomplished director as Boyle screw it all up. The direction is all over the place with inter-titles and unbelievable scenes that won't fly in the world we live in right now. It is too realistic to be set in a fantasy world and the film never pulls you in completely. Even the funny one liners and McKinnon's delightful comedic punches as a stereotypical Hollywood agent, can't save how ordinary ""Yesterday"" feels. And if you're really here for the music, I have to disappoint you. The few music montages are not even worth the admission, since most of the performances get cut short. Just let it be.<br/><br/>Review by Seth Eelen for novastreamnetwork"
"ReadingFilm","10","9","19","18 July 2019"," Ownership is up for grabs in the 21st century
","Oscar. Apple. Olympics. Bond. Beatles. Boyle asks his own phenomenon from his hyper90s counter culture roots resting comfortably inside an exploration of impostor syndrome. Now it is one of the defining questions ahead of us, specifically for the dearth of culture encircling us is this notion of authorship being on the same spectrum as our great debates in identity; as in the right to ownership not a tangible notion. This is not just music but a kind of test of western privilege. Who hasn't thought of the exact concept? But to actually go there is almost a cultural event, to peel into our counterfeit solipsism in search of their yearning for authenticity. That is not a judgment, but an endpoint in late stage capitalism rendering the individual dreamer as something from 'yesterday'. At first it is indeed him and not the music so he fails, until it second guesses itself that no, it is the music. It posits with the frame of art, real life is the gimmick; then adopting the frame becomes the frame. Identity. So the question of interest is not 'what if the Beatles' but, what if millennials, in wearing said identity, had a soul? Okay but then what if there was a World War in the 80s to lead to such identities? As to what sort of cultural madness could lead to the Beatles requires some great collective trauma or societal movement to unite a culture in a renaissance. So what is the millennial war? As is, escalating streamlining of privilege was our renaissance. Millennial cultural reactions are now fragments of regurgitation then our lack of culture becomes the subject bringing a hall of mirrors to show identities for choosing. We envied stuff once happened. It all reflects this complex prism of Boyle's self-insert in impostor syndrome; he began as an enfant-terrible after all so his success may be, on some level, a confusion for him. Here, the 60s without the 60s in the vessel of the millennial power fantasy it's basically yet another look at the Beatles through a deconstructing lens; they are, after all, so iconic and ingrained, even archetypal, that films exploring them tend to be conceptual, even metaphysical as their era championed such play with their elfish pranking. Films about the Beatles were always sort of postmodern gags. Adapted for today in the post-youtube age they come to reflect where youth meets the hyper age, and the fallout; lo and behold cultural renaissances are a threat. The millennial war was technological. With all things equal in the algorithm, all of those YouTube stars got too big, the war was corporate in nature against 'you' actually tubing... which puts The Beatles with today at a discrepancy: a counter-culture in an age where the war is against culture... and the best compliment I can give is the film does seem to account for this, in fact its entire purpose is to explore the divide. ""We remember those songs."" Rather they once remember there was a society. The film contrasts culture with society interestingly enough. Lennon's peaceful life came at the cost of a meaningful one: in this black mirror what if we are so lazy and complacent other people are writing our own songs, so we live every life at once. This is the exact convenience of post-culture, post-capitalistic streamlining, automation, post-individual, post-heroes journey, now hero being collectivist no longer requiring us. Thus in the frame of revolution, without war, art is the battleground. All this could ring horribly false but Boyle is too smart that he nudges subtext constantly. For the criticism of Yesterday with how the global infringes on the western accomplishment as a middle finger to capitalism's cherished heroes, I think he is aware of every problem with this being a giant tantrum, and actively counters with his craft. His best weapon is the simple sincerity of the lead performance in turmoil. The impostor woeful against the 60s. Fast after learning it's about the music, he learns it's not about the music at all. So it goes to love. Contrast the sociopath executive with Jack where somehow both in their artifice create two distinct halves. See the betrayal being exactly like a lover scorned. 'What if millennials had soul?' They would meet other millennials without it. 'What if music?' What if not? This comes at the time of his realization in feeling. So it's two loves: the childhood love and the proxy love with the exec, but love is the millennial love for themselves. The songs were a narcissistic proxy--no longer about an age, but revealing his desire for stardom for its own sake--and here is where cinema and music so abstractly collide for pointing the camera at something invisible, which all the best films do, it's that every song seems to push him deeper, as these lists of women the Beatles sang about were all post-it notes and he's watching people who lived life, lived culture, and reflected it back as a voice of a generation, and a generation who received and understood 'why', sees it all missing here. Malik comes to learn the most authentic way of being the music is the love on the table. In fact, he has to learn it directly from Lennon! The film's irony, weren't the songs enough? Blasting 'love' over and over? Rather the songs are not songs but monoliths he sings without understanding them. The millennial frame becomes Lennon's. Enlightenment ensues. ""All you need is love"" he finally gets it after thousands of performances. Most fascinating for me is how the frame of the songs suddenly makes this loser feel like a deity to us...despite we very well know the lie. Even -we- deceive ourselves inside this con of identity persuasion, hence today in every form. My favorite is the utter dread we feel that the lie would be exposed, which are almost like jump scares. This is where it stands that Boyle is so close to being a grandmaster of cinema that he can tweak and maneuver the film to thoroughly exhaust every single perspective. But he's only close in his humility; he's right there with us constantly asking and prodding and tearing his hair out about the Beatles asking 'how'. Boyle humbly steps back as a Sheeran not John though we see his virtuosity in an experimental pop frame and tip our caps how his career trajectory has some Beatles-ish mischief flowing through his veins. That its conclusion about authorship is not so clear is a subtle one. He was, after all, the author of the songs in the parallel world, and was needed to represent something missing from the world, as all artists feel. The most Beatles like thing to do would have been to own it. The oldies morally excused him after all. Rather it must end with an authentic moral act, and my problem is love was no victory in the frame of his ascent to greatness, which ended with a shrug; wouldn't years and years of channeling the greats have rubbed off on him? Wouldn't finding his authenticity finally give him something to write about? I wanted one of his own songs to be received there within the tracklists between the hits."

","I enjoyed this because I didn't think too much. If this were science fiction, which in some ways it was, and the Beatles never existed, how would so many things that were their legacy have developed. The British invasion would never have happened without them and a culture that expanded decades would never have taken place. But we can put that aside because the film tells us that the Beatles did not exist. Not that the four persons did not exist, but the band itself. I loved the bit with John Lennon where Mark David Chapman never came into his life. Anyway, it is a sappy love story in many ways, but the music is fun and the challenges of the protagonist are quite real in that milieu. I have been a huge fan of the Beatles from the get-go and if given a piece of paper and a pencil, could write the titles of a couple hundred songs. But to remember the lyrics, especially to a level of creative expertise, would be astonishing. Every once in a while something comes along that is just fun--no more criticism."

They are base level observational, cringy, pandering to millenial humor. There were literally two jokes I laughed at and that was it. The characters are messily written especially Lily James character. She contradicted herself many times and made so many stupid and annoying decisons. Credit where credit she did do a good performance and had some good moments but they were few and far between. Jack is ok as the lead but his character motivation is all over the place. Without much spoliers he changes his stance on stealing the Beatles songs constantly and it's quite dumbfounding.<br/><br/>And that's ignoring the fact that he is such a bland and uninteresting chatcter. The story is literally like every other music biopic meets romance plot and is predictable at every turn. There are an incredible amount of plot holes and lack of narrative development. They didn't care if the story made sense at all. I honestly could go on forever but the last thing I want to mention is that Ed Sheeran wasn't that bad. He did an decent job, it's just that the material they gave him was terrible. I guess this isn't the worst movie I've seen by any stretch but please don't see this.

"Dan1863Sickles","3","8","17","12 July 2019"," Erasing The Beatles From History
","Two stars for Lily James because . . . well, Lily James. One star for the odd bit of humor now and then, mostly very cozy British bits like the dad asking for a sandwich or someone stealing someone's crisps.<br/><br/>Other than that, this was a movie that left me feeling like Marlon Brando at the end of Apocalypse Now. The horror . .. the horror!<br/><br/>Please understand, I'm an American male and I've been listening to the Beatles for forty-three years. I remember what it was like when you could only buy their albums on vinyl and in America they were all different. We had Beatles 65 Beatles VI, and not Beatles for Sale. But I remember how good it felt on Sunday mornings at home, listening to songs like ""Kansas City"" and ""Words of Love.""<br/><br/>Funny thing is, both those songs are actually not Beatle originals. ""Kansas City"" was a Little Richard song. Richard was a gay black man from Macon, Georgia. ""Words of Love"" was written by a Texan named Buddy Holly. The Beatles learned a lot from those guys. Without them the Beatles really would not have existed. Without America the Beatles would not have existed.<br/><br/>Yet in this movie America is bad news, a joke, a put on. And the music of the Beatles is re-invented in a sort of painless virgin-birth that excludes any vision of change, conflict, or rebellion.<br/><br/>God knows the Beatles could be tough on America (""Rocky Raccoon"" ""Happiness Is A Warm Gun."") But they could also be hard on women. And old people. And England. And, well, everything. It's astonishing how the makers of this film want the Beatles to be remembered -- only the softest, soppiest ballads, and barely a nod to any of the mean, hard-rocking material they did almost as well as the Rolling Stones.<br/><br/>So getting down to the plot, such as it was. It's great fun to see Lily James, who soared playing unforgettable dream girls like Elizabeth Bennett and Natasha Rostov, playing a forgettable girl next door type. She just is so touching in all her scenes, especially when she hears ""Yesterday"" for the first time. But it's funny because when Jack leaves her to go on his first tour, I really expected him to start singing ""If I Needed Someone."" Because he's brushing her off for the money, and he's really ice cold about it! ""If I had some more time to spend, then I guess I'd be with you my friend . . . if I needed someone!""<br/><br/>See how cold that song is? See how heartless? George Harrison wrote that. See, the Beatles could be cold. The Beatles could be mean. But they could also be brutally honest about their emotions. That's something this movie so does not get. Nor does it wish to!<br/><br/>Now look at the other side of the coin. In the oldest romantic movie cliche, when Jack is gone too long Ellie gets herself another man. Nothing wrong with that, good on her. But it's funny, when Jack sees the other guy I really expected him to get steaming mad and rush out on stage and start singing ""I'll Cry Instead"" How did John put it? ""I've got every reason on earth to be mad, cause I've just lost the only girl I had. If I could see you now, I'd try to make you sad somehow. But I can't so I'll cry instead."" See how direct that is? How it's brutally honest and direct and says what the man really feels, without any effort to act like a nice guy or leave everyone smiling? This movie so, so, does not get ""I'll Cry Instead.""<br/><br/>When I went to the movies yesterday to watch this yesterday, it was a big milestone in my life. All the other people in line were senior citizens, and when I said ""one senior"" the lad at the counter gave it to me without even asking my age. I felt kind of thrilled, yet sad. But this movie just made me sad. It's sad that the only people who want to see a movie about the Beatles are old people like me. It's even sadder that the vision this movie presents of the Beatles rigorously excludes about sixty percent of who they really were and what they had to say. Maybe it's just as well that young people are staying away in droves!<br/><br/>When I was a kid, forty years ago, there was a cheap made for TV movie in America about the Beatles' rise to fame. I'll never forget the scene at the Cavern Club, where the local kids are screaming and going crazy and the Beatles are about to go onstage for the first time with Ringo Starr as their Drummer. John Lennon is in command, and he looks out at the crowd with a cold, sneering look on his arrogant face. Then he shouts something like, ""hello, you horrible lot. Welcome to the fabulous Apollo Theater in Harlem!""<br/><br/>Now what did he mean by that? What point was he trying to make? Figure it out and you'll understand why YESTERDAY is such an empty experience."

"andrewroy-04316","2","7","16","8 July 2019"," For such an unusual and fun premise Yesterday somehow manages to atrociously butcher the execution of the idea, and then falls into a generic and trite romantic comedy
","While I had my reservations going into Yesterday, I figured Boyle's direction and the cool premise would at least keep it enjoyable, if not perfect. As I've been thinking about it, there truly isn't a single element of the movie that I feel positively about, from the big ideas down to minor details. Let's get the obvious and ridiculous easy frustration out of the way: the cool premise is completely ruined by the worst execution of an idea I've ever seen. If Boyle had just implied that it was some fantastical force and left it vague, that would've been viable, if still not totally satisfying. Instead, he shows us plenty of effects of it while eschewing any attempt at an explanation, leaving it as a laughably absurd idea that couldn't possibly be explained. Somehow, the power goes out all around the world (weird, but ok - maybe some massive EMP?) and when it comes back on, not only does nobody remember the Beatles (or cigarettes, or Coke, or Oasis, or Harry Potter), but all physical evidence of them no longer exists. That on its face was enough for me to start doubting Boyle - sure, maybe electronic evidence could've been removed, but how could people's memories all be edited, and how could the billions of pieces of physical evidence go away instantly? Then, it's taken one step further: somehow, Jack (and two other random people) remember everything. If the movie centers on this one guy having this information nobody else remembers, there has to be at least some reasoning for why he matters or how that would happen, but there is none. Honestly, the movie seems disinterested in playing with its interesting premise beyond showing random cultural things that are removed for gags.
So the premise was horribly mangled, you say, but maybe if you just suspend disbelief and accept that this did somehow happen, maybe it would be a fun movie? If only that were the case. While the plot and other elements of the movie aren't awful, they range between disappointing to mediocre. Every character is completely one-dimensional and uninteresting beyond the single thing they are known for. Even Jack, who we see some ethical questioning and eventual development from, is a fairly simplistic and passive protagonist. Mandi, his manager, is an especially frustrating and unrealistic character as a purely greedy, uninteresting agent. I thought the movie would be much more of a love letter to the Beatles, as some reviewers had claimed, but I didn't get that sense at all. Yes, everyone lauded him as the greatest musical genius ever when he played their music, but we never really appreciated Jack's understanding of what makes their writing great or how it speaks to so many people. It's only a tribute to the Beatles so much as we hear their songs throughout, and doesn't honor their brilliance beyond just saying that Jack is apparently a genius.
I do wish the movie had gone deeper into the irony of Jack's greatness and the way our society portrays celebrities. I expected it to be much more self-aware in how Jack is just this ordinary dude who doesn't deserve to be famous more than anyone else, but who ends up as an icon. It would've been easy for him to get caught up in that fame, and while we see a couple scenes that focus on his inner turmoil in taking credit for the songs, he never seems willing to do anything about that or confide in anyone (which also seemed ridiculous), and his ultimate defining decision I would argue is driven not by honesty, but by love.
Which brings us to the predictable and rote rom-com that the movie devolves into in the third act. First, the notion that they've been best friends forever and seemingly have both always liked each other but never discussed it or either made any move is absurd. If Ellie had spent half her life waiting for him, why wouldn't she just broach the topic so they get on the same page? Then there's a classic frustrating change of heart, where Ellie said she was done and moving on when Jack chose music, but then he says he loves her and she comes crawling back, which reinforces troubling notions of her as a woman present in the plot to provide satisfaction to the man when he calls on her. The ending was extremely predictable - of course he finally declares his love for her and comes clean, and of course she's ready to jump right in his arms after saying she was moving on and seeing another guy (clearly just a plot device to force Jack to make a move and never seen as a real person). It never felt in doubt that they would end up together living happily ever after, and while it was nice to see their long time close friendship and support blossom into a relationship, their friendship throughout was strangely lacking in clear communication.
A couple other minor plot points that seemed like missed opportunities - when he wakes up remembering his concert where he plays Wonderwall, he remembers her there. I was sure he would ask her if she remembers that, and if so the song, to figure out how those memories were erased or confide everything in her, which would've been great. Instead, he wakes up to remember that he loves her (so literally nothing changes from the night before) and is frantic trying to catch her as though things monumentally shifted. Also, the John Lennon scene felt like a punch in the face with Boyle reminding us how horribly he ruined the premise. Honestly, after that scene it isn't even clear what the premise is. What does John Lennon remember doing with his life? Does he now remember some alternate universe where he just chilled out and was into art but never made music? He clearly doesn't remember the Beatles. His script was also fully heteronormative when it would've been so easy to be inclusive - why would you say something along the lines of ""The point of life is telling a woman that you love her"" rather than a person? Another very minor detail was the city names flashing across which were really fast and large, going in opposite directions, so very difficult to read and poorly done. The humor works okay - there are a couple funny moments, but I think there are just as many jokes that land completely flat or are overdone as to no longer be funny.
I wanted to like this movie more, but as I thought more about it and remembered more glaring weaknesses of it, I searched for redeeming qualities and struggled to find any. The acting is decent, and obviously it's nice to hear good Beatles songs, but everything about the movie and plot was a major letdown. I'm glad people seem more mixed to positive on it, as this is probably the most wasted potential I've ever seen in a movie, and even the simple rom-com elements were subpar."

You know, despite not having any really, flushed-out conflict, antagonist, or, say, an ending for that matter. Yes, this film's weakest point is the fact that it has no conclusion. Despite the fact that it has a concept that is so juicy, that it's BEGGING to have a conclusion. Of any kind. Whatsoever.

"hughjman","9","3","5","8 March 2020"," It got me in the end.
","I felt mostly ""meh"" about this movie until the John Lennon scene. I grew up with the Beatles - I was around 7 when they first appeared on Ed Sullivan - and when Lennon appeared (what a resemblance!) fine and an old man, I started tearing up. That scene was when I warmed up to the movie and I continued until the closing credits with ""Hey, Jude"" playing. I've thought before how tragic it would have been for the world never to have had John, Paul, George, and Ringo, and this film reaffirmed that.
The scene with Ellie demanding Jack choose between her and his music career a) seemed out of character and b) made me not like her for a bit. Lily James, though, was wonderful as always. On subsequent viewing, I loved the movie and really liked the actor in the lead role."

","This is a good family film. Well acted. Can't really complain with the direction I guess. The music of course is good. Even the idea isn't bad. But the writing is kind of terrible which sends the movie to a place I was disappointed with. There just seems to be too many plot-holes to count with this whole ""blackout"" scenario which I expected to be explained but it isn't. And the films conclusion raised so many more questions.<br/><br/>This film centers around an aspiring musician and his manager friend who's really hot and obviously in love with him, but he's too stupid to know it and then one night he's in an accident involving a nationwide blackout and when he wakes up no one knows who the Beatles are so he decides to write their songs himself and gain success.<br/><br/>First of all this film spends most of the movie just talking about how good the Beatles were instead of letting us hear why. I feel like this movie could've been about any bands disappearance. On top of that they threw in this really messy love story that they don't explain well and in the end comes off as a bit toxic.<br/><br/>And the Beatles aren't the only thing that people forgot. There's also Harry Potter, Coca Cola, the band oasis, and all of cigarettes... are you serious? What the hell is this black out? I get the fairy tale story idea but make it a more sound structure. Make me believe it.<br/><br/>I feel this movie would've been better if it didn't try so hard to avoid being obvious. It should've ended with him just waking up in the hospital after hitting his head and realizing that he should just write his own music and proclaim his love to his childhood friend and recognizing he's happy where he is. The end. Lesson learned.<br/><br/>Instead...After feeling guilty about taking credit for their music, the character proclaims his love for his longtime friend at his biggest show and then admits that the Beatles wrote all of the songs, but the Beatles still never existed so no one knows who they are or what he's really talking about. So he kinda just comes off as insane and then releases all the music for free for all the world to hear, saying he doesn't want any money for it(even though earlier he admits to not remembering how a lot of the songs go) and everyone just accepts it.<br/><br/>In the films final scenes, all appear happy. The main character got his girl, and he works at her school now I guess? And they're all singing a song. So in the end, the world never goes back to normal, the only trace of the Beatles that are left are these half realized covers of whatever some guy remembered of them, we live in a Pepsi world, JK Rowling is still living on welfare, and it took all of this for the main character to realize he loves his childhood friend.<br/><br/>(Also there are two very bizarre scenes one where he meets unsuccessful and alive John Lennon where more one note jokes about the Beatles not existing occur. The other scene is with two other people who remember the Beatles as well, one guy is from Russia and the other is a woman from Liverpool. Okay?)"

Its great as you see the lyrics drop into Jack's memory as he struggles to piece them together. As someone who is not a songwriter it was intriguing to see this process played out in such visual ways - taking inspiration from everyday life.<br/><br/>This movie shed important insight into the creative process of artists from grassroots to business management, and shows how sad it is the ways in which companies can completely take over and change the direction/vision of the original artist.<br/><br/>The love interest is another classic of friendzoning and frustrating the audience with back and forward moments where it seems so close.

"CinemaClown","Null","1","1","15 September 2019"," An Interesting Concept Unrealised To Its Full Potential
","An interesting concept unrealised to its full potential, Yesterday never truly grasps the places it could've gone with its premise and settles for a half-baked idea that's not allowed to simmer far enough and is further diluted with a half-baked romance. On top of that, it's missing the kinetic flair that's often evident in Danny Boyle films.<br/><br/>The story concerns a struggling musician who ends up in a freak accident during a mysterious global blackout & wakes up in an alternate timeline where The Beatles never existed. After realising that he's sitting on a goldmine, he starts playing their music, claiming them to be his own, and embarks on a journey to fame & stardom.<br/><br/>Directed by Danny Boyle (28 Days Later & Steve Jobs), Yesterday neither entirely digs into the what-if scenario of a world without the Fab Four nor wholly embraces the romance subplot it has going on the side. Boyle struggles in juggling both plots, thus resulting in a finished product that lands far from what the premise promised.<br/><br/>Despite the availability of so many routes to choose from, the film opts for the least interesting one and keeps returning to the romance part it could have done without anyway. Riding on the strength of the all-time greatest band's music, Himesh Patel delivers a fab showcase as the leading man while Lily James & the rest are alright at best.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Yesterday is severely underdeveloped in plot & characterisation and is nothing more than a hokey rom-com at its core. The Beatles' catalogue does make the ride a bit bright, breezy & bearable but the input from the cast & crew still leaves a lot to be desired. A wasted opportunity of sorts, Danny Boyle's latest is one of his weakest directorial efforts.<br/><br/>While there is absolutely no denying that a world without The Beatles is a world that's infinitely worse, it turns out that a world with this film isn't any better either."

I do hope to see her in many other parts.
I am sure Lily James was paid twice or 10 times what Himesh Patel was paid, and she is perfect in the part, Himesh, a British Indian who appears to have only been in a very popular soap, can sing, act and is self-depreciating. He has great skill with the blank puzzled stare. But the part does not demand much more. He's better when being a schoolteacher.
Ed Sheenan is very good as himself, who knew he could act. LOL.
There is not enough music, Beatles or other, for this to be called a musical, and lots of people who go to see it hoping to hear a lot of Beatles songs will be very disappointed.

","What if the Beatles never existed? The film could have explored such a world, showing how great their impact has been. But that would entail alternative history writing and creativity, Back to the Future style. But the film offers none of that. Ok, but at least the film gives the opportunity to explore the question: What if The Beatles' music was released in today's world?<br/><br/>But alas, Jack's reintroduction of Beatles tunes to a modern public goes way to smooth to be interesting. The music is great, but its success is probably inseparable from the sociopolitical context of the '60s and the mythology surrounding the band. It would simply not have made the same impact in today's popculturally oversaturated world. By the film lazily presupposes the same success, because that's what the rags-to-riches plot needs.<br/><br/>So The Beatles is just used as a plot device to give a mediocre protagonist what's essentially super powers. Finally, he have to choose whether to reveal the truth about himself. It's a story we've seen countless times, and the film brings nothing new to the table. I think The Beatles' music is too important to be reduced to a mere plot device.<br/><br/>The only redeeming thing about the film is the Lennon scene. It's very powerful in several ways. But hey, why wouldn't searching for the Fab Four be the first thing you'd do in this alternative timeline? (Like Marty searched for Doc when sent back in time.) Why isn't the film all about Jack trying to ""get the band together""?<br/><br/>That would be a completely different story, but much more entertaining (think School of Rock) and perhaps a bit emotional and thought-provoking as well. The message could be something like ""it's never to late to fulfill your potential"". And after Jack had orchestrated the Beatles late success, the ""spell"" would be broken and he would be transported back to his own timeline again (think Groundhog Day).

"Cineanalyst","4","3","6","2 November 2019"," Plagiarism Spoils Novelty
","""Yesterday"" was a promising movie that fails for the same reason its protagonist, Jack Malik, fails as a rock star. Both begin with a relatively original idea, but are increasingly weighed down by pangs over plagiarism. Jack finds himself one day to be the only person who remembers The Beatles and, already being a musician, sets out to pass their songs off as his own. This is an interesting concept that raises many questions more important than character psychology and interaction--almost all of which it doesn't bother to even investigate beyond the fact that Google clearly continues to exist to pay for product placement, as Jack repeatedly employs the search engine to figure out what has changed in the world. Instead, the movie cribs every other rom-com, to suffocate us in cloying infatuation, including retching up yet another climactic grand public display of love. Yeah, I get it, ""All You Need Is Love."" No thanks, copycats.<br/><br/>There may be something to the connection between popular music and rom-coms, though. Both seem to rely heavily and sometimes exclusively upon simple emotionalism. There's nothing here about the art or craft of either. Jack merely is already a practiced artisan of music and is seen only needing to remember the words and their order to compose the famous songs. Meanwhile, the movie attempts to play all the tired rom-com notes below detection--hoping we'll be too consumed in feelings to care. Listening to The Beatles for a couple hours is pleasant enough, but if there's no art to the movie's record playing, I could do as well without its existence.<br/><br/>In lieu of that, there are character dynamics. I couldn't care less about the love story. I mean, a hero who appears asexual for the first part of the picture and a woman who claims to have waited for a decade or more for a guy to ask her out, with their main conflict being between romance and rock-and-roll fame despite the fact that she was his manager--talk about contrived. Only once does the music even reflect this narrative in any compelling way, when Jack screams, ""Help!"" Additionally, the music industry is largely reduced to an SNL skit for Kate McKinnon, and the reported brilliance of The Beatles is seemingly rendered unimportant, as they appear to have had little to no effect on pop music, let alone the world. The oddest part is the inclusion here of a celebrity, Ed Sheeran. I'd never heard of him, but he occupies the same space that LeBron James did in another insipid entry in this genre, ""Trainwreck"" (2015). That is, neither one needed either of them. Moreover, they would've been better without them. Providing an audience the opportunity to think, ""oh, yeah, that guy,"" is not a valid reason for inclusion. In this one, Sheeran references ""Amadeus"" (1984), but ""Yesterday"" is chopsticks by comparison.<br/><br/>Even worse, I didn't check before viewing this to notice that it's written by, perhaps, the biggest hack of a screenwriter today in Richard Curtis. ""Love Actually"" (2003) is a putrid reference point, repetitively so, for every worthless trope in the rom-com book of clichÃ©s, and ""About Time"" (2013) was another promising variation (it has time travel) on the same genre that failed miserably. Evidently, Curtis has reached the point where he's merely altering the hook (mass amnesia or alternate timelines, time travel, or what have you) in rewriting the same formula. I'm not a fan of Danny Boyle, either, but ""Yesterday"" may be a bit better than those two because at least Curtis doesn't direct it. Ultimately, it's as though we're left remembering that initial, promising novelty here, which seems to have been forgotten by the rest of the movie in its determination to appropriate the same junk Curtis and his ilk have done over and over again. The spectator can imagine a better movie, one where the loss of The Beatles matters and reverberates. Perhaps, even the dearth of the band's juvenile and unrealistic nonsense depiction of love would affect cinema; then, maybe Nora Ephron would never have wrote a fluffy imitation of Woody Allen comedies, which would further lead to Curtis not turning that fluff into insipidness. Imagine."

But this move never quite realizes its potential, partly because the romantic plot starts feeling cliche, partly because the Beatles were more than just song writing, partly because this story lost its way 2/3 of the way through. I still enjoyed it more than I expected. It is just that there's a difference between being well done and being original."

","""We were driving through Colorado, we had the radio on, and eight of the Top 10 songs were Beatles songs...'I Wanna Hold Your Hand,' all those early ones. They were doing things nobody was doing. Their chords were outrageous, just outrageous, and their harmonies made it all valid... I knew they were pointing the direction of where music had to go.""-Bob Dylan<br/><br/>If the works of Shakespeare were suddenly erased from the world's memory, culture would suffer an unthinkable loss. In Danny Boyle's witty and entertaining Yesterday, the works of the Beatles have been lost in a freak 12 sec global electrical outage. Except for Jack (Hamish Patel), who remembers the music and proceeds to reintroduce it as his own.<br/><br/>Boyle and writer Richard Curtis, who seem to know a thing or two about music and struggle, have a winner of a conceit in the world discovering arguably the greatest composers of pop music in history. Patel interprets the songs beautifully and simply with a stripped-down guitar that enhances the lyrics and melodies.<br/><br/>We have been graced this year with two outstanding musical biopics, Bohemian Rhapsody and Rocketman (although the latter is surely more fantasy than bio), and Yesterday is a fitting companion piece to those stellar movies. The Beatles come alive through the songs, interpreted with low-key power by Patel.<br/><br/>Yesterday disappointed with its reliance on the old trope of boyhood friend Ellie (Lily James), then manager, having unrequited love for Jack. You know how that will end, taking considerable surprise away from an otherwise intriguing premise.<br/><br/>Then the matter of the ethics of plagiarizing; not until the end is Jack faced with the moral dilemma when so much effective drama could have been experienced much before then. Anyhow, hearing the simplified Beatles should bring tears to your eyes (It did to mine) with a deep appreciation of transcendent pop music.<br/><br/>Yesterday is about today and forever."

","Sorry, but as a huge Beatles fan, this just didn't do it for me. I was a fan of Lily James, but not of Himesh Patel. He's not a bad actor, just, in my opinion, not the right one for this part. And no, this has nothing to do with him being part Indian. In fact, there is one Indian actor that would have been, in my opinion, great in it and that is Ayushmann Khurrana, who was terrific in ""Andhadhun"".<br/><br/>The love story between Patel and James seems forced as there was, again in my opinion, not much chemistry between these two. Also, there were many times when it seems a scene was supposed to be funny and it just fell flat. Too bad to as the character ""Rocky"" was very good. Too bad the scenes were not funny enough. But this isn't really a Rom-Com, it's more of a Rom-Drama. So don't think you will be laughing most of the time, because you will not be.<br/><br/>As you know, this is an alternate reality movie.

"isaacj02","5","5","13","6 July 2019"," More misses than hits in Boyle and Curtis' sluggish ode to The Beatles
","There's no movie premise more fun than the 'what if' question; void of the wonderings of why and the logistics of a situation we are simply allowed to accept it and enjoy the fantasy that follows. Here, Danny Boyle and Richard Curtis approach a weighty 'what if' question to terrify all music aficionados... what if the Beatles never existed? Or, more suitably, what if only one man (luck would have it a down-on-his-luck singer-songwriter) remembered their classic tunes? In Yesterday, that man is Jack Malik (Himesh Patel in his big-screen debut), who is conveniently hit by a bus simultaneously as a split-second power outage hits the globe. Jack awakens in this all but identical parallel dimension; except no one has heard of John, Paul, George or Ringo. It's not long before our protagonist starts to realise that this isn't a curse but rather a blessing as he starts to gain huge success by painstakingly recreating the band's songs and claiming them as his own to the unknowing world.
The concept of Yesterday is an intriguing one, if a little familiar. What would perhaps be most exciting about the film however is that it sees two tour de forces of British cinema, Boyle and Curtis, working together for the first time. In Yesterday, it feels as if Boyle's contribution seems slightly smothered in the tone and style of the latter; this feels very much like a Richard Curtis affair and unfortunately not an entirely brilliant one. In the first third of the film, the pace breezes nicely along; we are introduced to Jack and his hum-drum life, including his curious relationship with manager Ellie (the endlessly charismatic Lily James). There's some classic Curtis writing here; joshing banter, wry humour and a good level of heart. A notably great scene comes from comedy powerhouses Sanjeev Bhaskar and Meera Sayal as Jack's parents, one of many early moments that makes what is to follow look promising.
It is a huge shame, therefore, that Yesterday slides off the rails, leaving behind its interesting premise to settle as a forgettable and frankly quite dull romcom that feels like lesser work from both Boyle and Curtis. There's one particular sequence where the film makes a horrifically misjudged turn and, from then on, meanders and warbles to a barely conclusive and unsatisfying ending. Himesh Patel leads the cast as Jack and one can't fault his utter commitment to what I'm sure will be a career-boosting role. However, despite this, Jack is a fundamentally unlikeable character; throughout the film he lumbers and sulks his way from screen-to-screen to the point that one wonders why we care about him in the first place. The same is true of the rest of the cast; Kate McKinnon does her best as a one-dimensional corporate music manager whose comedic novelty swiftly wears off and even James, who charmed the roof off in last year's Mamma Mia sequel, is given very little to work with. I hate to say that the real problem here seems to lie in Curtis' writing; whilst there are a few funny moments and characters (Joel Fry is superb as the hapless Rocky echoing Rhys Ifans in a better Curtis outing Notting Hill), largely there's very little to Yesterday that gives in any sort of kick. The 'what if' scenario that actually could be interesting seems always to be playing second place to Patel and James' bland love story, a 120-min will-they-won't-they... despite the fact we know they will. After the first third, there are occasional beads of hilarity and heart but these are largely lost within a sea of banal aimlessness that feels like borderline laziness on behalf of its creators who we know can do so much more. Equally, there are other aspects of Yesterday that don't play in its favour; the jukebox soundtrack is limited and underplayed, the editing choices are bizarre and the graphic effects tragically tacky.
That is not to say that Yesterday doesn't have its moments; Patel's rendition of the titular hit early on is an empathetically portrayed sequence and a scene featuring a leading Beatle is beautifully poignant. Plus there are some brilliant supporting performances from the likes of Bhaskar, Sayal and Fry. In fact, it is these faint glimmers of what Yesterday could have been that make the end result even more disappointing. In the end, the clever premise is left behind in favour of a cliched, muddled and overlong summer romcom that won't go down in history like the Beatles any time soon."

","Listen, I'm a huge Beatles fan and have been since I was a boy, so I really wanted to love this film. That said, I have found Richard Curtis's film screenplays in the past to be too sentimental and slight and I'm afraid this homage to the music of the Beatles found me in familiar territory again, even if it was directed by Danny Boyle.<br/><br/>The basic idea of struggling musician Himesh Patel wakening up after an accident to find he's (almost) the only person who knows the songs of the Fab Four makes for an interesting concept and Curtis gets some good little jokes in referencing some of the group's famous song titles. However when he brings in Ed Sheeran, about whose music I know practically nothing, for one of the biggest cameo roles you'll probably ever see a real life celebrity make in pictures, then gets Patel involved with a cliched portrayal of a high-powered American female manager and worst of all, tries to weave a love story between Patel and long-time roadie / agent Lily James, it starts to flounder and go nowhere, pretty slowly.<br/><br/>I also didn't get the reason for the other random examples of world history and culture (Coca Cola, Harry Potter) dropping out of the timeline although I did like that in this alternative universe, John Lennon got to live well into his old age, but why not George Harrison too, who only got to 59 himself. I was expecting more humour too, remembering that Curtis co-wrote two of the funniest ever British TV comedies, ""Black Adder"" and ""The Vicar Of Dibley"", although I appreciate those were many years ago.<br/><br/>Of course I enjoyed hearing the many Beatles songs which naturally proliferate the soundtrack even if I thought the material chosen was a bit Paul-heavy.<br/><br/>Overall though, I found it a bit overlong, lacking in punch and without a really strong narrative, all descriptions that rarely applied to the songs of the Beatles the film was trying to commemorate."

The exception to this is Jack Malik (Himesh Patel) who is a struggling musician who appeals to few people beyond his manager/groupie friend Ellie Appleton (Lily James). All of a sudden he is the only person who knows the back catalog of The Beatles. The film examines how he deals with this, but is mostly a rom/com.<br/><br/>The film is pleasant enough, but it's too stupid to really enjoy.

This movie makes you feel a lot of things and it's just a wonderful film that's a tribute to the influence that this music has had on everyone.<br/><br/>So, imagine the world went dark for 12 seconds and one the most influential musicians who ever lived never happened. No Beatlemania, no crazed fans, no legacy. Instead we have a down on his luck musician on the verge of giving up on his hopes of having sort of success. After a disastrous gig, Jack is riding his back as a freak black out crosses the entire globe. Within 12 seconds he's hit by a bus and wakes up to the care of his life long friend/ manager named Ellie. A few references to the famed group go right over her head. When Jack plays Yesterday, he still won't believe that no one in his friend group and later google knows who the Beatles are.
Somehow he manages to remember a good majority of lyrics from the acclaimed songs which I don't even think I could do. The songs grab the attention of a small firm recording studio then a local talk show, and then Ed Sheeran. To which Ed Sheeran drops by his house and offers him a gig to open for him which he accepts. After a song writing challenge, Jack impressed with The Long and Winding Road. He catches the eye of a very aggressive and condescending manager. Who was equally hilarious and passive aggressive. Success soon starts rolling in at a pace Jack can't catch up with. He soon finds at the cost of infamy means losing Ellie who feels too ordinary to follow the path he's going down. After a tearful goodbye, Jack goes forward with his career that is more about the product he can be rather than the music itself. During his album launch, Jack meets 2 people who also remember The Beatles and thank him for bringing the music back. Also giving him the address of someone who give him the answer to where he needs to go.
In a world where The Beatles never happened means that John Lennon was never murdered. Instead he's happily living by the sea at 78 in a tranquil existence. Jack realizes he needs to tell the truth and does so at a concert. Sabotaging his own album release by giving the music away to the entire crowd as he doesn't want to be made infamous by work that was never his. In the end, there is no magic fix it, the world doesn't reset itself. Instead Jack and Ellie, finally get together and settle for normal. Life goes on in a beautifully simple way."

"PushMaryInTheStream","5","2","4","1 December 2019"," Nothing you haven't seen before. Here's why...
","It's a Richard Curtis script, so cue:<br/><br/><ul><li>Awkward pauses between lovers.</li><li>Sudden interruptions at moments of romantic tension.</li><li>Gauche friends who don't fit in to society but have hearts of gold.</li><li>Inexplicably asexual/ non-libidinous people who suddenly discover their romantic/sexual sides.</li><li>A dash through traffic to stop a lover departing.</li><li>The lead actress confessing she's been waiting to be loved.</li><li>Emotion poured on in gargantuan dollops.</li></ul><br/><br/>The film's premise (someone passing off others' work as their own) has been done many times, so that's not new. The film also rests wholly on the questionable (and shaky) assumption that the Beatles's songs alone would guarantee world fame for a solo performer with limited on-stage presence in 2019, rather than four cheeky chappies who exemplified the emerging teen freedoms of the 1960s and then defined the musical zeitgeist of the generation with a synergistic group personality that coalesced into a thing called 'The Beatles'. As such, it separates content from performer, music from star image/personality, when in fact the two are inextricably entwined. To suggest otherwise is to say that in public consciousness Mozart's music lives a life wholly separate from the legend (and myth) that is the tragedy of Mozart, or that E=MC2 exists totally apart from the legend (and myth) that is the 'genius' of Einstein. This is a major plot flaw.<br/><br/>Curtis' scripts are increasingly predictable so you can easily fast forward in chunks and not miss the story-line. You know there will be a moral dilemma which love will finally resolve.<br/><br/>Strong acting from Himesh Patel and Lily James - by-the-numbers acting from everyone else playing two-dimensional characters whose job is to push the plot along.<br/><br/>An OK movie if you've nothing else to do for a couple of hours. Settle down with some popcorn, but don't expect to carry memories of the movie for years or quote parts of it by the water cooler.<br/><br/>Great possibilities which ended up in a vaguely disappointing result."

Himesh Patel, himself, is quite engaging but he has nowhere near enough to work with to stretch this out for two whole hours!! Lily James tries her best to assist but there's no getting away from a very weak screenplay. The soundtrack is superb but most of that was written elsewhere 50-odd years ago.There is a sort-of swipe at the modern day music business and at the industries that support ""solo"" artists, but any potential for a more satiric review of the business is lost in the banality of it.

So much I love, so I was looking forward to seeing this. Unfortunately, there were just so many annoying characters. Ed Sheeran's scenes always had an element of awkwardness about them, while it also didn't help Himish Patel lacked the charisma needed to pull off the lead. The fact he was playing a fraud for 3/4 of the film didn't do him any favours.<br/><br/>While proudly wearing an element of the 'fantasy' tag, there were still too many scenes that weren't convincing or believable - that should have been. Can't say I was a fan of the modern music scene and industry being mixed with the Beatles in this way.<br/><br/>It was sweet, but also a bit twee at times. The whole premise probably says more about the current state of the movie industry plagued with reboots and remakes than it does anything else.

","I agree with some other reviewers that the film makers took a brilliant and highly original premise and didn't sufficiently run with it. For example, they could have eliminated the romantic sub-plot entirely (cute as it was, it was formulaic and has already been done to death in film). It would have been more intriguing if, instead, they could have used that time to have Jack go on his own personal quest to find Lennon and McCartney. That could have been his reason for going to Liverpool, and it would have made his eventual meeting with Lennon that much more powerful. As it actually played out, it seemed more like an incidental ""throwaway"" scene.<br/><br/>I had high hopes at the very beginning, but as the film wore on and it was clear that it was going in the classic romcom direction, I became increasingly more disappointed. What a shame.<br/><br/>**UPDATE** I just read this from the Trivia section:<br/><br/>The original story for the movie was written by Jack Barth. It was much darker in tone, with the main character struggling as a musician in the new timeline and the premise of the alternate universe explored in more depth. When Richard Curtis did a rewrite, he made the tone much more lighthearted, put less emphasis on the premise of a new timeline without The Beatles, and more focus on romance between Jack and Ellie.<br/><br/>My only question is....WHY??

Some lighthearted humor and pretty formulaic love story is there also along the way. The movie is somewhat ruined by casting of one pretty lame SNL actress, who just cannot act and is so over the top disgust ing that she unwittingly parodies the intended music industry parody and undermines the otherwise pretty decent movie.

","I honestly expected more, the trailer looked much more promising (like many other movies, most of them actually).<br/><br/>My big first problem with Yesterday was Lily James, I think she is a really annoying person and therefore, a huge miscast. My second problem and shocking surprise was the horrid Kate McKinnon... since she's always a terrible choice for a role, even in all the stupid comedies she makes, I was dissapointed that she was cast in a more serious movie and more in knowledge of who the director is, Â¿what happened there Mr. Boyle?<br/><br/>But the main problem with this movie was the love element, it was so unoriginal, unrealistic and predictable, it totally ruined the film's soul.<br/><br/>Also, there's never a moral or a motivational message for the musicians, the dreamers or the viewers in general.<br/><br/>In the end, it seems like the plot was written on a napkin in a bar and then handled to a gen z team who developed the script, the production design, then raffled the director chair and a 'dude' won and directed it.<br/><br/>Btw, wth was the scene of 'John Lennon' for??"

","First of all, it's quite possible to watch and I daresay, enjoy, this movie without being a Beatles fan, though if, like the majority of its characters, you haven't heard of them, or more likely, not heard much of them. it'll lose a lot. As a massive fan since the Sixties, I loved the idea behind the film and so it was with some expectancy that I went to see it.
It's an entertaining, gentle, feel-good film. It won't set the World alight but it will make many smile. The characters are well written and acted. Himesh Patel as main character, Jack Malik, is particularly good, portraying his bewilderment at a world in which only he can even remember The Beatles, with ability and humour. He can also sing! His performances of Beatles songs is really impressive, the renditions being good but not 'too' good and not slavish copies of the originals, particularly when performing ""Help!"".
There are some interesting curve balls along the way and one or two real surprises. I felt the film deserved a stronger ending but it was very enjoyable and I look forward to the DVD/Blu-Ray release, which I believe includes an alternative ending."

","Himesh Patel (whom we know in the UK from EastEnders) acts and sings his way persuasively through the slightly klutzy central role. Ed Sheeran almost steals the show, playing himself (a natural klutz!) in a charming send-up. Danny Boyle has directed this at a snappy pace, but the most visible contribution is clearly Richard Curtis's script, with his trademark mismatched love-story. Other erasures from human memory caused by the power-cut are fed to us at clumsy intervals - did CocaCola pay for product DIS-placement, I wondered? And the central mystery - what has actually happened to the Beatles? - is neatly addressed. I particularly liked the late appearance of two other people who know that Jack is a musical thief.<br/><br/>The other most visible contribution is the Beatles' back-list - we are constantly reminded just how powerfully their songs are engrained in our consciousness. There may well be Sing-Along screenings of this next year."

","This is my first review as an Avid movie goer who sees at least 1-2 movies a week.
Well, yesterday we three baby boomers went to see Yesterday and after reading reviews here on IMDB we hoped to enjoy it. As the music of the Beatles was the soundtrack of our youth, we were so interested to see how the movie would handle the theme. We couldn't imagine a world without their music.
With the writer and director we thought it would be in good hands.
To say we enjoyed the movie and the way it dealt with the story is an understatement. The guilt that the character Jack felt about passing off the Beatles songs as his own, the resolution of this issue and the touching moments when Jack made things right were just so well done. We all laughed out loud and shed some tears as well. Excellent supporting actors as well. British films are often so adorably quirky, funny and how could you not love the songs? We saw lots of young and teenagers really enjoying this Fab film. Best movie I have seen this year."

","I really enjoyed ""yesterday"". It is a highly recommended movie for all fans of ""The Beatles"" and viewers in general. The concept idea for this kind of movie is brilliant and original that I was hyped from the first trailer. Even thinking about it is crazy, a world without ""the Beatles"" is not realistic and quite scary. That's why I sympathize with the main character jack malick. I feel his character was well written and the transformation he goes through is well portrayed by Himesh Patel. Lily James is gorgeous and Ed Sheeran has a good role as himself. My only two problems with the movie are minor: for once I would have wanted to know what happened to the Beatles if they didn't became famous, not only John Lennon but Paul, George and Ringo as well. The second thing is that it was great hearing all those songs again. But why do all the songs need to be portrayed by one person? Maybe it was done on purpose to show Jack as the only person who knows the songs. But I would have wanted to listen to the original versions as well. Anyway I really loved it and I suggest all fans to watch ""yesterday""."

"rddj05","3","0","0","8 June 2020"," Disappointing
","I have deep admiration for Danny Boyle and usually enjoy his films, but I was very surprised that he took on this project, due to a story and script that weren't particularly strong. It's not a poorly made film, but it seems to really struggle against the script. The idea is great. The story which extends from that idea is severely lacking. Aside from the fact that it treads well-worn rom-com territory and perpetuates every schmaltzy rom-com false cliche (including the one where someone suddenly realizes that their platonic friend for 20 years may just be ""the one"" after all, if they can only wake up and realize it), the script doesn't make much sense. There's no real spoilers in this movie to give away, but I'll be vague just be safe. The premise: There's a 27-year old failing British musician who's reached a point where he realizes his music career likely isn't going to go anywhere, so he'll return to teaching. Then, one night, there's a worldwide blackout, which lasts a few seconds, and when it's over, he's the only one who remembers who The Beatles were (and all their songs). There's no record of them online and no one remembers them (oddly, the same goes for Coca-Cola, cigarettes, and the band Oasis). There's some mildly amusing over-the-top characters who come into story after this, almost all of them are characters who say and do things that no real person on the planet would actually ever say or do, and a lot of bad advice given from the female romantic interest (seemingly presented in the film as good advice) where I can only assume most audience members would be yelling, ""Please don't listen to her. She's making no sense."" The most troubling thing about the ending is that the premise is never explained. Even with all the rom-com cliches, it may have been fun to realize precisely *why* no one was able to remember these few major aspects of pop-culture history. Nope. And yet, despite the lack of a logical--or even wacky--explanation of the premise, it includes a scene near the end, at a beach house, that only served to confuse me more; it raises more questions than it answered because the scene doesn't really make any sense. The best thing about the film is the premise (which could've gone in so many more interesting places), the music (obviously), and the fact that even when Danny Boyle is working with a somewhat weak script, he still knows how to make a fairly entertaining movie. It's just unfortunate that it doesn't have a good enough story for most people to want to watch for 90 minutes, even when it's filled with The Beatles music."

Tears welled up in our eyes as we sang hey jude together at the end of the film.Full of Beatles music filled the film, many tribute bridges, fun settings are remarkable. However, the development of the plot always gives people a feeling of lack of anything, lack of logical coherence, lack of explosive points in music interweaving, and the end is too relaxed. What is particularly true about the plot is that the male just started the nameless stage in the bar and even if he sang Beatles music, no one cares, true and impressive. However, the Beatles'music is quite powerful on the big screen, or it is recommended to take a look."

","Yesterday tells the story of Jack, a struggling musician who wakes from an accident in a world without The Beatles (and a few other notable absences). The story is very straightforward - with this exclusive knowledge Jack rises to fame, pulling number one hit after number one hit out of nowhere. I thought what the film did interestingly was changing how certain elements of The Beatles catalogue and image were perceived in this alternate world. It made me think about why and how certain ideas, songs, images, outfits etc become popular, which was relatively fun.<br/><br/>Aside from this the film was fairly derivative - fame isn't all that its cracked up to be, there's more to life than money, love is the real prize etc etc. You could spot the ending from a mile off, although it still retained its charm. One of my major criticisms of this movie however is that I wanted more Beatles songs! There weren't as many as I was expecting, although I suppose it was a shortish movie so they wanted to give more emphasis on story than singing a song from start to finish.<br/><br/>I wasn't overly enamoured with Himesh Patel's performance. Jack just seemed constantly uneasy and insecure. Whether I should pin this criticism on Himesh or Boyle I don't know, either way the character didn't hit the spot for me. Lily James was as expected - quirky, charming, and excellent. I really do love her as an actress and am yet to see her put a foot wrong. The inclusion of Ed Sheeran was... odd although not unappealing. I thought it would drag me out of the film a bit, but he did a solid acting job and it was actually integrated into the story pretty well, it wasn't a gratuitous cameo as I feared it would be.<br/><br/>Yesterday is a fun way to spend two hours. Its not too serious, straightforward, and has a funny and interesting concept which it executes perfectly well. I'm glad I watched it, but once is enough for me."

A movie that is set for release on June 28th and seems to be flying under the radar. Himesh Patel is the lead actor and it is good to see a fellow person of color in a film that would typically lack melanin. This film was directed by Danny Boyle who became famous for his films, Slumdog Millionaire, 127 hours, Trainspotting and 28 Hours Later. This movie seems to have good bones to it. Let's get to the nitty gritty.<br/><br/>Let's begin by talking about of the positives. Himesh plays Jack Malik, an aspiring singer/songwriter looking for his big break, but quickly nearing the end of his rope. Himesh plays an extremely relatable character. You feel every bit of emotion he pours into the film. He takes us on a bike ride and we feel every single lump along the way. On top of that, I was pleasantly surprised by his great singing ability (unless that's actually not him and then they did and excellent job covering that up).<br/><br/>Along with Himesh, the cast had a very good rapport with each other, especially Lily James as Ellie. The sexual tension is palpable between them and it truly enhanced the movie. In fact, the true essence of this movie is not about the Beatles music. Without giving too much of the movie away, the true essence of this movie is what will a person choose when the have two competing desires in their heart. Also, how much is your soul worth, even if in reality it actually costs you nothing. Enough of that deep talk, the movie has good comedic moments, a bunch anchored by Kate McKinnon.<br/><br/>With all that said, facially this movie is just an extra long Beatles and Ed Sheeran concert. Depending on who you are, that could be your worst nightmare or it will get very old very quickly (way too much Ed Sheeran). I did find that the storyline took way too long to progress and was WAY too obvious. Just a typical, unrequited love storyline in a different gift box. This movie also leaves the viewer completely confused by the reality of the movie. The producers have fun with the reality they created, but I believe viewers would have appreciated a resolution for that part of the storyline as well.<br/><br/>Long story short, those of you who loved the British Invasion should see this movie in theaters in some fashion because you receive a 2 for 1 (a concert and romantic comedy). Those of you looking for a last minute date night movie, should also consider watching this movie, especially if your date can appreciate good music. Otherwise, casual moviegoers should avoid this movie in the theaters, BUT will find a nice treat when it hits Netflix, Hulu, or Redbox."

There are a few swear words in this film, as well as a few strange scenes, but those are not something to worry about. Yesterday is family friendly and a good film. 8/10."

","Written by Richard Curtis and Jack Barth and directed by Danny Boyle, YESTERDAY, could be called a sleeper by some...I call it mystical and a genuine hit. Jack Malik (Himesh Patel), is a struggling musician right on the edge of giving up. Right at the moment of a global blackout he gets hit by bus. When Jack wakes up he begins writing songs like no one has ever heard. That's because he discovers he's the lone person on Earth who knows of The Beatles and their legendary catalog of music. Astounding the world he steps into stardom singing The Beatles songs from an alternate timeline.<br/><br/>It is brilliant how Patel so easily is able to sing and play some of the greatest songs from The Beatles songbook. The adorable Lily James plays Patel's love interest. And singer Ed Sheeran is cast offering musical advise. Kate McKinnon is briefly Jack Malik's money hungry business manager. Beforehand, I had no idea I would enjoy this movie so much. And oh yes, there is a surprise character that will provide the most important twist in the story line.<br/><br/>""Oh yeah, I, wanna tell you somethin'"""

","Yesterday has a very interesting premise to start with. It's a very fresh idea and I haven't seen anything like this before. Yesterday is a musical fantasy but it's more a romantic comedy. The writers and Danny Boyle gave importance to rom-com than exploring the main idea of the movie. It could have been a lot more good or lot more worse if they explored it more. But still, you'll get a cute rom-com with very good performances and very good songs. I personally liked this movie and I recommend this to everyone who likes rom-com's."

","Imagine a world without Coca-Cola, cigarettes, Harry Potter or The Beatles. Imagine a world in which the song 'Imagine' by John Lennon doesn't exist. I thought this was a pretty clever concept for a movie treatment and it works up to a point. It's just that the film had a less than totally polished look and feel to it. I couldn't warm up to the principal character Jack Malik (Himesh Patel) being the repository of the entire Beatles catalog following the twelve second blackout the world experienced. His second agent, Debra Hammer (Kate McKinnon) voiced that concern best when she stated ""Is this the best you can look?"" However when 'John Lennon' shows up in the picture, you really have to do a double take and remind yourself that he in fact is gone from this mortal coil. It was uncanny how actor Robert Carlyle resembled Lennon, living in a world in which the Beatles never came together. The romance angle between Jack and Ellie Appleton (Lily James) was sweet enough, but again, for some reason I couldn't reconcile the idea of the two of them together. Best part of the picture of course is the music, with quite reasonable renditions of many Beatles songs by actor Patel. There was one disconnect however when Jack Malik made his heartfelt confession to the crowd at Wembley Stadium. Even if he credited John, Paul, George and Ringo as the writers of all those hits, anyone hearing that confession and compelled enough to do an internet search like Jack did would have come up empty. Which still made Jack the originator of all those tunes in the newly established world order."

","Just by reading the plot you immediately raise an eyebrow in sign of interest. However unsure of how ultimately the effort will result, I went in with a small percentage of engagement and felt that the story was rightfully executed and with a proper hint of sensitivity. A struggling musician suffers an accident and after that he realizes that no one but him has ever heard of The Beatles, which at first he thought was some sort of an elaborate prank but when he actually did some research online discovered the awful reality. Not only are The Beatles missing but some other big names like Coca-Cola. So as he was living in humiliating conditions as a musician he decides to start playing Beatles songs and make them pass as his own, which takes him to stardom.<br/><br/>At some point one inevitably tries to figure out where the story is going to go, but I was unsure how everything was going to play out in the case of this film, which made it much more intriguing and engaging. Himesh Patel fantastically executes Beatles' tunes and give them his own spin which is always refreshing and much more fitting for the film.<br/><br/>A truly exciting and original film that flew under the radar.

","I enjoyed the film Yesterday. It was very pleasant and entertaining. However, I do feel like the ending missed a huge opportunity to take the film to a higher level.<br/><br/>Jack Malik, along with a few others, were the only people on earth to retain their memory of special pop cultural events after a mysterious global blackout. Jack has musical talents that he uses to reintroduce The Beatles music to a world who has now never heard any of it before. He initially takes credit and praise for all the music, but in the end, his conscience gets the best of him and he goes on stage to tell the truth about the origin of the music, denounces the value he has brought to everyone, and runs of to live happily ever after with Ellie... Boring!<br/><br/>Jack and the other special people who retained their memories of once was would all have had different talents that they could use to bring value back into a world that lost some of the greatest pop culture in all time. Why don't we get to see Jack share more music (maybe even some Ed Sheeran originals that Ed didn't even know of), or the lady retelling Harry Potter along with other classics, or the man bringing back Coca Cola at his restaurant, some college basketball player doing the iconic Michael Jordan dunk, etc.<br/><br/>The key element to a great story is TRANSFORMATION.
What is the world like now that everything has changed, now that there are special people in it who can do amazing things?
Yesterday says that it would just go back to normal, missing some great things all except for some plagiarized Beatles hits that were put back on the shelves. A story where you end up right back where you started is not very fulfilling."

","Jack Malik (Himesh Patel) is a struggling singer-songwriter in Suffolk, England. He is a ""complete failure"". His only fans seems to be his friends especially his lifelong best friend Ellie Appleton (Lily James). She has an unrequited love for him. One night, the lights go out and he gets hit by a bus. He wakes up to discover that The Beatles never existed. There are other surprising changes like the lost of Coke and Wonderwall. Jack tries to remake the Beatles songs with mixed results until he is contacted by Ed Sheeran who wants him as his opening act. Debra Hammer (Kate McKinnon) is Ed's money-grubbing Hollywood producer.<br/><br/>I love this premise which has the positive effect of including some great music. The general plot is fine although I would change some of the details. The filmmaker already made a few changes. In a delete scene, he actually sleeps with the Russian woman. In the movie, I treated his admission to Ellie as a joke. It's a good change. Their romance has to be kept pure which is why her dating Gavin is a little problematic. It's a false note that the movie is forced to correct with that big gesture. It's a terrible gesture. Putting an unsuspecting woman on a jumble screen is putting all the pressure on her and it's a bad way to break up a relationship. Jack and Ellie are fine but I would redo almost their entire love story. First off, Lily James is too beautiful. When a woman like her say things like that to any man, that man needs to stop and address it right away. He should close the door, block it with a chair, and have a sit down talk with her. It's actually a great moment to reveal The Beatles to her. The secret was definitely eating away at him and he has only one person to whom he would tell. For drama's sake, it's possible that she would get angry at him stealing music from some unknown band and she would walk out on him. That would make the final giveaway of the music that much more powerful as a gesture and it would make their reunion much more compelling.<br/><br/>As for the moments I love, I love Ellie's talk with him after the hotel cancellation. I love, love, love John Lennon. I love him so much that I want the movie to close with Jack bringing Ellie to meet him. Patel's sad sack performance is initially frustrating but he does grow on me as long as he doesn't lose his teeth. Ed Sheeran is pretty good at being Ed Sheeran. In general, the plot is fine but it could be so much better. I love the two Beatles fans and I really love their twist. In those two characters, there is the theme of the movie that Jack needs to hit much harder. They want to bring the music to the world and that is Jack's salvation. Those two could help him finish Eleanor Rigby. The film could have hit that point even harder than it already does. This movie has a cool premise. It's good. It could even be better."

This was a surprising treat I did not expect.<br/><br/>This movie is a treat you could sit back and get fully engrossed in. Perhaps you need to be a Beatles fan, or just any person. But I really liked it for a British flick.<br/><br/>The movie is about a musician who gets hit by a bus, and suddenly the world has no knowledge of the Beatles. The musician uses this to game fame and fortune by using the Beatles songs as his own. He falls in love with his first manager along the way. And right when he is at the height of his short lived career, he tells the world the truth, going back to his normal life.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't sound all that appealing, but it was really fun.

","A likeable if rarely surprising tale whereby Jack Malik (Himesh Patel) finds himself in a world where the Beatles never existed. Deciding to sing their songs, he becomes the biggest global artist in the world, while his unrequited love looks on.<br/><br/>It hangs on tenuous logic, of course. The Beatles didn't exist in a vacuum, and so their absence from the world would have had presumably more impact than just Oasis being amusingly but somewhat cruelly slated. Certainly the Rolling Stones that still exist in this world would have needed a new second single and different backing vocalists for We Love You. Other things have disappeared from the world, too, such as Coke, cigarettes, and - as this is a Richard Curtis movie - working class people.<br/><br/>But such discussions are immaterial, as this isn't a reflective sci-fi piece, but a ""feelgood"" romantic comedy that's fairly charming if never particularly anything you didn't expect. Even if you weren't aware that this film was written by Curtis, you'd guess it from the formula that's there... the British film that's sold entirely on its appeal to America; the eccentric parents; the ""zany"" best friend who has anti-social tendencies but not in any way that's offensive or unpalatable.<br/><br/>Despite being a multicultural film, every character is also an ""easy"" and ""safe"" middle class character with zero rough edge; the lead character and his parents three Muslims played by people with Hindu and Sikh backgrounds, and given the name of ""Jack"", ""Jed"" and ""Sheila"". It's a cute film, sometimes cloyingly so, and, apart from one swearword at the end it's one you can comfortably show your grandmother.<br/><br/>The real big issue here is the trailer. For some reason the last few years have gone from trailers being there to... well, trail a movie... and into things that contain enormous, massive spoilers. Some notable recent examples in the ""do I even need to go and see it now?"" category include Batman vs. Superman, which killed any vague suspense that may have been generated by showing a clearly post-battle duo on good terms; or Stan & Ollie, which showed... well, pretty much the entire film.<br/><br/>It's trailers made by the mindset behind Planet of the Apes having DVD releases with the Statue of Liberty on the front cover, and Yesterday is that most amazing of products - a film that was released with every. single. major. plot. point. shown. in. the. trailer. This reaches such extraordinary, outrageous lengths that plot twists that take place less than TEN MINUTES before the end credits are shown in the trailer.<br/><br/>Presumably the makers assumed that Richard Curtis scripts are so predictable there was nothing to spoil, and, apart from a scene where John Lennon appears as an old man, never shot dead in 1980, it's all very ""safe roads"" and a fantasy world that never exists... entertaining, but often threatening to drown in its own saccharine. Jack's world may no longer have Coke, but it certainly still has more than enough sugar."

When he starts to play and sing ""Yesterday"" for his friends they love his song. Same with all the other Beatles songs that he can remember.

"VelvetAvatarImpulse","7","0","0","28 September 2019"," An enjoyable distraction, not to be analysed too deeply
","I am a huge fan of both The Beatles and alternate history, so I expected this film to be right up my alley. Feeling in the mood for something that was light and not to be taken too seriously, I came away quite satisfied. I would describe the premise of the film as ""interesting but cheerfully ridiculous"". In terms of creating a world where The Beatles never gained any traction and are largely unknown, it mostly succeeds. In general terms, this world (quite plausibly) doesn't look vastly different to ours, until you start delving into its musical history. However, if you turn your attention to the more specific aspects, there are elements that do strain credibility. If history took such a divergent path that The Beatles, Harry Potter and Coca Cola were unknown, how are we to believe that Jack and Ellie still attended the same school, with Ellie still ending up as his manager? Not to mention that they still lived in the same town, with the same circle of acquaintences. And in this timeline, how did Jack catch Ellie's eye in the first place, seeing as he would not have performed Wonderwall (no Beatles = no Oasis) at the school concert? Of course, these are all essential plot devices, but still, they are ones that grate a little.<br/><br/>The reason for all the world's power supply being briefly knocked offline is never explained (fair enough, perhaps, seeing as this is not a science fiction film). For the record, a massive coronal mass ejection of the sun could conceivably have this effect. Nor is it explained how Jack's accident results in him languishing in an alternate timeline. I do wonder what the psychological effect on someone who (hypothetically) ended up in this situation might be, and perhaps there was scope for exploring this further. To its credit, the film didn't attempt a truly absurd scenario where Jack attempts to find his way back to his original timeline!<br/><br/>In summary, this film is no masterpiece, however it is to be commended for taking what could have otherwise been a fairly generic love story, and applying a number of quirky twists. The gentle moral that happiness is something to be found on your own terms, rather than by what societal pressure dictates, is also welcome. This film could be just the ticket if you are after a couple of hours of escapism, but would prefer not to have to concentrate too deeply (indeed, it's probably best if you don't!)."

","After seeing the trailer to this movie in February, I thought ""Man, this is going to be brilliant!"". I counted the days until the movie was finally in a cinema near me. A few days before watching the actual movie, I came on this site reading some reviews, most of them were positive and people seemed to be amazed by the movie and the genious idea.
However, as always, there were some negative-ish comments saying that they were disappointed with how the idea got ruined in the romance. Reading that, I thought to myself that those people for sure don't like one-of-a-kind movies. Turns out, they were kind of right, well at least I think so.
Here's what I didn't like;
In the trailer it's shown that the Jack Malik is the only one to know about The Beatles (later it turns out he's not the only one), what triggered me, though, was that Coke, Harry Potter, Oasis were also ""forgotten"" but not mentioned later in the movie. Why couldn't it be justthe ""The Beatles oblivion""?
Not one song lasted more than 15 seconds, which is sad, because let's face it- Anyone who came to see this film wanted to hear the wonderfully-brilliant sound that the legendary band created.
ANd of course, there has to be the romance part in every movie. Don't get me wrong, I loved Jack Malik (Himesh Patel) and Ellie (Lily James) together, their love was sweet, warm, but it's not the centre of the film, well, it shouldn't have been.
So, long story short, I did like it, it still is an interesting, unique movie that makes everybody laugh, smile and even cry a little bit. I don't regret watching it."

","I was a little shocked to see Boyle's name attached as director as this is certainly out of his normal comfort zone. On paper a Richard Curtis script with Danny Boyle as the filmmaker, would feel like a slam-dunk, but this is not the case. The film creeps into melodrama and it struggles to maintain that comedy and drama combination it strives to balance. Much like About Time, this might have been better with a few story beats removed or amended. Interesting idea and clearly a love letter to The Beatles, I just wish I could've enjoyed this more."

"arungeorge13","6","0","0","21 September 2019"," A feel-good drama that's less of a Beatles tribute and more of a regular rom-com! [+57%]
","Short Review: Yesterday isn't amongst Danny Boyle's best work but it's the simplicity of the screenplay and the warm performances from Himesh Patel and Lily James that keeps the proceedings breezy. That being said, the film explores little aside from what we already know about (the iconic songs by) The Beatles. The songs themselves are placed pretty neatly, yet I felt they could have been used to enhance the screenplay in a much better way. In the end, Yesterday doubles down to a typical ""long-term friendship that was always a romance from the get-go"" amid which the greatness of The Beatles sort of gets lost.<br/><br/>The dialogues are pretty corny at times too, with Kate McKinnon's character being in-your-face for no apparent reason (but to sound insultingly funny!). Ed Sheeran's presence in the film is also not utilized to the fullest and could have easily been a watered-down cameo. Yet, the lead pair and some all-time Beatles classics ensure that Yesterday remains compelling from start to finish."

","A fantastic idea well executed with some great details and insight. The characters were fun and funny, in a low key British way. I loved the multi racial but still British landscape, also this is one of those rare films with no cartoon baddie verses good set up, there is no real baddie in the movie, (much like miyazaki's totoro and kiki's), and the interest comes from looking into the what ifs more than the unrequited love aspect, which was well done and Lily James was gorgeous and Himesh Patel was suitably oblivious etc, it was needed for the story but it lead to be the rather too neat and tidy focus of the ending, ie it ended up being a love story more than an intriguing sci fi one.
I loved how the story didn't try an make a blackmail aspect to the 'others' story angle, showing Richard Curtis didn't want to go for the obvious with this film, and instead chose fascinating angles to investigate.
And that went right through to the jokes and set ups. The board meeting didn't play it for cliche laughs but those laughs were definitely there.
Ed Sheeran was pretty gracious with laughs at his expense too, the Rap line was great, and he was pretty low key in his delivery.
Just a pleasant fun watch with some great thought provoking set ups and of course a show case for the genius of the Beatles songs, which were on the whole really well delivered. Dan Pemberton soundtrack too to augment an already excellent collection of material.
Pretty much wins all around except for the cheesy romance ending."

","The premise is actually quite fascinating, and the real reason why I decided to watch this movie. But the execution is somewhat disappointing. The supporting characters are the biggest problem for me, most of them are extremely unlikable and uninteresting, and more often than not kind of annoying. Especially Rocky and Kate McKinnon's character. The writers are obviously inspired by The Office and similar types of sarcastic humor in films and series. For me, it did not work, and it made the characters come off as mostly shallow and cynical.<br/><br/>I also feel like the tone of the film varies quite a lot, from joyful to dark and depressing. Sometimes that can be a good thing, but I felt like this one was desperately in need of some momentum. At least I wanted it to be one of two things, either a fun kind of Bruce Almighty-comedy, or a gritty Coen Brothers-drama. It ended up being neither of those things, just sort of flat.<br/><br/>The ending also threw me quite a bit, but I won't go into details.

","Going directly to the plot: Jack Malik (Himesh Patel) has been ""profoundly unsuccessful for 10 years"", those 10 years spent in Suffolk doing insignificant jobs and moonlighting in gigs and songwriting. Childhood best friend Ellie Appleton (Lily James), a school teacher as well as his manager, gives him unfailing support with her sunshine smiles, which seems to be the only thing going right for him. She encourages him, saying that a miracle may happen. ""Like what?"" he enquired. ""Well, eh, Benedict Cumberbatch becoming a sex symbol"", she quipped. Right away, I knew this is going to be a fun movie.<br/><br/>One night, when power failure hits the entire world, Jack got knocked down by a car. Lucky for him, the only lasting damage was losing two front teeth. While in hospital, as Ellie is leaving after a visit, Jack asks ""Will you still need me, will you still feed me, when I'm 64?"". ""Why 64?"" Ellie does not appear to get it. Just out of hospital, sharing a few moments with a group of good friends, he is asked to sing a song. Instead of ""All I want for Christmas is my tooth front teeth"" (did not get a chance to visit a dentist yet), he sings ""Yesterday"". They really love it, and one of them asks ""Did you write this?""<br/><br/>That night Jack Googles ""John, Paul, George and Ringo"" and gets only ""Pope Paul"". However, when he Googles ""Rolling Stone"" he is happy to see that they are ""still rolling"". It become quite apparent that the freak global power failure has led to a parallel universe where The Beatles have not existed. Everything else seems quite normal. Well, maybe not everything. Disappearing together with The Beatles are Harry Potter and Coke, as I intimated in my ""headline"".<br/><br/>I will not belabor the plotline, which is easy to guess, of how Jack's memory of the Beatles songs becomes the golden key to fame and fortune. A warning, however, to those who expect a trip down memory lane. The familiar songs, appearing as a few bars here and a fragment there, are only devices to forward the plotline. For the purpose of going down memory lane, ""Across the universe"" (2007) is much more satisfying. Similar to ""Mamma Mia"", it's a musical fitted with an abundance of familiar songs from the group featured.<br/><br/>Also familiar is the love story's two key elements. First, best friends who consider each other more as siblings or buddies finally find romantic love (""When Harry meets Sally"", ""Always be my maybe""). Second, while one of the two soars towards stardom, the other remains the same as the social gap between them widens (""A star is born""). Here is where the actors carry the day. Patel and James are simply marvelous and more than carry the day."

My brain just can't process this.<br/><br/>And they had a good opportunity to end it different here. They set up a parallel universe and it would be perfect if in the alternative one he doesn't get the girl, but gets hee in the original one.<br/><br/>As for the soundtrack. It's missing a piece which comes up several times the two main characters try to express their feelings for each other... something in the style of Pachelbel's Canon.

","Rated so highly for the music only. Along with Bohemian Rhapsody, Rocketman, et all, Yesterday is another attempt to revitalize old catalogues and make money (The Beatles' Apple Corps is involved, natch). But beyond that, it paints the music of The Beatles on a new canvas and, as in the film, creates a different universe for iconic songs some of us heave heard for most of our lives (I was 11 when The Beatles came to the US). So it was great to hear these mostly stripped down arrangements presented in a world which didn't know The Beatles (due to the intersection of a parallel universe or something). They are simple arrangements, but allow the songs to shine and the genius behind them to become even more apparent. In one sense, they are in the pantheon of the millions of Beatles' covers, but then again, they are very fresh, spare, and modern, performed convincingly.<br/><br/>Other than the music, this is a very mediocre film. ""Saved by the music"" has rarely been more true. It's watchable and never boring, but if not for the music, I probably would have stopped watching at the 10th joke I didn't laugh at (did get a chuckle out of the Googling, though). It's totally formulaic romcom. There are so many better places the film could have gone, questions tackled. Like would the songs have been iconic hits without Beatlemania (kind of implicitly answered)? Or even a realistic idea of where popular music went without them (apparently a world without Oasis but with the vapid and unoriginal Ed Sheeran (who gets WAY too much screen time). Yet The Beatles completely rewrote the music business, radio, recording, the album concept, group singer-songwriters, and rock music itself so it's likely neither Oasis nor Ed Sheeran would exist in that world. That Sheeran and Oasis are used as the conduits to the Beatles for modern youth is beyond shameful.<br/><br/>I lost it when Jack meets the alternative John Lennon, age 78. It is a very touching scene and punctuates the tragedy of his death so young. I hope Yoko doesn't see this movie, and I guess that makes this (unnecessary) scene tasteless at worst, maudlin at best. This scene was not integral to the movie in any way, so seemed sad opportunism.<br/><br/>If you are too young to remember, start with the revolutionary Rubber Soul, or fire up a blunt with Sgt. Pepper. After Abbey Road, go back to the beginning. Rinse, repeat for your whole life."

"charney-1","Null","0","0","28 July 2019"," Nostalgia for baby-boomers
","Loved it immensely! I loved the way it took the Beatles music out of its usual, historical context and inserted it into another more contemporary context. The lead actor is a sort of ""against type"" prince but thoroughly charming; and his love interest is as enchantingly lovely as a princess. Lots of good Beatles music (even if only a few bars here and there of several tunes). The music is perfectly synced with the plot and the emotional ups and downs, the trials and tribulations, the pride and the guilt of its protagonist. The film is not so much about the Beatles as it is about collective cultural memories . . . and what the world might be like, what life might be like, what our relationships might be like if some one (or some few) iconic aspect(s) of contemporary cultural had never existed. Some critics have wondered why the film doesn't dig more deeply into the absence of the Beatles from the world; but ultimately, this film is (rightly) more about a small compnay of friends and family; it's close up and personal, more intimate than any sort of cosmic worldview -- thus, it's relatability. The flick is particularly nostalgic for those of us who grew up with the Beatles; but for younger folks, even if you're not very familiar with the Beatles or their music, try to enjoy it for its fairy tale sort of love story. Does the guy get the girl? Before the end of the film answers that question, there are a couple of other wonderful surprises -- one of which will make your jaw drop!"

You would think with all that said, I would give it a 10, wish I could because the stories that good. Here's one rub; the underlying love element doesn't quite work, there is just no chemistry between the lead actors. Her performance is solid and his isn't bad but there's just no one screen magic. Here's the big rub; Himesh Patel who plays Jack Malik and carries the mail, sort of speak, for The Beatles, is a decent actor that has a task he's not up too. Too many of the performances of Beatles masterpieces, he's off pitch and then butchers a couple of songs which the Beatles material protectionist in me finds offensive. Bottom line, Patel was miscast. To me that was the real flaw in this otherwise Oscar worthy film. So the fault lies with the producer on this one, not Patel. I really wish you cared about these two people getting together and that The Beatles music was expertly performed and produced. If that were the case, Yesterday would have been one of my favorite films of all time. By the way Ed Sheeran does a great job as himself."

a) the acting is terrible. The main fella is a nobhead who used to be in
EastEnders (a rubbish soap opera), it also has Ed Sheeran, patron saint of
losers playing himself.
b) It is never funny. Richard Curtis films usually have a few funny lines or
scenarios but this one didn't.
c) It looks bland. Danny Boyle usually offers some visual style but again, not
here.<br/><br/>However, the leitmotif of reintroducing the Beatles' music to a world that never remembered them was a powerful weapon. Every time a new Beatles song was presented in the film, it was as if that was the first time anyone had heard them and of course they were overwhelmed by how great they sounded.<br/><br/>The Beatles were the most important phenomenon in popular culture of the 20th century and by tapping into that force, this film has it's moments of magic but overall is a below average attempt, riding on the coat tails of something truly special."

A bundle of hits and tunes. Where in fact the Beatles are the foundation of modern pop music. Countless bands and singer - song writers have created music founded on or inspired by their music. Taking away the Beatles and the world of music of today would be unrecognizable. The Bee Gees, the Beach Boys, Heart. Even Kiss, Bruce Springsteen and Nirvana and The Foo Fighters.

"maxtiggertom","8","7","25","23 June 2019"," Yesterday Review: A world without The Beatles
","A world without The Beatles. As hard as a concept that is to grasp that is what Danny Boyle's new film aims to answer. It most certainly does.<br/><br/>Our main protagonist: ""Jack Malik"" played by: ""Himesh Patel"" is a troubled up and coming musician. Despite getting a brand-new gig to play at. Only manages to cup together a few audience members. Most of them being his group of friends and manager. His manager and best friend: ""Ellie Appleton"": played by the wonderful ""Lily James"" tries to get his mood up however that leads to film's main plot point. Which I won't spoil. The events that unfold after that point in the picture. Is where Yesterday really shines.<br/><br/>To me the film just sparks with energy and passion. No doubt thanks to Danny's Boyle's excellent direction and editing. Coupled with Patel's and Lily's excellent performances makes Yesterday soar into the sky instead of floundering down on the ground. This is not to say the music is anything to gloss over because the use of The Beatles music is a wonderful addition to the film and really helps elevate the film's energy to new heights. To be honest there were a few moments where I wanted to get up from the seat and dance along to the music.<br/><br/>Jack's sudden rise to stardom though The Beatles music is quite surprising, the film takes quite a few twists and turns as the film comes to its inevitable conclusion. The ending in of itself was quite intriguing and was not the way I envisioned the film to end. I personally thought the film reached the maximum amount of potential it could with the subject matter and it dove into the pit that was the world without The Beatles with care and interest. I felt myself drawn into Jack's character as he had a personally very relatable struggle, that no matter what he did it seemed that he would be destined to walk around in circles for the rest of his music career.<br/><br/>The performances by the two main leads Patel and James were fantastic and were along with Boyle's fantastic direction. It honestly really feels like this was a film made with passion and care, which is a dime a dozen in today's world. I also really enjoyed the cameos that made me chuckle quite a few times. Including one particular surprise which almost brought to tears.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In conclusion, I really enjoyed this film and would personally recommend it to anyone regardless if you are a Beatles fan or not this film has the potential to change your mind.<br/><br/>4/5 thumbs<br/><br/>Highly recommended!"

","Short answer is: no it wouldn't.<br/><br/>Spoilers ahead. You have been warned:<br/><br/>Two sentence plot summary: A unsuccessful musician gets thrown into an alternate universe (without any explanation of how and why) where various (pop-culture) things haven't happened but almost everything else is at is it today: Among them Harry Potter, Oasis, cigarettes and the Beatles. He recreates the Beatles' songs as his own, becomes famous and almost doesn't get his girl (but of course comes clean very publicly and gets her in the end).<br/><br/>So what do we have here? A whole bunch of problems.<br/><br/>The problem with the plot:
It's lazy writing from A to Z. You know: The type of romantic comedy where the two fated lovers cannot confess their love for one another over a huge amount of time (and 2 hours of movie-time) because people are interrupting, phones are ringing and doors are knocked on. In the end the guy gives up fame to get his girl. Original? Not in the slightest. Even the universe-shifting at the start merely exists to string scenes together in which Beatles songs can be played (and then mostly only fragments thereof).<br/><br/>The problem with the actors:
The protagonist and the girl are likeable enough. No one else in the movie (apart from the two who also remember the Beatles) is. Kate McKinnon doesn't ever seem to catch a break with the lousy scripted stereotype characters she's handed - and this movie is no exception, making her play the standard money-hungry agent. Most of the side-characters are only there for the ""cringe-humor"". The drug using firend. the fake fanboi-friend, the father, the mother, the neighbor, the list goes on.<br/><br/>The problem with the humor:
It feels like the movie desperately tries to put in a funny moment her and there but this basically boils down to the protagonist finding out that X isn't there in this universe, googles it and finds something else unde the same name. Calling this a RomCom would beg the question: ""What comedy""? The theater was reasonably full but there wasn't a single laugh. A few isolated chuckles was the best it ever got.<br/><br/>The music:
The movie very heavily relies on the recognizability of Beatles songs. Which is to say: The music - when it's a Beatles song - is great. Any other time it's 'meh' at best (and the recognizability of Oasis today is more of a: Oasis...who?). And here is really where it all falls apart. If it weren't for the nostalgia (i.e. if the Beatles were replaced with a fictional band and fictional songs) then this movie would be utterly boring to watch.<br/><br/>2 Stars for the Beatles songs. Zero stars for anything else."

Instead of Jack asking then what the hell is going on and why are those three the only ones that remember the Beatles he is just relieved he is not getting arrested? WTF?? are you kidding me? I would have talked to them and asked then if they knew anyone else that also remembers and if they had any idea of what happened.
There are other parts that were equally cheesy and stupid but that part stuck out to me.
Sorry i cannot agree with those that thought this was a excellent movie but it simply was not to me . It had potential but failed miserably."

","""Yesterday"" is a British ""rom-com"" musical movie centered around a struggling musician whom, after an accident, finds himself the only person who remembers the Beatles. He then becomes famous by taking credit for writing and performing their songs.<br/><br/>I saw the trailer for this awhile back and it peaked my interest. Apparently these past few years have sparked interest in reminiscing over musical geniuses of the past and present. We got a film surrounding Freddie Mercury and Queen (pass), a musical fantasy about the outlandishly amazing Elton John (big win) and this one which capitalizes on the famous British band The Beatles (super meh). It's an interesting concept, but in theory it could've been surrounding any famous band/artist and it wouldn't of made a difference. However, I am a fan of The Beatles so I was fine with this choice. Also I believe they are trying to replicate the ""Beatlemania"" craziness in modern day.<br/><br/>I can say I'm glad this film wasn't another ""Across The Universe"" where they incorporate the songs into the plot, it's already been done in that film and arguably yes the visuals in that movie are stunning at moments but the songs being covered were poorly done. We finally FINALLY got a movie this year (again big win) that incorporated a famous musicians songs into plot pretty flawlessly, so it would've been a disaster trying to do that in this one as well. In this instead we get a simple tale of a struggling artist becoming burnt out by playing small festivals and not progressing how he'd like.<br/><br/>Right off the bat I couldn't stop asking myself, did this movie even establish The Beatles as a band before their existence was just wiped randomly? Because of a power outage/bike accident. I don't think it was ever established which bugged me, but I pushed that aside and kept watching. I wanted a discussion about artistic integrity, making us as an audience debate on whether or not we would take advantage of the situation as well like our main character (whose name I can't even remember honestly). But I was giving this film too much credit apparently! No we just get a cliche romance flick that drags the story along because it's not very interesting.<br/><br/>We literally have this girl asking him to dump his dream for her and go back home. I hate this specific plot point so much! Also that Benedict Cumberbatch comment was personally offending to me! Okay but jokes aside, Ed Sheeran was in this. First of all, he would not just contact some random singer with zero notoriety at that point. The movie should've had him gain more recognition at least before this happens because it was unbelievable. Also Kate Mckinnon is way too much herself in this movie as the ""manager"", like come on.<br/><br/>There's a recurring theme of interruption in this for whatever reason and it irritated me to no end. The camerawork was pretty average, it could've pushed so much more wonder and made it visually impactful. Coming off the backburner of ""Rocketman"" which was visually stunning and even having seen ""Across The Universe"" which had all of its positive praise coming from me about the visuals, it was so lazy. Many say comparing film isn't ""fair"" but I disagree. It pushes directors to do better and take inspiration/advice from those who succeeded greater than them.<br/><br/>Something positive I can say is that they at least briefly touched upon the cultural/time period conflict which I liked. For example; Jude is an older name (though the joke they use is stupid) and could ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" be made successfully today? It's very psychedelic and drug influenced music. This is discussed during the table meeting, though I doubt singers discuss albums on a very large ""Game Of Thrones"" style table while they tear it apart. Maybe I'm wrong, but it felt unrealistic.<br/><br/>So amongst all of the poorly written drama, forgettable romance and random fluff we randomly get these 2 people who remember The Beatles songs? I mean...I don't need an in-depth explanation of it, there is a suspension of belief but it comes out of seemingly nowhere. Apparently, the actual Beatles band members exist still too!? I kid you not John Lennon is alive and well because of this weird parallel universe were in. I honestly would've rather them not exist at all within the film. I also need someone to explain to me why coke, cigarettes, Oasis/""Wonderwall"" and Harry Potter are gone too? Like what the hell!?<br/><br/>Random thought. I don't know why Ed Sheeran having his own song as his ringtone was what made me laugh the hardest during this entire film (which says a lot). Also the idea of Ed Sheeran having an actual concert and inviting some random dude on stage as his intro act for this movie, I couldn't contain myself! Back to business though, the ending of this sucks dude. Apparently everyone is alright that our main character admitted he never wrote a single lyric in his life. That is was all stolen basically. WHAT!? I hate movies that overlook interesting topics, but I also hate movies that sugarcoat everything at the end and tie a ribbon around it. There's a montage too at the end, yes just give up your dreams for romance. What a let down man, this one had so much potential too but we get a film that makes little sense and slaps us in the face with overdone romance cliche."

","We go through most of this movie believing that in the alternate universe into which the protagonist stumbles the Beatles never existed.

That it was only chance that made the Beatles a hit, and that they could have written the same material and still gone nowhere?<br/><br/>I have no answer. The movie doesn't offer one.<br/><br/>I much enjoyed this movie. But I wish the end had reflected at least a little on the question it raises."

","The late-sixties was barely breathing, but it still had a pulse, until Mark David Chapman(Jonas Bell) walked into a public library and began the process of pulling the plug. The security guard, the librarian, the other patrons: How could they have known that a madman was in their midst? Nobody looks like an assassin until they become one. He was ""Nowhere Man"". He was on an island. Chapman perused the fiction stacks, looking for ""some kind of guidance"" as he scrutinized authors and titles inscribed on spines, overlooking and sparing those works of literature the infamy of being weaponized. The Church of Scientology, we learn in Mark Piddington's ""The Killing of John Lennon"", was located right across the street from where Chapman worked as a security guard. He made repeated crank calls to its worshippers. Chapman believed that God should not take the form of a living author. And yet, he misconceived ""The Catcher in the Rye"" as a sacred text, unconsciously appropriating J.D. Salinger's words as scripture. The irony eluded Chapman. Unlike The Church of Scientology's founder, Salinger never claimed to be a prophet. Holden Caulfield, the disaffected teen who ""was surrounded by phonies"" wanted to kill himself, not other people. Chapman misinterpreted ""The Catcher in the Rye"", afflicted he was with a Holden Caulfield complex, the same as any religious crackpot, when he gunned down John Lennon outside The Dakota Apartments in NYC, circa 1980. Lennon was one of the phonies, according to Chapman. If the deranged young man listened to ""God"", an album track from ""John Lennon & The Plastic Ono Band"", and not the Salinger of his own making, he would have known not to ""believe in Beatles"". People loved The Beatles. People loved John Lennon. But in Salinger's own words: ""People are always ruining things for you.""<br/><br/>Rose Petrofsky(Wendie Jo Sperber) knows which mop top is left-handed. She begs Larry(Mark McClure) to stop the car so she can yell ""Paul"" into a pay phone and win free tickets to ""The Ed Sullivan Show"". Stock footage of screaming, hormonally super-charged young girls on black and white celluloid only tell half the story of Beatlemania, a pop culture supernova that started in earnest, but spread like a tempestuous wildfire, when the Pan Am that carried the four lads from Liverpool touched ground at JFK on February 4, 1964. ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"", the 1978 feature film debut by Robert Zemeckis, colors the disease by foregrounding those young women who lost it at the radio. Rose always carries a treasure trove of dimes in her pocket for a situation such as this. She intends on feeding one at the closest coin slot. Rose's condition is reaching critical mass. She threatens to jump. They don't believe her. Pam(Nancy Allen), Rose's best friend, should know better. Back at the record store, where vinyl copies of ""Meet the Beatles"" are selling like hotcakes, Pam witnesses her pal scream at a passing cardboard likeness of Paul. Cardboard, a processed paper good, simulacrum even more analog than the image on a movie screen or television set, puts Rose in a spasmodic bit of hair-trigger frenzy that bespeaks of an idolization that transcends the ordinary love you feel for your lover, your parent, or your pet. It was, quite simply, utter madness. Grace(Theresa Saldana), an aspiring photojournalist, insists that Larry drive on, and in the next instant, the film depicts how Beatlemania, at the outset, was a contagion without no known cure. Rose makes good on her threat. Janis(Susan Kendall Newman), the folk music aficionado, a proto-hippie who loves Bob Dylan, shrieks. Tony(Bobby DiCicco), a greaser out of time, can't believe that the girl riding shotgun propelled herself onto hard pavement from a moving vehicle, Later in the film, unfairly, it's Pam, engaged and not even half the devotee that her daredevil friend is, who sneaks into the Beatles' room at The Plaza Hotel. Suddenly, alone with men's things, famous men, something primal switches on inside her. Lascivious in nature, albeit abstract, like a concuspiscent groupie, Pam cheats on her husband, and worse, Rose, when she takes off her engagement ring and performs something resembling foreplay to Paul's bass guitar. At the ""Ed Sullivan Show"" taping, after ""She Loves You"" recedes into memory, Pam sobs quietly. The sweet single-minded love she lavished on the Hofner is consummated. She grips her skirt while the others help Rose recover from a fainting spell. Richard(Eddie Dezeen), a memorabilia collector Rose meets at the hotel, loves Ringo. Rose and Pam, both, love Paul; one like a silly schoolgirl, one like a cosmopolitan woman. Grace loves George. And finally, there is Janis, the future flower child, who is so mystified at Rose's lack of social consciousness when she cuts off Peter, Paul & Mary in mid-song with the thoughtless turn of a car radio knob. Someday, she will love John, and cry the hardest on that fateful day in December, when Yoko Ono lost a husband, Sean lost a father, and the yuppies lost their bridge to yesterday.<br/><br/>Should the world forgive Mark David Chapman? No. That's an irrevocable no. ""Watching the Wheels"", the third single off ""Double Fantasy"" was climbing the Top 40 when Chapman gunned down Lennon with hollow point bullets, in the back. ""The Killing of John Lennon"", albeit exploitative, works as a docudrama; it gets all the details right. Chapman meets the icon twice. John(Richard Sherman) signs his copy of ""Double Fantasy"" before he enters the limo, en route to a recording session with his wife. How could Lennon have known that he just signed his last autograph. When the ex-Beatle returns and sees Chapman loitering outside his apartment complex, he probably though the young man wanted another one. Chapman, serving twenty-years-to-life in a New York state penitentiary, continues to be turned down for parole, despite his repeated public affirmations of remorse for what he did yesterday, nearly four decades ago. ""Yesterday"", directed by Danny Boyle, has the unintended but unfortunate effect of being a fantasy that, arguably, benefits Chapman, because in this alternate universe, he is free as a bird.<br/><br/>""It burned in my head; it was like an electric current passing through my body,"" the killer narrates, as he clutches the book to his chest; he continues: ""and lighting up all the cells in my brain."" Chapman, a born-again Christian, gets to be Holden for real, in an extra-diegetical sense, because this time he does ""catch everybody if they go over the cliff,"" instead of that ugly doppleganger who drops them. Who is watching the wheels on the bicycle that Jack Malik(Hamesh Patel) rides when he slams into a bus? ""Yesterday"" can be read as Mark David Chapman's double fantasy. A worldwide blackout corresponds to the assassin's described high wattage overkill as if Chapman is some intradiegetic narrator who telekinetically recontextualizes the cells that light up his brain. The world stops spinning, 'til he says spin. It's just like starting over. Why Jack, a mediocre singer-songwriter who calls it quits to the disappointment of Ellie, his manager, after he plays in a seemingly invitation-only tent at some midlevel music festival. Best known, by default, for ""The Summer Song"", Salinger fans will recognize that the novel is set in winter. The temporal distance between the hot season and the eighth of December is only equated by the spatial distance; another island in another ocean: Great Britain, the Atlantic, so far away from Mark David Chapman's genesis that ended so apocalyptically. Instead of John Lennon or Paul McCartney, it's the quiet Beatle, George, whom Jack Malik most evokes, since Harrison's attraction to traditional Indian music informed his songwriting, starting with ""Love You To"" and ending with ""Within You Without You"", a sitar-heavy album track from ""Sgt. Peppers'..."", in which The Beatles developed alter-egos, as a means to create some distance from the trappings of fame that engulfed them. The character George adopts for these practitioners of baroque harmonics has a name now: It's Jack Malik. The retired performer wakes up in a hospital, greeted bedside by Ellie, who hands her client a mirror that reveals two missing teeth, a metaphor that signifies the erasure of Lennon/McCartney as songwriters. As Ellie leaves, he asks: ""Will you still love me when I'm 64?"" and his bewildered manager wonders aloud about the chronological randomness. Jack was chosen for a reason to be the go-between for fantasy and double fantasy.<br/><br/>During that same visit to the library, Mark David Chapman climbed the stairs and picked out a second book; it was a coffee table hardcover about The Beatles. For no particular reason, he targeted John, finding an adventitious link between Holden's notion of phonies, described by Salinger as people who were ""charismatic, wealthy, attractive, and superficial"", and the song ""Imagine"", in particular, this couplet: ""Imagine no possessions/I wonder if you can/No need for greed or hunger/A brotherhood of man"". ""Imagine"", which finished recording in early July for an October release, encompassed the cyclical period that falls under the astrological sign that denotes a lion. Jack is not the only person who remembers the Beatles. Two sentients; one man, one woman, talk with Jack backstage after they interrupt a press conference. The man's name is Leo, Chapman's stand-in. They give the dishonest singer-songwriter the address to John Lennon, alive at 78, an everyman, at peace, in a remote part of England.<br/><br/>""Yesterday"", without meaning to, validates the madman's grudge against Lennon. At a concert in his hometown, Jack Malik sticks it to the phonies, including his label's A & R woman, and alas, himself. This is the screenplay Chapman would write. Jack, in mid-set, announces to the world that he's not the author.<br/><br/>He abides by Lennon's own words: ""Imagine no possessions,"" and releases ""his"" catalog online for free.<br/><br/>Jack Malik is no phony."

The film though, is overlong, drags on in spots, and could use some severe tightening up.<br/><br/>The stars of the film are likeable enough (Jack's roadie friend is a particular scene-stealer) but the film is kind of like a cheap junk food treat - tastes kind of good, but has a lot of air in it.<br/><br/>Jack's rise to the top singing Beatles songs is done fairly decently, but there are just so many scenes with unneeded dialogue and dead space that the film becomes really dull and tiresome in certain spots.<br/><br/>Ed Sheeran is also in it a lot as himself - how the heck is this guy arguably the biggest music star in the world right now? In the film he's as flat as a pancake, no charisma or personality whatsoever.<br/><br/>It definitely helps if you are a Beatles fan, as you'll see and listen to clever nods to the group in various scenes.

This is the ""huge gyp"" I was talking about above in the subject line. There was a certain scene in the trailer that looked to be a MAJOR part of the film, and is a major ""this will help get people into the theater"" scene. However, while the scene is in the movie, it's not exactly what it seems. Therefore, the scene is a gigantic fraud (just like Jack in the movie), with absolutely zero payoff. This actually angered me as this was the scene I was looking forward to the most, but it meant absolutely nothing and led to absolutely nothing. This part of the trailer was a complete scam.<br/><br/>Another rip-off was another scene in the trailer, in the same setting as the ""gyp"" scene, that never made the final cut.

Review: Yesterday
By Josh Teggert - July 4, 2019<br/><br/>
Yesterday, on paper, spells a recipe for delight. It joins two established filmmakers with distinct styles and structures, Danny Boyle (Trainspotting, Slumdog Millionaire) and Richard Curtis (Love Actually, Four Weddings and a Funeral), and is set to the revolutionising music of The Beatles. But that's not all; the songs of John, Paul, George and Ringo are rediscovered and explored in a modern setting through Jack Malik (Himesh Patel), who is seemingly the only person to remember The Beatles after a worldwide blackout wipes their existence from the face of the Earth.<br/><br/>Despite its moments of pleasure and emotion evoked by the ever-astonishing music of The Beatles, Yesterday is nothing more than a barebone romantic comedy in keeping with the standard fundamentals of a Richard Curtis flick.<br/><br/>Curtis' structure here is a simple one; after Jack quickly spirals into a life of fame and fortune as a result of him modelling the Liverpudlian band's music as his own, he begins to lose touch with his closest friend Ellie (Lily James), who was Jack's manager through all his years of hardship as a struggling local performer. The pair's displacement raises questions within Jack on what he really wants from life.<br/><br/>There's a strange parallel here between this premise and the flow of the film; Yesterday, much like its young protagonist, loses track of itself towards the middle, loosely entwining side-plots in a haze of emotional exuberance. One sub-plot of particular significance is pushed aside to the point where its barely memorable before suddenly returning, making the overall integrity of the film somewhat shaky. It may be easy for Curtis to have focussed so much on the relationship between the two friends in a 'will-they won't-they' romantic entanglement, but Boyle's often sharp visionary filmmaking skills seem to have taken a back seat here in favour of Curtis' conventional structure, which is a shame.<br/><br/>Thus, Yesterday is very much a 'Long and Winding Road' towards a predictable outcome. What's more, Curtis' general dumbing-down of the overall message of The Beatles further highlights just how plain and normative the narrative is. The Beatles were edgy, experimental and often controversial, but there is nothing new in Yesterday to mirror this legacy.<br/><br/>It's essentially a 2-hour long ""what if?"" gag, which wears out halfway through the film. But to say Yesterday completely turns the viewer off as it progresses would be unfair. It can be heart-warming and uplifting, especially so when listening to the awe-inspiring repertoire of the Fab Four. Patel and James' on-screen chemistry is undeniable, however it's not enough to save from the fact that Yesterday by no means manages to encapsulate the magic of The Beatles' life and music throughout its course (all this without even mentioning the downright cringeworthy acting - if you can even call it that - from Ed Sheeran. Kudos to him though for being game).<br/><br/>With a bit more attention paid to the quirkiness of the context, Yesterday could have been a mesmerising hit. Instead, Danny Boyle's latest will sadly fizzle out into obscurity when it ought to have been as celebrated as the band members themselves."
"austin0731","6","2","5","11 August 2019"," Ironically forgettable
","Coming into Yesterday hoping for a good and relaxing time, with classic Beatles songs, I ended up being rather disappointed. There was nothing wrong with the narrative pers se but unfortunately it doesn't hit that charm that many music centric 'small' films tend to bring. Perhaps it was the one too many Ed Sheeran 'cameo' that just seemed to distract from the main draw of the movie.<br/><br/>In an already cliche genre and narrative Yesterday really doesn't do much to elevate its craft, it was a decent watch but ultimately one that would be easily forgotten."
"michael-kerrigan-526-124974","6","2","5","10 July 2019"," A bit better than meh!
","I've seen quite a lot of Richard Curtis films. Some had an emotional warmth (4 weddings, Notting Hill, About Time) others a bit cheesy but perfectly enjoyable (Love Actually) and a bit netter than merely meh.... For me, yesterday was very much in the latter category. I was never bored but could not get emotionally involved. But that's probably because fantasy is not my genre - and a world without Beatles is utter fantasy right? Not that AWWB would necessarily be a bad thing. They are and were the most overrated band in history. I will look forward to the thumbs down for daring to question The Beatles' apparent untouchability. 6 out of ten"

","As a big fan of Love Actually, I figured an alternate reality love rom-com on the music of the Beatles would be great. Unfortunately, from the opening shot this is a paint by numbers job. Struggling guy can't tell the girl he loves her... wow ever heard of texting? this is 2019 and it really shows the age of Richard Curtis when he uses 1980 style declaration of love constantly interrupted not once but three times. Give it a rest guys!
I enjoyed the singing especially when it was a bit off key, it made it more authentic.
The trailers showed Jack Malik improvising a song on Corden's show , that wasn't on the cut we saw.
THe editing was terrible but I guess parachuting Boyle to direct did not help."

","You know a film is excellent when the audience vigorously claps as the show ends, and when they remain until every credit has scrolled down the screen. That's what it was like when we went to a late matinee. If you love The Beatles music, you will be pulled into this film, with joy. The movie was entertaining, funny, touching, thought-provoking, and much more. It was a great way to escape for about 2 hours, and come out smiling; happy. My only question was: Who played John Lennon??? Can't find a mention of him in the cast, though I have a possible answer: Robert Carlyle, or Damon Herriman.

This film delivers on the very things you expect: great performances, great premise and featuring some of the best music of our time.<br/><br/>I hate spoilers, so I will not reveal any of the plot. I will say that Himesh Patel is EXCELLENT as the struggling musician Jack Malik
who finds out that, after a strange worldwide blackout , he is the only person who remembers the Beatles . His acting AND singing are both outstanding.<br/><br/>Lily James plays his best friend and manager Ellie. She is adorable and full of energy. Ed Sheeran is surprisingly funny playing himself and Kate McKinnon delivers a laugh out loud performance as Ed Sheeran's manager who gets her talons on Jack. There is also one other surprise at the end that I found quite poignant.<br/><br/>If you are looking for some life altering experience that has you exploring the mystique that was and is the Beatles , you will probably be disappointed. If you are looking for a fun film that makes you laugh AND sing along, then I highly recommend Yesterday the movie."

","I just wanted to be surprised, I so wanted to be surprised but I knew by the end of the movie it was going to end up exactly how I knew it would. The protagonist was going to feel remorse about taking credit for someone else's music and he was going to tell the crowd........big surprise I was not surprised at all. But other than that I mean they're playing The Beatles catalog and the actor is quite capable of singing."
"BookerWoulf-6661","7","2","5","1 July 2019"," I truely did believe in Yesterday.
","This film is actually a sweet treat! It's got enough Beatles in it to make a fan of the Beatles travel right back into their Beatlemania. I absolutely loved all of the little references wgich this movie provided. Especially one of the main ones towards the end. (: If you're a newer Beatles fan I'd go back and listen to their music before you do eventually see this, if you don't most of the little jokes may go over your head. Overall, this movie is wonderful! I'd recommend this to those who are truely real Beatles fans. I hope you enjoy the movie the same way I did!"
"KeremUlucay","7","2","5","28 June 2019"," BRILLIANT IDEA, AVERAGE MOVIE
","Yesterday is a enjoyable and funny movie. It has an creative and lovely idea for making a movie. It has great characters. Story is okay for a while but in second half it becomes so cheesy. On the other hand, it is a amazing journey in to The Beatles' songs. It has some creative sequences which is lots of fun. Also, it is good as cinematographically. But this movie could be more than that at all."
"tm-sheehan","6","2","5","28 June 2019"," Yesterday needed HELP! as it was a Long and Winding Road........
","My Review- Yesterday. I rate it 6.5<br/><br/>A Long and Winding Road that took a few bad turns.<br/><br/>I was really looking forward to go against some of the negative criticism Yesterday is receiving as I liked the original story concept portrayed in the trailers I saw but as often happens the trailer is better than the movie.<br/><br/>Yesterday is an Adult fantasy,a little Faustian ( sell your soul to the devil ) and Sliding Doors ( What if I took the different road) also Aladdin grant me my greatest wish.
The trouble for me with this movie basically is the script,it just gets sillier and veers off in all directions until I started to lose interest.<br/><br/>I blame the Director Danny Boyle the story writer Jack Barth and Screenplay writer Richard Curtis ,who wrote great stories and Screenplays for Four Weddings and a Funeral , Bridget Jones Diary and Love Actually but also the horrible recent one for Mama Mia! Here We Go Again,which I notice gets about the same rating on IMBD as Yesterday, which could have been much better.<br/><br/>Yesterday I enjoyed much more than Mama Mia !Here We Go Again ,which also featured Lily James who plays Ellie Appleton in Yesterday .<br/><br/>Himesh Patel ( no relation to Dev Patel) plays Jack Malek a song writer musician who has been trying for years to be appreciated for his talent .<br/><br/>His manager Ellie ,who would like to be more than a friend and manager is the only one that has faith in Jack.
Then a 7 second total World black out erases any reference to The Beatles and their music.
Jack runs in to a car in the dark on his bike and wakes up in hospital and when it sinks in after searching the web that no one knows any of the Beatles music he decides this is his chance to become famous.<br/><br/>No more spoilers (that's all in the trailers )because I can't rubbish this movie as it's original but flawed and the cast are all very good ,especially Himesh Patel who sings and plays his own guitar while performing the Beatles songs .<br/><br/>Yesterday is worth seeing for the excellent cast and for Beatles music fans plus Ed Sheeran fans ,who plays himself very well and its entertaining and good fun in parts as The Beatles song goes ""It Was a Hard Days Night "" and the script needed ""Help""!"
"cinechatreviews","7","2","5","26 June 2019"," A fun rom-com
","Rocketman recently did a great job of reminding us just how good Elton John songs are, making us want to dust off our vinyl/plastic/streaming service collection and reacquaint ourselves with his back catalogue all over again. Last year, the Bohemian Rhapsody movie did a similar thing for the music of Queen and now it's the turn of The Beatles with Yesterday. Written by Richard Curtis, and directed by Danny Boyle, Yesterday doesn't go down the musical/biopic route, instead taking classic Beatles songs and weaving them into a high concept romantic comedy.<br/><br/>Yesterday follows struggling musician Jack (Himesh Patel) and long-term best friend/manager Ellie (Lily James). Gigging in pubs is getting Jack nowhere and he's resigned himself to the fact that he might have to give it all up and return to a life of teaching. He lands a spot on the Suffolk stage at Latitude festival, expecting it to be his big break, but only his friends and a handful of bored kids show up to watch him play.<br/><br/>But then, while riding home on his bike that night, something mysterious happens. An unexplained 12 second power cut hits the entire globe and in the resulting chaos, Jack is struck by a bus and flung from his bike. When he awakes in hospital, bruised and missing a couple of front teeth, he plays a Beatles song to Ellie and his friends, who all think it's amazing. They think it's a new song, written by Jack, and claim to have never heard of The Beatles before. After a bit of Googling, it becomes clear that The Beatles never actually existed, and only Jack is able to remember them or any of their songs. There are a few other things which crop up as we go along, that also turn out never to have existed, in what is a bit of a nice running gag throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Jack immediately realises his chance of success at last and sets about trying to remember as many of The Beatles songs and music as he can. His friends love the new material, and there's also a hilarious scene where he tries to introduce his parents to a Beatles song (The Kumars, Sanjeev Bhaskar and Meera Syal both on top form here), but it's still not really working out for him at the pub gigs and weddings where he performs them. It's only when he gets the chance to professionally lay down his tracks, and starts handing out free CDs to customers at the store where he works, that things really take off for Jack, drawing the attentions of one Mr Ed Sheeran. Ed clearly has fun sending himself up, and actually features quite heavily in the movie, particularly in these early stages - turning up at Jack's house, asking him to come and support him on tour, arranging a 10 minute songwriting challenge between him and Jack. I'm not really a fan of Ed Sheeran but he actually turns out to be responsible for a lot of the movies humour, eventually conceding that Jack is a better songwriter than him.<br/><br/>As Jack starts to hit the big time, traveling to LA and being guided through the music business by new manager Debra (Kate McKinnon), we hit a bit of a mid-movie slump. Luckily though, Himesh Patel portrays Jack with such a relatable and likeable charm - his bewilderment and frustrations at the ridiculousness of the music industry, not to mention the building pressures of living the lie that his success has come from using someone else's work, guides us nicely through these slower moments of the movie. The romance part of the story continues to play out too, with Jack and Ellie both clearly having loved each other for 20 years now, but with neither of them committing to taking it any further. Lily James is once again wonderful, despite being very underused in this role, and it's the love story element of the movie which isn't quite as strong as the rest of it.<br/><br/>The movie does manage to pull things together nicely for the final act, resolving the unease and tension that underlies much of the movie. It could have done with a bit more rom and a bit more com at time, but still manages to be an enjoyable movie and a perfect reminder of just how great The Beatles are."

","It was really good. I just was. I felt like it was relatable in a we-all-have-unfulfilled-dreams way. I liked it. The main issue I had was honestly Kate McKinnon.

"ross-547-585754","9","4","15","27 June 2019"," What a year for music movies
","Bohemian Rhapsody, A Star is Born, Rocketman and now Yesterday. I've died and gone to heaven. The great music acts of my time given sensitive and wonderful cinematic treatment.
This film is not so much a story of the Beatles music, but a romance film with the Beatles music featuring heavily in the plot line. Himesh Patel does a good job with the vocals. He doesn't try to be John, Paul or George, but does instead steady covers.
The staging begins slowly as an unknown also-ran from Suffolk, but rapidly ascends into the heavens when 'he' is discovered. The big delivery of the Wembley concert where is given the stage by a very generous Ed Sheeran (who happily plays a great second fiddle to Patel) was wonderful.
The music was a good selection of the original oldies to the more modern tracks as their music became more complex was comprehensive. Aficionados will recognise the crescendo from A Day In The Life as Patel is hit by the proverbial bus that makes all this happen.
An all round pleasing movie with a romance and the rapid 'stardom' of unassuming Patel culminating in a solid ending.
Well worth seeing. Highly recommended, at least to people from the era."

"pokemon_trainer_lucas","8","4","16","21 June 2019"," Funny, Heart-warming and Engaging
","When I saw the trailer for this film, I was in two minds, thinking ""this could either be really good or a total flop"". I went to see it two days ago and it was thoroughly enjoyable! I think that whilst the idea for the film is really wacky and unusual, it is well portrayed and good fun to watch. Despite the fact that the character Jack Malik is stealing The Beatles' music, you actually feel for him the whole way through and want him to be successful in what he's doing. It's a funny and yet emotional film. Ed Sheeran is even in it, but I'll be honest, he can't act for his life! But oh well, he is a singer after all."
"oliverwilkins1","4","3","11","28 June 2019"," Oh what a shame!
","I was so excited to see this movie. Danny Boyle and Richard Curtis teaming up promised something very special but the honest truth is that the movie fails to live up to its headline billing. This movie just didn't cut it for me and here is why. Having watched Richard Curtis's movies for years I have always been drawn to the unique British blend of comedy and romance. But in the age of a more discerning and thankfully more demanding audience I'm just not sure I want to see another movie with a male lead and flimsy female support that plays on the all too familiar romcom tropes. The premise of the movie is largely outlined in the trailer and offers very little surprise if you, like me, had already seen them many times over. The acting is pretty good throughout if you excuse the musical cameo but really I wanted more. The story of boy meets girl, boy leaves girl, boy.... You know the rest won't cut it for me anymore. The thing is I've changed, movies have changed, audiences have changed and yet this movie, which probably would have been a runaway success in 1999 has been found seriously wanting in 2019."
"kjproulx","8","3","11","28 June 2019"," A Joy to Watch
","With all of the music-based biopics being released lately, I found myself much more excited for a film like Danny Boyle's directorial effort in Yesterday. There are so many films that take the formula of a band rising and falling and run with that as their premise. Although this isn't a biopic at all, it really is a celebration of the music, written and performed by The Beatles. It may feel a little uneven at times and it actually feels a little mean-spirited at times, but I believe it will win over many viewers. Here's why I believe Yesterday is worth your time at the cinema.<br/><br/>Following a young musician in Jack Malik (Himesh Patel), as crazy circumstances have him being the only one on Earth who remembers The Beatles every existing, Yesterday is a film that explores how he re-writes their music to become famous. Yes, this film asks you to fall in love with a character who has stolen famous music (but not really?), which does make for a bit of a frustrating watch. With that said, it really does dive into those aspects and wins you over by the time the credits roll.<br/><br/>Being the first time I have ever watched a performance from Himesh Patel, he has definitely proven that he can carry a film, because his devotion to this character, lept off the screen to me. Lily James also stars in the film as his best first, original manager, and possible lover. Honestly, I find her to be incredibly talented and she always elevates a film in my opinion, so for that alone, I may be a little biased when saying I loved a lot about this movie when watching it.<br/><br/>Danny Boyle has helmed this film, which felt like a departure for him when looking at the marketing, but really does have his touch all over it. From dutch angles to beautifully composed shots, it was clearly a Danny Boyle movie from start to finish, which felt very refreshing. Where I think this film lacked the most was in the script itself. Although I don't have any major problems with the movie, there are many scenes that have comedy, that just didn't work for me. In particular, there are a couple of dramatic scenes that are broken up and played off as a joke, which had me scratching my head. Aside from that, this is a very enjoyable film, through and through.<br/><br/>In the end, Yesterday meshes the style of Danny Boyle's direction with the great music that The Beatles have given the world, along with great performances by Himesh Patel, Lily James, and even the little screentime that Ed Sheeran has. With solid pacing, an enjoyably quirky story (albeit sort of dumb in retrospect), and a character that wins you over as the movie progresses, Yesterday was just a great time at the movies in my opinion. I absolutely recommend checking it out."
"arcticvulture-03197","1","2","6","10 March 2020"," Cutting out Ana De Armas ruined this movie.
","The message of this movie was to not be a fake, yet this movie is fake as it gets.

Worst thing is they still show her in the trailers despite not being in the movie at all."

Not sure if it is the actor or the director, could be both, the thing is he managed to make Beatles songs sound...boring. And this is an achievement, but not of the good kind."

"jboothmillard","7","2","6","6 July 2019"," Yesterday
","I saw the trailer for this film, it looked and sounded like a great idea for a concept, and it had all the right ingredients for something that should be good, written by Richard Curtis (Blackadder, Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill, Love Actually, About Time), directed by Danny Boyle (Trainspotting, The Beach, 28 Days Later, Slumdog Millionaire, 127 Hours). Basically, Jack Malik (EastEnders' Himesh Patel) is a struggling singer-songwriter from Lowestoft. His manager and childhood friend Ellie Appleton (Lily James) encourages him not to give up on his dreams. One night, the whole world is momentarily hit with a massive blackout, Jack is hit by a bus whilst on his bike, he recovers in hospital. The following day his friends give him a brand-new guitar, he says for his first time it deserves a great song, he plays and sings ""Yesterday"" by The Beatles, but he is astonished that his friends have never heard it before. Jack is astonished to discover, after searching the internet, that The Beatles and their music no longer exists. Later, he also discovers that in this world, the band Oasis, the soft drink Coca-Cola, the entire concept of cigarettes, and Harry Potter never existed either. After his initial bemusement, being the only person in the world that remembers the ""Fab Four"", he questions his morals and wonders if he could claim all their songs as his own. Sure enough, he performs the songs at gigs, claiming he wrote them, and records a demo with local music producer Gavin (Alexander Arnold). Following a performance on local television, Jack is invited by pop star Ed Sheeran (as himself) to play as his opening act in Moscow. Ellie declines to join him, saying she has responsibilities as a schoolteacher, so Jack's roadie friend Rocky (Joel Fry) travels with him instead. After the gig, Jack is signed by Sheeran's agent, Debra Hammer (Kate McKinnon), and rises to global fame performing all songs he has recalled by The Beatles. At a party in Jack's home, Ellie confesses that she has always been in love with him. Hoping to trigger more memories of Beatles songs, Jack travels back to the UK to their hometown of Liverpool, visiting landmarks such as Strawberry Field, Penny Lane, and the grave of Eleanor Rigby. Jack gets drunk, spends the evening with Ellie and they kiss, but she tells him she does not want a one-night stand. The next morning, Jack and Rocky pursue Ellie to Liverpool train station, but Ellie reminds Jack he has to choose between her and his career. Jack is heartbroken and almost forced into returning to Los Angeles. The record label prepares to launch Jack's debut album, but they reject his suggestions for titles, taken from Beatles records (such as Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, and The White Album), they name the album One Man Only, pushing his talent. Jack persuades his label to launch the album with a performance in Gorleston. Backstage, Jack is approached by two stranger, Liverpudlian Liz (Sarah Lancashire) and Russian Leo (Justin Edwards), they remember The Beatles, which is a huge relief to Jack. They tell him they know he plagiarised the songs; but they thank him, they feared the music of The Beatles had gone forever. They give him the address of John Lennon (Robert Carlyle), who has lived into old age, he gives Jack the advice to chase the one he loves and to always tell the truth. Ed Sheeran arranges for Jack to perform at Wembley Stadium. Jack confesses to the crowd that he did not write the songs, they were created by John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Ringo Star, and George Harrison, and he has Rocky upload the songs free to the internet, sabotaging the record release. He also finally tells Ellie that he loves her, they later marry and have a family together, and Jack becomes a music teacher. Also starring Sophia Di Martino as Carol, Meera Syal as Sheila Malik, Sanjeev Bhaskar as Jed Malik, and James Corden as himself. Featuring many great Beatles songs, including ""Yesterday"", ""Let It Be"", ""Here Comes the Sun"", ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", ""Yellow Submarine"", and ""Hey Jude"" (which plays in full in the end credits) (the movie version is titled ""Hey Dude""). Malik has changed significantly since being geeky Tamwar Masood in EastEnders, he gives a terrific performance as the struggling musician who becomes world famous when the whole world has forgotten about the most influential band of all time, James is likeable as his supportive friend and one true love who he is losing in the process, and Sheeran playing himself is splendidly funny and self-deprecating. It is a very clever concept, and you absolutely go with it, it is a good opportunity to celebrate great music, and really makes you realise that the world would be completely different without something, it is funny with a witty script, and it is a sweet love story, a really likeable jukebox musical romantic comedy. Very good!"

Such is what's depicted and what he eventually does with that knowledge. Other culturally relevant things are also non-existant in the world depicted but anyway, I found this quite funny and a little touching and very entertaining concerning the classic Beatles songs performed during the whole thing.

As another movie which was inspired by legendary musicians, Yesterday is a breath of fresh air, unlike Bohemian Rhapsody and Rocketman, this is not a biography, it's a very cute love story, carefully unfolded, with elements of fantasy and the Beatles music. Nice little twists along the way, with a truly moving ending.

Despite the constant optimism and support of his friend Ellie (Lily James) he decides to pack it all in, that's until a worldwide blackout and a freak accident put him on a collision course with superstardom.<br/><br/>The movie shows the at times comical reactions of friends and family as they hear The Beatles songs for the first time. The movie will be sure to take the viewers young and old back to a time where they too heard Beatles songs for the first time.<br/><br/>I took a while to get an understanding of the angle they were coming at in portraying the central character, finding him somewhat aloof or distant, but as the film progressed I was sold on this 'everyday' man and championed him as he remained aloof even around the corporate suits and music industry leeches.<br/><br/>The movie hit the mark, there were only a few criticisms, the role of Jacks manager played by Kate McKinnon was overcooked a bit but to be honest with how cut throat the industry is today you can see how there could be some half truths there. There were a few scenes where a little more care and not rushing the dialogue would have really allowed for some great moments that I felt were lost.<br/><br/>There is a touching scene towards the end that for some reason really moved me, I won't spoil it but let's just say when the door opens and Jack is let into this characters world for just a brief moment it really rounds out the movie for me.<br/><br/>Special mention goes to Joel Fry's take on the character in the movie called Rocky, honestly take a bow, he owned it.<br/><br/>Is it perfect, no, but the movie helps us realise the role music has played in all our lives, we could all create a soundtrack to our lives and I guarantee you for most of us that little band called The Beatles would be somewhere on that soundtrack, remember them?"

The hostess is really beautiful ~ Many people don't understand the emotional lines in the drama. I think this is to tell the audience to be loyal to themselves and to their love. Seeing them punching cards in Liverpool, I thought of myself who was chasing the Seventh Park and Ziqiang Tunnel. Even if the world is worse, do we still have music?

Now, not everything needs to be spelled out in movies but literally nothing is explained at all here and it's the central conceit of the movie. There's also this idea that suddenly injecting the Beatles into the modern climate would springboard someone from wannabe to music's Jesus, which I just don't think is realistic.<br/><br/>What we're left with is a fun, charming movie... That doesn't even try to make any sense. It's definitely enjoyable, it feels like there could have been something more though. Definitely a recommend though if you can catch it streaming somewhere."

","One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Yes, the boy-loses-girl theme is old hat, but the original concept of the movie is excellent. Spoiler - there are NO explosions, or super hero's, or cops or drug kingpins, or terrorists - it's just a fun, original movie with GREAT music. Himesh Patel does all his own singing and playing of the greatest rock music ever, the music of the Beatles. Kate McKinnon plays the ultimate smarmy L.A. music agent. There is an incredible, heartwarming moment near the end. Wait for it. It's so beautiful."

I enjoyed it, and it was so sweet I actually feel kinda bad for saying anything negative about it. But I've never seen a movie before during which I second-guessed the writing choices so often and so vigorously.<br/><br/>The first half is very well-done. Everything leading up to the point that Jack goes to L.A. to make his record is quite on-point and really builds the excitement for the second half. I was giddy as a little girl at Disneyland when I THOUGHT I realized where the movie was heading. When Jack was in his room assembling all those Beatles songs from memory, I wanted to shout the lyrics at him through the screen so we could move on to the shining, wonderful second half, in which Jack Malik becomes the greatest musical superstar in history and has amazing adventures.<br/><br/>But it comes on you slowly. You're watching, and waiting, and then you suddenly realize - ""Oh. They're doing this instead.""<br/><br/>I'm giving it 7 stars because I love the Beatles and I liked the movie.

To me, if I dare say, it as maybe even better...<br/><br/>Later on I saw the so-called missing or deleted scene: ' 'Something' on the James Corden Show' on YouTube and I was devastated.

Lily James' character was a bit more girl-next-door than was absolutely necessary, but she is a joy to watch in that role, nonetheless.

","It's a story that has been written into fanfiction before, but here we have it on screen. I loved the main story but the romance felt shoehorned. The actors had no chemistry and the romance came out of left field and was too large a part of the story. Some things were also left unanswered (Coke, cigarettes...). Overall, a great idea that's been had before, and executed well and with beautiful cinematography and music, but with a romance I just didn't care about."

","All of the characters are very like-able. As a viewer, you instantly want Jack Malik to succeed in his dreams of being a musician. The music is amazing and they stayed true to how the songs sound originally, which most people will like.
Though she's not in the film long, Kate McKinnon is a comedy powerhouse, as always. Ed Sheeran adds the star power the movie needs to seem like real-life. The movie is quick paced and has a happy, uplifting tone throughout. Yesterday is both a great tribute to the Beatles and also a cute rom-com."

","As someone who has been a Beatles fan for over 55 years, I thought this would be a cute concept. If nothing else, the music would sell it. I was wrong. The main character is not appealing at all. He's a loser who can only make something of himself by willingly stealing something he knows isn't his, even if no one else knows it. The sad thing is that, even after he steals fame, he's still a loser in his life. What kind of movie takes the amazing Kate McKinnon and makes her uninteresting? The way he reaches his ""epiphany"" is just plain painful. This is one that should be missed. The ending doesn't save it, neither does the music."
"PeteThePrimate","8","1","2","8 December 2019"," All you need is love.....
","...and a great soundtrack. The music is excellent, it's great to hear a refresh of the Beatles songs and Himesh does them very well. The storyline is well written and pretty straightforward and each character has some depth to it. I took it as a satire on today's music industry where the songs are secondary whilst profit, image and marketing are paramount and how it's hard for an upcoming artist to kick back against that. Take it for what it is, go along and enjoy a great 2 hours cinema."

","I was really looking forward to this movie. The premise was novel, the cast seemed interesting enough. But throughout the movie I was mostly bored.
I found it difficult to care about any of the characters. I do not blame the actors (except Ed Sheeran, he should stick to singing). Problem was the script and the directing in general. Even the covers of Beatles' songs were bland. Only stronger moment was meeting with old John Lennon.
If you liked Slumdog millionaire (I didn't, for practically the same reasons) you might like this one. Otherwise feel free to skip this, you will not miss anything."

"ian-07323","5","1","2","18 November 2019"," Close, but no cigar!
","One of those fantastic ""what if"" scenarios played out against the backdrop of a Richard Curtis romcom. Not long enough to really go into the ripples of what the world would be like without things and some of the missing things from life are a little odd, but hey, it's a romcom, switch off, sit back and enjoy. Well, I would have had it not been for one major thing. The lead actor was not very likeable (before or after revelations) and therefore difficult to get behind and want things to work out for them (which is an essential part of any romcom) This then, instead of sucking you into another world for a couple of hours, actually makes you realise you're watching a movie and that things don;t really make sense. If the guy is not likeable, then why is the female lead (well played by Lilly James) so enamoured with him? That aside, it was a well paced, funny in parts, Richard Curtis romcom based on a funny premise, had the character been written better, I think it would merit at least a 7 and maybe an 8, but you can;t win them all!!"
"armstrongd_uk","3","1","2","16 November 2019"," Disappointing - preposterous scenario
","As a huge Beatles fan, I really wanted to love this film, but ended up not even liking it. Not only was the basic premise of the collective consciousness of such a globally familiar band and creative force suddenly being erased always going to be too much to swallow, but there was such an absence of chemistry among the leading actors that you didn't really care what happened anyway. The key scene where Ed Sheeran was allegedly humbled by hearing the Long and Winding Road just felt embarrassingly contrived.
Simply left me with the feeling I had fallen prey to clever branding by association with the emotive appeal of a topic I genuinely love.
Not recommended."
"algemom","8","1","2","13 November 2019"," Continues to Grow on Me
","I liked this movie when I saw it in the theatres, have purchased it, and it continues to grow on me. It is not a movie about the Beatles, though their music and the love we all have for it is part of the movie. It is a movie about a man's journey through the pitfalls of wanting to be successful and loved, and how he finds his way through it. Himesh Patel is charming, I like his performances of the music, and I think he does a great job of portraying this journey. The ending is sweet, fulfilling, and joyful.

","I don't know if this is a great film or if it's just the great songs, but it's very good. Yes it's pretty silly, in a cheesy romcom fashion, but it's fantasy, pure indulgent fantasy and boy is it fun. Jack gets hit by a bus during a 12 second worldwide blackout. It's not explained why, that's not the point, let's not get technical, it's fantasy remember. When he comes around in hospital, no one remembers The Beatles, no one except our struggling musician hero. It's a bit random, but stick with it. Himesh Patel it has to be said does play and sing beautifully and for all the charm of this film, the highlights are clearly the musical interludes. That's not to say there's little else here, the cast is pretty impeccable and as instantly lovable as the songs. We get a few little jokes about Oasis and Coca-Cola not existing either and bit part Joel Fry threatens to steal the show on several occasions. Ed Sheeran's fairly lengthy and reoccurring cameo is... well it's cringey really, but still quite amusing. If only for the fact it highlights just how whimsically crap his music is. Alright putting him up against The Beatles is a touch unfair and he's clearly having fun with it himself, having 'Shape of You' as his ringtone when Jack calls him. Of course the elephant in the room is that Jack's rich seam of songwriting is all built on a lie. It all starts with a rollercoaster of excitement as Jack realises that fame and fortune are his, as long as he can remember all the words and figure out the chords. But as things begin to snowball and he's schmoozed by intentionally repulsive American record executives, Jack moves further away from himself, his home and most notably Ellie, his friend, original manager and painfully obvious love interest. It's all very sweet, quite generic and predicable with its happy ending, but it is entertaining and damn those songs are good!"

","The premise of the movie can't be knocked. I actually enjoyed the movie and took it for what I believe it to be... A Light hearted comedy with a love story thrown in and some of the best songs to have ever been written (or not as the case seems to be).<br/><br/>If I had woken up to be part of the madness that the main character finds himself in, then there are a lot more questions I would have had, and asked. However if you just sit down on a Sunday evening, stick the movie on and take it for what it is, don't take it too seriously and actually enjoy the movie and it's many holes, then the movie ain't bad.<br/><br/>Give it a watch - it's not Danny Boyle's best, but it's not is worst either..."

There's some great lessons yo be had as well, like the importance of always telling the truth, as told by a very surprising person. If only true this scene happened in real life.<br/><br/>Even if you only have a passing interest in the Beatles, give this movie a go. The lead is amazing, as is all the cast.

","Comedy movies these days seem to contain laughs that are few and far between. Often the best or only laughs are shown in the trailer and the rest is strung together by an uninteresting story. So last year sometime when we laughed all the way through the trailer for Yesterday, we hoped that the movie would deliver on those laughs.<br/><br/>It. Does.<br/><br/>By a long way the funniest movie I've seen all year, Yesterday is a really good time.<br/><br/>Here is the set up:<br/><br/>""Jack Malik is a struggling singer-songwriter in an English seaside town whose dreams of fame are rapidly fading, despite the fierce devotion and support of his childhood best friend, Ellie. After a freak bus accident during a mysterious global blackout, Jack wakes up to discover that he's the only person on Earth who can remember The Beatles.""<br/><br/>It's a pretty cool idea and I reckon they did a great job executing it. We were laughing out loud all the way through, and the chemistry between the British cast is great. The skeleton of the story is fairly standard for a rom-com style movie, but the setup of the movie and the main characters journey of figuring out what's up and then capitalising on his discovery give rise to some great philosophical questions. There is a lot jammed into the two hour runtime and it felt like there was never a dull moment.<br/><br/>The music of the Beatles is used to great effect all the way through, and if the final couple of minutes don't make you smile and get your foot tapping, then you have a cold dead heart.<br/><br/>All up it's a fun, lighthearted film, not too deep, but with plenty laughs."

I simply loved the handling of the whole subject, including all the nods and winks back to the original fab four, and although the plot is quite light and see-through and maybe doesn't fulfill everyone's expectations, it certainly fulfilled mine including a lump in the throat moment towards the end (and I'm a tough cookie when it comes to films) I will be buying the DVD for a re-run.

","Yesterday has a terrific premise: a failed musician wakes up one morning to discover that no one but him remembers The Beatles (or, for that matter, Coca-Cola). Realizing that he is sitting on a trove containing some of the greatest pop songs ever written, he passes them off as his own and heads towards stardom.<br/><br/>There's not a lot of story to this, but what there is flows along breezily, keeping you interested in what's coming next. It's a light, old-fashioned, feel-good fantasy comedy that is pretty much exactly what I was hoping for after seeing the trailer.<br/><br/>While I am able to suspend disbelief over the whole no-Beatles thing, I find the relationship between the singer and his manager less believable. For it to work out as he did he would have had to be far stupider and more awkward than he was. It's not a huge thing, but it does bug me.<br/><br/>(The idea that having a lot of brilliant songs is enough to make you succeed in music is also a bit doubtful, but I'll let that one slide.)<br/><br/>The cast is excellent. Himesh Patel has a nice voice, Lily James is charming, and Kate McKinnon brings her usual comic intensity to the role of a snarky manager.<br/><br/>Also, it's got a ton of really nice Beatles covers."
"rjkeenan-48553","10","1","2","13 October 2019"," Movie for Musicians
","I noticed a lot of negative reviews and didn't get it. But, my wife thought it was okay and I thought it was great. I think the difference of opinion is that I'm a musician and producer. There are a lot of jokes and situations in this movie that will fall flat for those that aren't musicians. Things such as pausing recording during a train rolling by, people ignoring you when you're performing amazing songs, or family and friends talking and being preoccupied while you're performing a masterpiece- these are pretty accurate frustrations for musicians that are also pretty funny.<br/><br/>Jack, the lead, isn't the best songwriter but he is a good guy, music lover and idealist. What makes him the perfect vehicle for introducing Beatles music to the world is that he simply loves and admires great music so much, which is also the same reason for his frustrations- some people just don't get how intensely some feel about music, just like some don't get this movie. Ed Sheeran probably wasn't necessary, and him calling himself the greatest songwriter until Jack came along is ridiculous, especially in a movie made for musicians- he's only admired by people that no nothing about music, but even be had a few funny moments in the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, the whole movie is a vehicle to pay homage to the Beatles, music lovers and idealists. It performs very well in managing to pay respect in those regards. It is definitely a Danny Boyle movie, which are told in an innocent, simplistic and idealistic manner, which can seem oversimplified but also make the movie endearing. If you love the Beatles or are a musician, check this out - otherwise, there's probably another Fast and Furious out. You can bang your head against the wall while watching those gems."

I thought this one looked pretty interesting when I first saw the trailer and I was right.<br/><br/>As it turns out, my husband and I both really enjoyed this movie. It is a fabulous break from the reality of this world, it has excellent music (as you might imagine), and the love story is very nice with only a couple of those roll your eyes moments where you want to yell at the characters to just stop being stupid and spit it out!<br/><br/>I think we were somewhat worried that the whole thing would just implode due to Jack being found out, but that didn't really happen. While it wasn't a rock and roll ending, it was a good ending.<br/><br/>This is definitely a movie you could watch with your family. I don't think there was anything that would have embarrassed me in front if my parents - although I think my dad will be really picky about the tempo of Help!<br/><br/>I'd give this an 8.5 if that were an option and I may change my rating to a 9 because I liked it that much.

"briancseel","7","1","2","3 October 2019"," A Beatles Movie That Isn't Really About The Beatles
","Let's start with what this movie is not. If you saw the previews you like think, as I did, that you are signing up for an homage to The Beatles or Danny Boyle finding a clever way to make a fanboy film. It is not. The Beatles, and their music, are used as a prop. Central to the film, yes, but a prop.<br/><br/>
What Boyle has really made is a film that asks the essential question, given our dulled sensitivities, our distracted culture, our need to take everything creative and process it into something that can be marketed to their broadest possible audience to make the most money, if someone made great art today would we even recognize it?<br/><br/>Here is where The Beatles come in. Jack Malik wakes up in a world where no one has heard of The Beatles. Motivated largely by his desire to be a famous musician and to a lesser degree by a righteous indignance that those around him have not heard these great songs Malik sets out to recreate The Beatles greatest hits.<br/><br/>Like any true genius (even if the genius is stolen in this case), Malik is not instantly recognized and the reaction to his new songs is comical but rings true in a culture where it feels like we don't recognize or appreciate great art anymore.<br/><br/>Eventually the power of the songs wins out, however, and Malik is discovered by the record industry who descend on him to market his surefire hits. Unfortunately this is where the film goes a bit over the top as, no doubt in order to appeal to a U.S. audience, Kate McKinnon (of the unfunny era of SNL) was cast as the American record exec and allowed to play the part in over the top, American fashion, in what is otherwise a British comedy. It doesn't work comedically, comes across as heavy-handed, and the excess is hardly needed to make the point about how the modern music industry works.<br/><br/>Running throughout the film is the thread of a romantic comedy as Jack is accompanied on his adventures by his lifelong best-friend (who has had a life-long crush on him) Ellie, played by a mature Lily James.<br/><br/>If there is one criticism it would be that the film is of multiple minds. It starts off posing the deep question of whether we would truly recognize great art anymore, moves into satire of the music industry, dabbles in Rom-com and in one scene near the end meditates on the high cost of fame. A focus on any of these individual elements could have made for a more singularly focused and harder hitting film, but Yesterday is hardly the first movie to struggle with this.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is an enjoyable ride. A creative premise with comedy and a great turn by Ed Sheerhan playing himself. Definitely worth seeing and if you aren't a Beatles fan, no problem, it isn't really about The Beatles."

One of the parts that isn't realistic to me is how he came clean at the end. In our world, I don't think anyone would ever come clean like that if something like this ever happened.<br/><br/>Also, if they're going to have the main character go visit Lennon, why not put the band members that are alive in the movie too or at least have actors impersonate them.<br/><br/>Small nitpicks but just observations."

"proud_luddite","7","1","2","30 September 2019"," An enjpoyable what-if
","Jack Malik (Himesh Patel) is a young, struggling singer/songwriter living in Lowestoft, England. Just as he is ready to give up on his musical aspirations, a world freak accident occurs which eliminates the entire history of the music of The Beatles; that is for everyone except Jack, apparently. In response, he uses his memory to ""write"" The Beatles' hits, performs them, and becomes a star.<br/><br/>The film begins with some terrible music gigs that are funny in their truthful depiction of star-wannabe purgatory. It then morphs into a fascinating ""what if"" scenario that could also be a dystopia to many.<br/><br/>The fantasy is the best part of the story which is sadly weakened by an unrequited romance between Jack and his childhood friend and music manager, Ellie Appleton (Lily James). Occasional dollops of schlock and schmaltz in this area lower the overall quality of the film.<br/><br/>But ""Yesterday"" has more pluses than minuses. Patel has a sweet, innocent likeability overall and James is fine as the leading lady. A couple of supporting performances add to the comedy element. As Jack's right-hand man Rocky, Joel Fry has some great moments as an oaf often out of place. And Kate McKinnon is bang-on as a Hollywood showbiz shark, Debra Hammer. In one scene, she is making her nastiest comments while doing perfect poses in yoga and Pilates while wearing (presumably) designer yoga clothing. This scene seems to be a not-so-subtle jab against a certain North American archetype. Anyone who has ever had the misfortune of encountering this archetype would have a good snicker at this scene. The jabs against shallow, Hollywood, showbiz types are further extended into a surreal boardroom scene.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Yesterday"" has a theme of ""what price, fame"". This is best depicted in a sublime scene that takes place in an isolated seaside home in the film's second half. (No spoilers here!) This scene, which could easily jerk tears, plus others carry the film's message quite sweetly and enjoyably."

"Sunsphxsuns","7","1","2","29 September 2019"," CAN YESTERDAY BECOME TOMORROW?
","What happens when a sudden global blackout occurs, and when it is over, only one person in the world, a struggling musician, can remember the music and legacy of The Beatles? That is the premise of Yesterday (2019), a light-hearted, and often engaging film.<br/><br/>Having recently screened this movie, I can see why a LOT of people have enjoyed Yesterday. The diverse cast is wonderful, with Himesh Patel (Jack Mailik, a musician and the only person to remember the Beatles), Lily James (Ellie Appleton, Jack's love interest and dedicated supporter), Ed Sheehan (attractively playing himself), and Kate McKinnon, a SNL Alum, who plays a instantly unlikable and darkly hilarious music executive (Debra Hammer).<br/><br/>The music carried much of the story, and the overall science fiction/fantasy/dramatic concept was intriguing. The film never bothers to explain how the worldwide blackout and new timeline occurred. But maybe that's OK. After all, this is a film, and not real life, right? It's still a clever script, and well executed by Patel, who apparently did his own singing and guitar/piano playing on the soundtrack.<br/><br/>To be clear, I enjoyed this film, and as much as I appreciated the interesting premise, portions of it troubled me.<br/><br/>I'm somewhat of a Beatles purist, and from this standpoint, I've always believed that an unprecedented ""perfect storm of events"" had to occur in strict order for The Beatles to have ever existed as a band. There are so many twists and turns in Beatle history it is quite staggering. Also, the film presupposes that Beatle songs would have been ""massive hits"" no matter who performed them. Historically, Beatle fans evolved organically. We grew with them culturally as their music and styles changed. Even if you weren't a Beatle fan, you would still recognize that there was an enormous artistic leap from sweet, beguiling songs like ""She Loves You"" when compared to the pre-Metallic, more visceral ""Helter Skelter."" Can you imagine listening to ""Why Don't We Do It In The Road"" in a different time and place, and then thinking, ""What a great song?"" I don't think so. Yet, when composed and performed by the Beatles (actually only McCartney and Starr were involved in the recording) we gladly accept it as we enthusiastically accept the rest of the songs on the Beatles White Album.<br/><br/>Here are a few examples to describe the sheer complexity of the Beatles phenomenon, and why it is improbable that most Beatle songs would be popular no matter who performed them, even in a thoughtful and sensitive film like Yesterday.<br/><br/>Example #1: When Paul's mother, Mary (Yep, the same ""Mother Mary"" mentioned in the iconic Beatle/McCartney tune, Let It Be), accepted a new job as a nurse, the McCartney family had to move to another property closer to her hospital. When this happened, Paul was forced to take a different bus line to get to school. The bus line he took just happened to be driven by George Harrison's father, who used to let George ride for free. During one such ride, Paul went to sit ""upstairs"" to ""have a smoke,"" and there he met a young George Harrison, already smoking, and, to McCartney's delight, was capably playing an old acoustic guitar. Thereafter, each school day, Paul and George would ride atop the same bus to school, and home again, smoking ""ciggies"" and singing the few tunes they both knew. Eventually Paul met John Lennon who invited him into his Skiffle band. Soon afterwards, McCartney convinced Harrison to audition for John's group. With 75% of the Beatles in place, it was just a matter of replacing Pete Best with the more likable Ringo Starr, whom John, Paul and George already knew from sharing the stage with another Liverpool group, Rory Storm and The Hurricanes.<br/><br/>Example #2: Brian Epstein had once attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, but soon realized he didn't enjoy being a student. Epstein's father put his son in charge of the record department in the family's NEMS music store on Great Charlotte Street in Liverpool. Epstein had learned about The Beatles from reading Mersey Beat, and also from a female fan of the band who had asked Brian if he had any Beatle records that she could purchase. Intrigued, Brian cautiously ventured into the Cavern Club to see what she was talking about. What he saw was a scruffy bunch of local Liverpool ""lads who looked dirty, acted rude, and seemed very unpolished."" But they had a raw energy that excited him. Brian soon became their manager, and through his theatrical experiences, as well as his flamboyant lifestyle, he ""put the boys in nice suits,"" ""made them pretty,"" and insisted that they ""bow after every song."" A different manager may have ignored the early Beatles, or tried to mold them differently. Epstein, with his love of theater and fashion, understood what needed to be done in order to transform his ""wonderful boys"" into a viable pop act worthy of a recording contract.<br/><br/>Example #3: Producer George Martin was given the assignment of recording the Beatles as a ""punishment"" by EMI. The company mistakenly held the belief that ""guitar groups were a passing faze."" Martin, who had previously produced comedy albums for people like Peter Sellers and The Goons, or helped to compose orchestral arrangements, had never been in charge of anything quite like The Beatles. Martin's sense of humor and open mindedness would turn out to be a perfect fit for Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr. Martin was surprisingly open to trying new ideas in the studio, and perfectly adept to ""translate"" into recordings any of the edgy ideas and contrivances that the young and creative group were persistently eager to explore. Any other producer would not have been able to properly produce and polish the works of Lennon and McCartney. This was the 1960's, a time when draconian recording engineers were autocratic, stuffy fellows, who wore white lab coats with black ties. Artists were not allowed to enter the engineering sound room. Martin and the Beatles would forever change how artists and producers would join forces to produce quality records.<br/><br/>For me to truly enjoy this film, I had to actually ""forget"" what I knew about The Beatles and their rise to becoming the world's greatest rock and roll band. I had to ignore the actual history and mechanics of how delicate and complicated the events were that eventually made the Beatles so profound and unique. It wasn't just the music that made the Beatles great. When I suspended my own sense of reality, it allowed me to enjoy the film for what it was: A great romp into a fantasy world where the Beatles were only remembered by one human being, and that person's decision to exploit that memory in order to help his own failing career made for a very interesting cinematic journey."

"neonhannity","7","1","2","26 September 2019"," Great concept, alright execution
","Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoyed this film, despite its flaws. It sounded like such an awesome movie - a struggling musician wakes up to find he alone remembers The Beatles, and uses that to score fame. But, why? Why are The Beatles, among other things, no longer in existence? What did the blackout have to do with it? Why is it just Jack and 2 other random people who remember? Are there other things gone that other people remember and Jack doesn't? When Jack admits that he didn't write the songs, are the members of the band out there watching and thinking this dude's crazy to give them credit when they don't remember writing the songs either?<br/><br/>So many plot holes that could have and SHOULD have been addressed, but it all got pushed to the side to make way for another cliche romance. Enjoyable? Yes. But it could have been so much better.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is wonderful, of course, and Patel does a great job with it. The acting is also done well, and it's believable, so not a bad movie at all.<br/><br/>However, if you're going to turn a concept into a movie, make that movie about the concept, don't just use it as background for a basic love story that we've seen too many times.<br/><br/>In the end, Jack just accepts this new reality, and we're supposed to accept it as well. No questions, no answers. This is just how it is now. The end.<br/><br/>But I have so, so many questions. This movie could have been phenomenal, but instead it's just another movie. It's good, but not one I would consider a favorite by any means. Ill probably still buy it eventually, but I really wanted to love it a lot more than I do."

Although superficially showing the influence that the Beatles disappearance has had on the world, it's well worth watching, it's fun and a guaranteed nostalgic soundtrack.<br/><br/>Himesh Patel brings a very good acting, as a simple guy who just wants to sing and achieve his dream of being a successful artist. Lily James is also amazing on paper, I confess that at one point I expected more from her singing. Ed Sheeran has a small appearance, but it went very well. Kate McKinnon did not even look like the excellent comedian she's, managed to play the part of a serious and cool business woman very well. Joel Fry also did his part very well by making a guy more comical and ""failed"".<br/><br/>

The Beatles music is done very well and it was refreshing to hear the songs again.
My only qualm with this film is the fact that the director felt it necessary to put a character who was John Lennon in this film. The scene is totally misplaced and frankly, disconcerting.
The movie is thin on plot as 99% of all Rom-Coms are but is a entirely adequate date flick.

","I really enjoy the execution of an already fascinating idea of a world where the Beatles never existed. The route chosen by Richard Curtis, to intertwine the raise to fame of the protagonist with his friend/love relationship with his manager/best friend was a very smart decision that had a strong emotional impact in specific moments of the film. The visit to Lennon was impressive and moving. On a small side note, he had me in the climax when Ellie is shown in Wembley's screen, but then lost me when the protag decided to reveal his secret, as opposed to, first, confess his love to Ellie, which was what was driving that particular moment of the story. However it is, I really liked he film."
"vinsond21","6","1","2","28 August 2019"," Interesting concept but too ambitious in execution
","First, what i enjoyed most in this movie is Kate McKinnon's delightful performance as a ruthless agent. Hers stands out among generally decent performances from the rest of the cast, and deserves an Oscar nomination for supporting actress.
The movie as a whole is a pretty shameless piece of work, perhaps not unlike McKinnon's character Debra Hammer. While the concept is interesting, those behind it try to take on too much and end up spoiling everything. One is allowed to be far-fetched up to a point and beyond that, the whole premise falls apart.
One suspects the whole idea behind this project is to make money from songs by the Beatles. On a positive note, at least it may introduce some new fans to the body of work. However, Yesterday the song was not rendered well, and including Back in the USSR is totally out of place and meaningless.
On the whole, one would give the filmmakers the benefit of the doubt and believe that their nostalgic intentions are good. One just wishes that they were more restrained and just focused on the sweet love affair in the middle, without wrapping it with so much ribbons, glitter and confetti."

","This is a cute and harmless film, courtesy of Danny Boyle.<br/><br/>The story concerns an aspiring musician, Jack Malik (Hamish Patel) who is discouraged about his lack of career and decides to quit. As he's on his way home, there's a worldwide blackout for something like 12 seconds. Danny plows into a bus and winds up in the hospital.<br/><br/>He soon realizes that the blackout wiped out a few parts of our culture - cigarettes, Coca Cola, and the Beatles. Jack seems to be the only person in the world who remembers the Fab Four. He starts singing Beatles songs as his own creations and becomes an international star.<br/><br/>The story is about what we all have in common and what happens if it's taken away - we lose that little piece that keeps us linked. It's also about a nightmare suffered by famous actors, musicians, artists, and writers - what happens when people realize I'm a fake? Many famous people, when their work is appreciated, feel like frauds.<br/><br/>In Jack's case, of course, he is one. As he gets ready for his first album, all the people and success start to get to him. And it's causing him to lose his girlfriend (Lily James).<br/><br/>I think another point here is that if the Beatles hadn't existed, we would have had to invent them.

","Overall, this film was enjoyable but the filmmakers made a serious error by establishing that the members of the Beatles were real people. This presents two scenarios: 1. They formed the Beatles and the music would still be in existence. 2. They never formed the Beatles and never wrote the music so it would not exist, even in the memories of the lead character. Introducing John Lennon into the story completely derailed the story. Not sure if it was done as a mandate by Yoko Ono or just to establish nostalgia but it completely unraveled the premise of the film."

I hope they include the uncut version of the movie in the future DVD release as the movie characterizations felt a little thin without something to balance against Lily James.

What disappointed me was how little the film actually spends delving into a world without the Beatles. Instead, we mostly get a cliched romance story about childhood friends. There still is a lot of enjoyment to find in Yesterday though. The music is great, as expected, and the humor around missing elements of the world is always humorous. I only wish the filmmakers spent more time on the band themselves."

12A
director:Danny Boyle
Starring: Hamish Patel,Lily James,Ed Sheeran, Kate Mckinnon,Meera Syal,Harry Mitchell,Joel Fry and Sanjeev Bascar etc<br/><br/>overall rating 52/100<br/><br/>Yesterday did have its charm and toe tapping songs but did not connect with me due to many reasons lets talk about why this is.<br/><br/>Firstly i thought the plot clever and interesting to see. To have the world suddenly forget not just one of the most iconic bands of all time but so many different aspects to day to day life was very amusing to see. And bought out a few laughs as it was so ridiculous it just worked in places and it was something i had never seen before explored in this kind of way so this was fun.<br/><br/>However i do have to add that unfortunately most of the humour during the film for me fell flat which created a disconnect to the movie for me. A lot of the humour just felt very flat and old fashioned for me and it just lacked uniqueness to stand out from many more funny comedy films in todays film business. Often i felt disconnected to the film for this or was just sitting there awkwardly knowing i should be laughing but in reality i was not.<br/><br/>One thing that this film could not get wrong was its incredible soundtrack. All the songs despite me not listening to them outside the film i still mostly knew and the songs were elevated by Hamish Patels singing voice which made the songs even catchier to listen to. Despite Hamish Patel having some weaknesses which we will talk about in a minute i thought his singing voice really was good and fitted in well within the film.And his whole character arc of being a failing musician that nobody cared about was interesting as he found his fame from other peoples music.<br/><br/>However adding on from my previous paragraph unfortunately Hamish Patels acting was not particularly great and he felt out of the place during the film. This is not good considering he is the main star of this film. You could just tell during the film his lack of acting experience due to him not being able to emote or show his emotions as strongly as other actors within the film such as Lily James and Kate Mckinnon. He was just very awkward to watch and he acted like he did not know what he was going to say throughout the film so he was often standing there awkwardly.<br/><br/>However apart from the previous negative the film was filled with some solidly good acting performances and cameos. The main stars for me here was Lily James and Kate Mckinnon. Lily james really suited this type of role. You could really tell her pain throughout the whole film with wanting to be with Jack and when they finally got together at the end of the film it really made you root for her character she actually reminded me a bit of kate winslet which is a big compliment. And secondly Kate Mckinnon is fantastic in whatever role she is in. She just has my type of comedy and humour which makes me love whatever character she plays and Yesterday was no different. Playing the cocky and powerful manager who portrayed the brutal reality of celebrity life. Also the film had a great cameo role for Ed sheeran and he actually had a fairly big part in the film which was a pleasant surprise. However i thought the John Lennon cameo was stupid and did not make sense. To have someone who has sadly passed away to have a cameo just for shock factor is a bit of a cheap way to buy tickets.<br/><br/>And finally the film had excellent narrative character development between Hamish Patel and Lily jameses character. To see there relationship blossom from friends and her being his manager to potential lovers and then drifted apart really took you on a rollercoaster journey throughout the film as everyone wanted the end result to be them being together which was satisfyingly achieved at the end.<br/><br/>However unfortunately ending on my last two negatives, i thought the execution and thought process behind the main plot point was very odd. To have a mass blackout and the main character to just hit his head i thought was a lazy way of introducing the main plot of everyone not remembering the beatles. I liked the idea of the plot but not how it was executed as i felt it could of been done in a more creative way. And finally the film had incredibly slow pacing. If i am being honest it was very difficult to remain interested in the film due to the lack of entertainment value. It picked up whenever a song or drama was introduced but it just needed a bit more depth and interesting plot points to really keep me interested.<br/><br/>Overall Yesterday did have some heart a great soundtrack and some good performances. But it felt like a clever plot with poor execution and left me feeling very disappointed when leaving the cinema due to its failure to be as good as it could of been."

","Have you ever seen a movie that you thought was good, but left the theater disappointed, because you knew deep down in your heart it could have been great? That's how I felt after seeing Yesterday. I remember seeing the previews on TV and thinking ""wow, what an original and interesting movie!"" I hardly go to the theater anymore because I'm so sick and tired of superhero movies, sequels and remakes, so seeing an idea that seemed unique and different really grabbed my interested. I liked it, but with the right writer and director it could have been heralded like Groundhog Day.<br/><br/>Jack Malik works as a teacher while moonlighting as a struggling musician. He is supported by his longtime childhood friend Ellie Appleton, who, as you expect, harbors a crush on him. One day, after another underwhelming performance, Malik is hit by a bus while biking home. He wakes up, bandaged and a couple of teeth missing, in a new timeline where the Beatles don't exist. Using his knowledge of their catalog, he begins using the songs to help advance his music career to levels he never thought possible before.<br/><br/>This is a brilliant concept that should result in an outstanding movie. In fact, if you look up the original story/screenplay, you see that this was a somewhat dark, complex story. However, Hollywood, as usual, got in the way, with Richard Curtis rewriting the story into a predictable rom com.<br/><br/>The Beatles had no creative input in this film outside of approving of their music being used, and it shows. It seems in fact that a traditional rom com movie was written, and the Beatles part was slapped onto it. This alternative timeline could of and should of been further investigated. Why did it happen? How many people were involved? What else in history has changed? In fact, you could go down a very deep rabbit hole and ask even more questions. If the Beatles never existed and neither did Oasis, does Jack still like music? Maybe he could have woken up and have no interest or ability in music, which then could have changed the type of friendship he has with Ellie, who fell in love with him while watching him perform. Maybe the British Invasion never ended up happening, so bands like The Who, Led Zeppelin and Queen never became a thing. Or maybe rock never took off like it did and standards performed by Michael Buble, Josh Groban, Norah Jones and Diana Krall top the charts. There was so much that could have been explored and that could have made a much more interesting movie.<br/><br/>The problem is the movie, as it progresses, actually gets worse. The relationship between Jack and Ellie has no rhythm to it. It's up, down and I just don't care. And seriously, if two other people in this ""new timeline"" know of The Beatles, who else does? And I'm sure there are others who aren't as kind or understanding to what Jack is doing, and would blackmail/exploit him for the highest dollar possible. To top it off, there is a scene towards the end of the movie where he meets one of the Beatles that is so contrived, convoluted and almost insulting that I cringed. It alone almost tanked the movie for me.<br/><br/>So yes, a good, albeit predictable rom-com that is an enjoyable 90 minutes of entertainment that could have an excellent, renowned film if it was given a little more TLC."

","When I first saw the trailer for this film, I knew exactly what I was going to get: an enjoyable feel good movie reminiscent of the most influential music group of all time. It gives off a vibe similar to that of many Beatles songs, and in that aspect, it succeeds by all means. But when you tie in side characters and subplots that cloud the overall message of the film it seems a bit congested. What could have been a reflective example of the challenges of fame and fortune was sorely diluted by a forced love story and Margo Robbie's money eyes. It is hard not to like Yesterday having grown up on the music of the Beatles, but the potential originality of the film was not fully lived up to."

"allwork15","6","1","2","13 July 2019"," Wasted potential
","Like many people here, I'm a big Beatles. fan. However, the trailer didn't exactly blow me away, but it looked entertaining, so I gave it a watch. And I have to admit, I left the cinema feeling a little disappointed.<br/><br/>The plot focuses on Jack (Himesh Patel), a man working a dead-end job in a warehouse who is trying to hit it big as a musician. During an unexplained power cut, he ends up being hit by a bus, and wakes up to realise that the Beatles (as well as a few other odd things) never existed. Using this new found information, he decides to write down all the lyrics to the songs he can remember and pass them off as his own. He is discovered by Ed Sheeran's manager and soon becomes a huge star.<br/><br/>I can't emphasise this enough - this film could've been fantastic. It has so much potential. The Beatles played such a huge part in music history; they delved into so many genres from rock, country, psychedelic, blues...yet none of this was even really mentioned, aside from the musical covers and a few obvious references that even non-fans could understand. Instead, the film settled for a rather predictable romance between Jack and his ex-manager/best friend Ellie that, in all honesty, wasn't very interesting. The characters have their moments, but I felt like they lacked the charm and substance that could've made the romance more entertaining. The other characters as well are rather bland, I didn't remember much about them although I did like Jack's friend Rocky (played by Joel Fry) who Jack brings along as his roadie. In fact, I remember thinking whilst I was watching the film that Joel Fry would've been more suitable playing the main character instead of Himesh Patel.<br/><br/>The film wasn't that funny either. It had a few good jokes here and there - the Abbey Road debate, Oasis not existing - however, a lot of them seemed to fall flat and didn't really go anywhere. I don't remember the audience I was with laughing that much either so I don't think I'm alone with that opinion. Like I've said, the film had so much to work with and yet it was never really used to its potential. The writer's could've included a few funny digs at some of the songs (such as leaving Revolution 9 off the White Album. I'm sure even the biggest Beatles fans wouldn't complain about that) or poking fun at the psychedelic era Pepper costumes. Although in fact, I thought one of the biggest missed opportunities was with Ed Sheeran. His character could've had much more to do - they could have even made him a villain due to jealousy from being pushed out of the spotlight by a superior musician. If you're having an extended cameo by someone famous, at least give them some funny material to work with. But instead they settled for him admitting that Jack is a better musician and nothing is really done with it.<br/><br/>I don't think this was a bad film by any means, it had plenty of heart and some good moments. I think the best scene was when Jack goes to visit John Lennon and asks his age (Lennon replies, 'Seventy-eight'), which felt very touching and served as a bittersweet reminder of what could've been had the real Lennon not been killed in the 1980s. If the dramatic scenes had a little more substance such as this one, and a few more well-thought out jokes, I think this may have been a much more interesting film. Unfortunately, it settles for easy humour and a predictable romance. If you're looking for something lighthearted and safe then this is probably the film for you, but if you want something with a little more depth, I'd give it a miss."
"fallyhag","7","1","2","13 July 2019"," Another copy and paste storyline from Curtis.
","The characters are all well played and Lilly brings the pleasant sparkle. However, the story just goes from A to B relying on a few minor giggles without really trying to be creative or original. Yes it is entertaining. You will enjoy it. But a writer with so much experience cannot be allowed to keep getting away with such copy and paste nonsense. The story is entirely predictable and unoriginal. You watch and wait for something to take you by surprise but it just never comes. The character, the love interest, the conflict, the heartbreak, the reveal, the happy ending. So if you have a boring Sunday then this film is for you. You will laugh and smile. I recommend it as a film for fun but it isnt a keeper."

Every time I felt I knew what was going to happen next, the film flipped itself on its head and switched the script.<br/><br/>I thoroughly loved YESTERDAY, and most of this is owed to the acting, fairly developed characters and brilliantly stylised film making.
The director left his mark all over the film, and it was very charming as a result.
The most was made out of a modest budget and not once did I feel as if this was a cheaply made film.<br/><br/>There are excellent plot twists that don't feel cheap or unearned and the movie takes its concept to some places that haven't really been explored in media before.<br/><br/>This is a film that is worth viewing by both young and old, and is worth watching more than once."
"enochsneed","7","1","2","10 July 2019"," Entertaining if you don't think too hard
","The difficulty with imagining a world which never had The Beatles is - there was more to them than just the music. They were a cultural phenomenon as much as a musical one; ""All You Need Is Love"" crystallised the attitudes of an era, it wasn't just a song. A world without that would not simply be the same world as today without the song.<br/><br/>Well, this is a movie, it aims to entertain and it certainly does that. The songs are well presented, although again showing it was the chemistry of the four that really made them work - Jack and his backing band really can't do ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" like John, Paul, George and Ringo. On a personal note, the film has made family history because my wife: a) wanted to go to the cinema to see it, and; b) she actually enjoyed the experience. That makes about 5 cinema trips together in 32 years of marriage - how we ever got together I will never know (but I'm glad we did)."
"masonfisk","5","1","2","10 July 2019"," NOT QUITE THERE, NEEDED MORE TIME IN THE IDEA OVEN...!
","The latest from director Danny Boyle (28 Days Later/Slumdog Millionaire) & writer Richard Curtis (Four Weddings & a Funeral/Notting Hill) is a mind-bending treatise on the notion of sanctified memory (the music of the Beatles) existing in a world where they never existed except in the memory of a busking, struggling singer/songwriter who decides to take advantage of this scenario. An intriguing concept struggles to maintain its novelty throughout the run time since the follow through can't quite successfully hit its mark. Most audiences will be primed for seeing anything to do w/the Beatles but in this new world there is no fallout to admitting the truth to something that doesn't exist but that doesn't stop our lead from feeling guilty about his deception even though his conclusion feels one sided & hollow. Boyle does well by the material since some of his films have a bit of wonderment & whimsy laced in them & Curtis strolls his usual tropes (the bumbling best friend ala Notting, the one girl in his life he falls for cue Four Weddings) even mining his own About Time, which dealt w/memory & changes to timelines, to concoct this fantasy which does have a decent but undemanding ending even though we still feel things are off."

","Yesterday doesn't do a whole lot with its premise as I'd hoped, but it's pleasant and straightforward enough for a recommended viewing, especially for Beatles fans and aspiring musicians. The film's about a lowly musician who after an accident awakes to find the Beatles never existed and sings their songs to become famous. It's a laid back, cautionary tale on plagiarism and the pressures of fame and studies how much the music industry's perception and demands have changed since the golden age with the Beatles. It could've gone into more depth with its premise and it has its formulaic moments, but it gets its messages across regardless and the performances were charming enough to keep me captivated."

I also felt the parts of the searching on the internet for like ""Harry Potter"" or ""cigarette"" was a little unnecessary and could have been deleted from the movie (although I recognize it was there probably for a little humor).<br/><br/>If the movie had a little more focus on the songs rather than the love stories, the ""Hollywood"" drama and the ""in and out"" visions/reality of the main character; this movie would have been much better.

"rockman182","8","1","2","6 July 2019"," Yesterday (2019)
","And the award for the most brilliant idea for a film goes to: Yesterday. I went wild when I first heard about this film. Danny Boyle directing a movie about a brown guy who plays Beatles songs, in a world that has forgotten about the Beatles existence. Extraordinarily fun premise. I adore The Beatles, if it were lucrative to be a Beatles historian, that would be my dream job. I had such a blast with this film. It pays tribute to the greatest and most influential band ever and also serves up a charming love story.<br/><br/>The film is about a down out of luck musician who gets hit by a bus during a weird global occurrence where the world has a blackout. He soon finds out that the world inexplicably does not know of The Beatles, its members, or any of their music. Using this to his advantage, the protagonist named Jack Malik, uses the Beatles works as his own and eventually gains worldwide recognition as a renown artist. He must balance his new found superstardom and the feelings he has for his friend and former manager.<br/><br/>This is the film debut of Himesh Patel who is so good in this film. You get behind the characters plight and his story. He is a talented musician no doubt as his renditions of Beatles classics in the film are quite good. Richard Curtis's script and idea is quite great and innovative, despite it not being perfect. It doesn't always score but for the most part it does a great blend of music, drama, romance, and comedy. I like how clever it allows itself to be. If you're a fan of The Beatles like me and can catch every reference to the band and their songs its even better.<br/><br/>I think I'd be clinically depressed if I somehow forgot about the wonderful work of The Beatles and also knew I could never hear a song about them again. Their music is so important to me and I love that a film came out about a ""What if"" scenario for if everyone forgot The Beatles. At its core, its got a really cute and charming love story as well. I'm very much pleased with this film. I'm really down for seeing more of Himesh Patel and the ever expanding filmography of Danny Boyle.<br/><br/>8/10"

2) Why did nobody remember Oasis, cigarettes or Coke either?
3) How did this occur in the first place?
4) Where did all his records go?
Some part of the plot seemed a bit lazy to me. The premise of the film is interesting and the acting is brilliant but it could have done without the love story, that seemed a bit unnecessary and turned what could have been a wonderful film into a ""nice"" one. Again, the romance element was a little lazy and flimsy too"
"dfle3","8","1","2","5 July 2019"," I've a feeling Toto might not be able to tour in Kansas anymore. 75+
","As someone who regards The Beatles as the greatest pop-rock act of all time, the prospect of seeing a film which imagined a world in which they didn't exist but one in which somebody else gets to take the credit for their music was one which I found to be...appealing. Maybe there are some Beatles fans who feel the opposite way to me? In any case, I enjoyed this amusing film and would suggest that it would mostly appeal to people who are fans of romcoms and also fans of The Beatles, who don't take umbrage at other acts singing their songs. If you are unfamiliar with The Beatles, then, I'd say that this film will mostly be conceptual humour to you, as the jokes won't make sense many times if you don't know the band's lyrics or status in popular music.<br/><br/>The high-concept premise of the film has Jack Malik (played by Himesh Patel) as a wannabe singer-songwriter, who has an attractive manager in Ellie Appleton (played by Lily James) who believes in his talent. Jack regards Ellie as a friend and is oblivious to her romantic feelings for him. Jack's music 'career' is going nowhere, fast and he is ready to give up on his dream. As to be expected, cliché of clichés, a narrative event intervenes to turn things around. Having read a synopsis of the plot somewhere, I was expecting the kind of scenario found in the film""The wizard of Oz"".<br/><br/>As a result of a global 'weather' event, Jack is injured and wakes up in hospital to find that his Beatles allusions are being met with incomprehension (as such weather events are wont to do). Having proved to his own intellectual satisfaction later on that, yes, The Beatles are no longer a thing in his world, he is put into a very interesting position...he knows a lot of their music...what should he do with that knowledge?<br/><br/>After putting out some Beatles' songs in the public domain - not attributed to them, of course - Jack finds himself in the orbit of the non-fictional singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran (played by himself). Some reviews of this film note that Sheeran's own story parallels that of Jack's, in some ways (Himesh Patel would seem an unlikely choice to be the star in this kind of film). Jack finds himself in a position, subsequently, to try and achieve global stardom. A lot of amusing scenes are to be had with Jack's wannabe American manager, Debra Hammer (played by Kate McKinnon), who is...blunt (to put it kindly!).<br/><br/>Early on in the film, when Jack plays Beatles' songs before a crowd, there is indifference. This state of affairs isn't really explored as a possibility. Being a fan of The Beatles' music would lend itself to the view that this band's music is transcendent and universally ""great"". I would put myself in the position of most of the world's citizens in ""Yesterday"" as far Ed Sheeran goes. I can't say that I know the names of any of his songs although I could get lucky and be able to pick a song on the radio as being one of his...probably just the one song. What pushed my review of this film from 75/100 to 75+/100 (and hence receive a bump in my score from 7 stars out of 10 stars on this site to 8 stars...I don't round up otherwise) was hearing perhaps my favourite Beatles' song in its entirety during the closing credits. Looking behind me, I noticed that people were walking out of the cinema at this point and by the end of the song it was just me there, basically. I did find that sad, really. I'm normally one to stick around for the closing credits in any case (sometimes there are Easter eggs in them!). This experience maybe reflects on the premise of the film about the stature of The Beatles. Speaking of which, it did seem to me that their music was (or had) disappeared from commercial radio (""Classic Hits"" stations perhaps moving onto the next decade of music, as they did with the likes of Elvis Presley et al.). It's my impression that the TV documentary series ""The Beatles anthology"" revived their fortunes in this respect. That series saw the release of a 'new' song which I regarded as one of my favouring Beatles' songs ever, ""Real love"".<br/><br/>Whilst the high-concept of this film was a drawcard for me, I don't think that the authors/writer of this story (including Richard Curtis, who wrote the screenplay for the hit film ""Four weddings and a funeral"" which I enjoyed) have fully understood the ramifications of this concept. For instance, in the world in which Jack finds himself now, trying to attribute ownership of 'Jack's songs' to The Beatles could have the following consequences: Jack being viewed as insane or Jack as making the ultimate ""concept album"". The comedy might not flow from the first possibility but having thought of it afterwards, the latter possibility is something that I wish the authors/writer had thought to canvas! Also, for the film's dénouement, I did think that Jack might give Ed a gift, which would put Ed in an interesting position too! Basically, one issue that I have with this film was that it raises more questions than anything.<br/><br/>Now, to aspects of this film that I enjoyed:<br/><br/>* There are two people who form a 'strange couple' later on in the film, who Jack meets after a performance, I think. It wasn't clear to me how that would go, but I like what they did with this.<br/><br/>* One unexpected character is visited by Jack. Not sure how others will feel about this but it worked for me. Again, how does this relate to the film's concept?<br/><br/>* Amusing product placement-alternate reality facts.<br/><br/>* Liked impact on Sheeran of Jack's 'genius'.<br/><br/>* The trailer for this film seemed to have a scene which I didn't see in the film itself, namely, where Jack 'spontaneously' writes a song on a talk show and sings it to a female guest.<br/><br/>I've reviewed ""The Beatles: Eight days a week - The touring years"" here."

","This movie has a few interesting ideas. But overall it didn't WOW me. The film's success is largely an understanding of a reality the movie tries to paint as evil.

Also, after a while a lot similar kinds of jokes were recycled to a point where it wasn't fresh.<br/><br/>The actors were fine. The songs were performed nicely. I was annoyed that they never really explained why nearly everyone suddenly forgot and had no record or evidence of The Beatles, Coke, Harry Potter, cigarettes and a few other random things.<br/><br/>I liked what they did in imagining John Lennon surviving to the present day. Although the pathway to the main character meeting him seemed rather contrived.<br/><br/>Sadly, the story had a lot of love story cliches which made what I thought was an interesting Beatles sci-fi movie, into a chick flick romance. And not a good chick flick romance.<br/><br/>The film honestly feels like the work of a producer with a calculator rather than an artist making a brilliant work of art.<br/><br/>It isn't terrible. Producers usually know enough to make a product which will stay afloat. But it certainly isn't a movie I'll be recommend to my friends. Other band or musician movies of late have been much better. If you want a musician tribute movie, I'd recommend Rocketman, Bohemian Rhapsody, or Green Book instead."

With some nice stylistic choices by Danny Boyle, and a nice line in humour, a highly enjoyable use of a great catalogue of music and warm performances from MOST of the cast, I found myself grinning at much of it, with a few guffaws too, as though I was watching a Cute Kittens video or something.
The first half hour or so is really strong,.I thought it was heading to about a 8.5 rating...<br/><br/>NEGATIVES<br/><br/>Basically when Curtis tries far too much to make it a romantic comedy. You are there, laughing, or grinning, or.humming or singing...

But unfortunately, there's more... About I guess, on and off, half an hour more over all... And it's horrible, (and quite a number of things are said in this 'romance that just make one of the romantics seem almost unpleasant to me anyhow... It's really weird to be honest)<br/><br/>There's also a bit of storyline, involving an unpleasant character that was similarly clunky, and over done, but time wise this was not so bad, and I guess was needed for the story, but was badly done.<br/><br/>But overall I when I did enjoy it, I really did, it had some rather cool surprises and it is actually an interesting concept, and does make you think a little when it's at its best.<br/><br/>

","The Good:
In a cast made up primarily of caricatures and walking genre tropes Himesh Patel shines as an acting talent and musical performer. Without much to play against Patel plays the role of a conflicted and lovesick musician perfectly, and his often emotional renditions of the songs of The Fab Four help make up for the middling performances of the rest of the cast. While it's still not enough to lift this movie out of the disappointingly average place it finds itself if, it is refreshing to find a fresh face with real talent among bigger stars phoning it in.<br/><br/>The Bad:
Because the movie doesn't feature much of The Beatles catalog prominently, it relies heavily on the romantic storyline between Patel and James, and their chemistry. Unfortunately, their chemistry falls short, and is confused by early dialogue that suggests James is uninterested, and that their relationship, romantic or otherwise, has always been driven by her, not Patel. With their lackluster romance in place, the comic relief of McKinnon and Fry, and the reserved inclusion of Beatles songs performed by Patel just aren't enough to ensure the success based on reinvigorated nostalgia that is clearly the aim of the film.<br/><br/>The Ugly:
For a nostalgic look back at The Beatles catalog there is no better film in its execution than Across the Universe (Julie Taymor, 2007). As a jukebox musical it's pretty generic. But, for Beatles fans it puts the music and the history of the band at its center without complicating its sensibility by trying to tell a narrative so separate from the music that the audience is left wondering where the two meet. In fact, the close parallels between the romance between the main characters, and the personal and career trajectories of The Beatles enrich the story in a way that Yesterday's imagined narrative apparently separate from any influence of The Beatles could never achieve."
"AdrenalinDragon","6","1","2","2 July 2019"," Yesterday was Danny Boyle on an average day
","Yesterday certainly has that Danny Boyle style to it, but is the actual movie any good? Well, it's a mixed bag I'd say. The concept of being the only guy who remembers The Beatles and using that information to gain fame and success is great, but the movie just runs dry of what to do with its feature length running time and falls into predictable cliches and character moments that you see coming a mile away. It didn't feel like they knew exactly what to do with the concept and just went with a safe predictable path on how to conclude it all.<br/><br/>There's quite a bit of funny humour here and there and good use of music and shots thanks to Danny Boyle. I found some characters mildly irritating in
places and there were also alot of scenes in this movie that seemed like filler. It felt pretty long and probably could have been 30 minutes shorter easily. On a more positive note, the acting is very solid and there's definitely a unique British charm to the whole thing that makes it stand out from other mainstream movies. It's just a shame the story gets progressively worse as it goes along. Overall, I'd say Yesterday is still worth a watch, even if it might only seem average at best.<br/><br/>6/10"
"The-Sarkologist","7","1","2","1 July 2019"," Forgetting the Beatles
","So, imagine if you wake up one day and suddenly discover that nobody has ever heard of the Beatles (and Oasis for that matter). Well, that is what happens to the struggling musician Jack Malik (though it should be noted that there is a world wide black out at the exact same time as he is hit by a bus). Fortunately for Jack he happens to be a big Beatles fan, and he happens to remember quite a lot of their songs as well, so it seems like he has basically hit the jackpot.<br/><br/>Yeah, this film is one of those light hearted romantic comedies that basically explores the price of fame. The thing is with Jack is that he really wants to be a famous musician but his song writing skills are, well, not all that great. He does have this friend, Ellie, who has basically been in love with him since she saw him playing Wonderwall at school, and she is also his self styled manager. Not surprisingly Jack doesn't seem to actually notice that Ellie likes him.<br/><br/>Well, as it turns out, when he starts playing Beatles songs, songs that nobody has ever heard previously, a lot of people sit up and start to notice, one of them being the musician Ed Sheeran. Well, Ed invites him to open for him at a concert in Moscow, and what else are you going to play in Moscow but 'Back in the USSR'? Yeah, that raises even more eyebrows, and next thing he knows is that he is on his way to Los Angeles, and fame and fortune.<br/><br/>The interesting thing is that Ellie doesn't go with him. This is interesting because while she was more than happy to help him out while he was a struggling musician, when fame and fortune come their way, she suddenly decides that it is not for her. Obviously, and this comes out in the film, she wasn't so much doing it because she wanted Jack to become famous, but simply because she loved Jack and saw this as an opportunity to simply be around him.<br/><br/>Another thing is that it is never quite explained what happened to the Beatles, though the suggestion was that they simply never decided to make any music, or if they did, they made the choice that fame wasn't for them, and simply disappeared into the background to live quite and peaceful lives. This is the thing about this film, namely that it is about the value of the quiet and peaceful life, and that fame and fortune never actually bring the fulfillment that our world seems to suggest that it does.<br/><br/>Okay, there is the question about Jack plagerising the songs, but the reality is that if these songs where never written in the first place, then how could he actually plagerise them. Well, in a way he can't, because the songs were never written. The other thing that gets me is that the Beatles had much more of an influence on modern pop culture than just Oasis. Sure, Oasis sounded a lot like the Beatles, but the reality is that the Beatles literally defined the music of a generation, and beyond.<br/><br/>But, that is actually just a minor thing. Look, the idea is that the Beatles not existing is just a plot device to actually drive the movie, and to explore the relationship, and the pitfalls, of being famous. As the producer in the film says 'I don't care about his personal life, he is just a commodity to me'. Mind you, there are quite a few amusing aspects to this film as well, because the Beatles aren't the only thing that doesn't exist - Coca Cola doesn't either, and neither do cigarettes. While there are problems with the concept, you really do need to suspend your disbelief.<br/><br/>Look, I didn't consider this to be an outrageously funny movie, but it was a good movie nonetheless. And of course, you also get to hear quite a lot of Beatles songs as well."

"lawrencekaneshiro","7","2","7","1 July 2019"," Yesterday, NO Syfy Movie Here
","Imagine a world with no Coke, Oasis, Harry Potter, Cigarettes, and the Beatles. Ok, a world without cigarettes would be a good thing. This is exactly what Directory Danny Boyle was going for in his latest film ""Yesterday"" starring Himesh Patel (Jack Malik), Lily James (Ellie Appleton), Sophia Di Martino (Carol), Joel Fry (Rocky), and Ed Sheeran (Ed Sheeran). Jack is a down on luck, struggling, an unattractive songwriter who one night, on his way home, gets hit by a bus during a worldwide blackout. The blackout is key to what happens next.<br/><br/>Laid up in the hospital with two missing teeth, Jack's best friend and manager Ellie pays him a visit. She breaks the news to him about his broken guitar and his sort of comical looking smile. When Jack references an old Beatles song ""When I'm Sixty-Four"", Ellie completely misses the reference. In fact, he learns that nobody knows anything about who the Beatles were. For some reason, Coca-Cola and Harry Potter do not exist either. Some of the user reviews on IMDB compare the movie to an old Syfy television show from the 80's that deals with parallel universes phenomena where somebody, either Jack or everyone on Earth, in this case, is transported to an alternate universe. Was this divine intervention or can a simple solar flare somehow change history?<br/><br/>The point is not to over analysis the movie. Accept it for what it is and enjoy the music. Too bad however there was not more of those nostalgic songs that made the Beatles famous in this universe. There was some familiarity in the plot that reminded me of other films but watching Jack and Rocky interact with Ed Sheeran was still fun while at the same time watching Jack struggle with his moral dilemma. What should Jack do, tell the world who is really the musical genius behind his success? No one knows who the Beatles are so what harm will it cause?<br/><br/>Lily James is adorable as Jack's love interest and manager Ellie Appleton. Or perhaps it's the other way around, as Ellie is in love with Jack without him realizing it. The underlying message is that one does not need to be beautiful or charismatic to find love or become a huge star. You just need to be honest with yourself. Know your limitations and find a way to challenge those limitations to be the best YOU, you can be.<br/><br/>""Yesterday"" is no superhero movie by far. But it was the only ""non-super hero"" film where only those that were at least 60 years old and older stayed through the end credits just to listen for more original Beatles music."

I went through the 60s, on the youngish side, and was NOT an immediate fan of the Beatles.
But this movie was well written, well cast, and offers great entertainment while making some pointy points. It is good natured and a trifle daring, towards the end.
I was surprised at how well hooked I was, and thoroughly enjoyed myself.
The cast was excellent. Patel has an expressive face, Lily James is sweet and endearing. I like Kate McKinnon but I think her character was either under utilized or unnecessary to the overall scheme of things. Ed Sheeran played an interesting supporting character quite well.
I recognized Sanjeev from television series ""Unforgotten"". He is excellent in everything I've seen him in. Here he contributes to the domestic believability of the main characters and appropriately humorous."

","This film is poorly edited. Delete ALL scenes with James Corden . Showing them in the trailer is the ONLY thing you see in the film, with no explanation or follow up. They didn't even make it seem like he was having a nightmare! there's other things that are popular ( albeit with diminishing returns in today's market) but never purportedly heard about. Kate McKinnon plays a good heartless 2nd manager. Yet the interview cut short by her, again makes no sense to the story line, as her character knows notta of any involvement of the Beatles.) Ed Sheeran plays himself, no acting involved, so a safe bet, yet in this film only because Chris Martin of Coldplay turned it down. Lily James (of Downton Abbey fame) is really the only reason this film stays afloat, besides ofc the music of the Beatles. I like that their music is played pretty much solo, except in two key scenes with little accompaniment. Another poor direction is the chemistry between the two protagonists, just didn't seem convincing enough to achieve their ""union"" in the latter part of the film, before then seemed right on target. There are 2 points which I don't want to totally give away for the film, one being the Beatles complete exclusion,(again the James Corden scenes are totally misleading & only garner attention to see the film, yet if one does decide to spend their money, they will be disappointed, in this regards. ) Near the end is a ""HODOR"" incident (a GOT fan shouted out at the appropriate time in the theater, Cool moment.) On the 2nd screening,one week later, additions are made at the end to supplement the couple & in the future, their two kids. Finally there is an attempt to bring closure to the Beatles, which using CGI, but I leave it up to the viewer to decide just how ""comforting"" he is to them."

The film is better, but not what you are lead to believe by the trailer.<br/><br/>The movie is stolen by Kate McKinnon, who is an unknown (on this side of the pond) American, very talented, funny without trying. I do hope to see her in many other parts.
I am sure Lily James was paid twice or 10 times what Himesh Patel was paid, and she is perfect in her subdued role, Himesh, a British Indian who appears to have only been in a very popular soap, can sing, act and is self-depreciating. He has great skill with the blank puzzled stare. But the part does not demand much more. He's better when being a schoolteacher.
Ed Sheenan is very good as himself, who knew he could act. LOL.
There is not enough music, Beatles or other, for this to be called a musical, and lots of people who go to see it hoping to hear a lot of Beatles songs will be very disappointed.
However the story is excellent. It moves forward and never misses a beat. Oh, and the ending is very clever, and not what you might expect."

","""Yesterday"" has a hook as instantly catchy as any iconic song by The Beatles: Jack Malik is a struggling singer-songwriter, ready to give up on the starving artist lifestyle after an unremarkable career. All of that changes, however, when a freak accident finds Jack living in a world where suddenly he is the only person who has any memory of the The Beatles or their music, or so it seems. Unlike the best Beatles' songs though, ""Yesterday"" is not as fleshed out beyond its captivating premise, leaving that premise feeling thin and worn out by the end.<br/><br/>I just couldn't help but feel like ""Yesterday"" could have been so much more. The movie focuses more on Jack's career after this massive change. Initially, his desire is to preserve this amazing music that the world has forgotten about, but he comes to realize that he can capitalize on it and become massively successful. Jack does confront his internal battle throughout the movie of how ethical his actions are, but this is about the extent of the depth of his character. A movie that could have been about both a celebration of the greatest band of all time AND an artist finding his own voice, isn't. Jack is actually frequently reminded how his own songs simply doesn't measure up, which is played more for laughs than anything. It felt genuinely disheartening in this otherwise uplifting movie.<br/><br/>Similarly, Jack's literal situation of just what the heck happened in the world is not really explored or resolved. While it's not necessarily crucial to the plot, I found it unsatisfying for such a tantalizing stone to be left unturned.<br/><br/>This narrative slack is picked up by what the heart of the movie really is, the romance between Jack and his childhood friend and number one supporter, Ellie. This romance is sweet and believable in all the places it needs to be. Ellie's character, however, does make some choices midway through the movie that would make her borderline insufferable were she not played so well by the charming and sympathetic Lily James.<br/><br/>Besides the romance, the real star of the movie is The Beatles' iconic music. There's a surprising number of songs thrown in. In order to further the plot along, we have to be told sometimes about how powerful and amazing the music is, but there are also plenty of moments where we get to just witness people be moved by the music. I found it to be a great celebration of their music, and it was all performed excellently by Himesh Patel.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Yesterday"" is a movie with a brilliant idea that could have been executed better. The feeling of what it could have been was palpable for myself, but it didn't lessen what the movie already possesses. At least, certainly, not enough to give it the low scores it's been receiving by professional critics. It's funny, sweet, and charming. If you're intrigued by the premise, see it. Just don't expect a revolution."

They had more control over their music in the recording studio than the vast majority of new recording artists in the 60s, so paved the way in so many ways.<br/><br/>But what about the movie? It's a nice romance with good comedic actors and some really good music (if you like the Beatles, that is...and if you don't, you're just trying to be cool!).

Lily Collins plays her part well but again, her character has no depth and relies completely on the main character! And a certain pop star appears constantly throughout this movie and you question what this unfocused movie is really about and why Danny Boyle made this so middle of the road.<br/><br/>Occasionally Danny pulls through on the cinematography and the friend character 'Rocky' has some moments that was amusing. The music intergrated is the highlight and it has its feel good moments celebrating The Beatles's music but it's doesn't focus enough on The Beatles and it doesn't deliver as a fresh romantic comedy either. It doesn't really understand their music that well nor their influence and it doesn't understand what it's actually like to be a struggling musician in 2019<br/><br/>Honestly, if want a decent music based feel good movie, skip this and watch Blinded By The Light instead as it's so much better and emotionally engaging than this expensive waste of potential.<br/><br/>Casual viewers might find it charming but I personally found it quite shallow."

It amounted to a ten minute side story in a much better film than this one. Question: if Oasis never existed- how did Jack sing the awful ""Wonderwall"" as a youth at the talent show? Love story was hard to swallow- but that's standard fare, as I have said, for Curtis- never believed it for a second.

","At times, Yesterday's glorious goofiness and Danny Boyle's professional gloss make this downright charming (getting to feature the best melodies ever written isn't a hindrance either, duh). Unfortunately, these times are few and far between. The insanity of this plot never needed a full explanation. Even attempting one would surely be tedious if not downright impossible. But the complete emptiness behind the central question (WHY did all but three humans on Earth suddenly have no recollection of the Beatles) doesn't cut it either. Oh, and the inane detail that (at least) three other entities/concepts (Coca-Cola, cigarettes and Harry Potter) are missing in this dimension as well is just pure frustration (and potentially gross, misguided product placement? yuck).<br/><br/>Not that any of that wasn't predictable from the trailer; it all checked out. So allow me to answer my own WHY: why did I find myself on a Monday afternoon indulging in a film that I assumed would be more bad than good on a long summer lunch break in a movie theater I used to frequent all the time and now has a failing air conditioning system so loud the pressure in my head would change every 10-15 minutes when it kicked on? Because this was my idea.<br/><br/>I mean, quite literally: the plot for Yesterday was something I have thought about in detail many times over the last decade or so. This is not to say the thought amounted to a film spec or anything of that ilk. It was more of a rhetorical proposition I considered personally. Something along the lines of: if this happened to me, would I be able to recreate and capitalize on/odd this ""new"" music? And that still feels like an interesting concept which, in fact, the film does briefly touch upon. But the wheels come off rather fast. Instead we get Ed Sheeran (who can't act) in a much bigger role than is necessary; Kate McKinnon (who can't reign it) providing unnecessary and out of place comic relief that came off as if she was acting in an entirely different movie; a hamfisted love story; bad/inconsistent intertitle graphic design; an alternative history where John Lennon is an old recluse/fisherman (?) that only further convolutes what little structure this device is still clinging to; etc etc etc.<br/><br/>It was still early afternoon when I left the theater.

","Great acting all round. A true feel good movie. Colourless in terms of race. Funny. Great British humour. Really enjoyable if you let it flow over you. Nostalgia with the music. It has all the elements. The only thing I didn't understand was why there was a different timeline. I thought at the end that Jack was gonna wake up from a coma or something. That didn't happen. Still a good movie."
"niiickbu","6","1","3","30 November 2019"," Quiet simply emotional
","The story of this movie is on the simple side and quite predictable. It didn't try to explain the incidence and the world, but focused on the personal and love story. It was a good experience, but didn't leave very much to think about or remember afterwards.
The music adds a little to the emotional part. Also, they brought back John Lennon. Can't complain about that."
"CabbageCustard","8","1","3","28 October 2019"," The cleverest, quirkiest premise since 'Groundhog Day'
","'Yesterday' is a really delightful film. It is clever, witty, innovative and very enjoyable. The acting is great, the plot leaves you guessing right up to the end, the acting and characterizations are top notch and, it goes without saying, the music is brilliant. The only criticism I have of this film is that it contains a rather maudlin and predictable romantic subplot, which it could have well done without. It adds nothing to the story - quite the opposite. That aside though, this movie really is a pleasure."

"pwykes","4","1","3","13 October 2019"," Silly Love Movie
","This movie is obviously inspired by the Beatles but unfortunately it turns into a McCartney-like Silly Love Song, only in movie form. The premise of the movie is very promising - a fledgling musician ends up being the only person who remembers the Beatles after a freak event/accident. Unfortunately, it turns into a cliched romance story that we've seen hundreds of times before (boy and girl grow up together as friends, girl falls in love with boy who just treats her like a sister, girl confesses love for boy, boy eventually realizes the love of his life was his friend all along, they get married and live happily ever after).<br/><br/>The screen play was written by Richard Curtis, which is a big red-flag given his propensity to write cheese-ball love stories. If you liked ""Love Actually"" (written by Curtis), you will actually love Yesterday (as did my wife who enjoyed both movies).<br/><br/>There are a few humorous moments ( I particularly liked that Oasis didn't exist either since there we no Beatles to copy) which help keep the movie somewhat entertaining. Kate McKinnon plays an evil music manager in an over-the-top way that channels Cruella Deville, which also detracted from the movie.<br/><br/>The acting and signing was generally well done, which merits a few stars. All-in-all the movie's a disappointment considering what it could have been in the hands of someone with more talent than Curtis."
"lucidskyline","6","1","3","5 October 2019"," Good but many failings
","This film starts off well, the 'transition' scene is good and holds you throughout. It makes you realise the significance of the Beatles. How they are going to continue to shape the future. It's not that there are not songs out there just as good. It's the culture they created. An insight into the end of an empire. A lazy, psychedelic, visionary replacement for religion. The music becomes the sacred texts which people in future will return to again and again. Everybody feels it but nobody really knows what any of it means. Best kept that way. It's the voice of pure imagination and vision, beyond literal understanding. This movie puts this across by creating a parallel universe where the Beatles never happened.<br/><br/>The first cover of Yesterday worked brilliantly. It showed what it would be like if someone just picked up a guitar outside a pub and played this amazing song out of nowhere. John Lennon always admitted it was Paul's best song.<br/><br/>However, except for this cover nothing in the movie really does the songs justice. Many covers are just cut short. The version of Help at the hotel fit the story but was atrocious. After the movie I had to go and listen to a whole load of music to make up for what seemed like an appetiser that wasn't satisfied. Including the big hole where Eleanor Rigby didn't happen. But that's normal in such films and I guess it was really a love story, not a musical.<br/><br/>But a downer in the film for me was Ed Sheeran. I find him lacklustre and boring. I have tried listening to his songs but never reach the end. To put this very mediocre musician and singer in a movie about the Beatles was simply a marketing strategy. Of course he would agree to do it. 50 years ago Ed Sheeran would never have been noticed. The standard has fallen so far. Musicology studies have shown this. Apparently young people these days require this familiarity and security in music. When they get older they go back and realise how brilliant this old music is. Hopefully this movie may have purpose in 'educating' them sooner.<br/><br/>There is a scene when they get on Ed Sheeran's private jet that could have been made genuinely funny. Instead it just served to reinforce the impression that Ed is so far above us ordinary folk. It turned out to be so bad that it was hard to watch. Ed cool and rich beyond belief. The main characters bumbling idiots. Yuk. That should have ended up on the cutting room floor. The only bit where Ed Sheeran came close to actually acting was the scene where he admits losing the song writing contest.<br/><br/>What saves the movie in the end are the interactions between Jack and Ellie. In the few films I've seen Lily James in, she has been pretty good. In this she really shone. I will go back and check out some of her other roles.<br/><br/>Don't be put off by this review. I wanted and expected more but I watched it to the end, including the end credits right to the end while Hey Jude played. It is a basic feel good movie, with many failings, but it leaves an impression. 6/10."
"cavidpost","9","1","3","5 October 2019"," Different!

","I'm not a big Beatles fan, but I'm a musician and have a lot of respect for their legacy. I'm also not under 35, as one person suggested of anyone who doesn't rate this movie highly.<br/><br/>The story was interesting, and at first I was enjoying this movie. Kate McKinnon is great, and she really carries the whole cast. But it was irritating me at it went on.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie, I was waiting for the explanation. How did this happen? There were TWO other people who knew of the Beatles. How? Where did the Beatles go? What is the connection with these other two people?<br/><br/>I'm sorry... I guess a lot of people are ok with watching a movie where the entire universe gets altered with no explanation or reason for it.<br/><br/>Hey... the world just ended! HOW? Who cares... let's just tell a cheesy love story built around the implication that the Beatles' music would have as big, or an even bigger impact now than it did in the late 60's. Well, it's a much different world now and there have been many great songwriters other than the Beatles.<br/><br/>Regardless, the biggest problem with this movie is the incomplete story line. How TF did this situation occur? It's written in the trivia that the original writer was including more of the alternate universe in the story, where the secondary one decided to ignore that and focus on the incredibly awkward love story. Bad decision.<br/><br/>Marty McFly traveled to alternate pasts and futures... but we know how and why. There were multiple love stories intertwined in those movies, but it never left major ends untied... except for the purpose of sequels, but I won't expect to see one for this movie.<br/><br/>Malcolm McDowell chased David Warner as Jack the Ripper into the future. The love story was structured around the method of their time travel. We knew how it worked and why.<br/><br/>Ironically, the female love interest involves the same actress in both of my examples, but they were great movies that didn't leave me wondering WTF happened at the end.<br/><br/>I'll look forward to someone taking this idea and doing it right.... someday. Perhaps with the music of Led Zeppelin."
"mdw0526","6","1","3","3 September 2019"," A pleasant enough trifle...
","This was a pleasant trifle, a big cone of pink fluffy cotton candy that we enjoyed and then promptly forgot about. It was a nice love letter to the Beatles and their music, with a wispy thin plot that required a massive suspension of disbelief to believe that the songs by the Beatles were so extraordinary, they would be hits no matter when they were released or who sang them. I love their music, but they were also as much a product of the right time and place as anything else, and lots of other great artists didn't have as much success because they weren't mop-topped white boys singing catchy tunes."

"meddiedrinkwater","5","1","3","18 August 2019"," It's good, could've been great.
","Right off the bat, here's a few things I thought about that the movie never addresses.<br/><br/>1. How big is the human population considering cigarettes have never existed?
2. What colour is Santa Claus' clothes and how could of this had an effect on society?
3. Why isn't Jack in charge of what he calls his album?<br/><br/>Anyway, while this movie does have a pretty interesting idea and does do a lot of good like pretty good performances from Himesh Patel and Lily James and some good humour, the movie has some awful editing and amateur cinematography. What's the point in having a title card say ""Los Angeles"" if you're going to show the Hollywood sign in literally the next shot. It's as if the movie thinks we're too stupid to notice subtlety. I didn't like how It seemed that Jack had no control over whatever he was doing. How are we supposed to relate to a character if he only makes decisions based on what people want him to do? ( With an exemption at the end of the movie which is pretty dumb.) Anyway, if you want a fun, light hearted film with a new refreshing concept, I would recommend it."

Obviously everyone in Tinseltown would, blow coke and trash POTUS, stab your mother in the back, all in it for M-E! So there is no way a story where the protagonist actually cares about leading a good life and being a decent person - well, to Hollywood that's unbelievable.
If you are a normal, decent, caring person - the movie has no controversy or politics... no social agenda... it's just 2 hours of exploring how someone might respond if they suddenly had the greatest (some of) songs in history... enjoy!"

","A poor choice for the lead role for me far too much procrastination, similar to the Eastenders role, very frustrating. There was a missed opportunity to play on cultural differences which could of brought more humor to the film. As most people are saying the 3rd part of the film went too flat and it could of been a great celebration of the Beatles music instead of a demolition of 'I feel fine' and 'Hey Jude'. Ed Sheeran did his part and the supporting roles of the haphazard roadie and the patient girlfriend saved the film for me."
"regrunion","4","1","3","13 July 2019"," Lightweight Hollywood Fare
","The Beatles were great, in context of time and place and social movements and art movements and everything. Their influence on pop music is tremendous (would have been interesting to explore what the music world would look like without their influence, not only their songs, but the movie took a pass on that.) Although it is not a serious movie by any stretch, it is built on the premise that art is objectively great divorced from all that. I don't agree.<br/><br/>Also I wish I could watch just one mainstream movie in which the main characters don't hook up by the end. You can watch the first two minutes and easily predict who will be in bed within the next 90 minutes. There are so many interesting types of relationships that can be explored, but this movie (like most) went for the easy one that required no writing talent, effort by the audience or risk by the studio."

"insertwickednamehere","6","1","3","10 July 2019"," Genius concept ruined by the love story
","Let me just preamble this by saying that I had been so excited to watch this movie. I love The Beatles and the concept of this movie sounded so interesting but unfortunately, it let me down in so many ways that I've had to put it in writing AND bullet points.<br/><br/>1) Main character gives up playing Beatles songs even though he is depriving the world of life-altering music to be with Ellie - the woman who is introduced as his manager/potential love interest who wants him to succeed as a musician, sees his potential and is smitten with him... Until he is too successful.
Ellie goes on to make him choose between his immense success and being with her. Why would you want to be with a woman who supports your success as a MANAGER in the beginning who then goes around to making you choose between her and being the most successful musician ever. Why couldn't Jack have both? Why make him turn his back on everything he has aspired to since childhood? Ellie, why are you like this?<br/><br/>Jack spends a portion of the movie fearing being exposed, and when he is confronted by two people who also remember The Beatles, they thank him for keeping the music alive. He is effectively making sure that these wonderful songs are not forgotten, which is a nice sentiment that makes him feel less guilty about claiming these songs as his own - a sentiment with a lifespan of about 15 minutes that goes out the window when Jack chooses Ellie over being a musician. No ""Imagine"", no ""All Things Must Pass"", no ""Maybe I'm Amazed"". Ellie is being selfish for asking him of this, and he is being selfish for agreeing to it.<br/><br/>3) Depriving the world of Harry Potter to be with Ellie
At the end of the movie, it is revealed that the Harry Potter books do not exist in this universe either, and when Ellie asks Jack who that is (or something to that effect) he says: ""never mind"". Yes, I am biased because I love Harry Potter, and a world without these books seem incomprehensible.
Considering that he gave up probably the most successful musical career ever to be with her, it is implied that he is also giving up writing Harry Potter to be with her. This man is a teacher, and is basically depriving children and adults from one of the greatest fictional works in modern times, a series of books that have been proven to make children more empathetic.
4) There was no reason for Jack to say that he did not write this music, because in this universe, neither did John, Paul Ringo or George and therefore, no plagiarism. This music would not exist in this alternative universe without someone like Jack bringing it to life.<br/><br/>I also have some thoughts on how the movie portrayed John Lennon's alternate life of not being in The Beatles which I do not agree with, but it is such a small portion of the movie that I will let it be.<br/><br/>Negative: The development of the love story / Ellie
Positive: Beatles music, the idea itself of the movie"
"maurice_yacowar","8","1","3","10 July 2019"," Struggling British musician finds himself the only person who remembers the Beatles.
","So it's not just the Beatles that have been forgotten in this alternative universe. Coca Cola, Oasis, cigarettes, Harry Potter and Jane Austen have been too. John Lennon casually refers to ""prejudice and pride"" as if he'd never heard the famous title.
Ah, yes, the evanescence of human achievement, where even man's greatest accomplishments can disappear without a trace. Call this the musical version of Shelley's ""Ozymandias."" Of course, with worldly glory so insubstantial and fleeting all that matters is true love. All you need is love, as heroes Jack and Ellie finally discover. Could be a song there.
A familiar theme does not a failure make. Indeed Danny Boyle's new film is his most satisfying since Trainspotting (1996!), albeit in a tad different key. The idea that the Beatles could disappear from all but three peoples' memory is intriguing. It reminds us how tentative our apprehension of any reality really is.
The film is also a well-earned homage to that quartet. As another ""memory"" puts it: The world would be a far poorer place without the Beatles music so any revival, under whatever terms, is a blessing. That value goes for art in general - the imaginative fabrications that enrich us, our world, out lives. Everything is enhanced by our imagination, the ability to apprehend what never existed - or what did but has been lost.
That also reflects on the love story. Jack as kept Ellie in the wrong column all these years because he has failed to imagine her as a lover, them as a couple. His ethnic distinction makes that instinct of self-denial all the more understandable. The happy ending gives him all his beloved - the woman he married and the music he has managed to selflessly donate to the world, no financial strings attached. The school gym performance is more satisfying than Wembley."

","I was super-excited about this film from the second I'd seen the trailer in February. From then on, I would just come back and rewatch the trailer at least once per week, if only just because even those three minutes cheered me up so much. This last year has already been a blessing with two other fantastic films about musical legends (Bohemian Rhapsody and Rocketman), but as someone who was thoroughly obsessed with the Beatles in my high school years (which only ended 15 years ago), this one I was most excited about. The Beatles' songs are the one of the few ones that can get covered and remade and never lose their charm - that's why I predict that even in 200 years time, there will still be a young person with a guitar pluckin' on Let it be or Yesterday near a bonfire.<br/><br/>Even though this film is not a biopic at all, it's a beautiful homage to the Beatles music, and about how bleak the world without it would be. The sweet love story and the hardship of stardom are presented well, and the cast is top notch - Kate McKinnon is always a win though.<br/><br/>Also, my fear was that they were going for a cliche ending of ""waking up from a coma and realising it was all a dream"", and I was very very pleased that they opted for a much more intelligent end.

"theredsky","6","1","3","7 July 2019"," Yesterday Review
","This is a decent movie that I thoroughly enjoyed. Here are the negatives. Just like Ma and Brightburn, the concept of the film is really good but it isn't explored enough. You want to know more but it decides to focus on more character drama. Ed Sheeran is not the best actor in the world and he just looks incredibly awkward in this film. In most scenes he is in, it looks like he is incredibly confused. Another aspect would be that there are a lot of plotholes thrown into this film that when you notice them, it starts to take you out of the experience. The editing for this film is not good at all. There are too many cuts for some scenes and scenes just keep cutting away every 2-3 seconds when it shouldn't. The camera angles are so obnoxious in some scenes that it is distracting. Some scenes are tilted at a 45 degree angle for no apparent reason at all and it is just annoying. The humor is not that funny at all and I only chuckled one joke throughout the entire film. I'm not huge on Kate McKinnon as the primary antagonist in this movie. She just feels out of place surrounded by everyone else. Here are the positives. Himesh Patel and Lily James do a great job and have great chemistry together. Patel's performance is actually really good. He gives a ton of emotion, he's a good singer, and he knew what he was doing. Most of the supporting cast does a good job with what they are given. I was surprised about how much heart there was in this film. You genuinely care about the experiences they go through. There is one particular scene that I feel is very very touching. Patel's character is given an address and he drives to this secluded location where he knocks on the door and John Lennon answers it. He gives some inspirational words to Patel's character and it is very nice, emotional, and touching. The new renditions of The Beatles songs is actually pretty good. I enjoyed listening to them a lot. The cinematography is good in most areas but it is not special. The tone remains consistent throughout the entire film and it's also paced really well. Overall, Yesterday is a great Beatles love letter with lots of heart, good acting, and interesting renditions of good songs but is held back by major plot holes, poor editing, weird casting choices, and an underexplored premise. I give Yesterday a 6/10."

For me, it was kind of cute, with some funny moment, but ultimately gave my brain cavities. The music is great, of course, and nicely sung by the Himesh Patel. Unfortunately, the shot setups that hide his lack of guitar and piano ability were way too obvious and distracting. Lily James is delightful, as always.

","I'm a huge Beatles fan so I'm exactly that guy who should pick this movie apart in a review. It started out with humble beginnings and a welcome simplicity. The ""event"" that set the story wasn't focused on, or explained. Which is perfect because this isn't Sci-Fi.... and really leaves the whole plot as an issue that can be complex and open for debate. This movie felt like an Indy film but then we had some big names show up and I was blown away by the CGI character that appeared later. Our main characters journey itself was like a Beatles lesson. All you need is love/ Love is all you need. This was the freshest and most original film I have seen in a long time and I can't wait to share my thoughts on it (but not here because I don't want to give anything away) * Okay so I didn't hear ""Blackbird"" or ""A Day in the Life"" which are my two favorite Beatles songs, but that's okay. - edit- to those saying that the guy steals the Beatles songs- NO! NO! NO! He likened the songs to masterpieces (watching the brush strokes of the Mona Lisa) and couldn't imagine the Universe WITHOUT them. Given the fact that John Lennon did not die (because he wasn't famous) it seemed like a good thing, at least in that regard. Our guy made NO MONEY from the performances... jeez.

","'Yesterday (2019)' is a very traditional 'Richard Curtis' film, complete with pretty much every trope you'd expect from a rom-com come music-drama. As with many others of similar ilk, its loosely sci-fi-stroke-fantasy 'what-if' conceit isn't really a massive narrative concern; it's brushed aside with some basic lip-service that doesn't even come close to an implication of an explanation, really. Of course, its repercussions echo throughout the piece and it is, for all intents and purposes, the fuel of the flick. The story that evolves from this initially outlandish but increasingly acceptable premise is a familiar one, but it's a satisfying and well-told one nonetheless. This is, in large part, thanks to Danny Boyle, who directs the thing with a real flair not often seen in the genre. Whenever he has the opportunity to do something somewhat left-field, while still delivering a traditional and relatively straight-forward piece, he takes it with apparent glee, injecting the experience with an unmistakable vigour. This praise is in no way meant to discount the work of Curtis, mind you; the screenplay is confident, charming and well-crafted enough that you don't mind how, essentially, 'by the book' it is. The cast do an excellent job at drawing you into this slightly alternate world, too; everyone, and everything, seems suitably grounded. I did find one of its clichés to be a tad bothersome, but it didn't matter too much. Neither did its general predictability, which was actually shattered on a couple of occasions by some decent pseudo twists. Even when it isn't funny or poignant or particularly fast-paced, it's still pretty fun. The entire affair is rather strange, from an outside perspective, because it's ostensibly a 'Beatles film' that isn't a 'Beatles film' at all. Their music features heavily - although, it's pretty much all sung by someone else (wonderfully, I'll add) - and the picture seems like somewhat of a celebration of it, too. However, both the band and the music basically fall into the background: the film isn't really about either them. Still, it's not like non-biopic movies are a new medium for The Beatles. Perhaps pieces like this are better at conveying the feeling of listening to iconic songs and the joy they bring to people's lives than classic biopics could ever hope to be. The stories behind the songs often aren't as interesting as the stories we make while listening to them. I think that's at the heart of 'Yesterday (2019)'. It isn't a story about success, it's one about giving the world the opportunity to make their own stories. 7/10"

","Lots of witty dialog, colorful characters and a fun twist on Beatles music. While no one can match the vocals of the fab 4, it was fun to hear their popular tunes again.<br/><br/>While the two main characters were good, they were almost out-shadowed by Kate McKinnon (the money-hungry manager), Joel Fry (Jack's goofy assistant) and Ed Sheeran (just for being him).<br/><br/>While everything about this movie was pretty well done - I wouldn't say anything stood out as exceptional. Nonetheless, you can't help but have a good time."

","Yesterday is a film that with this title could so easily have written its own obituaries, but with Danny Boyle at the helm this film has sailed thru what could have been troubled waters.<br/><br/>We have a cookie premise of one man who finds after an accident he's the only one in his new reality to have ever heard of the Beatles. Taking advantage of this, he climbs up the ladder of fame but really the real prize that he must Kearny is to win the heart of his childhood sweetheart.<br/><br/>It generally avoids cliché, its fun and sassy, but most importantly pays genuine homage to The Beatles and the roots of the songs. You love the humour, the colour and relatable characters. It doesn't add anything new but isn't trying to.<br/><br/>It's a fun ride on this yellow submarine, and doesn't need any Help! One to Twist and Shout to. Enjoyable homage."
"dr_faristuta","7","1","3","30 June 2019"," Two different stories into one
","This film felt like 2 different stories within one film. One was the main story of Yesterday which was very innovative and interesting, while the other was much leas creative, just a cliché story seen in many previous films. The good acting and chemistry between the 2 main characters saved the film, but that love story weakened the plot. The film could've been a great opportunity to examine whether the Beatles songs would've been relevant in today's society or not, or at least tried to make the audience think about that."

","Seemed like a great premise and I was excited to see it.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the beginning and the setup. Some early moments were great, like the ""Let It Be"" reveal to his parents, and his playing Beatles tunes in small cafes early on and no one really paying any attention because they didn't know the music.<br/><br/>Kate McKinnon's character seems a little over the top and played a bigger role than it needed. The Ed Sheeran plot line went on a bit too long, and wasn't that interesting.<br/><br/>They didn't touch on what I thought could've been interesting ideas. The lack of the Beatles invasion and cultural changes. (music, fashion, etc.) Kind of like a Back to the Future changing of time. While they had one scene with JL, which means he would still be alive if he weren't famous, he also wouldn't be John f'n Lennon.<br/><br/>The romance plot line was pretty boring and I thought it ended with a dud. The acting was great but the writing and story line could've been better."

","I took my children to see this film, and although my 9 year old son fell asleep (that was to be expected), my 14 year old daughter and I loved it. The acting is superb, with special mention of Sanjeev Bhaskar as Jack's dad and Kate McKinnon as the agent. Sanjeev is very much a ""dad"" hilarious in his everyday ""dad-ness"" and Kate McKinnon is brutally funny with her one-liners as Jack's agent. The cast on the whole is spot-on, with dry british humor in ever scene. I also liked the more mundane things that most people don't notice (like a school teacher dressing like a school teacher, not in new designer labels, and only have one pair of shoes, and not a different pair for eery scene). Although this is really a love story, it does not take the typical path to get there. This is a winner."

","Danny Boyle have always been an exceptional director responsible for some original movie ideas and yesterday is no exception. Just like mamma Mia paid its tribute to ABBA, yesterday gives its best to do the same to the Beatles .the storyline seems to be siding towards special effects to tell the story than any actual storytelling. Some heartwarming moments but in overall a movie that Hollywood seems to be needing in times of reboots sequels and remakes."

","Well. How can you not love a movie that ends with Obla di, and Hey Jude. Asks many complex questions that go unanswered and often unexamined and sort of slides into the easy groove of a love story. Reminded me of 'Love, Actually' (same writer) in a lot of way though Yesterday is both more complex and less tight than that earlier film. Suppose no one had ever heard of the Beatles and a marginally decent singer came along and performed their songs. Would they go over? Probably. Would everyone in the modern world think they were the greatest songs ever? Maybe. Though probably not the earliest ones. Does this mean that our culture has totally degraded -- that no music of the last fifty or so years is anywhere near as good as the Beatles? That's a scary question because, obviously, the Beatles, good as they might have been, are certainly not remotely in the same league as, say, Mozart or Bach. The really scary questions about our culture are avoided but that's OK because Patel and James are wonderful. In fact acting all around is pretty good. The story holds together and love conquers all, even greed. The best moment is when Patel is confronted by the only two folks in the alternate universe who remember the Beatles. Rather than confronting Patel for claiming the songs were his own they are grateful to hear a reasonable facsimile of such wonderful."

"rgkarim","8","1","3","28 June 2019"," One Day Meets Beatles: Yesterday's Charming Balance And Music Saves The Lackluster Finish
","We all know music and many of us love it without so much a whim so long as we get the tracks we love. The artists who work to make music often are recognized more for their abuse of money and fame, rather than the motivation behind their music. So what would happen if you could be that artist you admire so much? What if you could take credit for their work and nobody had a clue they even existed? Well that's where tonight's movie comes in, and yours truly is here to cover the film to let you know whether or not the film is worth a check out. Let's get started as tonight we look at:<br/><br/>Movie: Yesterday (2019)<br/><br/>Director:
Danny Boyle
Writers:
Jack Barth (story by), Richard Curtis (screenplay)
Stars:
Himesh Patel, Lily James, Sophia Di Martino<br/><br/>LIKES:<br/><br/>Charming
Fun
Good Covers
Decent Comedic Relief
The ""cameo""
The Artistic Messages
The Love Story
The Acting<br/><br/>DISLiKES:<br/><br/>Trailers spoiled Much
Kate McKinnon's Extreme Character
Other Secondary Characters Lost
A Little Preachy
Not Quite The Revelation/Tension I thought<br/><br/>SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Much like Slumdog Millionaire, Boyle's work once again manages to capture a charming tale that holds so much in the simplistic story telling. Yesterday was able to bring a lot of fun into the tale, taking the idea of living life as a rock star and using the covers, which are of a good quality, to maximize much of the Beatle's legacy without the masters themselves being present. Despite the seriousness of the movie, Yesterday is funny, selecting a drier, English wit that is occasionally spritzed with some American antics including several cameos that are fun to see. However, Boyle's accomplishment also is finding a way to incorporate the true film art style by sampling some artistic messages into the love story at hand. Yesterday's alternate reality is awe inspiring in terms of pulling the blinds of fandom down to reveal the moral testing sacrifices that the music celebrity world requires, managing to test the boundaries of love without diving too far in Hallmark territory. And it's actually thanks to the acting that I was able to become entranced by the magic of this film. There are plenty of actors to talk about, but in reality it's Patel and James that take center stage, each presenting balanced performances that work in tandem and craft the tale that many will enjoy, again making a believable romance story.<br/><br/>Yet there are a few limitations for me that I have to say I was surprised to see, at least for some of them. One thing that is not quite a shocker is how much the trailers have given away in the mass franchising, with many key parts and comedy hits revealed in the television spots. Amidst the predictability, Yesterday starts to lose some of its balance in terms of several decisions they made with the characters. One thing is Kate McKinnon, the comedic queen holds the same personality quirks that people loved, but for me her style of comedy was forced and a little too extreme for the tone this movie set. It's SNL like presentation worked sometimes, but like a few Sheeran moments felt out of place from the components I liked. And much like many films, Yesterday's secondary characters we are introduced to sort of feel lost to the layered storytelling, dropped in the background for more comedic one liners. Sure a bit realistic, but again I'm about utilizing the characters as much as you can. Oh well, I guess that decisions goes with the themes of the movie about fame vs everything else, which although artistically presented sometimes got a bit too after school special for me. However, the biggest ""let down"" so to speak was the lack of mind-blowing, or even suspenseful, revelations that the trailers suggest lied in the wings of this mystery. Yesterday's concept is interesting, so you were hoping for some secret to be revealed that would not sweep the film off of the beautiful presentation he put together. Not the case, for the concept sort of fizzles out in favor of pursuing the character arc stories that were built in the 2 hours.<br/><br/>Overall, Yesterday worked for me and was fun to watch. A beautiful balance of love, music, and charming artistic quality, Boyle proves to still have the eye for alternative storytelling. It's an entertaining film with a lot of heart that many should enjoy and I feel the acting performances and direction give you the characters you want to invest your time in. There are some forced moments into the movie, primarily in altering the comedy to add a little more moisture to the drier comedy, but it's really the lack of that giant revelation punch at the mystery that really stood out for me in terms of areas to improve. Still, the charming tale is one that can be enjoyed in theater, but the fact it doesn't have enough flash bang boom components means that a home viewing is most likely in your future.<br/><br/>My scores are:<br/><br/>Comedy/Fantasy/Music: 8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0"

"movieman6-413-929510","6","1","4","30 June 2019"," The acting and singing work of the main characters carries the film together with the music of the Beatles.
","Yesterday is a new fantasy comedy directed by Danny Boyle, the director of 127 Hours, 28 Days later and Slumdog Millionaire.<br/><br/>In the film, musician Jack Malik (Himesh Patel) has a hard time breaking into the music world. The only one who really supports him is his good friend Ellie Appleton (Lily James).
When Jack is hit and recovered during a worldwide power outage, he realizes that he is the only one who still knows the music of the band The Beatles. For example, he decides to use the Beatles songs himself during his performances. In this way he manages to break through in the music world, but he still feels insecure, knowing that he has not invented or written his songs himself. As long as he remembers the songs of the Beatles, he can remain successful. His new success is somewhat at the expense of his relationship with his parents and with Ellie.<br/><br/>This film plays in a comical way with dealing with secret plagiarism and copyright problems. For Danny Boyle it was also an expensive film to make, because he has to pay for the rights of the certain Beatles songs, which can be heard in the film. Buying these rights has fortunately been a good buy, because in addition to the mysterious plot of the story, the film is further supported by well-known music. They also know how to make some jokes about the music world and how things are going nowadays with this film. The film also has other fun comic moments, but the trailers do give away some of the nicer moments. To enjoy the movie more, you better try not to see the trailers.<br/><br/>The acting and singing work is done well and nicely in this film. Himeesh Patel and Lily James have good chemistry together. Himesh also shows how celebrity and money can turn people into a completely different person. Kate Mckinnon plays her role in this film somewhat exaggerated, as she often does in all her roles, but here she knows how to put it down appropriately. Furthermore, some music artists such as Ed Sheeran also have a cameo in this film."

","Despite pre-release Australian reviews for Danny Boyle's Yesterday being decidedly underwhelming, it had a full house at the large theatre at which I saw it on a Sunday afternoon. Apart from a few young shavers, In my fifties, I was at the youthful end of the watching demographic - there were several blue-rinses.<br/><br/>Yesterday tells of The Beatles becoming wiped from history after a 12-second world power outage. A young and unsuccessful songwriter from a sleepy English seaside town, Jack Malik (Himesh Patel), is seemingly the only person now alive who knows of the band and their catalogue, having received a concussion at the precise moment of the power cut. After realising he's not victim to a large scale meta joke, that The Beatles really have been expunged from memory in this parallel universe, he starts 'composing' their songs, ultimately to be lauded as the world's greatest songwriter. But does it bring him happiness and love?<br/><br/>The idea is great, the execution less so.<br/><br/>Screenplay is from Richard Curtis who seems to have been on auto-pilot during its writing. His CV in the last 30 years is beyond impressive, but we all have off days. Its well-worn and simple premise of guilt and unacknowledged love ran very shallow, its jokes often laboured.<br/><br/>And too many of the support characters are plain annoying and irritating rather than endearing; sadly, the usually marvellous Sanjeev Bhaskar as Jack's Dad is the chief culprit in this regard. An extended support performance from Ed Sheeran stretched his limited acting experience beyond credibility.<br/><br/>Likewise, in his first big screen outing, Himesh Patel as the film's star had difficulty imposing himself. His delivery of the Lennon-McCartney and Harrison songs was, however, generally impressive, a lack of tone only occasionally showing.<br/><br/>Cinematography from Christopher Ross was first rate, the concert footage especially so. The mainly English locations showed that country in a good light - including a brief montage of Liverpool's exceptional civic architecture.<br/><br/>The film is inoffensive, the soundtrack exceptional (does that need saying?), but ultimately extremely lightweight. But it's always going to be worth seeing for the tunes."

Directed by Danny Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire, 127 Hours, Trainspotting), it is a lighthearted romp brought to life by some great music and acting performances.<br/><br/>Jack Malik (Himesh Patel) is a struggling musician from a small town in England whose dreams of making it big are beginning to fade. One night, the entire world experiences a twelve second blackout and during this time Jack is struck by a bus and is later hospitalised. Upon being discharged, Jack is astonished to discover that he is now the only person on Earth who remembers The Beatles and their music. Using this to his advantage, Jack starts passing off Beatles songs as his own to assist him in becoming the famous rockstar he always wanted to be.<br/><br/>Even though it doesn't quite achieve the satirical edge it hopes for, Yesterday is still a fun, sweet-natured film that truly does bring to light how much impact The Beatles have left on the world, whether we realise it or not. The film has a distinctly British flavour and it's unlikely it will appeal to international audiences, where some of the more subtle eccentricities may go right over their heads. The overall premise is similar to the 2006 TV series ""Life On Mars"", where the main character is hit by a vehicle and transported to an alternate timeline, although this film is considerably more comedic in tone. Danny Boyle seems like an odd choice of director for a film like this, but he does a pretty good job carrying this unorthodox subject matter the whole way through. All of The Beatles songs featured are used perfectly during the film's big musical moments, and are expertly performed by newcomer Himesh Patel in the lead role. Surprisingly, a supporting appearance from Ed Sheeran of all people provided some of the film's funniest moments, as he proves to have solid comic timing. While not a must-see on the big screen, this film would certainly be worth a watch upon home release.<br/><br/>I rate it 7/10"
"dfrb83","8","1","4","27 June 2019"," Ridiculously unbelievable

"homecoming8","4","1","5","11 May 2020"," Nice gimmick ruined by a bland and weak cast..
","The story follows an interesting concept: after a world wide black-out certain things just don't exist anymore like Coca Cola, Harry Potter and.. The Beatles. From director Danny Boyle and screenwriter Richard Curtis you would expect a magical film but they hardly use the twist and decide to go for a by-the-numbers rom-com.<br/><br/>And that's were the film starts to fall apart because the cast is too weak and uninteresting. Leading actor Himish Patel is an odd choice and lacks humor and charisma and there's no chemistry between him and Lily James.<br/><br/>As a viewer, you don't care about their friendship / relationship which isn't believable to begin with. Most of the cast is rather weak, even Ed Sheeran but he's forgiven since he's a musician, not an actor.<br/><br/>The entire cast is overshadowed by American comedy actress Kate McKinnon, who's the only one who's actually convincing and funny.<br/><br/>""Yesterday"" is not a total failure because it features lots of awesome music from the Beatles. And (SPOILER ALERT!) we have Robert Carlyle who plays John Lennon at the very end of the film.<br/><br/>""Yesterday"" would have been a better film without Patel and James as the leading cast and if the running time was 20 minutes shorter because many times the story seems to drag on forever."

","First of all i could not say that i am a die hard beatles fan but as probably most of you i am raised with their music. When i first heard the plot and saw the trailer i was really excited..
And now after i've seen the movie i feel that the excitement was for no good..
The acting is average at best, but for the music parts, what the h*** happened? A beatles punk crossover with no soul or charisma like these stone cold classics at least in my oppinion deserves.
I fairly think that the writers and producers spoiled a really good chance of making a seriously good movie and a real homage to the Bestles and their legacy.."

"paul_haakonsen","4","1","5","15 September 2019"," But it had so much potential...
","I saw the trailer for ""Yesterday"" in the cinema and I must admit that the trailer was cut and edited in a manner that really made the movie look interesting. And thus I ended up eventually sitting down to watch this movie from director Danny Boyle.<br/><br/>First of all, the fact that it was directed by Danny Boyle hardly brought any excitement for me. Not that he is not a good director, but I am not the type of person whom watches movies solely because of whom has been behind the camera.<br/><br/>Secondly, ""Yesterday"" definitely had potential, and it was heading down a great path, right up until about halfway through the movie, which was about an hour in, give or take. Then the air just seeped out of the balloon and it went horribly flaccid and mundane. The storyline just crashed entirely for me at that point and the movie spiralled into mediocrity fast and irrevocably. It just got repetitive to watch the things that took place on the screen.<br/><br/>And the movie was long, so terribly, terribly long. And given the fact that the last half of the movie was so mundane didn't exactly help to lift up the enjoyment of sitting through the movie as it trotted onwards in a generic and monotonous pace.<br/><br/>Ed Sheeran was in the movie, playing himself. My wife liked that he was in the movie. Me? Not so much, as he is merely a pop musician of no importance as I don't like his music or that genre of music he plays. So that really didn't excite me to see him.<br/><br/>I will say that Himesh Patel carries himself and the movie quite well with his performance and his on-screen charisma. But it was a shame that the movie just nosedived halfway through. Kate McKinnon was in the movie, but it was so hard to tell if she was portraying the same character she did in the abysmal ""Ghostbusters"" remake, or if she is seriously ill-equipped for acting and she just everything the same way.<br/><br/>""Yesterday"" definitely had potential, but it ended up being a less than mediocre movie at the end, when it comes to it for me. The movie was cut down because of its pacing, because of its length and because it just simply rolled over and decided to die halfway through.<br/><br/>I am rating ""Yesterday"" a generous four out of ten stars."
"desierra2003","10","1","5","27 July 2019"," I wasn't sure at first
","When I saw the preview for Yesterday I didn't think I'd be that into it. Nobody can do the Beatles songs like they did. I couldn't have been more wrong. I decided since I'm a fanatical Beatlemaniac it's sort of a requirement to see it. I laughed, I sang, I cried like a baby. I'm so glad I saw it. Even if you have a passing interest in the Beatles music, you're bound to love this movie."
"writers_reign","5","1","5","2 July 2019"," Help
","The production company clearly spent a young fortune on PR for this title and if the flacks got it ride and drag the punters in the movie will easily make its neg cost back.Whilst it managed to keep my mind off Brexit and my dinner plans for the evening throughout the running time I had completely forgotten it by the time I reached the foyer on the way out. Part of the problem is that in my salad days I was frightened by screenwriters like Terence Rattigan and directors like Puffin Asquith who, had they turned out nothing more than The Way To The Stars and The Browning Version would have more than secured a lifetime pass to the Pantheon and these Poster boys for the luvvies Curtis and Boyle, who struggle to achieve mediocrity just aren't in the same league albeit as crowd-pleasers they're right up there with The Simpsons and Kermit the frog. This is a thinly-veiled rip-off of the tv sitcom Goodnight, Sweetheart, in which time-traveller Nicholas Lyndhurst passes off Beatles song as his own work and that's the story from soup to nuts. The best thing about it by a country mile is Lily James who, unlike the rest of the cast, is completely unselfconscious and doesn't walk through the film clearly in awe of being in this season's feelgood triumph. Go see it, though. You will anyway."
"vengeance20","5","1","5","29 June 2019"," Ok, but I don't entirely get it...
","Seen this tonight & was intrigued by the premise of the film following the trailers.<br/><br/>But after watching I'm kind of left wondering what to think of this film. Like it had good parts in it, but also had parts which made the film hard to take seriously, let alone the film itself, which I think simply couldn't decide what it wanted to be.<br/><br/>The film is about a young man who after being hit by a bus around the time the entire earth lost power for 12 seconds, wakes to find that nobody knows about 1960's Band, The Beatles.<br/><br/>I found the concept interesting, but very weird, far fetched not to mention too off the rails. The parts when the young man tries to look up The Beatles, Cigarettes or even Coke Cola was while funny at times, was annoying & pretty stupid for its own good. John Lennon suddenly being alive was the cherry on the cake, the film clearly takes place in 2018-2019/Present day, yet because of an outage, The Beatles to Coke-A-Cola & other things suddenly became forgettable. Why & what? It made no sense !<br/><br/>The Beatles being the main reason for the sudden disappearance was 1 thing but plot convenience things likes Cigarettes, Coke Cola to even Harry Potter was just dumb, funny, but dumb & got old very quickly. Another niggle was why The Beatles were forgotten by a simple power outage, all trace of them went missing, their songs, web pages, Wiki page etc. Yet everyone, even the internet, cleared all trace of them. I'm it's not as if the whole earth was plagued by some toxic nerve or trance gas!<br/><br/>The good points were the scenes in how the guy got famous & how he got together with the love interest at the end. The film was surprisingly enticing & engaging despite the plots hole, weirdness, overall undecided execution, plot & script continence.<br/><br/>Overall, this film simply couldn't decide what it wanted to be and was plot holed throughout. While enticing it was the premise and stupidity of the film which made it hard to take seriously. 5/10"
"azeemnavarro","2","1","6","16 September 2019"," Money (That's What Danny-Boy Wants)
","Not even the Beatles music could save this garbage. ""Yesterday"" is about a mediocre musician that, after an accident, is the only person that remembers the Beatles. Why's that? We don't receive any explanation. The film, instead of focusing on the cultural impact on such an event, decides to be another awful romantic comedy.
Our main character is a whiny little biatch, that complaints about not being recognized for his ""talent"", and that only rise to success after stealing the Beatles songs. Let's face something, if the Beatles were formed today...no one would pay attention, that's the sad truth, because everyone is a normie that only listens to trap or reggaeton or garbage like that. And people would care less if the Beatles were only Himesh Patel (ugh). This man is the most uncarismatic person ever, my toe has more personality than him. All the music of the Beatles is butchered, literally the man can't sing, and the arrangements for the songs are atrocious or mediocre.
But the biggest problem of the movie is a woman called Lily James. Her character is the worst person ever put on screen. I can't describe how horrible she is, you have to watch the movie, all i'm going to say is that she's basically the antagonist. Lily James>Hitler, yes she's more evil, that's all.
At the end of the day, what Yesterday teaches us is that:
a) If you have talent for something, you're a bad person that should only live in mediocrity.
b) If you have a dream, forget about it, because you should not be successful.
c) You can't have ambition, because you would be greedy.
d) A crazy woman should control your life.
e) Ed Sheeran needed promotion for his music.
f) Danny Boyle has lost its touch."

"davphv","Null","1","6","8 July 2019"," Loved the music but not the movie
","Most fantasy movies that start with a life-jarring experience usually have another to set things back to the-way-we-were but with improvement of the lead actor's life. So many films were like that: 13 Going on 30, Big, It's a Wonderful Life.<br/><br/>But not this one. This one doesn't have a decent ending - screen writers must have run out of ideas..<br/><br/>This movie wants us to believe that a 12-second world-wide blackout affected all but a few people, and that some of our favorite things never happened. How can their be only one soft drink in the entire world - did capitalism get snuffed out in the blackout? Or was this just a huge product placement advertisement?<br/><br/>The songs are great - they're from the Beatles. But no one in this movie seriously challenges the fact that one man alone comes up with dozens of hit songs after 10 years of failure.<br/><br/>I'm getting a little tired of Hollywood forcing mixed-race relationships on us, too, just like they forced gun violence, gore, heavy swearing, hip hop culture,and unprotected sex on us."
"WillsFilms","6","1","6","28 June 2019"," Yesterday Will Not Be Remembered Tomorrow
","Yesterday is a movie with an intriguing concept, that suffers from poor execution. The movie follows Jack Malik, played my Himesh Patel, who is a struggling singer-songwriter that plagiarises songs from The Beatles in an alternate timeline where they do not exist. Jack is a likeable character, with an interesting arc and he has fantastic chemistry with Lily James' character; Ellie Appleton. The problem with the film is that how the alternate timeline is created isn't explained. A global blackout occurs and afterwards, The Beatles don't exist. How does a global blackout cause The Beatles to vanish from history? The movie doesn't explain. How is Jack the only person that remembers The Beatles? Also not explained. If the basic premise of your movie is extremely confusing and doesn't make any sense then it doesn't matter how good anything else in the movie is, because the whole movie takes place because of a gigantic plot hole. Even if there was one throw away line that briefly summed it up that I missed, that's not an effective way to explain the biggest plot point of the movie. Yesterday is an okay movie with good acting, likeable characters and good music, but it's premise makes zero sense and leaves your head hurting as a result."

"dan_counts","8","0","1","28 June 2020"," A plucky little film that punches above its weight class
","So reading through the reviews....I'm sorting out that the majority of blokes that gave this movie 1 or 2 stars are the sames ones that probably angry the lead is dare I say it.....a Pakistani!!!!!<br/><br/>As for the film itself, is it a Citizen Kane? Trainspotting? Gone With the Wind? Nope, doesn't bother to try to either. Is it a Bridget Jones' Diary or Notting Hill? Thank the gods no it isn't.<br/><br/>You have a perfectly average will they/won't they rom-com, that takes a twist (what if no had heard of The Beatles), and you have a movie that admirably punches above its weight class and does so in the most wonderful way possible.<br/><br/>Seeing Jack struggle, and as someone with a few friends that are grinders in the music industry, I've seen that pain of doing a show and a) only your friends show up or b) the people that are there aren't even listening to what you're playing. The point is really driven home when Jack goes on his Beatles songwriting binge and is on his way to his first gig and his parents ask him to play one of the new songs, then keep interrupting him as he's starting to play what I think is the most seminal of The Beatles hits, Let It Be.<br/><br/>And I'm sorry, I could feel that tension between Lucy and Jack throughout the film, a couple of times Danny has to hit the audience over the head with it so people aren't whining, ""This is supposed to be a Beatles movie!!!""<br/><br/>For myself, Himel drove the spike in and nailed this movie perfectly as a rom-com with the Pier Hotel concert and the first song out was Help! and it was the perfect combination of heartbreak and energy with the way he was screaming the lyrics not as much singing. Felt like the way that song should have been sung, especially if Joe Strummer ever got his hands on the song.<br/><br/>You have a couple of through lines with Ed Sheeran, dropping the line about becoming Salieri was just brilliant. And then Kate McKinnon is a perfect stereotype for a producer but then takes it so over the top, especially at the end with her ""Stop in the name of money!"" line.<br/><br/>Could it have been better? Yeah the pacing at times leaves much to be desired, sometimes Ellie comes off a bit one-dimensional, but overall, I'm giving this movie 8 out of 10 stars.<br/><br/>Not standard Danny Boyle, but he does service to the movie instead of his personal tropes."

It's not even remotely believable that such a ""man"", even when gifted with sole knowledge of some of the greatest songs of all time, would be able to accomplish anything, let alone international stardom. It's an affront to the beauty, originality, and greatness of The Beatles music for it to be associated with such blandness.

","I'm just not sure what I really feel from this film. It is a great idea; and the train of thought, and side issues it brings up are very fascinating. I finally decided to view the film as an exercise. A long drawn out 'what if' scenario. The big obvious question is ""would the Beatles songs stand up again? Was it just a matter of the times and fashion? Was it the four guys?"" And the clear reply is 'No'. Those songs are so universal, so exuberant and timeless, that the genius shines through in all settings, on every level. If anything it showed up today's age; how vapid the pop machine has become. And to what denominator the machine appeals. The only Beatles song that comes up short IMO is ""All you need is Love"". I was imagining someone coming up with that song today, and how it would be used, and pushed, and I could easily feel how much I would hate the song. The Beatles did everything right. It was genius. The film does try to show what we expect now. There is little to no subtlety allowed in music anymore. People have to, or want to, be hit over the head with any message or sentiment. otherwise it doesn't count. So ""USSR"" is done Ramones style; John's real meaning of ""Help"" gets exagerated to the point of the singer screaming in a deranged manner. whereas Lennon knew that singing ""Help"" or ""I'm a Loser"" straight was powerful enough. The whole extended cameo of Ed Sheeran was ....confusing. I guess it made sense plot-wise. Someone needed to 'discover' him. And it also underscored this idea of the masses needing to be told. The room does not erupt in applause until Ed gives the OK, the first clap. Personally I don't think too much of his music, and he is IMO very unlikable, but it has to commended that he offered himself up to be 'sacrificed'. Someone needed to lose out to the Beatles songs. And someone needed to come up with the idiotic line ""Hey Dude"" LOL. Once again it is just so amazing to realize how those songs are in a completely different league. Untouchable. For reviewers who say ""interesting concept; should have been developed more"", I have to wonder how that could be done. Because I initially thought the same thing. But then I ask myself how exactly? Don't know how many stars to put here. As love story, and supporting cast, production values etc go, it is all run of the mill, very average. From a musician's POV it is fascinating, and also insanely annoying. Watching those cutesy recording sessions with those idiotic grins,and those rubber gloves was a chore. But re a storyline, or any kind of drama I think the two people who ""know"" - that whole angle could have been done with more flair. And then the 'confession' is kind of a joke. Yes, the audiences love a story of redemption; especially if there is love involved, but it all plays out in under 2 minutes LOL. I mean Milli Vanilli are still pariahs today LOL."

","Directed by Danny Boyle. Starring Himesh Patel, Lily James, Joel Fry, Kate McKinnon, Ed Sheeran, Sanjeev Bhaskar, Meera Syal, Alexander Arnold, Harry Michell, Sarah Lancashire, Sophia di Martino. (PG-13)<br/><br/>Unsuccessful singer-songwriter Patel is considering hanging it up despite earnest encouragement from best friend and manager James; one collision with a bus later, and he comes to in a world that somehow does not have the music of the Beatles in it (nor Coca-Cola, cigarettes, and a few other things). Performing the Beatles tunes from memory--and claiming them for his own--suddenly he's a music star on the rise. Strange premise, pregnant with possibilities; pity that writers Richard Curtis and Jack Barth weren't all that interested in exploring them deeply, and decided instead to present a genteel rom-com fantasy with Fab Four wallpaper. Pleasant enough, but dishearteningly unambitious, with so many questions left unanswered, and so many missed opportunities for commentary, satire, speculation, profundity and/or pathos; the cop-out ending leaves a half-dozen or so plot threads dangling and brushes past a mountain of consequences. The leads are solid, with just enough dim spark between them for rooting interest in their romance; McKinnon's eccentric music manager might have been funny in a different project, but she sticks out like a sore thumb here. Robert Carlyle is almost unrecognizable doing a cameo as...a famous person, let's leave it at that.<br/><br/>43/100"

As a teen Beatles fan, I was disappointed by every aspect of this movie. The only things that made it watchable for me were the songs and references, and those don't make a movie."

","This movie never really found out what it wanted to be, let alone what it wanted to say. As a comedy, it really isn't all that funny, except of course for the premise which sounds like it should be a side-splitter. As a romance it was as predictable as they come. That kind of leaves us with the Beatles.<br/><br/>I was in the pub one day chatting to a pretty young bar attendant (admittedly, not the intellectual type) and the Beatles came up in conversation. She said, ""Who are they? Can you hum me a song they've done."" Momentarily stunned, I sang some lines from a few classics... which got me a blank look. ""Nope... don't know any of them.""<br/><br/>My point is that the Beatles were a product of a time and place, and their own hard work to get to the top. If the world really did forget about them, it is highly unlikely that any mildly talented artist would find success by releasing their songs today. They followed the times and, to a degree, the times followed them. And may their souls live on forever."

","I just watched Yesterday and enjoyed it. I agree with others that say those who are giving it low ratings are probably under 30 and have no clue who the Beatles are (no pun intended). It was fun and didn't need to be deep or thought provoking to be enjoyed. Some people are trying to make this some huge drama and it really isn't supposed to be. If you like the Beatles and want a movie that isn't just another reboot/sequel, you'll most likely enjoy this.<br/><br/>If you want to add a little more depth, please read more below, though take it with a grain of salt, it's mostly for fun.<br/><br/>---See it in a different way---<br/><br/>There are a number of things left unanswered through the movie, questions that couldn't possibly be answered unless this was a major sci-fi movie or a theory in quantum mechanics. What caused the blackout? Why did everyone forget about the Beatles? How were cigarettes never invented? It really raises some questions that never get answered, but I believe the answers are right there the whole time and because of one simple reason.<br/><br/>This movie is (unofficially) about the Mandela Effect.<br/><br/>When you get down to some of the basic questions in this movie, it becomes more clear that maybe the director wasn't just making a heartfelt movie about the Beatles and life without them, but possibly having some fun with the theory of the Mandela Effect.<br/><br/>The Mandela Effect was first truly documented with everyone believed that Nelson Mandela had died in a South African prison in the 1980s, but having actually died in 2013.<br/><br/>It kept bugging me how the movie never addresses the sudden disappearance of the Beatles (and soon other things revealed later) until you get to the scene near the end where Jack meets to two others that DO remember the Beatles. It's safe to assume that there are even more people who remember them, but they never made the connection.<br/><br/>The theory of the Mandela Effect is that a group of people remember an event or an item that has never existed, being able to bring up memories and all sharing the same information, contrary to these things never actually existing. They remember specific dates, pictures, places, etc, but nowhere is evidence to be found.<br/><br/>One theory is a sudden dimensional shift that causes some people to be phased into a new reality where things are different, but only slightly, such as the blackout, having created an alternate universe. Jack (and others) suddenly wake up in a world much like their own, but only certain events have not happened.<br/><br/>Another possible idea is that someone has traveled through time to stop some things from happening and only some people still remember, despite a shift in the timeline, but this idea gets more 'sci fi' and doesn't mesh well with the theme of the movie.<br/><br/>It is very possible that some cosmic event caused Jack and others like him to remember things that ""never happened"" while the rest of the world has always been the same as it was when Jack and others arrived.<br/><br/>Again, this is all just a theory and I don't really have any specific evidence to support it, only by what I saw in the movie."

"AhmedSpielberg99","5","0","1","2 February 2020"," A wasted huge potential; still enjoyable, though.
","With Steve Jobs and now Yesterday, I'm sure now that Danny Boyle's direction suffers recently from a major problem: taking a back seat to the screenwriter. I had almost no problem with that with Steve Jobs simply because it was Aaron Sorkin who wrote the script. Here it's Richard Curtis, and if this says anything, it says that he's definitely not the right person to develop this promising concept and make something creative out of it. The result is an unsurprisingly uninspired, perfunctory, overly-sentimental, clichÃ©-filled, clumsy and even, occasionally, implausible film. Nevertheless, it's still charming and feel-good film that has likable performances (especially from the always-amiable Lily James) and bits of creativity -especially towards the end- that enhanced the dramatic and romantic aspects of it and made them work fairly well.<br/><br/>(5.5/10)"

","A struggling musician wakes up in a world where The Beatles never existed, and sets about re-writing all the songs as his own. The film has decent comedy, especially in the female manager who is not shy about her avarice. Her shark-like persona is a nice counter- balance to the nervous, low self-esteem hero. There is a very nice switch-and-bait with two minor characters at the end that trips you up, but also makes a lovely comment on the hero's project. My favourite moment is when the character is having his Dark Night of the Soul moment, and is sent off to meet a certain individual. It was not a moment I expected, and I have to admit it got to me. Curtis can be sentimental at times, but when he walks the line rather than rushes over it, he can really break your heart. This was one such moment. Not as brimming with humanity as Four Weddings, but also not as shallow as Love Actually. Clever (high) concept, well executed. A fun experience."

","This movie is more diverse and inclusive than The Beatles. The Beatles are 4 whites guys in band from Liverpool that includes NO People of Colour. The lack of diversity and inclusiveness in The Beatles was and is astonishing. How can we as a diverse and inclusive society continue to discriminate against POC and The LGBTQ? Couldn't have Paul McCartney been replaced with a Person of Colour? I wouldn't have felt excluded had The Beatles had a female woman of colour on guitar. John Lennon could have stepped aside so a Trans singer/guitar player would have made The Beatles more inclusive to the LGBTQ group. The Culture Club, Erasure, Thin Lizzy, and Wham are perfect examples of Diverse and Inclusive bands and musical acts. To continue having all white groups with no People of Colour or diverse Sexual Orientation must stop. Western Civilization must catch up to more progressive diverse and inclusive nations like Africa, India, Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras, and China for example. White supremacy groups like The Beatles, Rolling Stones,One Direction,Sex Pistols, Spice Girls, Radiohead, The Clash, U2, and Green Day will no longer be exclusive and intolerant. We will eradicate every existence and being of these groups, nations, and institutions built and formed by white males. I recommend this movie as I was never a fan of The Beatles, however Jack's diversity provides a more heartfelt and personal performance than the 4 white Beatles ever could.People of Colour deserve and demand more positions in All White Bands.<br/><br/>

","The current imdb rating probably reflects a rather humdrum romcom as seen by younger viewers. For boomers, it's hard to give this homage to the impact of the Beatles anything but a 10. The contrivance of an alternative reality manages to distill in a fresh way just how the miracle of this rock group affected the world. As one of the characters says at one point, a world without the Beatles is poorer, and this movie drives home the point in a poignant fashion. For those of us who remember the first appearances of the Beatles, who followed their musical evolution through several iconic albums and who now are moved not just by nostalgia but by the force of the lyrics and and music, this is a powerful film. And while the love story is lame, the film offers some hilarious moments rediscovering the Beatles and sending up the music industry."

","I've feared for a long time now that the peak of Danny Boyle the filmmaker had long been past and Yesterday just further confirms the sentiment that I wish was not the case.<br/><br/>Responsible for some of the most talked about and energetic films of the last 30 years, from his classic Trainspotting, zombie fueled adrenaline rush 28 Days Later, Sci-Fi masterpiece Sunshine and the Awards showered Slumdog Millionaire, Boyle had deservedly been recognised as one of the industry's brightest directing talents but on the back of some genuinely forgettable efforts like Steve Jobs, the downright bad Trance, the ill-advised T2 Trainspotting and the failed new Bond movie, Boyle has found himself in a career funk that doesn't find itself relived by Yesterday.<br/><br/>The type of film that on paper sounds like the dream project for Boyle, a wildly inventive narrative conjured up by Richard Curtis that sees the world forget about The Beatles and Himesh Patel's dullard wannabe musician Jack Malik somehow remember them and take his career to new highs on the back of it, Yesterday should be a return to form for Boyle but its strange lack of enthusiasm and by the book construction, that mostly ignores the repercussions of a Beatle-less world, makes it a far more forgettable experience than its plot-line would suggest.<br/><br/>There's none of that creative flair on show here from Boyle that was a staple of his best works and while Beatles fans are sure to get a kick out of its adoring fanboy take on the Fab Four, most viewers will be left wishing for more as Malik sings his way into superstardom and somehow ignores Lily James (the films MVP) beautiful and loving Ellie that forms the centre of Yesterday's attempt at rom-com.<br/><br/>This component of the film goes a long way to ensuring Yesterday remains mostly lame throughout its entire runtime, as it becomes increasingly frustrating just how bland Malik is for the films entirety, there's no real charisma here on show from Patel and the fact he seems oblivious to Ellie's clear affections makes us not pine for them to be together, there's no real spark here that exists in other Curtis penned UK classics like Love Actually or About Time.<br/><br/>We as an audience are supposed to be rooting for Patel's rise up the ranks from a nobody to a huge somebody as he conquers the world and finds love along the way but it's hard to care to much about him after he fails to win over our affections early on, while his so-so renditions of Beatles classics will just make you wish you were listening to the real thing.<br/><br/>Final Say -<br/><br/>Mostly misusing a great central concept, Yesterday is a generic and tame romantic comedy with very little creative magic or chemistry, marking this down as another Boyle film that sits very far from his best work.<br/><br/>2 Hey Dudes out of 5"
"jrarichards","6","0","1","16 November 2019"," Good idea, but tangibly under-implemented
","The last time Richard Curtis played with sci fi, the result was ""About Time"" (2013) - a reasonably good and cohesive film, if one that played fast and loose with the old-fashioned ""rules"" of time travel - despite key characters (played by Bill Nighy and Domhnall Gleeson) maintaining within the world of the film itself that such rules did exist...<br/><br/>Fast forward 6 years, and we have Curtis, Tim Bevan and the Working Title gang, plus Danny Boyle and Jack Barth - and in all of that sea of talent we out here all know for sure that - as a timeline episode of ""Dr Who"" or ""Star Trek"", say, this same story would most likely have looked more polished and sharper, and even meant more, precisely because the sci-fi lovers there would have known how to extract most from a ""reorganised time stream"" story.<br/><br/>For yes - as a great many people know - ""Yesterday"" asks us to envisage a world in which some cosmic event that briefly puts the lights out globally re-rigs our history in such a way that the group ""The Beatles"" somehow never got together, and nobody is any the wiser about that sad fact - except our hero Jack (Himesh Patel) and two other people, one of whom is a Russian and the other a Liverpool lass played to very good if brief effect by the ever-reliable Sarah Lancashire.<br/><br/>As the film develops, we in the audience learn along with Jack (in a pretty humorous way) that 4 other key phenomena we know about from our world never made it into existence in the alternate reality that is now being lived by the film characters (but no spoilers offered here on that).<br/><br/>Now sci-fi purists who watch will notice that only one of these 4 has any closer (also quite witty) link with the non-emergence of The Beatles, while the other 3 would - under the strict rules of traditional sc fi - have required re-rigging at several other points in history, some even quite far back. This ""eclectic mix"" hardly holds up for a purist, but then ""Yesterday"" is not a sci-fi film, even if it might have done better had it been so.<br/><br/>The key storyline it does have still has a great deal going for it, and the true (momentary) magic of this film - that we can share vicariously - comes with our empathising with people who first hear those glorious fusions of melodies and lyrics the ""Fab Four"" came up with, often adding that extreme dose of down-to-Earth melancholy. In our own lives, we doubtless happened upon these hits step by step, from an early age, so the power is diminished thanks to the gradual nature of our acquaintanceship. But just imagine if we were all fully-fledged adults and then were exposed to ""Eleanor Rigby"" and ""The Winding Road"" and ""Let it Be"" all at once for absolutely the first time. This the film invites us to imagine, and for brief moments at least a true lump is brought to our throats by it.<br/><br/>Beyond that, we could for example ponder on:
<ul><li>how a non-charismatic person would fare singing the great songs? (hinted at in the film)</li><li>how the songs would succeed/not succeed if first introduced 50 years later than they were ""supposed to""? (barely hinted at in the film)</li><li>how the songs might prove unsuitable for our delicate 21st-century sensibilities? (hinted at in the film)</li><li>how the songs might flop if they came into existence with no cultural context, and hence no particular meaning to the person presenting them? (hinted at - as Jack is an Asian from rural Suffolk, who has no link with Strawberry Fields and so on)</li><li>how suspicious the world might be of someone producing all of that without any great talent or creative struggle? (hinted at in the film)</li></ul><br/><br/>Ironically, these are the kind of ideas that come to my mind in the aftermath of seeing the film, but they are my thoughts provoked by the film, rather than notions present (or at least fully-developed) in the film itself - a sure sign that not enough creativity was really shown.<br/><br/>And interesting (not by pure chance) that Ed Sheeran features - quite effectively. For we might really question whether a world that had never contained The Beatles would even be ready for Ed and his ballady style. That also seems quite a worthwhile question.<br/><br/>To be honest, Himesh Patel in the role of an average performer playing down his role all the time at moments perhaps unfortunately begs the question whether the actor himself is really up to this part. And - since we know Lily James can do great things - her also less-large-than-life character seems to be making a trend out of the whole ""let's not get too excited here"" vibe, and that's a pity.<br/><br/>Ironically, ""Yesterday"" often seems to play best as an ""odd goings on in rural Suffolk"" kind of piece, in this way harking back to ""Whisky Galore"", ""The Titfield Thunderbolt"", ""Passport to Pimlico"" and other gently whimsical British offerings of the Ealing Comedy kind. So the fact that this film's universe extends to LA and Moscow looks a little incrongruous, even as these locations are theoretically necessary for the plot development.<br/><br/>The idea that the non-existence of ""The Beatles"" would not necessarily denote the non-existence of individual band members was one that sci-fi fans could see from miles off, and happily it was one the makers ran with to good effect. Surprising, then, that it was ultimately a lookalike of the late Lennon that we got to meet, rather than the very much alive and kicking in real life Sir Paul or Sir Ringo. Neither actually made it into the film, and maybe that's just as well ... or maybe it's not.<br/><br/>The fact that somebody had this great idea, and that it was given some measure of power in the movie is still something we can be grateful for. But many of us out here are aware how key points that needed making, or could have been made, in the context, were not - and that's a saddish waste of a great opportunity."

","I suppose it helps if you are a Beatles fan to appreciate this film, and I am a big Beatles fan. When I was about 5 years old I saw an advert in my Dad's The Daily Mirror for a set of mail order albums by The Beatles and I decided I wanted them. I have no idea why, I had never heard a single Beatles track in my life. I just liked the look and the sound of this 8 album set. None of the 8 were The Beatles actual albums, but more an anthology story of 16 best tracks on each album, and I still have them to this day, approximately forty years later. So I convinced my mum that this was going to be my birthday present and she must have said are you sure? about a hundred times. Yes I was sure, this is what I want.<br/><br/>I remember when they arrived sitting up in my sisters bedroom as she was the only one of us kids who had a record player and from the moment I heard the first track on the first album, Love Me Do I was hooked. A massive Beatles fan I became and I love their music as much today as I did when I was 5 years old.<br/><br/>As I said, unfortunately, being a Beatles fan doesn't really help this film any. I was quite excited about watching Yesterday, 1 - massive Beatles fan, 2 - quite liked the weird premise of the film and everybody knows I like a weird concept and 3 - Danny Boyle directed it and who doesn't like Danny Boyle? Shallow Grave, Trainspotting, The Beach, Slumdog Millionaire, 28 Days Later and the guy who directed live action for the olympics. In my opinion, he's only made one bad film and that was A Life Less Ordinary with Ewen and Cameron. I thought the idea of waking up one minute and nobody remembering The Beatles except you was a nutty idea with so many possibilities. Dissappointingly I think this is Danny's weakest film to date. There is nobody in the cast who smashes a performance that can rescue the film and the script is pretty dire as well. I never knew that Danny Boyle could or would make cheesy films but he has managed to do just that here. I think the fact that Richard Curtis had a hand in this film has injected the typical Hugh Grant type film into the proceedings. Ed Sheehan is in it as himself and the lines that he delivers that are supposed to be funny just aren't. It's obvious from the start that the love interest will work. At one point you think things are going to Strat to get interesting at a press conference when someone waves a yellow submarine in the air and shouts out who was your favourite, John, Paul, George or Ringo but even that part of the storyline seems to get bottled which would have been fun.<br/><br/>Robert Carlyle pops up to make a cameo as John Lennon but he can't master the Scouse accent and simply sounds the Scotsman that he is. The best thing about the movie os obviously the Beatles music. I wanted to love this film but sadly I didn't. What was good is that as soon as it finished I dug out my copy of 1+ on Blu-ray and watched the real Fab Four doing what they do best, mop tops and all. A disappointing 5/10."

","Review:
'Yesterday' is a romantic-comedy film directed by Danny Boyle.
The story flows nicely with related characters that are well developed. It's not what I expected from the trailer, but I ended up liking it better than what I expected. It's nice to see someone take a chance on an original story.
It focuses around Jack Malik (Himesh Patel) who is a struggling singer-songwriter. His manager and childhood friend Ellie Appleton (Lily James) tries to encourage him not to give up on his dreams. After Jack is hit by a bus during a global blackout, he sings ""Yesterday"" for his friends, and discovers they have never heard of The Beatles. After realising the world no longer remembers the band, Jack begins performing their songs, passing them off as his own.
All actors are really good, but I absolutely adore Lily James. I think she is brilliant it everything she is in and this movie is definitely no exception. She's funny in the movie and when she cries, she makes you want to cry. She shines in her character and steals every scene she is in.
I wanted to give this movie the best score, but after thinking about it more I can't. The reason being, as a comedy the movie didn't work. For me none of the jokes landed, and mostly just came off as awkward. Looking at this film as a drama or romantic film is where it really shines and is more enjoyable.
Overall, this is a good fantasy film with a very good soundtrack, if you like The Beatles.
4/5"
"antonio-derani","6","0","2","1 November 2019"," I don't know who wrote all those songs, but they saved the movie!! :D :D ;D
","Jokes aside, while it was great to hear the songs I grew up loving (I'm 49), I felt a little disappointed about the script (dull) and some of the acting. They wasted what otherwise could be a great concept for a movie.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. The movie is ok, go and watch it, it deserves. Some movies were not born to be great but to be average, and that's ok, we watch them anyway, have a good time and then go eat something and sleep, forgetting them the next morning.<br/><br/>But... A movie about the Beatles songs should not be just average.<br/><br/>I stand to my first statement: the songs saved the movie."

","Following a global power outage that lasted 12 seconds, the world remains without many things of notoriety, of which nobody remembers anything. About The Beatles, only three people can remember , of which only one can interpret their famous songs that can bring him the fame, Jack Malick (Himesh Patel)."

","In a time when we're surrounded by movies inspired by different discographies, this is definitely a winner. The story is sweet as are all the characters.<br/><br/>NB: Ed Sheeran playing himself is redeemed after his appearance on Game of Thrones."
"oasomera","9","0","3","28 October 2019"," A clever reminder of just how powerful this music was
","It's difficult to guess how this movie will be understood by those who weren't alive when these songs were released, but for me and people my age, each song lovingly rendered here evokes a wave of emotion. I really hadn't realized how devoid of joy my youth might have been without the Beatles, but after watching this, it's hard to deny.<br/><br/>These are great songs but there's still a lot of mystery as to why they were so effective. Perhaps one day we will have an explanation but for now it's quite moving to relive their first hearing like this.<br/><br/>It's hard to imagine someone other than Himesh Patel as the lead here mostly because his voice is so perfect for the Beatles songbook and his personality shines through, but I imagine some will have a problem with someone of apparent Indian descent being the musical hero. Most will quickly be won over aided by his singing and by Lily James' glowing performance.<br/><br/>All in all a near miraculous movie for which Danny Boyle deserves much praise."

A bit 'British', so you have to stick with it and the very best of it comes after the half way mark.
Thank goodness that it wasn't another one of these biopic things coming out right now, rather a really sweet, fun-filled delightful movie that anyone, and this is rare - kids, grannies, parents, the lot - can go and see and love.
An absolute must-see for an enjoyable time even if you really don't know who the Beatles are. If you're out there, enjoy the sensation of their music!"
"Benjamin-M-Weilert","5","0","1","14 October 2019"," A disappointment with a killer Beatles soundtrack.
","When I saw the first trailers for Yesterday (2019), I had some high hopes for this movie. The premise of only one person remembering The Beatles in a world where this famous band didn't exist was intriguing enough by itself to warrant a watch. Plus, with Danny Boyle directing, I had perhaps anticipated more than what I actually got. It's hard to hate a movie with such a great soundtrack full of Beatles songs, but the execution of the entire idea left me wanting a bit more and breaking my suspension of disbelief on more than one occasion.<br/><br/>Back in high school, I had a history assignment to perform a thought experiment similar to Yesterday: what happens if The Beatles didn't exist? Instead of just being a weird gap in the cultural zeitgeist, I think this movie would have done better to see the amount of influence the band had throughout the music industry. Sure, some moments highlight how The Beatles wouldn't be able to do what they did back then in today's music recording environment, but I don't think this went far enough to show how revolutionary they were.<br/><br/>On top of everything else, other loose ends seemed to be added in with no real explanation or reason. I would have been fine with just one person remembering the Beatles, but the movie thought otherwise. Similarly, why are several other famous brands and pop culture items missing from this world? These seemed to distract from the main thrust of the film, which should have been exclusively about The Beatles. I also didn't appreciate the hackneyed romantic subplot that was so far from realistic as to be an insult to all relationships everywhere. In the end, I was disappointed with the result of a great idea that was never fully explored.<br/><br/>A disappointment with a killer Beatles soundtrack, I give Yesterday 2.5 stars out of 5."

","Positive: Creative storytelling however how & why so selective a removal from history of certain pop items (Beatles; Coke; Potter) could have used a bit more reasonable explaining, but then too it was fantasy. Sampling the vast compilation was a pleasure. One twisty toward the end was a surprise, but welcomed.
Negatives: The romantic hook was overused, and placed just to meet demographic monied demands. The other twisty (confession) toward the end not sure it was needed/helpful, or would have been understood, and even meaningless. A better alternative would be to have given their names as co-producers of the songs.
Neutral: Can't decide if the inadequate singing helped other than it allowed viewers to focus more on the lyrics & less on the performer."

Bottom line, if you want a great movie to watch (and lets face it not many coming out these days) then I would recommend ""Yesterday.""

","The theme of the story is interesting in that it alludes to things that are familiar to us, with the viewer thinking that this guy is incapable in his life, much like his musical career, but actually his speedy successes came with his own touch on things.<br/><br/>But when you finally find out who he is, what he used to do for a living, any condemnation at a wasted life dissipate and you grow to love his character more. Given the turnover rate in that industry, we would find their highly trained staff in all areas of society. Given the life he led after the bump on the head, I started to wonder if the external forces causing the shift were less physical and instead work pressure related leading to a psychotic break. In a thankless profession, here the character just wants to be appreciated. What he does isn't really bad since many in the music field buy their song material from innovative creators and then put their face and name to it.<br/><br/>There were a few interesting points alluded to, for the viewer to take in and think about. From the claustrophobic stalkers representing the stress of being found out as not good enough to do your job, to stereotypical assumptions of blue collar service sector workforces, and the imagery of the assumed happiness of middle class professionals (who were quite laid back, not overblown, perfect characters.) Just human. Everyone is human. And I think the director wants us to examine all living and think about what roles we have in life, the unlikelihood of fame, and ultimately the price to be paid.

","For the Beatles aficionados out there the Beatles' back catalogue is like the stone tablets; sacrosanct. And so whoever dares to touch, feel or alter such a catalogue needs to tread very, very lightly. Each note, lyric, instrument and recording are the soundtracks to lives, and hold such gravitas in peoples hearts. Therefore, whoever would be so brave as to tackle the mammoth task of making a full feature length movie about there never being a 'Beatles' had to either be certifiably insane, or a Beatles junkie who could do the story justice.<br/><br/>A struggling singer songwriter Jack Malik (Himesh Patel's big screen debut) is on the verge of an early musical retirement, much to the dismay of childhood friend a manager Ellie (Lily James). A worldwide blackout suddenly occurs and in those 12 seconds Jack is hit by a bus, leaving him with the ability to be the only human who remembers The Beatles (amongst other things) - Just roll with it. Once Jack discovers this phenomena (during a 'singalong' to yesterday which nobody knew) the journey begins wherein he tries to recreate the Beatles' back catalogue. This is of course a painstaking process, and 'tries' is the perfect word to describe the ordeal. He is then faced with guilt and stardom as the lyrics and melodies start to flow, and 'Beatlemania' sweeps the world.<br/><br/>This monumental task was left to none other than Mr Richard Curtis to develop the plot, whom is no stranger to either comedy or indeed musicals (most notably Mama Mia and Pirate Radio). Screenwriters don't get mentioned enough in big productions as the director usually takes centre stage and reaps the rewards. However, Yesterday needs to be an exception because it is one thing to have a concept, but it is another to then make it tangible so that it doesn't become a gimmick or loose its charm too quickly. To say that this movie is predictable is utterly ridiculous, there is a genuine level of surprise in each and every scene - which is just fabulous.<br/><br/>Yesterday is indisputably hilarious. Himesh does a brilliant job of allowing himself to get swept up in subtle disbelief of the whole ordeal which is hilarious in itself. Alongside that the actual recreation of the songs themselves still pay homage to the originals; which was evidently important to everyone involved in the movie. There are of course some scenes which fall slightly flat, however this is simply a matter of taste - may that be comedic or scripting. Having said that, for a Beatle fan it is brilliant to experience people experiencing these magnificent songs for the first time in the movie. Director Danny Boyle has done a great job in capturing the genuine level of excitement, admiration and glee on peoples faces upon hearing these songs, and it's tangible!<br/><br/>This is without a doubt a polished film, which as mentioned can work to its disadvantage in certain scenes. Perhaps that is exactly what Richard and Boyle were going for, in creating a translatable modern depiction of The Beatles and their songs. It certainly isn't offensive, just a good crowdpleaser which gives audiences the space to react in anyway they see fit. You can laugh, cry or just sit and take it in - it's up to you. Beatles fans should not be weary of Yesterday instead should appreciate the level of integrity this movie has through its cast, direction and scripting."

","I was really looking forward to this movie given its unique premise but was disappointed with the weak storyline, over the top acting and lack of laughs.<br/><br/>The continued vanishing of additional pop culture ""names"" were pointless and didn't generate laughs or add to the plot.<br/><br/>In fact the plot meanders with our hero caught between his moral dilemma, childhood love interest and a yearning for success. Similarly the plot meanders between a soppy and superficial love story, a musical and a very poor attempt at comedy.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the film is saved, in part, by the forgotten heroes, The Beatles. Their music joyously punctuates this otherwise soporific offering.<br/><br/>Watch it if you're a fan of The Beatles but don't expect a good movie."

","As a lover of Danny Boyle films i won't go over the top with this movie. However, billed as the ""feel good film of the summer"", one has to go along with that and after watching this delightful fantasy rom-com, it was a pleasurable 1hr 50 mins of cinema. Written by the ever credible Richard Curtis, this story line tells the tale of Jack, a Suffolk musician, struggling to get any serious credibility in his music, playing at small time gigs and bars until one day he encounters an accident with a bus whilst riding his bicycle. He ends up in hospital with a head injury and wakes to find he appears to be the only person in the world that has heard of or known of the existence of The Beatles. This is a fabulous story line and credit where it is due, Danny Boyle and Richard Curtis have made a winner here in my eyes. There are some great scenes of the Suffolk Coast and indeed into Norfolk in England as well as Liverpool and Hollywood. My favourite scene is when Jack re-creates that famous roof top Saville Row Beatles concert in London, although in this case it is on the beach in Gorleston On Sea, my home town. Suffice to say my old school chum, Ian, owns and runs The Pier Hotel, where this scene is filmed and it is a delight to watch this as Jack performs a terrific punk version of ""Help"". There are some great songs and if you were like me born in the 60s, you will be more than familiar with most of them especially as i grew up listening to the band. I adore the scene where Jack & Ellie discover a delightful recording studio right out in the middle of nowhere next to a busy railway line and this turns out to be the old railway station cottage at Buckingham in Norfolk. As the trains whiz by they belt out many songs from The Beatles catalogue and you can't help but foot tap along to them. I've watched this film for the 3rd time in my local cinema, The Palace, in Gorleston High Street, having previously seen it in London and incidentally The Palace is where Danny Boyle held the local premier of this movie along with Richard Curtis, Ed Sheeran and Kate McKinnon whom i thought were terrrific in the film. I guess this film will appeal to those aged 30 or over as anyone under that age may not be at all familiar with The Beatles, but don't be put off by that, this is still one of those fabulous rom-coms that is a delight to watch. This film will stay in the memory for many in the not too distant future and i guess when the DVD appears, many people will be stop freezing to see if they can spot themselves of the 6400 extras that were used on Gorleston Beach in the summer of 2018."

","Ever since I began my studies into film, I've heard the commonly negative attitude towards simplistic story ideas, with many people often pushing for bigger and more complex ideas. But ultimately, a simple premise can be a strong factor towards a film's success. Which is exactly the case with Danny Boyle's latest release, Yesterday, which left an instant impact on me, thanks to it's well crafted plotline, especially since it's an idea that is so easy to create, yet nobody has gone to this extent before.<br/><br/>Now the basic outline of struggling musician, Jack Malik (Hemish Patel) recovering from an accident to find he is the only person to remember anything about legendary pop act, The Beatles, and then using his knowledge to essentially reintroduce their work to the world is so simplistic on paper, and could easily turn people away at the cheesy premise. But ultimately, it's the simple premise that also makes it endlessly intriguing. I was constantly hooked on the journey of Patel's character, and really felt my heartstrings being tugged at, whenever they delved into the chemistry between Jack and childhood friend, Ellie. (Lily James)<br/><br/>Now, the way this premise gets kick-started can be very questionable for the sceptical audience members among us. But the film doesn't put focus on what caused the scenario Jack is in, but instead, follows the inevitable situations Jack faces, when he suddenly becomes the only person in Britain to seemingly know about these classic pop songs. In the end, the narrative takes a really heart-warming and unpredictable turn in the final act, avoiding many outcomes that many audiences members (myself included) could have easily predicted.<br/><br/>Lily continues to demonstrates her fantastic and effortless acting skills, demonstrating emotions that many of us feel when it comes to those we truly care about. As someone who has often found it hard to express strong feelings towards others, I truly understand how much emotional pain Ellie is dealing with, thanks to Lily James' portrayal of those emotions. As well as that, Patel's transition to film from TV is also effortless. His acting is full of charm and dry-British wit. As with Lily James, Patel demonstrates the built up emotions and feelings, and the struggle to open up about them properly.<br/><br/>The use of celebrities being featured as themselves can easily tarnish a film's reputation, thankfully this is not the case with the inclusion of British musical legend, Ed Sheeran, who is a welcome addition to this narrative, without being overbearing. And while others may criticise his performance as being dry when compared to the more passion driven performances from the likes of Patel and James, it must be remembered that Sheeran isn't playing a character, but instead is appearing as himself within the narrative. And since Sheeran has never been shown to be a loud and performative person, it would be very juxtaposing to have him behave differently in the film, compared to how our society sees him.<br/><br/>Production values are top notch throughout the film, with the two biggest highlights being the work of editor, Jon Harris, and cinematographer, Christopher Ross. Ross's sublime use of space and colour leaves every frame full of vibrancy and well angled moments, leaving few shots with unnecessary dead space. Harris' editing compliments Ross' camera work, utilising fast cutting, overlaid shots, and documentary style split-screen, which helps draw the audience into some of the film's biggest moments.<br/><br/>Now, obviously, if you don't like the sound of a film that relies on a simplistic and cheesy premise, then you've probably made your mind up by now. But for those still on the fence, consider giving this film a try. It's still a well-made and endlessly lovable British film, destined to be a classic among the ranks of other fantastic British films. You'll be entranced by the powerhouse performances, beautiful emotional beats and an endlessly fascinating plot-thread.<br/><br/>SCORES

"mr_bickle_the_pickle","8","0","1","31 July 2019"," YESTERDAY....I saw this movie :P
","I really enjoyed this film up until the last 10-15 min of the film. I thought it was completely original. I also liked that it wasn't just The Beatles that didnt exist. Theres a bit of running gag where Jack (Himesh Patel) will ask for something or mention something and the others will go ""Huh, what are you talking about"". It was funny, it was charming, I laughed and had a smile on my face throughout. I even thought there was some really nice cinematography in here too.<br/><br/>The reason why I think the ending dragged my enjoyment down. Besides a cheesy montage thrown in. And this is where a spoiler comes in....is that he finally announces to this huge stadium that he actually hasnt written any of these songs, it was done by The Beatles (which of course no ones know). However, this doesnt really cause him any conflict. Except for his manager but thats mainly because shes money obsessed. The whole crowd that has just learned he's a liar still ooohs and awwws over him. He gets the girl. Even the boyfriend of the girl is basically all ""Oh...schucks, you guys are so a cute couple"". I mean I get thats not the main lesson he had to learn. It was more about that success doesnt mean dollar bills or being super famous, its about the people you surround yourself with...blah blah blah, but it still just didnt ring true to me. I think I would have been more accepting of him getting away with lying and taking credit for other artists work, if maybe there was another power surge and that kind of reset what happened. He can still retain the knowledge he has learned and he gets a proper do-over.<br/><br/>I also feel like this film suckles Ed Sheeran's dongle a bit. Don't get me wrong, I do like Ed Sheeran. But they make him out to be like he's the biggest and most best artist out there. Like theres a seriously a scene where its like ""Can you challenge me, Ed Sheeran, in a song writing competition? Bet you can't"". And like after this song writing scene, Ed literally has a line where he's like ""Now, I know what its like to be Salieri"". And his manager is constantly ragging on Jack for not looking like a star...but have you seen Ed Sheeran...he doesnt look like a star or dress like one either. I dont know why he gets a pass. Im sure Ed was fine with poking a bit of fun at himself...but I dont know. It just made me want to go ""Calm down, even in a world without The Beatles, it doesnt make you number 1"".<br/><br/>I would also maybe change up the relationship with Ellie (Lily James) and Jack. There was more than one scene where they do the dance of ""Why wont you love me...oh its too late"". I think I would have maybe cut out the first moment in the bedroom, cause I feel like it cuts out some of the impact later. But I would say those are my main gripes. I otherwise really liked this film, and could see it being in my top 10 later this year.<br/><br/>I'd give it an 8.5"

","A sweet movie about love, ""the poisoned chalice of fame and money"", reality (in several senses) and honesty with self and others. And the Beatles' music.<br/><br/>During a balckout (never fully explained, but who cares), Jack Malik (3rd rate struggling musician) is transported to an alternative timeline in which the Beatles never formed a band. He's the only one who knows their music, and he builds a career by presenting their songs as his own. The story ends happily, with a couple of nicely done reveals that (almost) explain what actually happened. Along the way, there are some pretty good covers of Beatles songs (none of them complete, unfortunately), some neat riffs on the evils of fame and fortune, and a love story holding the whole thing together.<br/><br/>Acting: first rate, including the roles of the (inevitable) stereotypes. Cinematography: competent, with no pretensions. Story line: plausible. Writing: very good, its main strength being dialogue that doesn't aspire to Great Thoughts.<br/><br/>Some reviewers think the movie falls over the edge into sentimentality, but I disagree.

"aidanratesmovies","8","0","1","30 July 2019"," Not the best, but certainly enjoyable
","Yesterday is the classic film version of too good to be true, but not all is lost in this upbeat concept about a world without The Beatles. Sure, there is a large pacing issue without, which makes the film feel like it is going too fast while at the same time moving too slow. Sure, there is also an issue with the transition between scenes, and editing throughout, but in terms of whether I enjoyed the film, whether I smiled and laughed throughout it, I would still have to say yes. The film has heart, and I would be lying if it also didn't feel inspiring as well. The film has humor, and though some of it doesn't land from its bland and overly harsh portrayals of music business stereotypes, most if it besides that does. All in all, Yesterday is certainly not a perfect film, but it is perfectly enjoyable for anyone that is a fan of The Beatles, or really music in general, or anyone who just wants to have a good time at the movies.

First Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Yesterday. Imagine if you woke up in a world that didn't remember The Beatles. What would you do with that knowledge. After a freak blackout which caused him to be knocked off his bike by a bus, Jack Malik wakes up in hospital in precisely that situation. Malik, played by Himesh Patel, along with his longtime friend and manager Ellie (Lily James) are struggling to get his musical career off the ground. Post accident Jack finds nobody remembers The Beatles and not aiming to conquer the world he sets himself on a path to share their songs with the masses. He is at best a mediocre musician, but with a little help from his friends, and Ed Sheeran, he becomes bigger than.......well....Ed Sheerann. This is great example of how the great machine can take over and how a little cog is made to seem so insignificant, when in fact it's the little cogs that work hard to keep the whole thing together. From the stable of Danny Boyle this is a refreshing film, without profanity and violence and is a great watch from start to finish."

"dromasca","8","0","1","24 July 2019"," 'All You Need Is Love'?
","If they create a category of ""best idea for a film"" at the Academy Awards, ""Yesterday"" directed by Danny Boyle would undoubtedly be a formidable competitor this year. The starting point of this movie, which is part of the wave of musical films that have brought this genre back to the preferences of the audiences in the last two years and made some nice cash as well is the hypothesis of a world in which the Beatles have never existed. Does this sound like a dystopia? To appease your fears I will add that after the imaginary event (but in fact very possible - an electromagnetic solar source pulse with catastrophic effects on people's memory and on the machines they created) a few other landmarks of Western civilization, including Coca-Cola, are almost forgotten by most of mankind. Well, Pepsi and the Rolling Stones survive, but I assure you that this is not a catastrophes movie.<br/><br/>The film's hero, a mediocre amateur musician, is almost the only one on the face of Earth who seems to have been spared by this selective amnesia. When sharing with the people around him the Beatles songs, the cultural shock has mixed effects, but eventually they claim back the audiences on the planet, and also make our hero a world celebrity, one of those who fill the stadiums and sell music on all channels and available media. The first part of the movie works well, at least for those who know the music and agree that the genius of the Beatles is equivalent to that of Mozart. I'm not sure about the impact of the movie among younger audiences. I saw the film in a movie hall where part of the viewers were teenagers who were probably more familiar with the figure and music of Ed Sheeran (who has quite a substantial cameo role), and they seemed a little confused. After all, if you did not hear 'Hey, Jude' for several decades, why wouldn't it work as well, or even better as 'Hey Dude'?<br/><br/>The movie asks explicitly or implicitly some questions about the Beatles. What caused their phenomenal success and the way they changed the course of pop and rock music in a few years of intense activity (compositions, recordings, concerts)? Just or mainly their music, or their personalities, their way of being and dressing, the scandals created by them and especially around them? The authors of the film seem to support the thesis of the importance of music, and hence the choice of a relatively anonymous actor (Himesh Patel) who creates a sincere and super-naive character, charismatic only through the music that we know well, does not belong to him. The Today of ""Yesterday"" is our time, with the advertising machines and the image makers who can invent stars but can also destroy the lives of those behind the shining masks. As the story progresses, the movie loses speed and slips into little compelling melodrama which cannot be saved even by Lily James, the beautiful and talented actress, known from theater plays on the best English scenes.<br/><br/>""Yesterday"" is a must-see movie for Beatles fans. The first part is superb. The continuation belongs to the 'feel-good genre and, despite the attempts to preserve originality, it disappointed me a little. 'All You Need Is Love'?

"Ant-ManSalinas","7","0","1","22 July 2019"," A Critique on ""Yesterday""
","I know I'm incredibly late to the game on reviewing this movie, but Yesterday was a movie I was looking forward to seeing based off the concept alone. Let me start by saying that I'm not the biggest fan of musical biopics, because it's rather difficult to write intriguing and surprising elements. I don't want to open a can of worms on a movie that's already been polarized by millions, but I'm actually one of the few people who enjoyed Bohemian Rhapsody. Yes, I'm fully aware of some of the awful things that it does, such as that one scene where there are like sixty cuts or something, simply ignoring a handful of movies (Flash Gordon mainly) or other artists they collabed with, and also having the time of events (such as album releases or when Freddie gets AIDS) to be very confusing and also disappointing. Although there was much room for improvement and shouldn't have been nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars, I also thought that as a one time or even two time watch it was more than decent, and I still find Rami Malek's performance to be truly incredible. This is the main reason I was looking forward to seeing Yesterday, because I thought that they found a really creative way to solve the usual tropes of musical biopics, and also have its own unique and original story behind it. I also really like the director behind it, as he made one of my favorite movies of all time, that being Steve Jobs. So, after seeing it and letting it resonate in my mind for about a week and a half or so, I could say that it definitely isn't perfect but isn't awful either. I do think that this is better than Bohemian Rhapsody, but I also didn't enjoy it as much as Rocketman. I thought that this movie was good, but nothing higher or lower than that. I think I have more to say about my personal flaws than my pros, but I do want to point out some of the things I loved about this movie. I love how we got to see the main character interact with John Lennon in this alternate timeline and see one of his biggest idols right in front of him. I thought it was handled very well especially considering that if it wasn't handled the way it was, it could've easily came across as insulting and disrespectful to Lennon's legacy and life. I also really enjoyed the idea of people and items and food just randomly disappearing, not just the Beatles. That made it feel more real to me although the plot isn't really realistic itself, which is just impressive I think. But that leads me into my biggest problem with the movie, and although it could be marked as a major nitpick, I still think it's an important character detail that just went unnoticed. Why does the main character want people to remember the Beatles? He's pretty much the only person in this world that knows about everything that just vanished off the face of the earth, so why does he want specially want the Beatles to be remembered? There's never a moment where he explains why he's doing this, all we get is that they have amazing music. I'm not trying to disregard the impact the Beatles have had, they're one of my favorite bands of all time. It's just never made clear why he choose the certain thing he did, while he could've done the same thing with anything else such as Harry Potter or Coca Cola or Oasis or any other musical artist that vanished. That part seemed to be unfocused to me, and I also think it would've done a lot to establish the main character's story even more. Another problem I have is that the editing in the beginning of the movie appears to be VERY sloppy edited. It threw me off at first and I thought to myself ""Oh, maybe this is just the style the director wanted."" But it really isn't... because they drop that style within the next ten or fifteen minutes. It felt more rushed to me than anything which I found to be disappointing. My last real complaint is that I found the whole thing with Ed Sheeran to be kinda forgettable? I think that he has a really promising start when he's first introduced, because when he hears our main character perform a song he realizes to himself that he isn't going to be as good as he can be anymore, which led our main character (Sorry I forgot his name) to feel guilty about stripping away the glory of other musicians that have stayed behind. I thought that was a very interesting start to his arc and could've been DEEPLY explored, but the movie literally forgets that it started this arc and Ed comes back into the movie like an hour later and he's just fine again? It felt very jarring to me and didn't make much sense. Overall, I really enjoyed everything else in Yesterday. I thought that it was a really sweet movie about finding love and purpose to yourself, and about finding your place in the world. I thought everyone in the movie did a good job, except for Kate McKinnon who was just okay for me. I would totally recommend this to someone if they're looking for something interesting to watch, and I wouldn't mind owning the movie on blu ray. I think that more people should go out to support it, and I wouldn't mind seeing it again. 7/10. It's good. Go see it if you haven't."

","When the movie Yesterday ended not a single person in the theater moved, no one got up to leave and it wasn't in anticipation of a post credit clip, so what gives ?
I think it was because , regardless of expectations, the movie delivered thrice. First it was entertaining, next, it reminded ( me at least) of the power that music has in peoples lives and finally it payed respect to the notion there there is something sacred about what the Beatles brought into the world.
Love it or hate it, which appears to be the consensus here for reviews, this nod to hallowed Beatlemania was fair and overdue ."
"elicopperman","7","0","1","22 July 2019"," Lighthearted Fun with an Underdeveloped Premise
","Some of my favorite types of films are those that take a struggling individual and put them in a surreal fantasy-like situation unlike anything on Earth. In the case of this film, it follows a struggling musician who, after an accident, becomes the only person to remember the Beatles, and then becomes famous for taking credit on their songs. That premise alone could create one of the greatest films of all time, and with screenwriter Richard Curtis (Four Weddings & a Funeral) and director Danny Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire) on board, this would seem like a sure fire hit. However, while it was by no means bad, it could have used less familiarity and more substance.<br/><br/>Now admittedly, the best aspect of the film has to be the main character, Jack Malick, goes through as the only person to not only know the Fab Four's work, but also debatably carrying on their legacy by singing their songs. While he does have a predictable outcome with his manager/friend Ellie whom both have feelings for each other, it does give him growth in deciding between living either a ginormous lie or a simple life of happiness and solitude. In addition, Himesh Patel does a fantastic job lending his acting talents and surprisingly good singing range as Jack, and his performance alone practically carries the film on its shoulders. Everyone else does a really good job, including Lily James as the sweet albeit concerned Ellie, Joel Fry as the juvenile slacker friend Rocky, Kate McKinnon as the hysterical and overbearing manager Deborah, and both Sanjeev Bhaskar and Meera Syal as Jack's carefree and passive parents. Even Ed Sheeran displays some notable sincerity and subtle emotions through his performance alone.<br/><br/>However, the one major flaw with the film is that it underdeveloped its incredible concept to focus more on Jack's stressful career and feelings for Ellie. Aside from Jack, there are two other people in the film who still remember The Beatles, and they alone should have had much more screen time. Later on, it's revealed that John Lennon didn't die and instead lived a simple obscure life with his spouse. In all honesty, the film would have been a lot more unique if it explored the idea of being in a world where the band did not exist and Jack starts over with their work, with the other two helping him discover what went wrong. Instead, the film seems to sideline that potentially grand storyline for a standard rom-com scenario. However, in spite of all that, the film still has a very charming feel to it all, much of which is captivated by the acting and live singing. The lighthearted nature of it all is definitely enough to put a lot of smiles on Beatles fans and general audiences.<br/><br/>In terms of notable production values, the editing can be fast paced whenever it's being timed to the songs. The vibrant usage of colors help elevate the effects in the music video-like scenes as well as the quick cuts, long pans, dutch angles, wide shots and other cinematography tricks to keep the film on a leisurely pace. Interestingly enough, often when the film plays a song, it can go up to a very loud rate, but then it all stops and even quiets down in any scene right afterwards to give some closure and let the viewers rest. It's a nice little bonus when the sound mixing compliments the musical accompaniment with striking vitality and smooth transitions. It's a nice little touch that some movies have forgotten to do nowadays. Also, it's somewhat cliched how the film depicts England as either mundane or urban, but it does create a nice contrast between the much more bright and wild Los Angeles and how overly commercialized it is, fitting with the film's theme of turning into something you're not.<br/><br/>It is a tad disappointing that such a premise was not explored in its execution further, but the film at least has it heart in the right place. Overall, while Yesterday does sell its concept short for a routine rom-com storyline and some questionable narrative flaws, the charming acting, lighthearted tone and splendid singing performances to make the film enjoyable enough to watch. If you're looking for a film that delves into such an oddball premise like this flick has, then you might want to find something else. However, if you're just in for some harmless and goofy fun that still pays tribute to the legacy of the Fab Four, then you'll have a pleasant experience. Maybe in the future we'll experience a movie that explores this concept further, but until then, we can all let it be."

","This movie is clearly not to be taken too seriously. There's no need to pick it apart and look for plot holes and unexplained things, because it is just a light hearted comedy. Funnier than i expected without being cheesy or cringey. The actors and actresses are doing a great job delivering these lines. One of a few movies that actually made me (and everyone in the cinema) laugh out loud instead of just the occasional chuckles. The only down side is there's not enough Beatles songs playing! Only snipets!"
"info-891-531070","6","0","1","21 July 2019"," Fantastic premise.
","The premise is a fantastic one. In fact, it is often debated in the music industry as to whether The Beatles would attain the success they received in the current oversaturated music climate amidst an era of people with smaller attention spans that are less 'innocent' and vastly harder to please than their 60's counterparts.
So a world where only one musician knows that the Beatles and their incredible catalogue existed is a notion really worth exploring to it's fullest.
However, it seemed to play second fiddle to the romance plot.<br/><br/>If you're to make a film about the music of one of the most influential and innovative bands in history, then there's an expectation for the film to also be somewhat innovative.
Sadly, it isn't.
Instead it is a repetitive formulaic clichÃ© caused by a hebetudinous script.
So let's not mistake this for what it could have been to what it actually is: it's a straight forward RomCom.<br/><br/>It's saving grace was that, due to the awesome premise, the brilliant music of the Fab Four could be relived as if you're introducing someone to the Beatles songs for the first time.<br/><br/>The acting performances from all the cast were outstanding, which also helped hold the audience attention and lead Hamish Patel did an absolute sterling job of performing the songs we all know and love.
Kate McKinnon never fails to garner a chuckle with her delivery, Lily James steals every scene she is in with her magnetism and Joel Fry was on point with his character.<br/><br/>There were enough funny scenes throughout (mostly in the first half) and enough chemistry between Hamish & Lily to keep us happy to see the film to it's obvious conclusion.<br/><br/>Why do romcom's feel the need to make the protagonists such pure beings that they feel compelled to do public confessions of their own wrongdoings?<br/><br/>I really wanted to love this film more, so it's unfortunate to witness all the hard work put in by all the cast and crew be downgraded due to Richard Curtis' script."

","I'll not review the movie because plenty of people have already do that. I'll simply tell you why you should go see it.
I'm not an overall fan of the Beatles, just their hits, of which 20 were secured but only 17 were used. This movie isn't the director, Danny Boyle. It isn't Himesh Patel or Lily James. It isn't Ed or Sophia, or Ellise or Joel. It isn't the predictable storyline, or even music beloved by the world. It isn't any of those things. It is the much greater sum total of all those things done well that make this predictable story not only fun to watch, but to actually enjoy! This a movie I would actually own at full price, and you're reading this from a guy whose last purchase was from the $5 DVD bin at Walmart a few years ago!
The only questions I have begin with this: how could the fact that the ENTIRE Earth comes COMPLETELY dark for 12 seconds not be questioned ONCE in the entire movie? That is an entire movie in and of itself. Did they forget that little fact, along with Coke, Harry Potter, the band Oasis, and cigarettes?
Or maybe there is a sequel, ""Yesterday 2, Tomorrow""."

","I saw a lot of one star reviews here for this movie, which could give a person cause to pause before going to a theater to see it. But I have learned that one star ratings, especially those of just one or two sentences (worst movie ever! etc.) usually have nothing to do with quality and everything to do with, um, let's just say 'other considerations.'<br/><br/>So anyway, I really enjoyed this movie. I had to accept that it is a fantasy rather than sci-fi, because sci-fi usually tries to give some sort or explanation for why something happens but here we just take it as it is. The dialogue is mostly witty and fun, and the characters got my sympathy. I had a slight problem with the two lead characters having always been platonic, but I was able to put that aside. Plus I really liked seeing the third lead character, the Mini Cooper (okay, yes, I have owned one for nearly twenty years).<br/><br/>One reviewer stated that the ending was totally predictable, and part of it was, but another part astonished me in its originality, so I have to disagree with that assessment. And yes, most of the songs presented were better when the Beatles did them, but just set that fact aside and enjoy this harmless and entertaining film. Oh, and if the thought of someone of a non-white ethnicity singing these songs makes you rage with explanation points, just give it a one star review without bothering to type the obligatory hateful review."

","Jack Malik is an enthusiastic but unsuccessful singer/songwriter from Lowestoft, supported endlessly by his biggest, and often only, fan and would-be manager (and old school friend and wistful unrequited lover) Elle. Then, one night, strange events result in Jack being the only person in the world who remembers The Beatles. And The Beatles' songs prove to be just as memorable when Jack delivers them as they were in some other reality. But is Jack doing the right thing, achieving success on the back of someone else's talent, even if those people never showed that talent in this reality?<br/><br/>There are three narrative strands running through this movie. One, Jack's rags to riches success story. Two, the morality of trading on stolen songwriting. And, three, the underlying love story. All three work, and Richard Curtis' script is as gentle but sharp as one might expect it to be. The emotional heart of the film is the love story, but the dramatic heart is Jack's ever-increasing guilt, and the elements which factor into the resolution of this are enormously satisfying. And they brought tears to this old Beatles fan's eyes.<br/><br/>All the cast are good. Himesh Patel delivers the songs pleasingly, but all the supporting cast excel in, yes, giving support, especially an uncredited (and unrecognisable) Robert Carlyle.<br/><br/>I found this film enormously satisfying."
"david-meldrum","7","0","2","19 July 2019"," Funny But Ultimately Lacks Something Crucial
","If I had a desert island director, it would be Danny Boyle. I can't say the same for Richard Curtis in the writers' department, but that's not to say I don't like many of his films. But on many levels they seem to be an odd fit for each other - Boyle loves to put his audiences through a tough journey to reach any sort of emotional journey. With Richard Curtis, it's all about enjoying a ride we more or less know the route of from the beginning. When Curtis is good, he's very good; when he's bad ... we'll, he writes The Boat That Rocked. The two of them coming them together for Yesterday - a feelgood romantic comedy around the music of The Beatles, which can be remembered by only one person in the world - is enough to make me worry that we'll be landed with a film which is neither Curtis-enough nor Boyle-enough.<br/><br/>That's pretty much what this film ends up being. There are plenty of charming, laugh-out-loud, Curtis moments. There's some of Boyle's style and social commentary. What we don't have any of - and it's crucial to the success of the film - is light-footed whimsy and charm. Both Curtis and Boyle can produce that, but neither of them does so here as if they're both saying 'After you'. There's some fine performances; Ed Sheeran, as himself, is especially funny (I say that as someone who really doesn't like his music); it's to Sheeran's credit that he's willing to satirise himself.<br/><br/>The music is, of course, magnificent; Himesh Patel in the central role carries them off with aplomb - his song renditions are often electrifying. It's just that ultimately this film is neither one thing nor the other."

I hope to see it in the directors cut on Blue Ray. (2) I wished he had made a point to contact ALL the former Beatles members - I would have if in the same situation.

","Despite not being as familiar with the Beatles as everyone else appears to be, I still enjoyed Yesterday quite a bit-- and that is why the film is so good. The film can entertain audiences that aren't necessarily head-over-heels with Abbey Road or yellow submarines or songs about people named Jude. While other contemporary love letters to bands (Bohemian Rhapsody, The Dirt) focus entirely on the band itself, this film honors the Beatles by telling a story of the world without them-- a world in need of a voice to tell their stories. This is where the conflict comes from: does Jack Malik plagiarize the Beatles or not? This premise is fun, lighthearted, and thoroughly enjoyable in execution by Danny Boyle, who clearly understand what this film needs to be.<br/><br/>The film's heart is not the Beatles, it is Jack Malik (the outstanding newcomer Himesh Patel) and the choices he makes. The story/romance between Jack and Ellie is what pushes the film forward, and the Beatles-never-existed premise is merely the vehicle to do so. At the core of this film are two strong performances, a simple message about telling the truth, and a heartwarming love story.<br/><br/>No, the film's cartoonish nature isn't going to blow audiences away. But what the film lacks in terms of originality and depth, it makes up in charm. Yesterday is wholly satisfying to those who want to be satisfied."
"blairchristina","9","0","2","17 July 2019"," Very enjoyable
","This was a good, clean, fun and unpretentious movie. I enjoyed the music, of course, and appreciate the premise of the story - what if you woke up one day to discover that beloved cultural icons had never existed?<br/><br/>The story - talented aspiring singer/songwriter and Beatles fan wakes up in a world where nobody has ever heard of The Beatles. Other cultural icons have also strangely disappeared, and those are interspersed throughout the movie for mild comic effect. So what do you do? Well if you are an aspiring songwriter, you pretend you wrote the songs and let it take you to fame and fortune. Except, of course, there is always the worry that someone, some day, will find you out. The main character remains likeable throughout the story, never quite resting easy and never completely forgetting about the people who believed in.<br/><br/>It's light comedy, and even lighter on the romance. Yes, there's a boy and a girl; and yes, you want them to get together. But the story is not entirely dependent on it, and there's a nice cast of supporting friends and family who add flavor.<br/><br/>And, of course, overlaying all of this is the great music from The Beatles, which the movie, very happily, does not stint on. The budget for the rights alone must have been huge. And our guy can actually sing and does John, Paul, George and Ringo proud.<br/><br/>It all makes for a lovely and entertaining afternoon at the movies, and that's more than I can say for a lot of movies these days."

The premise is after the world forgets the music of The Beatles, one wannabe musician is the only one who remembers them and their music.

He's a great singer and gives the character a wonderful charm. Lily James as Ellie is your Joey Potter 'girl next door in the friend zone' type and plays it well.

I usually like her but this role as the loud mouth unrelatable agent gets more screen time than she deserves - even interrupting the flow of some nice moments with unnecessary dialogue. It would have been better to show the disconnect between the two countries and their approaches to art. Instead all she talks about is taking his money. It's a weird character to have when we are used to Ari Gold-type characters who do anything for the stars they represent.<br/><br/>Boyle gives the movie a modern feel while maintaining some bland hometown backdrops before ramping it up to major stadium performances.<br/><br/>The two leads are fun to watch and if it introduces more people to The Beatles, that can only be a good thing."

"tabuno","7","0","1","15 July 2019"," Not the Beatles
","It's hard to classify Yesterday. It prominently uses Beatle's lyrics and song. It's funny but with a twinge of melancholy. And mostly it's a fantasy of what ifs. It's also predictable with a sad whimsical elemental surprise towards the end. For Beatle purists, this movie would be hard to accept and enjoy. Somehow the interplay between Beatle songs and the movie plot doesn't quite run smoothly and easily play out like Across the Universe (2007). Nor does Yesterday incorporate the creative movie magic that Across the Universe used with a compelling lavish way. This alternative reality fantasy appears to be a somewhat new take on the more oftentimes comedic or dramatized versions of reality such as John Candy's Delirious (1991) or Amazon's The Man in the High Castle series (2015) which make more of their own focused intensity in their delivery. This fusion of so many genres coming together in Yesterday ultimately changes the movie into more of an experimental film genre in progress. As a musical Yesterday doesn't sustain the intimacy of lengthy sweeping musical pieces as experienced in Rocketman (2019), La La Land (2016), Les Miserable, or Chicago (2002). Overall, the movie stands on its own, in its own way, but as a tribute to the Beatles, only the Beatles themselves can really authentically hit the original notes of emotional integrity with their own tributes"

A world event happens and he awakes with a concussion and some missing teeth -- and a changed world in which the Beatles have never existed (among other things). As a songwriter, he decides to try out a few of their songs and, surprise, they are hits! This movie does a good job of showing how corporate greed kills creativity. Had a buddy who was a gifted artist but working for a big marketing company who wanted him in a cubical in a suit with his head phones turned down so as not to bother the other cubical rats, killed his vibe. This movie has some flaws, like most romcoms you find yourself asking ""why not just tell her how you feel"" but it all works itself out. I'd recommend this one."

","I just got out of Yesterday<br/><br/>I loved it. Seriously one of my favourites of the year. I knew Himesh Patel from his work on Eastenders (a show my ex was obsessed with) so it was no surprise to see him be great, and it was nice to see a few other English tv actors pop up too!!<br/><br/>Lily James!! What a babe!! It took me a while to place her, then I realized she was Cinderella In the live action version from a few years ago.<br/><br/>I feared Paul McCartney would turn up at some point, but he didn't"

","Yesterday is just a charming, heartfelt and often touching film. Superbly directed by Danny Boyle, the film is so much more then a feel good movie.<br/><br/>The performances are pitch perfect. Himesh Patel is gold as Jack Malik, not only a great acting performance but his renditions of the classic Beatle's songs are genuinely good. I saw Patel years ago in Eastenders and it's great to see him in this star making turn.<br/><br/>Lily James is just a wonder, she is always solid and she is great here as Ellie, funny, cute and just full of charm. The whole film is just charming and likeable, it's an odd description but its true, the whole picture is just so likeable.<br/><br/>The supporting cast are amazing. Sanjeev Bhaksar and Meera Syal were glorious as Jack's parents, loved seeing them steal the show. Joel Fry was equally spot on as Rocky, he provides most of the laughs and they are genuinely funny, typical Richard Curtis character in all the best possible ways.<br/><br/>I want to give a moment to appreciate Alexander Arnold, I've seen him in quite a few things now 'What Remains', 'The Salvation', 'Capital', 'Save Me' and 'Film Stars Don't Die In Liverpool' and he is just a star. He is great here, he is bloody great in everything, a supporting role nonetheless but he is definitely a star and worthy of so much praise.<br/><br/>Ed Sheeran, Kate McKinnon, James Corden, Sophia Di Martino, Ellise Chappell, Harry Michell, Sarah Lancashire and Justin Edwards were all solid support but the aforementioned cast members are truly the stars.<br/><br/>We head into MAJOR spoiler territory now so be warned:<br/><br/>Robert Carlyle as John Lennon was heartbreaking. The scene itself isn't sad but it was just such a beautiful surprise. Lovely. Absolutely lovely.<br/><br/>The cinematography and editing should be praised, Danny Boyle is a fine director and once again brings a fantastic style to the film.<br/><br/>The story actually contained a few surprises, I loved how it wasn't just The Beatles that disappeared from reality.<br/><br/>The film had such a nice ending and such a nice message, the fact that Jack goes on to reveal he didn't write those songs and becomes a music teacher to just carry on the legacy of their music to the next generation was really poignant. The whole concept is quite poignant and touching which the trailers don't really sell which was a nice surprise in my opinion.<br/><br/>The film is filled with heart, love and such poignancy. I really can't compliment it enough, Richard Curtis has once again produced a charming script that is actually quite layered whilst Danny Boyle has amassed a great ensemble to bring a fantastically feel good movie to life.<br/><br/>Don't listen to those criticising the film for being 'silly' and 'cheesy' watch the picture yourself and understand the deeper layers Curtis has penned within his script. This touching film is a what if scenario..what if one man remembered the Beatles when no one else did...but it's also about so much more."

"capucinedelattre","10","0","2","14 July 2019"," A wonderfully crafted piece of wholesomeness and creativity
","Some movies are just too good to be true. Yesterday is one of them.<br/><br/>Now, let's be clear. I was desperate to like this movie, I wished so hard to love it I was actually convinced I would end up being disappointed in some way.
Turns out, I was wrong. This is a perfect breath of fresh air, a wonderfully crafted piece of wholesomeness and creativity, two hours that manage to conjointly celebrate nostalgia and hope towards the future.
There are so many ways in which this movie could have turned out extremely wrong: we could have been left with the whole ""it was just a dream"" narrative, or quickly sent into a series of catastrophes thrown on Jack's head for his lies. Instead of that, we are granted with what we have been wishing from the very first time we heard about the premise of the movie: incredibly funny misunderstandings, clever details which really constitute the marrow of the movie, loads of music (from the Beatles, but not only, a smart move again), vibrant performances and genuinely heartfelt moments. The directing itself is overloading with fresh, uplifting and stimulating ideas, mixing traditional representations of both romantic comedy and musical biopic, while adding a whole new layer of absurd humor.
The most amazing thing about the film is that not only it doesn't instrumentalize the incredible potential of the Beatles' music (by simply pulling some easy nostalgic strings), but moreover, it manages to celebrate their legacy while letting room for each spectator to bring what the Beatles mean to them. Someone who grew up listening to the Beatles will be able to feel the fresh, sweet vibration of childhood and marvelment, while someone who associates these songs to adolescence (such as myself) or adulthood will be able to grasp a more mature understanding of the movie. Indeed, Yesterday is both about the innocent joy of first discoveries (the joy of all the people around Jack, who discover all of the Beatles' discography in the span of a few weeks - lucky them) and the meditation about maturity, growth, what art brings to oneself and how one can profoundly change thanks to it (as Jack in the movies, who starts off seeing the Beatles' work as a tool, something he possesses and will be able to make flourish, and who ends up understanding the incredible power of reunion of these music, its ability to create shared feelings, empathy, new bonds between people.
That was cheesy, I know. I stand by it.
Yesterday is of course a crowd-pleaser - what else could a movie based on the most unanimously acclaimed music band ever turn out to be? But it manages to outreach that aspect, and become something more, something spontaneous, optimistic, that focuses on talent, collaboration, art, communion and empathy rather than greed, jealousy and lies. It manages to create laughter, emotion, and above everything else, that great emotion that no medium can create better than cinema: wonder. Yesterday successfully asks the famous question of the ""what if"" and delivers a perfectly satisfying answer, without ever denying itself. And I'm just so grateful about that.
Now you know what to do.
Go on, watch this movie, it will take only two hours of your time, and it will for sure make your life a bit lighter."
"Anurag-Shetty","9","0","2","14 July 2019"," Absolutely delightful.
","Yesterday tells the story of Jack Malik(Himesh Patel). Jack is a musician, who is still trying to get a foothold in the industry. One day he wakes up in an alternate reality, where everyone has forgotten about the evergreen band, The Beatles. Jack is the only person who seems to know, who The Beatles are.<br/><br/>Yesterday is a fantastic movie. Director Danny Boyle steps out of his usual genres & collaborates with romantic comedy veteran screenwriter, Richard Curtis. The end result is comedic, emotional, romantic, foot-tapping & pure unadulterated entertainment. The various locales have been captured phenomenally by cinematographer Christopher Ross. Himesh Patel is the star of the show, as Jack Malik. Patel shines in his debut & is going to be a talent to watch out for, in Hollywood. He sings beautifully. Lily James is spectacular as Ellie Appleton. Himesh Patel & Lily James' warm & effortless chemistry, is the highlight of the film. Joel Fry is brilliant as Rocky. Meera Syal & Sanjeev Bhaskar are awesome as Sheila Malik & Jed Malik, respectively. Ed Sheeran is amazing, playing a version of himself. Kate McKinnon is mind-blowing as Debra Hammer. The supporting cast is great. Yesterday is a must watch for fans of The Beatles, romantic comedy fans & more or less everyone else. It is an absolute joy to listen to so many of The Beatles' songs & take a trip down memory lane. Go & have a rocking time!"

","Great story about the music. But the unreal relationship between Ellie and Jack was unbelievable. Ellie loved Jack from the beginning, and it was obvious to anyone but Jack. Add to that she is beautiful. That Jack ignored her is a poor way to write in drama into the film. Either make Ellie more unappealing (not just looks) or have Jack appreciate her earlier like any healthy hetro man would."

","My sweetie and I watched this pic opening weekend, Friday night in a packed theater. From the first frame it drew all us in. It's all about life, being true to oneself and others. It's filled with awesome music organic to the story- so not a musical- though many in the audience knew the music and couldn't help but sing. Kinda like a concert that carries one away. The romance is well enough underplayed, yet builds until it deliciously fills you up. Yesterday has it all. Story that sweeps you away, directing and acting so good it seems real. And overwhelming music. This plays like a Best Pic Nominee."

I also admire many of Danny Boyle's films, so this pair working on the same movie was like a dream come true to me. The directing was classic Boyle, I absolutely loved it, and the story was everything I'd expect from Richard Curtis. Both Patel and Lily James did amazing jobs. As a fan of the Beatles, I was excited to see another film with their music, having previously only seen Across the Universe, which even though it was a great movie, it was drastically different to Yesterday. 10/10 recommended if you enjoy British rom-coms."

"helenbassett","10","0","2","12 July 2019"," Yesterday Film Review - Hey Dude Danny Boyle Directs A Love Story To The Beatles Without Coke & Cigarettes
","Yesterday written by Richard Curtis offers an interesting premise, what if no one had heard of The Beatles and their songs? Danny Boyle directs the unsuccessful singer Jack Malik, played by Himesh Patel, as he strums his guitar around Suffolk. His manager Ellie is the gorgeous, but dowdy, Lily James, a schoolteacher by day but roadie/driver when he plays a gig. And when Jack lands a spot at Latitude it's the big time. In the Suffolk tent with a handful of kids and his friends as audience. And that's it, he's finished with music. Playing his Summer song to seagulls and empty cafes. But miracles can happen says Ellie, like Benedict Cumberbatch becoming a sex symbol, she suggests. Cutting! But Jack is unconvinced as he rides off on his bike, and just as his life couldn't get any worse, the world suffers a 12 second blackout and he's hit by a bus in the darkness. Knocking him out cold, and his front tooth.<br/><br/>And the weirdest thing is when he recovers and Ellie and Jack's friends give him a new guitar, seeing as the last one is now firewood, he christens it by playing Yesterday. We've all strummed a guitar and played a Beatles riff or two, but Jack's friends have never heard Yesterday before. And they haven't heard of the Beatles, and neither has Yahoo. Pope John Paul II! It seems Jack is the only person on Earth who knows John, Paul, George and Ringo. And with no one having heard of the Beatles, songs that John Hannah said in Sliding Doors, we are all born knowing, passed along to the fetus, Jack suddenly has a whole new body of work. If he can only remember the words.<br/><br/>And when Jack plays the songs for the first time it isn't only his new audience that sits up and listens, well to be honest they don't, it's a slow burn, like playing bars in Hamburg. But for us it's like we're hearing them for the first time. And their power is as strong as it was when they were first played, before we were born. Well except the first play of Let It Be could have gone better, a screen gem in front of his family. Mum and Dad are hilariously played by Meera Syal and Sanjeev Bhaskar. They aren't expecting much from Jack's music.<br/><br/>And as well as a love story to the Beatles there is a love story that should have developed between Jack and Ellie. But as Jack never noticed it, over time they became just friends. But Ellie always holds a candle for him, why else would she manage his unsuccessful music career, he's her Wonderwall. Even without Oasis. And now as he plays the Beatles greatest hits, fame beckons when the Ed Sheeran offers Jack a gig as his supporting act. Ed is a good sport accepting his inadequacies over Jack's talent. Yeah Hey Dude didn't work. But Back In The USSR goes down a storm, in Russia. The Beatles never actually played in Russia, but imagine how Back In The USSR would actually have gone down.<br/><br/>Kate McKinnon is Ed Sheeran's manager Debra, and she offers to also manage Jack, Ellie cannot just leave her school teacher job to go with him and Jack is the biggest thing in music. To be honest Debra's pretty upfront about the deal in her downward dog, she'll make him a star and take all the money. Fair enough I suppose as he ripped off the Beatles, but nobody knows. And as luck would have it fortune favoured Jack who could sing and play guitar. Otherwise he would just be a lonely person remembering all these hits that he couldn't sing. Although without the Beatles where did the yellow submarine come from I wondered? But this is everything Jack always wanted. Fame and fortune. And he never even knew what he was missing with Ellie, but it's never too late. Love is all Jack needs.<br/><br/>I was at some point waiting for Paul and Ringo to appear but Yesterday is a fantasy so why not a fantasy end. And in that strange universe I wonder was it a fair deal? Death and immortality or life and anonymity. It was a terrific idea to spin the Beatles jukebox, and imagine no Coke or cigarettes, saving the NHS a fortune. But even in that strange universe Harry Potter isn't going to write itself!<br/><br/>Danny Boyle directs a great cast with summer loving, happiness and comedy, and just keeps the hits coming. Terrific fun."

",". . . ""Shakespeare.""

Think about it.

If you advised your college-bound kids, ""To thine own selves be True"" they might laugh in your face.

","What would the world look like if one of the greatest bands ever were wiped off the face of the earth? That's the premise of the movie Yesterday. The world experiences a global black out in which the entire Beatles catalog has gone, and only one person remembers them, struggling musician Jack Malick. He decides to utilize the accident towards his advantage, and pass of the Beatles songs as his own.<br/><br/>Malik discovers that he's the only person that remembers the Beatles. This happenstance is the opening he needed to turn his failing career around. Once he starts passing of the songs as his and uploading them on YouTube, he becomes an internet sensation.<br/><br/>The foundation of this movie isn't the Beatles, contrary to popular opinion. It's having your dream come true and realizing it's not what you expected. Like so many before him, he's excited to have an audience finally, but the more his videos receive clicks, the more prominent the demand. Naturally, this requires him to leave behind everyone he loves, including Ellie, his best friend/manager/booking agent. Their relationship is one of the themes of this movies. There are many sections in this film, friendship, success, and self-worth are few Jack Malik grapples while navigating success.<br/><br/>There is going to be two types of audiences for this movie. Beatle fans and fans that are looking to escape monsters or superheroes.<br/><br/>The Beatle fans are going to feel disappointed at the commercialization of these songs. After all, they were written to commemorate love, awareness, or even conflict. The latter is happy to see a movie with a human-interest story without special effects. How to do you weave those two worlds together? First, you can't take this as a blueprint for the music industry.<br/><br/>Second, you must accept that this generation wasn't raised on the Beatles like previous generations. There are more Oasis and Radio Head fans. Also, this story is about Jack thinking success was going to solve all his problems; instead, it created more.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Himesh Patel as Jack Malik, he was funny and believable as a struggling artist. Lily James is charming as his love interest. I wish their coming together were written a little more interesting instead, we knew that these two would fall in love.<br/><br/>Kate McKinnon was spot on as Jack's slick new manager. She makes no qualms about looking at him as a cash cow, not an artist. The most delightful characters in Yesterday however are Rock and Mr./Mrs. Malik.<br/><br/>Rock portrayed by Joel Fry is the worst Road Manager; however, this is what makes him so charming. The guy with the worst time management is now in charge of the hottest artist in the world. The scenes between Fry and Patel are some of the funniest in the film. I also enjoyed that Ed Sheeran was willing to let this film make fun of his persona.<br/><br/>Veteran comedic actors Sanjeev Bhaskar and Meera Syal are hilarious as Jack's parents. They are so underwhelmed by Jack's desire to be a musician that even when he plays a classic Beatles song they don't care.<br/><br/>If you're looking for accuracy, you will be disappointed in Yesterday, but if you're willing to invest in Jack Malick this will work for you. After all success doesn't guarantee happiness. Yesterday is a feel-good movie also it was nice to imagine how this generation would react to John, Paul, Ringo and John.<br/><br/>Diversity- This movie gets a 7 the lead was brit of Indian descent<br/><br/>Scale- this movie receives a 7."

","I went and saw ""Yesterday"" yesterday lol. When I first saw the preview way back when, I was really excited because the premise was something original.

One night he gets hit by a bus and somehow ends up in a world where no one has heard of the Beatles. Soon, he ends up singing the Fab Four's songs as if they were his own.<br/><br/>Earlier I mentioned it doesn't use the premise nearly enough. The reason is I feel like they set it up great and then it doesn't go into a lot of detail about the Beatles, it's just a guy singing the songs.<br/><br/>Despite my ""complaint"", I still enjoyed the movie and the performances.

"t_k_matthews","6","0","1","11 July 2019"," Shaggy Treatment of Mop-Top Music
","The good:
1. Lily James plays Ellie. I loved her spicy Cousin Rose in Downton Abbey and her spunky good ol' girl waitress in Baby Driver. She has become a young actress I look forward to seeing. She gives an appealing performance as an underappreciated woman. But pray tell, why does the lead character, Jack, underappreciate her for so many years (besides being a sad sack)?
2. The Beatles music is fun to hear, even though not performed (mostly) by the Beatles. The music playing over the closing credits is perfect.
3. Toward the end there is a charming scene set at a slightly dilapidated house near the water. To say more would be to say too much.
4. Funny character work by Kate McKinnon, who has the best comic eyes since John Belushi. But see the quibble below.
5. Ed Sheeran shuffles through the movie playing himself. He is amiable and self-deprecating and likeable.
6. The use of Google searches is amusing. (Some of us pray to God for guidance, but we all get answers from Google.)
My quibbles:
1. Himesh Patel, who plays Jack, isn't a great singer. He misses notes.In a movie about an aspiring musician getting famous singing Beatles songs, shouldn't the actor be able to do them justice. (I assume he sang for himself. Where is Marni Nixon when you really need her? Or Auto-Tune?)
2. The film raises some serious issues-happiness and art and conscience and the corrupting influence of fame and money-but falls flat. There's no emotional heft in the climactic moment of crisis and redemption.
3. Dental problems. For a time, the lead actor wears an off-putting dental prosthesis. It's both gross and obviously fake. How does that improve the movie?
4. Beatles music remains popular, but the band and the music and the innovation are inseparable from the cultural context of the 1960s. If The Beatles came along now, would they even get played on the radio? Music which felt fresh and innovative and a little dangerous in 1967 has become foundational to much of popular music today. Indeed, if a classic Beatles tune were released for the first time today, it might seem a bit old-fashioned. The movie simply assumes that songs written in the mid-1960s would have instant astonishing immediate popularity 65 year later. But would they? A question worth pondering. The movie, however, doesn't give it a second thought.
5. The worldwide blackout that destroys almost all memory of The Beatles is never explained, It's as if the filmmaker is saying: Move on, moviegoer, nothing to explain here. But that means the blackout is a deus ex machina of the most shamelessly contrived sort.
6. In one scene, Jack is overjoyed to meet an older man and woman-never mind why. But then he lets them leave without even getting their phone numbers. Did I miss something? Wouldn't he be desperate to see them again? They are, so far as he knows, the only two people in the world who understand him and to whom he can talk.
7. Kate McKinnon is funny, but it's a stock character, the fast-talking overbearing anything-for-a buck soul-deadening leach of a manager. She could have been the film's villain, which it needed, but she never moves the character past comic caricature. She succeeds at comedy but fails at villainy.
8. The big climax leaves behind questions for the world to ponder that can't be answered. I can't say more. But how do those massive unanswered questions affect Jack's life? The final scene doesn't logically follow or resolve the huge questions, and so leaves us hanging.
If you want a lightweight movie with Beatles music, a movie that doesn't place demands on its audience or itself, and you don't mind shaggy logic and loose plotting and maddening loose ends, give it a try. You could do worse. It's hot out there, and the theater is air conditioned."

"gortx","Null","0","1","11 July 2019"," Enjoyable lite Beatles fantasy
","Most of Richard Curtis' (NOTTING HILL, LOVE ACTUALLY) feature work has some element of playful fantasy to them. As long as one keeps that in mind, it's not really a leap to imagine the world of YESTERDAY where the Beatles never existed save for one dude. Jack Malik (Himesh Patel) is that man. A small-time musician who travels around Suffolk with his combined manager and roadie Ellie (Lily James) just struggling to get by. The pair have known each other since they were kids, but, despite their close bond have never moved beyond the ""friend zone"". One night while riding his bike back from a gig, Jack is knocked cold by a bus JUST at the moment some kind of magnetic storm has wiped out all power on earth. Fast as you can say The Day The Earth Stood Still, all collective memory (and physical evidence) of The Beatles is gone -- save for Jack.<br/><br/>Armed with their catalog of great songs, Jack takes advantage and begins to pass them off as his own writing. Ed Sheeren (playing a good natured version of himself) happens to be listening and gives him his first big break. Ed's manager Debra (Kate McKinnon) signs him on the spot and his career skyrockets.<br/><br/>Director Danny Boyle adds a few touches, but, he mostly just lets the actors and, most of all, the Beatles' tunes do the persuading. The light fantasy is pleasant enough, even if the script gets a bit baggy (one of Curtis' negative tendencies). YESTERDAY never really digs down to expand much on what the impact and meaning of such an occurrence would mean*. Patel and James are charming together, and most of the cast follows along (McKinnon starts off amusing, but, becomes a one-note caricature pretty quickly). The arc of the story is pretty predictable, save for a last act diversion which is pretty questionable. Some have found it a bittersweet comfort, but, it made me feel a bit squeamish. I get why the scene is there (and, it's plot ""logic""), but it's squeaky wheel in an otherwise purely pleasurable ride. Curtis also tosses in a few oddball power outage 'aftereffects' in the margins that are quite amusing in their specificity, while remaining affectionately offbeat.<br/><br/>YESTERDAY isn't for those who take things too literally. Curtis is just doodling a Silly Love Song -- You either get on the Magical Mystery Tour or you may as well Hide Yourself Away.<br/><br/>* Two things the movie ignores:
1. Even armed with the lyrics, that doesn't mean the finished music would recapture The Beatles magic. The quartet also played the instruments, and, with George Martin, created a unique sound. You can't just throw a newbie in a recording studio with a backing band and out comes Sgt. Pepper.
2. In this streaming, download, and uncentralized music landscape, would even The Beatles be ""The Beatles!!"" today if they were just arriving on the scene?

"ThomasDrufke","7","0","1","9 July 2019"," The Romance This Summer Needed
","When done right, rom-com-drama's (especially ones with a music backdrop) are some of my favorite films of all time. 'Yesterday' posed a creative premise, as the world has forgotten The Beatles (among many other pop culture things) and one musician decides to take advantage of that and take credit for the songs as his own. It's a premise that almost begs you not to root for the main character, played by Himesh patel. But Patel contains great charisma and shares a natural chemistry with Lily James. Admittedly some of the rom-com elements feel dated and towards the end of the movie, a little bit unearned, but there's something truly special about hearing The Beatles iconic music on screen amidst a charming love story, something we've been missing this summer.<br/><br/>7.7/10"
"Robert_duder","7","0","1","8 July 2019"," Cute and fun, it strives to bring something different to summer
","I loved the concept of Yesterday and was excited to see it. It doesn't disappoint and it presents exactly what you would anticipate from the movie. The music is wonderful, the cast is very good, the romance is awesome, it has some good laughs and some genuine heart. And yet somehow it stops short of being great. The film is good but for some reason forgettable. It never really seems to find it's own magic and that's unfortunate because the concept is very neat and watching Jack's rise to fame. I understood Kate McKinnon's role as the power hungry manager but her performance of it made it slapstick comedy which didn't fit in the walls of this bittersweet-indie-romance-comedy. She felt out of place and almost annoying which is her vibe in a lot of things to be honest. Himesh Patel and Lily James are magnificent though. They are perfect in the movie and their chemistry is excellent. It actually is the backbone of the movie rather than the songs or the concept but actually the romance that goes on between them. Certainly if you're looking for something different or a nice date movie, this is worth checking out because it's nice. It won't floor you but it's nice and nice is okay. 7/10"

","I did not see the trailer...Just heard it was about Beatle songs and how some guy gets famous by pretending he wrote the Beatle songs himself...It is sort of about that and somehow the idea for this movie really works.. The movie makes u Love the Beatle songs like you are hearing the Beatle songs for the first time...Showing how much Joy those songs continue to bring to everyone.... But the movie has some extraordinary actors that u start to really care about and as much as u like the A story about an ordinary guy i that ends up in an unreal place of finding fame and fortune you feel bad for him to... He is a fraud and he knows it and it eats him up...He chased Fame for so long that he does not knowtice the person next to him that has always believed and Loved him....The Love story (Boy knows Girl, Boy loses Girl, Boy realizes he loves Girl and gets Girl back) was perfect and it really shows how nothing is as important as love. In one scene it shows something very interesting that most of us were wondering about during the film but set aside that it would not be dealt with. Yet it is dealt with and it shows what happens if your self centered dreams do not come true. It shows that greater Love and Joy could await u....It shows u true Happiness is finding Love and Joy not Fame and Fortune....Also everyone that Loved this ordinary man when he was struggling continued to love him when Famous. Yet those that only wanted to use him for Fame and fortune loved him only when he could give them something....There were so many great characters that were kind and real and sweet ..It was really about recognizing that the real Rockstars are finding Love and Joy and holding on to it.

the movie leaves u feeling Happy and loving those Beatle songs.."
"rustonreviews","8","0","1","7 July 2019"," A lovely tribute to one of the worlds most influential bands.
","Struggling musician Jack Malik (Patel) is growing increasingly tired of perusing his dreams of becoming a famous singer-songwriter. Despite his best efforts and undeniable talent, Jack's dreams of stardom stray further and further away from him as time passes by. With the ongoing encouragement provided by his childhood friend (and manager) Ellie (James), Jack strives to achieve his dreams in spite of falling short every time. When an unexplainable global blackout occurs, Jack is struck by a bus and wakes up in a drastically changed world; a world in which nobody except him remembers The Beatles. With one of the most influential bands mysteriously erased from existence, Jack takes it upon himself to reintroduce the world to the music of The Beatles, taking credit for their work and skyrocketing to fame in the process.<br/><br/>Yesterday is a charming celebration of The Beatles' music. This collaboration between Richard Curtis and Danny Boyle proves to be a matchmade in heaven that begs the question as to why their creative minds have never joined forces until now. Richard Curtis produces another fantastic script packed with charm and wit, and both Patel and Lily share great chemistry together. They're a fiercely likable duo, and like all of his previous works, Curtis understands how to write excellent romance that's wholeheartedly believable and human. Patels' renditions of classic Beatles songs are pretty great, too. For many, recreating such iconic tracks would be an intensely daunting task, but Patel manages to pull it off. What the film also does so brilliantly is explore the ignorance of genius. Everyone knows the colossal impact The Beatles had on music, and both Curtis and Boyle take great joy in poking fun at how their songs and concepts would be received by the disillusioned youth of today. 'It's not as good as Coldplay,' retorts one of Jacks friends, following a heartfelt cover of 'Yesterday'.<br/><br/>Curtis and Boyle's first (and hopefully not last) collaboration serves as a fitting tribute to one of the most influential bands in the world. Heartfelt and thoroughly charming, Yesterday is a must see even for those who don't necessarily have an attachment to The Beatles or their music."

The Baby Boomer generation was ignited. That flame exists to this day.
The ""British Invasion"" and the ""American Response"" of pop/rock music ensued.
Inertia from ""'64 - 67"" is felt also to this day.

"M_Exchange","6","0","1","5 July 2019"," Enjoyable, but lacking
","I was extremely impressed with Himesh Patel's lead performance, Lily James is always nice to see and of course we all love the Beatles' music. But other than those things, I'm probably not going to remember much about this film.<br/><br/>
The romantic problems between James and Patel's characters seemed as if they were more appropriate for people who are in their late teens, not thirty year olds. The way that they interacted with each other seemed downright bizarre for older people, and that subplot seemed to branch into several directions that just didn't interest me.<br/><br/>
I was also disappointed with the things that randomly disappeared from Patel's new world in addition to The Beatles. Bill Maher said, ""Ronald Reagan didn't destroy the Soviet Union. The Beatles destroyed it."" When it's revealed that a band that was extremely popular in the '90s and massively influenced by The Beatles disappeared, I thought that director Danny Boyle was going to show us things that would have happened without their influence. Instead, random things that have nothing to do with them are erased from his reality. Also, the Soviet Union dissolved regardless of their absence. :)<br/><br/>Kate McKinnon is funny, and I laughed at several of her lines as a talent manager. However, even her performance was a bit too goofy. I work in L.A.-- as much as I hate agents and managers, I realized that I've seen three films this year (""Stan and Ollie,"" ""Rocketman,"" and this film) in which they are depicted as a bit too evil... even for them.<br/><br/>In terms of Boyle's oeuvre, it's like his Trainspotting sequel: I liked it. I didn't love it. However, unlike T2, I won't rewatch this film."

So, forget everything and enjoy the way Danny Boyle has told this story, it is a love story, not between two people but a true love story between the world and the message of love given to us by all the songs written and performed by The Beatles. The film certainly is not perfect but why should it be. The underlying story of a couples relationship is poor and holds nothing but ultimately is secured. The 4 winners are the couple realising love, the world regaining lost love and the audience sharing the love of some of the worlds finest music. Enjoy"
"eparazak","7","0","1","5 July 2019"," An intriguing, yet somewhat safe take on a unique ""what-if"" scenario.
","Yesterday was brought to us by the director of Slumdog Millionaire and stars Himesh Patel as a down on his luck musician who wants more in his profession. One night however, his luck changes when the entire world forgets about The Beatles aside from him, so he naturally takes advantage of it.<br/><br/>For the longest time, I had no idea what this film was about, yet I was still fasinated by it. Coming out of the theater, I was pleasantly surprised by what I saw. Yesterday presents a genius ""what-if"" scenario that presents many different questions that provoke thoughts like wat would happen to the person if they remembered The Beatles while everyone else didn't. While I mostly enjoyed how it was executed, I had a few problems with the film.<br/><br/>The film's casting was really will-done. It has some great performances from Lily James and Ed Sheeran, but I was mostly surprised with Himesh Patel as Jack. What mostly surprised me is how amazing his singing voice was and how well he took advantage of it. I thought the first half of the movie was also pretty thought-provoking with its themes and concept. One question that the movie answers is what the world would look like if The Beatles didn't exist. I also appreciated how the movie didn't go into severaly dark territory. When we have a film like Yesterday, which is essentially a fantasy, I was genuinely happier with its lighter tone, as opposed to a realistic biopic. It has both heartbreaking and heartwarming moments all around, and that made for an overall pleasant experience.<br/><br/>Despite being satisfied with the film's execution, I felt as if the second half felt too safe. I thought it could've been a lot more interesting; it could've gone into more depth on the problems of plagiarism and taking advantage of someone else's work despite the fact that everyone forgot about it. The film doesn't raise those question enough for me to care, and I wanted to care more about the inner conflict. I also think this film is a little out-of-touch with how modern-day music is conceived. The movie takes place over the span of months, and music tends to come and go, rather than be timeless, which is what the movie intends to say to its audience. Personally, I don't understand that logic given modern times. My final issue with the movie is that there is a cameo during the third act that I think shouldn't be there.<br/><br/>Regardless of my issues with the film, I still enjoyed it for its light tone and interesting concepts.<br/><br/>7/10"

","I loved this movie. The concept was genius and the performances outstanding, with one exception: Robert Carlyle as John Lennon. Carlyle is a good actor, he should have been up to the small part but he just wasn't. True, he had to play Lennon at age 78. Although it is possible that had Lennon lived to this age he may have grown more soft spoken, as with Carlyle's performance, but the cadence would not have changed. It should have been easy to imitate Lennon's distinct inflection but watching the performance it appeared that almost no effort was made on the actor's part to do so. He did look like Lennon, though. They should have considered someone dubbing Lennon's voice and I would have given it a perfect 10."
"jimhurcomb","7","0","1","4 July 2019"," ""I've Just Seen a....Film?""
","I looked forward to ""Yesterday"" with great anticipation, not because I'm a huge Beatles or Danny Boyle fan, but because the British make marvellous ""little"" films about rock and roll. Witness ""Still Crazy"", ""That's Be the Day / Stardust"" and ""Sing Street"". The premise is interesting, the characters all seemed real and Himesh Patel looked like he could really play the guitar. And that scene in the trailer when he sings ""Something"" on the Corben Show...oh wait. That wasn't in the movie after all(??). Having just left the theatre to catch a matinee showing, I've got say I am a bit disappointed. The music was great, as expected. I l love the straight covers and the neo-punk version of ""Help"". But..it's the Beatles after all. The acting is first rate on all levels, and the inside record industry humour hits the mark. So where does ""Yesterday"" not work? It's the plot, that petty film device that makes celluloid magic seem almost like real life. It's that element that makes super-heroes and super-villains and web-slinging crime fighters seem almost plausible. Maybe ET's really are out there, and what if we could time travel or make ourselves shrink to the size of an ant. I was looking forward to the explanation of how the Beatles, and other things, just never happened. Just some kind of half boiled rubbish about post-concussion syndrome or exploding supernovas would have worked. But really, aside from a throw away one liner early in the film, it was not mentioned. That was a let down. Some plot lines, which I won't give away, were just left hanging, as if someone forgot to roll reel 6.
There was an awesome scene near the end with the return of a legend, but that was really the only scene that might endure as a classic. There were other moments that came close, but most just didn't hit the mark. Still, an entertaining night out, and great memories for Beatles fans. But would I see it again? ""Not a Second Time"". Yes, you can add that song reference to the others you will see in virtually ever review of ""Yesterday""."

","The story is intriguing about a struggling musician who through a fluke accident is thrust in an alternate universe in which the Beatles don't exist. Himesh Patel plays musician Jack Malik who is only an adequate singer and performer but this only emphasizes how good these songs really are. He plagiarizes all the Beatles songs he can piece together by memory and has a meteoric rise to fame even impressing Ed Sheeran. But along his way to the top he starts to lose touch with his former manager and love interest Ellie played by Lily James. There are some funny moments but there should be many with this clever plot. It's like having a delicious meal with small portions leaving you unsatisfied. I liked it. I just expected more."
"jadepietro","7","0","1","4 July 2019"," Fixing A Whole
","GRADE: B-<br/><br/>THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>IN BRIEF: Although quite charming, the filmmakers should have known better.<br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: Yesterday plays with a very intriguing premise: Living in a parallel universe, a musician discovers a world untouched by the music of The Beatles and begins to pirate their tunes as his own. It's a rags to riches cautionary tale, with the typical greed and fame overtaking the singer on the rise from becoming a Nowhere Man into Something.<br/><br/>Himesh Patel plays Jack Malik, a down-on-his-luck musician ready to give up on his musical career. His best friend and loyal manager, Ellie (Lily James) encourages him to follow his dream as she falls in love with him. One night, during a global blackout, Jack's path leads him directly into a local bus and he awakens to a world without the Beatles.<br/><br/>But the fallacy with this concept is that songs themselves evolved, just as the band did. (Compare the simplistic sing-song melody of She Loves You with any of the complex sounds from Sgt. Peppers or Abbey Road and one can readily see that aspect.) The pop / folk basis is there, but the innovative engineering, catchy harmonies, and musical skills that made the difference between commonplace and art falls short. Also, The Beatles were not just a rock band. They were also trendsetters and led the counter culture youth movement. They were a marketing package hyped and promoted as a new iconic group of talented English laddies with their unique style, mod look, and loads of charisma which influenced a generation. Yesterday only proves that The Beatles were an important product of their times, before computers and social media ever existed.<br/><br/>In fact, the problem with any film that flaunt the ""what if"" origins is that any moviegoer must work hard not to see the obvious illogical plot-holes in order to enjoy the set-up. Like the Fab Four, certain people and things are fully erased from memory while others exist and remain unaffected and unexplained. (Yes, to the Rolling Stones, no to Coca-Cola...why? Other questions that come to mind: Why doesn't Jack introduce some of his own compositions along with the plagiarized stolen tunes? If others learn about this scam, why not expose the culprit who dishonors the band's true legacy? Why does the odd quality of the songs with their mix of early and later tracks never become an issue?)<br/><br/>The song's new arrangement and solo vocals never come near the greatness of the original musical sources. This failed to convince this reviewer of Jack's instant phenomenon and mass adoration. The screenplay by Richard Curtis never bothers to address these and other unethical issues. It is more concerned with celebrating the Beatles songbook and using their familiar and popular songs to enhance its paper-thin romantic story.<br/><br/>Yesterday gets lost in rom-com territory rather quickly. And to its merit, the love story is charming, if predictable. Mr. Patel is fine in the lead and his voice and screen presence is more than serviceable. But his talent is lackluster compared to John, Paul, George, or Ringo, which does not help the audience buy into Jack's superstardom (or me). The real star quality comes from a delightful Ms. James who takes her underwritten role and makes her character believable and enchanting. Other supporting parts fail to register, except for a scene-stealing turn by Kate McKinnon as a greedy American agent who provides the needed comedy that Joel Fry as Jack's goofy sidekick fails to deliver. Ed Sheeran plays himself and has some amusing moments.<br/><br/>Danny Boyle directs with his customary flair, but even his flashy style cannot hide the film's obvious flaws. Still, Yesterday always entertains, even as it tries to cajole its audience into believing its shaky rom-com narrative. For me, it just didn't all Come Together."

"nancyldraper","8","0","1","3 July 2019"," Mixed reviews
","I've read the reviews, this film is getting a love-it or hate-it reaction. First, I think a lot of the bad press comes from people judging it out of its genre. It is a romantic comedy, so those who gave it 1s and 2s (out of 10) because it was ""just a love story with music"", need to adjust their expectations, appropriately. Secondly, this is under-spoken, self-deprecating British humour (that I adore) but this is often baffling to American audiences (who are use to being fed broad comedy, charicatures of life - see note on Kate McKinnon, below) and this fuelled another flurry of low ratings. So, you can see where my review is going. I loved this movie. The love story was inevitable (it WAS the point of the movie). The premise was unique (and it provided a great reoccurring joke). The theme of Friendship Zone vs Romantic Interest was executed perfectly by the deep, emotional vocabulary of the performers (although, the 14-seconds-that-changed-the- world is as much of a leap as Lily James, made average with fuzzy hair, being left in the friendship zone, in any time line). Himesh Patel made a smooth transition from the Soaps to the Big Screen and his musical skills were perfect for this. Lily James brought such vulnerability, energy and strength {spoiler} dealing with unrequited love {/spoiler}. As much as I appreciate the comedic talents of Kate McKinnon, I wish she would find the real people behind her charicatures. She needs to find her dramatic chops which, I believe, are there to be discovered. But the glue for this film was the music. As with BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY, I was transported to my youth when so much of this music was imbedded, word for word, note for note. {spoiler} I fully expected the ending to flip back to Jack waking in his hospital bed, having lived a dream, and now seeing Ellie with different eyes and not missing his moments, cue same ending from there on. {/spoiler} I give this film an 8 (great) out of 10. My friend gives it a 9 (just short of perfect). {RomCom around great Music}"
"Metaflix","6","0","2","3 July 2019"," Disappointingly Formulaic
","The premise to Danny Boyle's 'Yesterday'-that a struggling musician realizes he's the only person on Earth who can remember The Beatles after a strange worldwide blackout-is incredibly alluring. Too bad the film itself effectively wastes the opportunity to explore such a novel idea in any sort of resonant or meaningful way.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with Boyle's approach is how formulaic the entire movie is. There's the dedicated small town talent manager, the jerk part-time boss, the one supportive fan, and the dopey sidekick. The performer's musical career, played by a wonderful Himesh Patel, isn't going anywhere until the Beatles thing happens. Then fame, success, and a stereotypical super-agent steps in. Before we know it the singer-songwriter has everything he ever wanted but is miserable.<br/><br/>There's no need to dwell on the finer details or the love story because you can probably guess them all already. Sure, there are a number of things that are disappointing with the film, but most of all it's that Danny Boyle couldn't make 'Yesterday' something on a similar level as 'Slumdog Millionaire' despite ample opportunity to do so."

","Actually, I can see ""Rocketman"" and ""Yesterday"" doing just that (trending into the next year / decade and inspiring other stories from music and other worlds). I had never heard of this one until I watched the trailer while seeing the Elton John movie at the local cinema, and it looked like a hit to me from that first look. This long-time music fan of true, original artists like The Beatles and Elton thoroughly enjoyed both films - this one even a little more so. The male and female leads were wonderful in their roles, as were most everyone involved on-screen and off. I had heard or read somewhere that the filmmaker (Danny Boyle) had been given the rights to use up to 20 Beatles songs in the film, and that alone is quite a feat. I'm so happy his movie lives up to mine and many others' expectations, well beyond my own as I very much look forward to seeing it again when it hits the video markets. ""Yesterday"" is the seventh or eighth Boyle film I've seen, and I've always appreciated his vision in making films as diverse as ""Trainspotting"", ""28 Days Later"", ""Sunshine"", ""Slumdog Millionaire"" and ""127 Hours"". I believe ""Yesterday"" is among his very best."

","I don't often write reviews, but had to after watching this. The usual fare of ""what if...."" movies has indeed been added to with 'Yesterday' but this was different, and I guess in this era of disposable music, the subsequent generations are forgetting the Beatles as the trail blazers they were back in the day. Enter this feel good Beatles promo movie (let's face it, it was). Himesh Patel was perfectly cast as the down on his luck good guy that passed off the back catalogue of Beatles songs as his own as a result of a cosmic mishap, and became an overnight sensation as a result. There is a scattering of humour to keep the audience happy. Lily James played the ever loyal manager-in-my-spare-time love interest and the cameo appearance of music heavyweight Ed Sheeran to give the movie its credibility. I just need someone to explain how the non-existence of the Beatles would cause Coke to disappear from the public tastebuds amongst other things. Still, this is just a triviality and even if you're not a fan of the Beatles (which I'm not) this does not detract from the movie at all and I for one found it a refreshing change from the constant drip-feeding of superhero movies flooding the cinemas right now. At last a movie I didn't have to think too much about because there'll be yet another sequel. If you have a couple of spare hours, give it a watch. I'm glad I did"

","Musical romantic comedy.<br/><br/>This is a warm love story about our hero (Jack), who is a struggling singer-songwriter, and his very long term childhood girlfriend (Ellie), who is a school teacher but also his devoted music manager.<br/><br/>Jack is on the verge of giving up on his musical dreams, but we see an extraordinary 12 second global power cut that results in him being hit by a bus. Badly injured he gradually realises that reference to any Beatles lyrics are unfamiliar to everyone around him, baffled by this he Google's the 'Beatles' but this only returns information on insects.<br/><br/>Jack now finds himself in a world where the Beatles never seemed to have existed, or that the legendary band have been completely erased from history (what a clever idea!)<br/><br/>Now Jack has a dilemma, he begins to use what he can remember of the Beatles songs to advance his own musical career, but should he continue with this strange journey?<br/><br/>His immediate mega success leads him to meet other rock stars such as Ed Sheeran (who plays himself) in a much bigger role than just a cameo. But Jack is also very anxious about getting found out. Music management are also well featured, who treat musicians as a commodity. This part really has a deserved dig at the general music industry.<br/><br/>This is a feel-good movie that will make you want to dust off your old albums."

","I loved Yesterday. Many critics are lukewarm toward it, but it's a corky funny film with all the tropes of a Richard Curtis film, so what's not to like. It has some Danny Boyle flairs but not enough to distinguish it as a Danny Boyle film. It seems he was content making a Richard Curtis film. I liked Himesh Patel as Jack, but Lily James makes the screen lights up everytime she is on. It is also a very funny film too, and Kate McKinnon's Deborah insured I laugh hard everytime she'd crack a mean insults toward Jack. The biggest problem I have with the film is that Himesh's singing is not really great, but he carries the acting part very well. I would highly recommend it."

The movie was entertaining, funny, touching, thought-provoking, and much more. It was a great way to escape for about 2 hours, and come out smiling; happy. My only question was: Who played John Lennon??? Can't find a mention of him in the cast, though I have a possible answer. Also, it shows an actor played Ringo Starr, yet I did not see Ringo in the movie... Hm"
"Kingslaay","Null","0","3","30 June 2019"," Not too bad
","I was very excited to watch this film because of its great and novel concept. I'm a huge Beatles fan and imagine if there suddenly was no Beatles but you had the ability to sing and perform. Love the music and how it was shown that even after all these years these songs would hit it out of the park. The corporatisiation of Jack Malik's image was done quite well.<br/><br/>While this was not a bad film I couldn't help but feel it was a missed opportunity. The film regrettably became somewhat of a rom-com. Emphasis was on his relationship and the one dimensional romance we couldn't care less for. With a unique and brilliant concept I felt the sky could be the limit, performing the Beatles hits. Historic moments could have been created and other music legends could have been involved. I think Forest Gump is a good comparison with Yesterday. It was a simple story about a simple man who got to meet icons and experience huge moments. Yesterday however is about an extraordinary and magical situation happens to a musician who reduces himself to a simple love storyline."

For me and my date, we discussed how the movie could have been better, but overall were satisfied with the story and the outcome. A few parts in the middle really start to unravel, but I think it was meant to show the chaos that the character was going through. Still hard to follow at some points, but honestly a really good surprise cameo in the movie I'm sure no one expected to see. I hope more movies are made that explore different ideas, instead of the normal scripts that have been coming out as of late."

","I so wanted to love this movie. Richard Curtis has written some of my favorite films, and with both of us being avid Beatles fans, I was sure it would be a winner. I loved the concept, but I saw no redeeming qualities or allure in the protagonist until the very end of the film. Richard Curtis is the king of creating couples who have chemistry, but not this time; perhaps my expectations were too great. I'll think about going to go see it again to see if lowered expectations will make it a better film for me. For now, I think I should go pop in my About Time DVD; that was one that I didn't think I'd like, but it's become one of my favorites."

When he starts singing Beatles songs, people are amazed and he becomes this famous ""genius"" with fantastic songs. Then there are others glomming onto this, to help or to exploit?<br/><br/>The music is great but I believe the movie is about something else, importance of relationships, the people we love, missed opportunities, and maintaining one's integrity when the world takes on a rocket ride, that is what is really important."
"lmon2","8","0","3","29 June 2019"," Yesterday is a gem!
","My wife & I both very much enjoyed this film. We loved the story line, the cast, the humor - and all wrapped up in the best of the Beatles. Pay no attention to the critics (or critic wannabe's) - they seem to have a compulsion to over-analyze. You will be entertained, you will smile - and it has the right ending. If you want something more significant, or deep or philosophic - go rent some dark film from Sweden or France. Think ""Love, Actually"" mixed with ""About Time"", with a dash of ""Slumdog, Millionaire"". If you liked those movies, you'll probably really have a good time with this one."
"dcrik-16668","6","0","4","29 June 2019"," Enjoyable for Beatle Fans
","The film was an interesting nostalgic trip through the music of The Beatles. The movie poses the question, ""What would life be like without the music of the Fab Four?"" The moralistic dilemma of wealth and fame versus love and serenity is ever-present while a sweet, though rather shallow romantic storyline serves as the thread weaving the storylines together. Major holes exists as to how the world forgot The Beatles. Still, the music made viewing the film a nice way to spend a couple of hours."

","So I think if I grew up with the Beetles I would've appreciated this film more. Also while the main cast dialogue and acting was spot on the supporting cast was way over the top in a trade for a poor joke. Kate McKinnonin was annoying every time she came on screen and would have been better if she just played a more normal person.
Also the romantic relationship was just like come on already and shag would you.
Not sure it's worth a movie price but a rental sure"

"bbewnylorac","6","0","3","29 June 2019"," Perfectly pleasant, but nothing special
","I am a fan of writer Richard Curtis, but the movies of his I've loved (Pirate Radio, Love Actually) are rooted in (albeit kooky) reality - the first based on a true story, and the second a series of realistic love stories.
This time, Curtis goes for fantasy - an unsuccessful musician, Jack (Himesh Patel) wakes up from a road accident to discover that no one has heard of The Beatles. So he starts to perform and record all their songs, and becomes a massive star.
It's a cute idea, but what's the point? I suppose it does show how beautiful The Beatles songs were. It's a love letter to the Beatles. There are lots of songs penned by Paul McCartney, one of just two Beatles who are still alive.
But for me the movie, while well made, is too light and cute. Patel at least is quite a curmudgeon and does have some depth as a man not knowing how to commit to his possible girlfriend Elly (Lily Jones). He also feels massive guilt at stealing songs he didn't write, and comes to realise that the corporate side of the music business can be terrible.
Ed Sheeran, who plays himself, is basically there as a novelty but he does OK. Jones is portrayed as a pretty love interest, and as a character doesn't develop much. Comedian Kate McKinnon tries hard (and obviously has fun) as Jack's soulless, rude, money-hungry US agent, who I guess at least is honest about what her intentions are.
It's not a bad or offensive movie. The cinematography is nice and colourful. It's just not a great movie."
"Milora","8","0","1","29 June 2019"," Worth watching, if you adore the Beatles or not! Spolers
","I grew up listening to the Beatles, thanks to the grown ups in my family. So, this one was a must watch for me. I liked the movie, given the crap of movies we have these days. I wouldn't say it's better than Bohemian Rhapsody though. What disappointed me, was that the songs were all cut short. So, if you have never heard a Beatles song, you would never understand the greatness of these songs. Nevertheless, it is a lovely feel good film. We need movies like these that would remind us now and then of the legacy of these great artists!"

"jhunte","7","0","2","28 June 2019"," Rom-Com Disguised as Beatles Cash-Grab
","""A world without The Beatles isn't a world worth living in.""<br/><br/>The movie almost exactly what you'd expect from the premise the trailer and summary sets up. Inexplicably Jack is ostensibly the only person in the world to remember The Beatles and their music. So as a failed musician Jack sees his chance and slowly rises to fame by passing off any Beatles songs he can remember the lyrics and music to as his own. Once this part of the story is set up it shifts gears and goes from Beatles music picture to run-of-the-mill rom-com. The Beatles part of the flick heads backstage and intermittently reappears as referential jokes, scenes of Jack struggling to remember lyrics, and quick 15-second sound bytes of Jack's cover. The rest of the movie is dominated by the love story between Jack and Ellie. Ellie has waited all her life for Jack to love her, and well, Jack just has been too focused on his music career to apparently notice. So now that Jack is making it big he still doesn't have time for Ellie, yet he loves her he now realizes, but Ellie is mad because Jack waited too long. And so it goes.<br/><br/>I think the most annoying part is it's never explained why Jack falls into this alternate universe. It just happens. The audience is expected to just go with it no questions asked, and to ignore the blatant reason that it is merely to use Beatles nostalgia to boost the box-office for a mediocre rom-com. The second most annoying part is Kate McKinnon. She blows hard in this movie. In all her scenes she was overacting and was just a complete duds. It got eerily quiet every time she appeared on screen. The last bad part of this movie is the song covers are few and far between and very short. If you're going in expecting a musical Beatles movie you'll be disappointed.<br/><br/>Overall it was still enjoyable, but I think many viewers will have been fooled by marketing into thinking they're going to get a Beatles musical movie like 'Rocketman' or 'Bohemian Rhapsody'."

"jtindahouse","7","0","2","28 June 2019"," A love story first and foremost
","Music based films are all the rage at the moment. 'Bohemian Rhapsody' did astoundingly well both with audiences and award ceremonies, 'Rocketman' seems to be a hit and now we have 'Yesterday'. 'Yesterday' is a little bit different in the sense that it is a fictional story which utilises the music of an extremely popular band from the 60s rather than just straight up telling their story. In fact this is one of the best ideas for a movie I can remember. The whole world forgets about The Beatles except for one person. The possibilities that lends itself to are endless.<br/><br/>I didn't actually realise until after seeing the movie that there was only a select few (20 I believe) songs that they had rights to. That possibly explains a little why the film often feels more about the love story at its centre than the music itself. The love story was actually very well written (both characters were extremely likeable) but I did often think I would like to be hearing a little more music. Too often songs were cut short or were chopped around a joke relating to interrupting the song.<br/><br/>The biggest flaw in this movie for me was the humour. Far too often jokes fell flat. The character of 'Rocky' was clearly designed as the comic relief, and the character was perfect, but the jokes written for him were not up to standard. It felt like they were trying far too hard. An obvious joke is never as funny as a subtle one. Ed Sheeran's involvement with the film was a master stroke though. They didn't over-use him and when he was on screen it was fascinating to watch. I had a good time with 'Yesterday' no doubt about it. I can't help wondering though if things were done a little differently whether this could have been a masterpiece."
