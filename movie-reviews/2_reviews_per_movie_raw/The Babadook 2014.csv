","The Babadook isn't for the mainstream crowd. If you're looking for jump scares and scary monsters you wont find any here. The Babadook is a movie that taps into the basal emotion of fear. It portrays the truly terrifying things in life - grief, loneliness, and despair. Not things that freak you out but things that make you unsettled, disturbed, and human.<br/><br/>The acting is fantastic, the story itself is unique and told brilliantly through its subtle writing and directing, it's very well paced, I could go on and on. What I love about this movie especially is the suspense. There is always tension present throughout the movie, like there's an underlying unease to every shot. The way Jennifer Kent crafts these shots is bleak and macabre but not to the point where it's depressing. You're always on the edge of your seat. And I can't give enough credit to Essie Davis. Her performance is Academy Award worthy material, seriously. The son is great as well. At first he may seem obnoxious, and to an extent he is, but he acts exactly how a kid would act in that situation. You believe him. You believe everything these characters are doing, and that's what makes this movie work so well.<br/><br/>The Babadook really is one of the best horror movies I've seen in a long time and I've seen a lot. Is it scarier than The Conjuring or Sinister? I wouldn't say that, but that depends entirely on your definition of scary. This movie explores the more disturbing and realistic side of the genre, I'd say it's more haunting than said movies for sure. It's psychological horror at its finest. It actually gets under your skin, and when a movie can do that, it has done its job."

","Never written a review before. Haven't felt the need. But after seeing the 1 star reviews of this film,i just felt compelled. <br/><br/>Firstly,what this is.<br/><br/>I would say a cross between The Shining and We Need to talk about Kevin. This film is desperately sad. A woman who is haunted,first by her husbands death,then by the Babadook all while looking after her young son. This is a creepy, no jump scare, fantastic psychological horror. A rare gem that plays on all those fairytale fears that you may have had as a kid.<br/><br/>Second.What this isn't.<br/><br/>Well,not ""The worst horror in years"".I get that people have different opinions.I do.But this isn't a film that can justify that sort of nonsensical comment. It isn't a dull jump scare-filled blockbuster. The characters are not hot teenagers. They are believable, disturbed and this makes the film the slow,creeping horror that it is.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of horror,it really is a must see film."
"mikeburdick","9","124","173","29 August 2015"," Much more than a horror film
","While ""The Babadook"" may display some of the hallmarks of the traditional horror film, there's a lot more going on here than meets the eye. Far from the typical Hollywood bloodfest so brilliantly satired in ""Cabin in the Woods,"" this film's characters are layered, its plot is mercurial, its actions are metaphorical, and its conclusions are ambiguous. All this is likely to disappoint those filmgoers who need to be spoonfed a formula. But if you're a film lover, Do. Not. Miss. This.<br/><br/>Director Jennifer Kent understands what most horror filmmakers fail to grasp: that our biggest fear isn't of crazy killers or monsters or ghosts, but of ourselves—what lives inside us, the emotions we have to live with, the illusory veil of self-control. <br/><br/>The plot revolves around a mum, her troubled son and the book he pulls off the shelf one night. But you already know too much. This is one film where knowing less going into it will really pay dividends. Really, don't even watch the trailer.<br/><br/>Just know that the storytelling and craft are flawless. Essie Davis delivers one of the most challenging performances put to screen with total commitment and credibility. Kent's storytelling is utterly absorbing and she so delicately treads the line between what's real and what's not that you can never be sure of yourself. <br/><br/>What you make of ""The Babadook"" will depend on who you are. You might take it at face value, as a creepy monster flick with all the constant threat and looming dread and shocking moments. You might take it as an attempt to capture the authentic experience of mental illness. You might take it as a symbolic story using a metaphor for grief and loss. The best films make you feel something and allow you the room to make sense of it yourself.<br/><br/>Personally, I thought about this film for days after seeing it, both because of its ambiguity and because of the themes it explores, namely mental illness and domestic violence. Yes, it's scary. But it's also touching and heartbreaking. While ""The Babadook"" belongs alongside other great psychological horror films, like ""The Innocents"" and ""The Haunting"" (1963), to classify it purely as ""horror"" really belittles its accomplishment as a film that challenges us to examine and discuss issues we are very uncomfortable tackling in reality."

","At first glance, The Babadook may sound like a tale that warns people  to not let children put creepy stories up into their heads. It may also  be like one of those old horror movies with children being influenced  by the ghost. The titular monster seems to have the potential of being  a silly urban legend, such as Slender Man or the Hash Slinging Slasher  (sorry about that), that is destined to be flooded with fan fiction, or  simply just another horror movie icon, but the film surprisingly has a  different aim than just scaring the audience. It might as well be a  character study of a mother having a hard time moving on after the  tragedy she's been through losing her husband and trying to raise her  only son. The real horror doesn't come out that quick, but there is  already a pretty compelling movie when it come to its characters. The  tension is just the prize for being intrigued by the story's core.  One thing people must know about the film is it's not generally about  The Babadook monster. In spite that the antagonist has an ambitiously  great campy design and his story is told well by a twisted storybook  with wondrously illustrated diorama, the movie is still laden on the  more human element of the tale, which is the struggle of a mother who  is unable to live normally. The pacing of her life may move too fast  for the film, but the sadness and deprivation beneath those regular  troubling days are totally manifested even without extending any of its  breathing. The plot mostly concerns Amelia finding a way to overcome  Samuel's behavioral issues and her memories with the accident than  dealing with the whole supernatural threat, for sure it is trying to  build some slow burn, but even without that horror movie sense, it  still feels like they're being tormented by life.  It deliberately takes their personal grief seriously, making sure that  they actually aren't insane, and nobody else could ever understand what  they're going through. This is pretty much the most compelling view of  the film, which makes them reasonably trapped into their own  nightmares. Mister Babadook only becomes the boiling point of the  ordeal. And when it hits to the part of the real scares, it sells well  whenever the monster attacks. Instead of loud lazy jump scares, it  rather spreads away signs of his presence and its effects to the  family. His appearance has more terror if he's lurking in the shadows.  It also has a nice use of practical effects to endure its very  effective creeps. The performances of the two leads are outstanding for  bringing the real heart of the picture. Essie Davis embraces the  character, making her fear, depression, and shifting madness all  visibly genuine. Same to the young Noah Wiseman who as well gives his  character's actions some sense of anxiety.  Some horror fans might get slightly disappointed for not giving The  Babadook monster enough of the characterization he deserves. The other  story is a lot more interesting to follow than his diorama tricks, and  that is why I keep stating that the the movie is best viewed as a  gloomy fairytale about a mother and a son fighting to keep a hold of  themselves and promise to protect each other from the odds, even if the  promise doesn't always apply, than just another horror movie being  shown in our theaters. While it still has the right amount of admirably  campy scares, the film often explores to the larger and much affecting  side of the story, and that sure offers beyond than what you expect to  this stale genre."
"klarnemann","10","24","31","4 October 2019"," Brilliant depiction of a borderline mother and her child
","Like the child -- and adults -- in the film, the audience is blind to the simple, shattering reality: Amelia created the Babadook. Amelia is -- and always was -- the Babadook. The film brilliantly depicts the dissociated perceptions of both child and mother as they attempt to survive their horrifying and tragic reality. Because, who can fathom a mother who is pathologically detached, hateful, malicious, and... violent towards her child? Not the child, not the mother, and not even the adults that surround them. The adults who watch this film. We are blinded by our deeply held belief that mothers are supposed to be nurturing, loving, and most of all... safe havens for their children. The reality is that Amelia is possessed -- by borderline personality disorder triggered by the traumatic loss of her husband. A perpetual victim, she feeds off of her self-pity and the pity of those around her, using it to justify her seething resentment of her child. Unable to take responsibility for her abusive behavior, she birthed the ""Babadook"". Underneath it all is a deeply troubled mother -- and a brave child living in constant fear of and for his mother, desperately struggling to protect himself, protect his (abusive) mother, and, ultimately, to survive. I am so grateful for this film, which so perfectly encapsulates the reality of hidden mental illness, giving life to the complex experiences of mother, child, and outside observers."

","You've heard of feel-good films, well this is not one. It's creepy and disturbing pretty well all the way, a good old horror fantasy with a nod to the psychological canniness of Nightmare on Elm Street but much more economical in terms of special effects, casting and I would imagine budget. It nevertheless maintains tension and atmosphere along with some high-flying dramatic sequences from the actors which bear comparison with The Exorcist. The plot also connects nicely with the psychological and existential conflicts facing a single mother whose son's birth coincided with the tragic death of her husband, and the whole nasty Babadook phenomenon, and its unresolved outcome, can certainly be read as an allegory of this traumatic event. Maybe it's over-reading to say the film also contains a Nietszchian lesson about the importance of embracing every aspect of one's life and history, no matter how horrific - but it works for me. The acting is amazingly good from the two leads, although the supporting characters are a bit stereotyped, a directing decision presumably. Sets and locations are charged with a bleak gloom, and the colour accordingly verges on monochrome. Love the specially made children's book, and Mr Babadook's physical character, as well as the wonderfully curated vintage movie footage appearing throughout on the TV screen. And a special word for the very fine intricately crafted sound design."
"goakim","10","253","429","10 April 2014"," Not what you expect
","I saw this film on Copenhagen pix yesterday. The movie was compared to ""the orphanage"", and even though i liked that film i was a bit in doubt if i should go for it because i was not in the mood for a heavy emotional, mother and son horror-drama. But its everything but. Sure its horror, sure its drama, but the tone is very different from the Spanish movies around same kind of subject which are very serious.This is way more fresh, snappy and sometimes funny actually, without being lame. But also creepy, its the change of moods thats freaky. Nice style. The actors are supreme and the whole socialrrealistic scene around it is far out and overexagerated, which the horror part also is. But it works, because its a metaphorical movie describing a feeling. Its highly original. If you expect the same supernatural children horror movie As you have seen before, think twice. This is new, this is cool, different. The best movie i have seen in a year. Serious. It never gets melodramatic, its fast, entertaining and a bit psychedelic. Very refreshing. And smart, clever. It has it all. I am a big fan."

","The Babadook is written and directed by Jennifer Kent. It stars Essie Davis, Noah Wiseman, Daniel Henshall and Hayley McElhinney. Music is by Jed Kurzel and cinematography by Radek Ladczuk. <br/><br/>Amelia is a single mother still haunted by the violent death of her husband, she is trying to deal with her young son Samuel's fear of a monster in the house. Initially tolerating it as a flight of fancy, the arrival of a book in the youngster's bedroom called Mr. Babadook, signals the start of a sinister presence that she herself can begin to fear as well. <br/><br/>Australia has been producing some great horror films in the last couple of decades, The Babadook is one of the best of the bunch. Jennifer Kent made it as a 10 minute short back in 2005 called Monster, itself a super piece of horror film making, now in full feature length form (Kent's first), the vision and intelligence explodes off the screen in every frame. <br/><br/>The premise at the core is not exactly fresh, but Kent manages to make The Babadook its own entity, skilfully steering away from formula jolts and terrors. Which in this day and age of horror retreads, sequel frenzies and blood for blood's sake, is most refreshing. This is a big character piece, a two hander of incredible emotional power, a mother and son dealing with their own demons before the eponymous Mr. Babadook enters the fray. We care about this pair of troubled souls, so much so that as we start to feel the dread, get the tingles down the spine, our hearts are also aching for them. The two performances of the actors quite simply magnificent. <br/><br/>Mr. Babadook is a pop-up picture book that suddenly arrives into their lives. The creature is a sort of cross between a German expressionistic nightmare and Jack the Ripper. The book itself is creepy enough in its own right, more so as it starts to take on a more terrifying tone – and Amelia proves unsuccessful at getting rid of the thing – the picture starts playing its ace psychological cards. The monster is kept mostly to the edges of the frames, or just popping up for a quick glance in unexpected places, this is a great move and suits the narrative perfectly. <br/><br/>The tech credits are top notch. A key aspect to getting the most out of The Babadook is to make sure the sound is loud, for the sound mix is tremendous and can bring pounds of goose-flesh rising up on your arms. Ladczuk's photography is at one with the themes pulsing away in the story, the colours paled and cheerless, enhancing the fractured psyches of mother and son, but Mr. Babadook is a jet black presence in this landscape. All told the art design from the book to the house and the creature is excellent. <br/><br/>Umbrella's Australian All Region Blu-ray Release has a super transfer and does justice to the sound mix. There's over an hour of interviews, which are a mixed bag of informative chat and back slapping, a 12 minute behind the scenes making of and some trailers. The bonus is the 10 minute short, Monster, The Babadook in its infancy but no less scary for it. <br/><br/>The Babadook is a superlative horror film for adults, like when Polanski met Kubrick and they decided to pay homage to Fritz Lang and George Melies. Yes it's that good. 10/10"

","I really enjoyed this film, its dark and unnerving without resorting to loud bangs or ""found footage"" style filming to get its scares.<br/><br/>Low budget and well shot, the film leans on the power of suggestion and tone to create a film which has a sense of unease throughout, tonally like the Exorcist, where there is this underlying feeling of dread and helplessness <br/><br/>The scares are not spoon fed, so this won't be for everyone, if your brand of horror is purely just modern films like Insidious or the recent Annabelle - then this might not be for you.<br/><br/>One of my favourite films of the year."
"shaunmutantdog","7","52","85","23 January 2016"," Better than most, but not quite up there with the best.
","It's a rare thing when I give anything labeled horror more than a passing glance. The genre has become so completely oversaturated by teen slasher flicks, soulless gorefests and inferior remakes. Having said that I'd heard enough to convince me this may be one of the rare exceptions, unsurprisingly this is a low-key non-Hollywood affair. <br/><br/>Of course there have been enough horrors over the years for a pretty well defined list of tropes to be a known part of the movie-going consciousness. While The Babadook does deviate from the standard affair we all know and are mostly bored of, it does bring in a few of the more classic tropes, the problem child, the distraught mother and thankfully the illusive villain. Throw in a fair dose of questionable insanity and you have a recipe for a decent classic style horror. <br/><br/>In this respect it doesn't disappoint, of course it can't hold up to Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist or The Shining but it is certainly familiar of those and in no bad way. Paying tasteful homage to inspirations is acceptable if the movie can stand up on its own weight and in this it succeeds. <br/><br/>The actual premise itself seems fairly original, although not groundbreaking, the shocks come from the actions of the characters rather than any clichéd jump-scare tactics. As others have mentioned, the underlying metaphor is not too subtle but surely that's part of what adds to the tension. <br/><br/>There was some really good editing throughout, keeping the feel of a fast paced movie while not rushing the story. The kid actor in it does an excellent job of appearing genuinely disturbed but simultaneously good natured. <br/><br/>The Babadook may not be a groundbreaker, I don't expect it to redefine the genre and I doubt it will appeal to the younger horror demographic, but if like me you yearn for the spirit of the classics to resurface once in a while, this is a pretty good attempt.<br/><br/>And provided the promise of no sequels is kept, this is one that will hold up well for some time."
"olivetart","9","141","265","2 November 2014"," Definitely a new horror classic!
","Let me start off with a little disclaimer: I am very picky with my horror movies made after the year 1990. Although some are excellent, I feel that they are few and far in between. I strongly believe that this is one of those few movies, and I urge you to watch it - no review necessary. GO NOW! This is one of those movies that isn't ""in-your-face"" scary, and it doesn't have jump-scares galore either. It's subtle, suspenseful, and downright creepy. There is a point in this movie where some believe the director lost the audience, but I beg to differ. This simple plot-twist was used to DRIVE the plot, not BE the plot (like in some other big- budget movies I won't name). The only little complaint I have about this film is the ending. I feel like they didn't know HOW to necessarily ""kill the monster"" properly and wanted a happier ending then most horror movies these days, but that only knocks this one down by one star for me. Now, before I spoil anything for you, I suggest you go and make up your own mind about this new horror classic. This is definitely one I wish we could have had in theaters this past Halloween, I'd buy two tickets!"
"Jared_Andrews","9","21","34","28 June 2017"," A Haunting and Brilliant Unconventional Horror Classic
","So many modern scary movies follow the same patterns. They introduce a killer—sometimes a person, sometimes a supernatural being—then the killer proceeds to wreak havoc on the main characters. Most of the frightening content comes from jump scares and violence. It's all very procedural and drab.<br/><br/>The Babadook breaks all the standard conventions. It does so right from the open.<br/><br/>Typically in horror films, the opening sequence takes place a night, in an isolated location, with a lone female. She meanders about without a care in the world then boom! The killer strikes. Then the title flashes on screen.<br/><br/>The Babadook begins much the same (except the lone female is with her young son rather than being alone). But no killer strikes. A purposefully framed shot lingers on screen, clearly foreshadowing something. Exactly what is not certain. Then the title flashes on screen. Viewers are left furrowing their brows and wondering, ""why that shot? I don't get it."" That's the point. You aren't supposed to understand. Not yet.<br/><br/>Unlike most scary movies, it does not immediately make clear who or what the monster is. The monster isn't even introduced until nearly 30 minutes into the movie. It doesn't appear on screen until 20 minutes after that. By movie's end, it remains cloudy what exactly the monster is or if this monster is a real, tangible entity.<br/><br/>As an enthusiastic scary movie fan, I cannot express how refreshing it is to see one that respects the audience's intelligence. Nothing is clearly spelled out. The mysterious nature fosters an eerie vibe that builds throughout the story. This causes the viewers to think and wonder, which is a vastly underused technique in scary movies. One of our greatest fears as humans is that of the unknown. This movie plays on that fear.<br/><br/>This mysterious style, along with the creepy lifeless color scheme in the house, establish an unsettling tone. Some of the best scary movies ever made opt for tone as the main method of frights over the traditional jump scares. Setting and maintaining a tone takes far more effort and skill, which is why fewer movies choose that route. Appreciate this tactic. You won't often see it executed better.<br/><br/>One of my favorite ways to judge the effectiveness of a scary movie is by how it sticks with me after it ends. In this case, I felt as much unease in the two hours following the credits as I did in those preceding them. The Babadook has a haunting brilliance that sticks with you. That's the sign of horror classic."

","The Babadook surprised me on two counts.<br/><br/>First, as someone who doesn't often get the warm fuzzies at spooky films, this did. It's a well acted, believable account of a mum and child being haunted by a seemingly malevolent 'thing'. Effective jumps and creeping tension are handled well.<br/><br/>But I was surprised again by the end, as I came away seeing it as an allegory for deep grief and a way through it. I found it quite moving, the mum finding a place for that darkness, finally taking control of it."
"Imaculata","8","50","96","7 January 2015"," Most people will not get it, and rate the movie accordingly
","This movie's biggest strength, is also it's biggest weakness. It's a cleverly constructed horror story with multiple layers. The problem is that it never explains itself, nor does it even drop the faintest hint by the end. Thus, people who went into this thinking this is just a generic monster flick, will come out of it feeling pretty much the same. But that is not what this is.<br/><br/>The movie is far more intelligent than a lot of people give it credit for. It's also a credit to the excellent direction, that this movie never delivers some sort of forced explanation of what it is really about. Without spoiling the movie, this film tricks you into thinking you are going to see a typical horror movie, but it ventures into far darker psychological territory. But like I said, most viewers will not get it. This is why this movie has received some terrible ratings from some viewers, but this is not an accurate representation of the actual quality of the movie.<br/><br/>For the other half of the audience though, this is one heck of a ride. I suspect some viewers will get it halfway through, and some two-thirds into the movie. And everyone else won't get it at all. The acting is stunning, the cinematography and lighting are amazing, and I also really like the sound editing (except when they use a sound effect that's clearly from a very old and overused sound library). I found it especially compelling how the movie shifts focus several times during the story, regarding who the villain is.<br/><br/>See it, and judge it for yourself. Do not let impulsive ratings fool you."
"aldri-feb","7","70","140","8 August 2014"," Beware of the Babadook
","Original and truly terrifying, ""The Babadook"" proves what a horror-fiction movie could do with involving more on psychological emotion from it's protagonist character rather than shocking audience with ghost appearances. It has totally different ways to scare compared with James Wan's ""The Conjuring"" or ""Insidious"". The movie focused on Babadook, a scary creature from children's tale but even The Babadook appearance itself wasn't much exploited and seems too mysterious. The débutant director, Jennifer Kent has successfully and smartly convinced also planted images of Babadook character at audience's mind without much showing what it really looks like and keep them guessing at the ending part. Babadook only appears couple times at shadow, sounds or some hallucinations. <br/><br/>What definitely makes this film that scary is a standout performance from Essie Davis. Her acting as Amelia greatly portrays a destroyed and depressed mother who have unwell circumstances to raise her only son. At first half of the film, audiences were dragged to feel the stressful condition and sympathy to Amelia but she with her gesture and changed behavior would surely scare them when it reaches last 20 minutes. ""The Babadook"" is a respectful and undeniably creepy old-school horror movie that is rarely to find these days. With also supported by strong performances from Essie Davis, spooky suggestive premise and surrounded by annoying score, makes Babadook easier to sneak in your midnight sleep and haunt you as worst nightmare."
"Cineman17","7","61","122","15 January 2014"," The scariest ""children's film"" I have ever seen
","We are all familiar with the scenario: a young boy with an overactive imagination becomes terrified of the monster underneath his bed, and rushes to his mother for a therapeutic bedtime story. But what if this imaginary monster actually becomes real? This is the set up for a new Australian horror flick premiering at this year's Sundance Film Festival entitled The Babadook. Our protagonist, Sam, is terrified of monsters. So terrified he is loosing sleep, causing trouble in class, and creating his own sinister weaponry out of household objects as a means of defense. It's enough to drive his widowed mother, Amelia, into a frantic state of paranoia. As tensions between the two escalate, a new presence called the Babadook makes it's way into the household which questions the sanity of everyone involved. The film cleverly embraces and deconstructs typical horror film conventions in order to create something new. Though it is hilariously playful and entertaining, it's also a terrifying psychological thrill in the same vein as films like Black Swan or Rosemary's Baby. Essie Davis is great as Amelia, but newcomer Noah Wiseman gives an incredibly memorable child acting performance. If you are a horror fan looking for something new, look no further than The Babadook. Just be prepared to have nightmares afterward, and remember to leave the kiddos at home for this one."

","On paper, The Babadook had a lot of potential and seemed to promise something refreshing to a genre that desperately needs it. Unfortunately, it suffers from all the usual tropes of horror films, without bringing anything new to the table. I found both lead actors to be particularly annoying : the always whining and screaming boy and the clinically depressed hushing mother. I couldn't care less about their fate ! As far as the monster is concerned, the director didn't bother to explain its origin, meaning or how to defeat it. As always in this case, some may like the fact that it leaves things purposefully open to interpretation, and others, like me, would have preferred if some hints were dropped here and there ! Either way, the ending is really unsatisfying and dull.<br/><br/>I'm sure the film is meant as a metaphor for the mother's grief, but it could have been better if they had more carefully and subtly built the tension, and if the cinematography and score were more sinister. It had potential but I found the pacing to be a bit off and the scary bits were quite cheap. In fact, I'm not even sure you can call The Babadook a horror film. It felt more like a psychological thriller and should have been advertised as such. 5 out of 10."

Even though I thought I knew what was coming I still found myself caught off guard. The young boy is an amazing actor, and when I learned from the Q & A after the movie how some of the scenes were filmed it made me appreciate the movie more. Parts of one scene reminded me of the movie Sinster which I saw a few weeks before.

","""The Babadook"" does two things that seem almost impossible for a modern horror film: create a tense, creepy sense of discomfort from beginning to end without resorting to lame jump scares or over the top gore, and develop its characters enough that we actually care about them.<br/><br/>Drifting away from the ""cinema-veritas"" style that seems almost a rule for horror nowadays, the film tells the story of a family that is haunted by the titular monster, the ""babadook"", a creature that, even when he doesn't make a ""real appearance"" on the screen, now rivals icons such as Michael Myers, Chucky and Jason Voorhees in my book. But the short appearances of the monster are all for the best, as in horror ""the less you know, the scarier it is"". Each shot is also beautifully crafted, each one guaranteed to build up momentum until the climax arrives. And finally, the performances are particularly strong for a horror film (someone get that kid an Oscar!).<br/><br/>There are still a few shortcomings, particularly on the effects department, but all is forgiven given its low budget, and, aren't all the best horror movies made with heart over money? The only other fault I see in the film is that it could have been a little shorter, but again, this is just a minor criticism.<br/><br/>If you're a horror fan or you're just in for a good scare, you should see this right now! (even William Friedkin, director of ""The Exorcist"" loves it!) Let's just hope Hollywood does not the turn the well dry (""Paranormal Activity"" series, I'm looking in you direction...) and leaves this movie at is: a beautiful, nearly perfect little film that is not only the best horror film of the year (BY FAR!) but of the most wildly inventive horror features of the decade.<br/><br/>9 out of 10"

In all that first 40 minutes you feel like strangling the little boy yourself. He's constant whining shouting and screaming will really get on your nerves. The mother is actually well played for the first half because I actually felt sorry for her having to listen to the whinge bag child. The last part of the movie awful. It had moments like every other horror except they managed to screw up with the shoddy special effects. If you want to see a true horror watch anything other than this. Don't believe the hype. If some people are really scared by this I think those people couldn't handle Mickey Mouse. Don't waste your money."

","the Movie starts off a bit slow in my own opinion, in the beginning there is mostly drama and no horror but that changes later on. but they build up the drama and horror quite good and mix in a quite a bit psychological fear and elements, such as the struggle of being a single mom who is struggling with the trauma of her dead husband and a quite difficult child and being judged by others and society as a parent. how the moms struggles with difficult emotions and how that blends in with the horror part later in the movie is mixed in a very smart and good way. the horror effects are fantastic.<br/><br/>+ the actors. <br/><br/>+ the the music, sound and visual horror effects (i got goosebumps several times).<br/><br/><ul><li>A bit slow in beginning.</li></ul>"

"rjaynesmith","3","85","193","15 June 2014"," Really didn't like it
","I really didn't enjoy The Babadook and it seemed that this feeling was shared with many in the cinema I was at. The acting, production and technical elements were good but the story and character development really let it down. There was no explanation of why the Babadook was in their house or what it's motivation was at all, which is really important in a movie with a supernatural element. Also I felt the way the supporting characters behaved to be very untrue to life and needed more back story to make their actions believable. The film was also a bit long and the ending just bizarre. The ending might have worked, again, if there was more development into why the characters were behaving the way they were. <br/><br/>If you're looking for a good Australian horror I would watch The Loved Ones."
"shauncore808","1","138","325","17 May 2015"," Not even bad enough to be funny
","{Technically contains spoilers. Nothing to actually spoil}<br/><br/>Suggested tag-line: ""The consequences of not spanking your child""<br/><br/>For the entire painstaking extent of the movie, one, and only one, emotion persists: a profound dislike of both of the main characters. The mother, after being in the car during the death of her husband years earlier, has an incredible amount of difficulty doing even the simplest, easiest tasks. Simply put, she is pathetic in the worst meaning of the term; a shell of a person. This may very well have been written intentionally, except that the shear amount of time that has passed makes it unacceptable that she is still somehow unable to handle simple day-to-day experiences even four years later.<br/><br/>It is this inability that has allowed her child to grow to roughly age 4 without even the faintest sign of discipline. Simply put, the child is more of a monster than the actual monster in this movie. Time and time again, he does things to endanger himself and others, all the while the mother just continues on in her own perpetually overwhelmed world.<br/><br/>This situation drones on and on for more than half the movie. To say that it's painful to sit through is an understatement. To say that it makes you despise both of them is understatement.<br/><br/>Given the rave reviews this movie received, I was determined to see it through to the end despite being thoroughly tired of it by the 30- minute mark. What I found was an anti-climatic movie that was sub-par in every regard except possibly the acting, assuming that these terrible characters were indeed as intended. To say that The Babadook is bad fails to do it justice.<br/><br/>Many people that like the movie praise it for being atypical of a horror movie, for being more of a psychological thriller than shock or jump horror, for it's atmosphere. As someone that thinks jump horror to be cheap, and far prefers psychological thrillers any day, let me say this: The Babadook is not a psychological thriller, as it is not thrilling. It is not atmospheric, as the entire movie is dull in every sense. It is not jump horror. It is not shock horror. It is not gore. It is not excited. It is not intelligent. It is not creative. It is nothing more than a strung-out story of two terrible people.<br/><br/>In short, it is nothing."

","This is a psychological drama where the protagonist refuses to resolve her own self-generated difficulties. There was no character to identify with in the film. As the film progressed to the ten minute mark, my empathetic response to the self- destructive protagonist had already evaporated. So, who cares?<br/><br/>Netflix classifies this hot mess as Thriller, Independent Thriller, Psychological Thriller. At least they did not mark it as 'horror.' Also, Thriller? Really? There is nothing thrilling (or even engaging) about this descent into the outer boundaries of stupidity.<br/><br/>The Movie Database (TMDb) calls it Drama (yes), Thriller (no), and Horror (no). The film had no body horror, no serial killers, no gore-fest. The madness aspect was all fake, so the supposed supernatural elements were each and every one fake. What aspect of horror is this misstep supposed to represent?<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes marked the genres as Drama, Horror, Mystery and Suspense. There is no suspense here since there were no real threats involved. The protagonist's pathology was set clearly during the first 45 seconds. The mystery, I suppose, was whether she would decide to get well. The other mystery is why RT rated this dog so highly.<br/><br/>There are so many dull stretches in this film. At times I thought I was watching Paranormal Activity without the jump scares. Also, watching full-screen, low resolution badly taped ancient television is just boring, whether or not the protagonist thinks she sees something in the childish images.

I don't blame the actor since he is a kid, but he wasn't the best at acting (smiling when he was supposed to be scared sort of stuff).

","the babadook is the story of a women who loses her husband on the way to have her child...this happened 7 years before and is the main conflict that arises between her and her ingenious 7 year old son. basically the mother indirectly blames her 7 year old son for her husbands death. the child starts out as the poster boy for childhood behavior problems which essentially means hes two screws away from being a full fledged sociopath. the mother on the other is depressed, repressed, sexually frustrated , tired and on the verge of an emotional breakdown. the kid seems to have a ""home alone"" complex coming up with weaponry that proves the kids ingenuity and understanding of what going on whiten his family. nobody seems to understand either him nor his mom and his mom ( and everyone else it seems) all blame the kid for the mothers emotional instability. one day the mother picks up a book with the words ""the babadook"" a child's book about a demon that kills children. this demon suddenly takes the role of the new affliction between the mother and son, as the son claims the babadook is real while the mother contends that its part of his overactive imagination. as the story goes on the roles are suddenly switched when the son now seems to be the sane one and the mother seems to be the one losing her mind. this is not a the typical clichéd mother and son relationship. in the end this movie is less about a demon and instead serves as a metaphor for the difficult relationship between a mother and her 7 year old son. your left with a feeling that the Babadook may be a figment of that families imagination, a manifestation created by the family in an attempt to coup with their problems..but it could very well be real...there is evidence to suggest both may be true. this is a must watch for horror fans."

The plot was unable to get to me throughout the length of the movie, the so called scary scenes were laughable at the very least. The Babadook himself was as scary as a cute puppy, weather he was a figment of her broken mind or an actual real monster, was ultimately not important since the movie failed in setting the scenes in a way to make it interesting, no answers no questions just a broken movie. I would have had a better time, an more enjoyable time hammering a nail in my head, then watching this movie.

","After viewing the trailer for this film I immediately wanted to see it, it promised to be a very good film and appeared to have a good storyline..... My how appearances are deceiving! I don't actually know how to begin this review as the film is so so very bad, I am unsure where to start. I have ticked the contains spoiler box to cover myself, although there isn't a great deal of story to the film so I'm sure I won't ruin it for anyone.<br/><br/>Let me start off by saying the reviews on this site for this film are laughable! I have read a couple of reviews however, that have given the film a 1/10 or a 2/10 and I agree with them. Trust me though, if there was an option to rate zero stars or minus then I most certainly would have. OK, so we start out with a mother child relationship which actually intrigued me as I was thinking along the lines of The Ring, Dark Water which are quite good. The mother is a washed out, depressed woman who couldn't smile for all the tea in china. Her son on the other hand is actually very quirky and I found him to be extremely intelligent and by far the best actor. We then have the bedtime story and the anticipated Babadook book, a book with a sinister rhyme and a few blank pages. This takes up about the first quarter maybe more of the film, which is very slow (YAWN). Then we have the light bulbs flickering, a few knocks at the door and another version of a Babadook book (you'll see for yourselves what I mean). This is basically it, until the film turns even more pathetic and the woman gets overtaken by the ""monster"" which actually looks stupidly similar to a pencil drawing drawn by a very bad or very drunk artist. Trust me when I say that this is basically it! There is a part of this film that contains unnecessary animal cruelty and I did at this point skip the film for a couple of seconds, but I doubt that couple of seconds made the film any better to be honest another hour of this film couldn't have improved it...<br/><br/>It's extremely boring and drawn out, it is filled full of suspense but that suspense leads absolutely nowhere! After I watched the film I did a Google search as I wanted to know what the purpose of the story actually was, while I didn't find my answer I did find a review which labelled the film as ""intelligent"". Let me just state with 100% certainty that, if this film for one second is intelligent then I am the Queen of England. Apart from the acting by the little boy which is great, the rest of it is terrible. The monster is an awful black smudge of pencil, which isn't seen for 99% of the film, and the story is hideously bad and extremely boring!! Trust me people if for one second you are considering watching this, decorate your house and watch the paint dry instead.... You'll enjoy it more! Don't pay cinema prices, don't waste good money buying it and if you are desperate to see it watch it on Sky Box office or Netflix, at least that way you're getting a choice of other films for your money and not just this pathetic excuse for a film.<br/><br/>Would I watch this again? NO! Never ever ever as long as I live, even if I was the only person on the planet and this was all that was on Television! Do I recommend it? NO! I cannot tell you enough how bad it is, why on earth the reviews are stating ""Best film ever"" and ""Awesome"" is actually beyond me. All I can assume is that people have been watching this film while very drunk, as a Disney film would have been more scary!! I rated a 1/10 which I believe is still too good for this pile of crap, trust me people save your money and one hour and thirty minutes of your lives and avoid this film like the plague."

","A woman is involved in a crash. It's a nightmare based on something that happens years ago. On their way to the hospital to give birth her husband dies in a car crash. Years later we meet her again and the her now young son. She works at a convalescent hospital and hasn't gotten over her husband's death. The kid plays games about being a magician and also builds weapons and runs around saying he will protect the mother. But he's also problematic. He gets in trouble at school, with neighbors, family. He looks creepy and drives the mother crazy but in good modern fashion she barely dares raise her voice, let alone give him a good and deserved beating. She takes him out of school, and some child services people arrive. Finally she takes him to a psychiatrists and gets some tranquilizers for him and her.<br/><br/>At some point the kid finds a creepy pop-up book called ""Mr. Babadook"" about some creepy guy dressed in black with lots of teeth who wants to be let in the house and warns of killing people. She hides the book but it appears again. The kid becomes obsessed with it seeing Babadook everywhere. The next time she reads it, it now presents a woman who kills her dog, a child, and herself. She, too, has a dog, and as all dogs in movies, it doesn't end well. This new story will become somewhat prophetic as the babadook does enter into her body. The kid will get to enact his fantasies of protector of the mother.<br/><br/>On the face of it, The Babadook is lame psychological thriller that's frustrating and infuriating. Who wants to see bad miserable parents and their obnoxious kids? So you end up rooting for babadook to kill these two in gruesome ways. And that's a problem for any movie, if your two main and almost only characters aren't particularly likable. This movie is not scary in spite of what some odd reviews claim. The babadook doesn't really show up all that much. His voice though is pretty creepy.<br/><br/>We are led to believe then that there is some very deep meaning to this movie, and there are plenty of interpretation on IMDb. If anything perhaps, this is about the repressed desire mothers have to kill their annoying son, who knows. I don't think this movie aims to lead us to one single interpretation. The problem is that I couldn't care less whether this movie has the deepest religious symbolism or presents some radical political criticism. I didn't care for the characters, nor for the story; I didn't connect. I imagine that single mothers will enjoy this movie, or parents with problematic kids, or folks who feel like their life is driving them crazy.<br/><br/>The question I wonder about is whether this director is a good director or not. On the one hand, the story should have lent itself to a better, scarier movie. On the other hand, with few characters and a pretty basic story the director managed to make more out of what she really had. The Babadook enforced my belief that it is extremely difficult to make a good movie about madness, perhaps even impossible."

If I wanted to see a bleak, psychologically unhinged film with way too many metaphors, I would have picked something else. I read such great reviews all over the net I thought I would buy it and settle in for a night of scares. pfft! my grandmother is scarier than this film.<br/><br/>It feels like we come in halfway through the setup. A seriously annoying and badly behaved kid and a mother already strung out and at wit's end. It doesn't endear empathy - I spent the first half hour being annoyed AT the film for all the caterwauling and shrillness. I did not empathise with the characters. Don't blink or you'll miss the reason - a one line explanation of what happened six years ago. There was no recent catalyst that triggered off the forthcoming events, no explanation of why they would find the book at this time, it just... 'happened'. <br/><br/>Dreary, miserable, slow, predictable and overly symbolic with no relief. If you wanted to study this film in a course, it ticks all the boxes to endlessly psychoanalise the mind of the mother about whether it is real or some sort of delayed PTSD manifesting as the ""the monster in the closet"". I understand why they chose the set design to be washed out and shadowy but it didn't change with any action either - there was no high contrast in the scenes outside of the house as to inside the house. No sense of The real world vs the internal struggle. It was just all dull and draining to watch. <br/><br/>and the dog. really? gratuitous and unnecessary. <br/><br/>I was looking forward to this film but as an entertainingly good horror movie - I didn't expect I'd have to 'read' it. <br/><br/>The Babadook failed to impress on either a horror or macabre level.<br/><br/>Not even bad enough to be good."

Once you get to the end and realize what the whole movie meant, it was quite a different rewarding experience compared to any other film. <br/><br/>I think the people giving this movie 1 star really don't understand the premise of the movie. It's not meant to be supernatural or cliché like every other horror movie. The entire movie is meant to be a metaphor. <br/><br/>Me and a couple of friends figured it out as we were watching it right at the end of the movie. The entire movie, the mother and son had been struggling with the loss of their father/husband, and you start to realize it more throughout the film. The Babadook monster represents the feeling of depression, and the things our minds can come up with when we are at our worst. That's where the real eerie moments come into play of the film. <br/><br/>The ending represented that we have to be able to cope with our grief, realize its there, and accept it instead of letting it consume us. Hence the mother bringing the ""monster"" the worms at the end of the movie. Just another part of the metaphor that we have to keep our demons at bay and learn to accept them. <br/><br/>Unless you're expecting a cliché horror movie with jump scares and overdone supernatural plot about exorcisms, ghosts, and out of world beings, then do not watch this movie and make an uneducated review.

I think this film deserves an overall IMDb rating of about 8 which is at the higher end for this genre, I'm scoring it a 10 however, to balance the 7.2 it currently has which I feel is a little under par for this thoroughly entertaining film. I cannot think of much I don't like about this film. Maybe if they had a few more million, a visual effect here or there could have been a bit better but that's about it really. The Babadook monster itself is as creepy as they come and about the most terrifying sounding monster/entity since the devil/captain howdy from the Exorcist. Mr bab a dook is a bad book indeed and an exquisite film. A must see for true lovers of horror/drama."

","I have absolutely no idea why there are so many positive reviews of this movie, it's cliché, poorly acted, and just awful. <br/><br/>The only reasonable explanation that I have as to why this movie rates so highly on IMDb is that one of the producers, or someone involved in marketing this movie has paid a bunch click farmers to click 10/10 and write fake reviews for this movie. <br/><br/>This movie is an intellectual carcinogen, please don't waste your time. The pace is painfully slow, the characters are completely unlikable, the story makes no sense, and the ending is almost like the writers got bored and just decided to end the movie once they'd sucked up enough money from the Australian government in the form of artistic grants designed to prop up the rotting corpse that is the Australian film industry.<br/><br/>Movies like this are the reason why I vote for the Australian Liberal party."

","I have ticked ""contains spoiler"" to comply with the IMDb rules but to be honest reading this will not spoil the film for anyone with at least half a brain cell.<br/><br/>I watched this after reading reviews all over the place that it was the ""scariest film of the year"" and other commendations such as ""fantastic"" or ""Psychological horror"". However I found nothing to be further from the truth.<br/><br/>Set in some dreary Australian country town a Widow and her young son are finding it hard to come to terms with the loss of his father and her husband in a car crash some years earlier.<br/><br/>At least I think that is the reason why the woman had a face like a kite from the very beginning and showed hardly any love towards her son who initially had behaviour issues before somehow becoming cured on a weeks' worth of prescription sedatives.<br/><br/>I must confess at this stage that I did not watch all of the film and turned it off at the point she was going to throttle their pet dog! So if by any miracle the part I missed makes the first part any better please accept my apologies. I think it safe to say however this is no Pulp Fiction masterpiece! So after booting some horrible little girl out of her tree house and busting her nose the little bugger takes a hand crafted weapon to class and shoots that off. The school suggests supervised tuition in all lessons (how generous to donate such resources) but this isn't good enough for old kite face so she takes him out of school.<br/><br/>The kid then finds some book called ""The Babadook"" from anywhere you care to imagine and chooses it for a bedtime story one night. Mother starts to read the scary illustrated pop-up book to her nutcase son before realizing half way through it won't end well, flicks through the last 6 blank pages (yeah I'm thinking straight away those will soon be mysteriously filled in) and switches to Winnie the Poo or some such thing.<br/><br/>She hides the book away before it reappears again so she rips it up and throws it in the outside bin. Now at this point something rings a bell in my head from another film where something bad or evil was ripped up, thrown in a bin, comes back again glued together before being burnt instead.<br/><br/>Well would you guess it, the next day there is hammering on the front door and it is good old ""The Babadook"" book returning home! And not only has it been glued back together but the last pages have been filled in - Never! Those last pages basically explain that she will become even more of a loveless sour faced old hag than she already is, will kill the dog and then the kid, the end. So there is your spoiler (if you actually consider there is anything to spoil) as up to the throttling the dog part at least that is exactly what happens when I hit the 'Stop' button.<br/><br/>Look out for The Babadook himself; you will know him when you see him as he looks like he was pencil animated in a few brief times like a badly drawn cartoon character lost in A-Ha's ""Take on Me"" music video! Don't waste your time with this croc mate!"

","Before watching the film I had read reviews which adored the film absolutely. After watching the film, I have come to the conclusion that this is even worse than 'The Happening' (which was the worst movie ever before Babadook for me).<br/><br/>It is a challenge for every filmmaker who makes a horror film to employ techniques that have not been used before or else the scare, would in fact not be a scare and would be a straight rip off that audience might have already experienced in other movies. While Babadook tries to avoid these clichéd techniques (which it still does at one point or another), it has absolutely nothing new to offer to the genre. Rhymes and childlike antagonist isn't exactly what the horror genre needs. It needs narratives that play with our emotions.<br/><br/>Through out the movie, it seems they've tried hard not to scare us with some experimental shots and editing (straight from music videos and experimental for the genre only) every now and then that I seriously wished to God such style would serve some sort of purpose and help a huge plot twist that is going to help makes sense of what has happened and why the movie was constructed this particular way and probably leave us a scared as well. Well nothing of that sort happened and all it was an experimental waste. <br/><br/>So while it is always good to avoid clichés, offering nothing is the worst thing you can do with one's time and money."

","I am genuinely shocked and confused at all the high ratings for this film. Most well-known review websites have given this film very high ratings and the only reasoning I can see behind this is there is some sort of scam going on to get as many people to go and watch this awful film in the cinema around Halloween time as possible. I rarely go to the cinema and feel this disappointed and robbed of my money but the film simply wasn't good. Is there a possibility critics get paid extra to give films good reviews? I don't know... but from this day forward I will not be referring to critics websites as they either don't have a clue what they're talking about or there is a scam going on in the film industry. I'm particularly disappointed with Rotten Tomatoes who gave it a whopping 96%. This is very misleading, confusing and just plain wrong! <br/><br/>The film started okay and the acting was half decent but I spent most of the film waiting for the plot to kick in and to get at least half a scare but nothing! The acting swiftly deteriorated as did the story line. I have seen many horror films before and I am normally quite positive about most films in general but i could not rate this film higher than 2/10 simply for the reason it was badly made. Not only does it copy the basic themes of so many recent horror films such as the conjuring but it portrays them terribly. <br/><br/>PLEASE don't waste your money seeing this film at the cinema and don't even bother getting the DVD. If you know someone unfortunate enough to have already purchased it then watch it together so you can witness how unscary and badly directed it is for yourself... then burn it together and never speak of it again."

","'The Babadook' really isn't that scary, which is usually the number one requisite for a horror movie, but this is a rare case of that not really mattering because there is so much other brilliance to the film. It starts out like any other horror movie and I thought to myself here we go again, but by the halfway point I was beginning to realise this was something quite unique and fascinating. The acting was fantastic and there was clearly more going on that what immediately met the eye. <br/><br/>A couple of months back I was reading which actresses were expected to be given Oscar nominations and someone mentioned that Essie Davis in 'The Babadook' was the best performance of the year and that they were disappointed she had no chance of being nominated. I thought to myself how bizarre it was to hear of an actress in a horror movie being given such critical acclaim. The genre just typically doesn't allow for such a thing. Now I understand however. Her performance is incredible. Every aspect of her acting was impeccable right throughout the film. No matter the mood of the scene, she nailed it. Another very fine Australian performance from 2014 to go with Sarah Snook in 'Predestination'.<br/><br/>It's a great film. Seeing it is only half the fun though, because reading all the theories and small details that may have been missed is a real pleasure. I can't remember a horror movie that seems to have created this much debate and discussion in..... well, possibly ever. The annoying son was an absolutely marvelous creation of a character because it really did put us in the position and understanding point of view of the mother throughout. <br/><br/>Had director Jennifer Kent been able to accomplish more frights (the scenes were there to do it) I think this had the potential to go down as an all-time classic. Unfortunately though some people subscribe to the theory that if they pay for a horror movie, they want to be scared. Those particular people also generally don't care too much about underlying messages or metaphors either. A shame because if everyone took the time to appreciate this for what it really is I think they would find some real joy."

There were some brilliant shots in this movie, emphasizing how weak the mother is. I do no think that this movie should be classed as a horror, it had a very minimal scare factor and would much more suit the genre of a thriller. The character and voice of the Babadook also didn't cut it for me. It just seemed too fake and was not scary for me at all.

I thought the boy was extremely annoying and intolerable and several times during the movie I wished that the mother would have slapped him silly. The mother wasn't much better.

The problem is where it goes from there. I'm not going to bother explaining what the story is, you probably already read that. The movie is made in such a way that leaves you wondering if the Babadook is real or if the main character is going insane. That is definitely a plus, and the movie goes along this line almost all the way. Then there is that scene where the lady next door, knocks on the door at the middle of the night to ask if everything is OK. This is by no means a spoiler, it is just an alert that is when thing start going downhill. From then on, the story decays to the point of pure silliness. It is a train wreck. I've seen quite a few movies like this and it still mesmerizes me why and how do the directors manage to spoil everything so near the end. Obviously I can't detail to you what goes on towards the end, but I'll tell you that if the ending was decent I'd probably scored The Babadook with something like 7 or 8 stars.

Here Babadook is the metaphor for Amelia's suffering and grief. Because of this grief, she didn't take care of her son properly. This grief increased so much that she became possessed by her own tensions and turned crazy. At last, she accepted her fate and overcame her emotions. And she finally moved on.

There is an ominous foreboding that pervades every scene, and I truly did not know what to expect, although you knew you were in for something unpleasant.<br/><br/>Another great aspect about the first half is that I honestly did not know if ""The Babadook"" was truly haunting this family or if this was a trip into the mother's psychosis. By the end of the movie, it is still not entirely clear.<br/><br/>I started to be less afraid once the ""reveal"" happened and we understood where the story was headed. It was still creepy, but I spent more time trying to figure out if she was crazy or if she was really being tormented, the thought of which added a whole new unpleasant dimension. I think there is a difference between deliberately trying to be vague and letting viewers figure it out and deliberately being confusing by putting conflicting clues. That being said, the movie keeps you hooked to the very end and I was nearly breathless as the last scene concluded, unaware of what was about to happen.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend this movie. It will not make you jump and scream, but I had goosebumps more than once due to how creepy it was.

","This horror film revolves around the difficult relationship between an imaginative and active son and his mother, a recent widow, both of whom seek to overcome the trauma of a very poorly resolved mourning. From an early moment, we understand the difficulties that the child brings to his mother, both of which are very poorly understood by all those around them. Sooner, the poor mother seems closer to a fit of nerves or deep depression. This finally happens when the character of a children's book (apparently written by herself) begins to take on a life of its own and to terrorize mother and child. The film is a lesson about depression, mourning and trauma. Sometimes, the bogeyman lives within ourselves and its us that we should be afraid of. The scares exist but the tense and terrifying atmosphere is something that is hardly ignored. Concerning actors, Essie Davis is the protagonist and carries the film on her back with great courage, presenting herself without makeup in order to look much more worn, as it requires her character. She is undoubtedly an artist of great talent, capable of embodying difficult characters."
"robertbert-04625","8","4","6","27 March 2017"," The Babadook Review
","The film ""The Babadook"" takes an unique twist at horror that may not seem appealing to your every day horror movie thrill seekers. Jennifer Kent tosses away the modern scare tactics like jump scares and horrifying faces and instead gives us a psychological thriller. The film relies on an eerie atmosphere which is created through the use of lighting and shadows, creating darkness, leaving the audience in a constant state of paranoia. What really contributed to this constant paranoia was the effective use of sounds throughout the film. Even when Amelia was reading from the book, we hear this ambient sound which seems like it was used to unnerve the audience, preparing us for fright. From the skittering of the monster along the walls to the absolutely terrifying shriek of BA BA DOOK DOOK, the sounds really leave a chilling impression on the audience. In my opinion, an interesting concept is that the monster seems to be a symbolic reflection on Amelia's depression which increasingly developed as her mental state worsened from taking care of her annoyingly pretentious child. Overall, Jennifer Kent chooses not to scare you with stereotypical creepy images or noises but instead haunts you through the psychological decay of a grieving single mother."

After another stressful day and after checking the routinized hiding places Amelia lets her son Samuel (Noah Wiseman) choose a bedtime story and picks ""Mister Babadook"" from a variety. As the restless days and nights go by, the subtle nuances of Amelia's real state of mind begin to surface after personally encountering the Babadook. Each episode more and more noticeable.<br/><br/>With each scene in the film was carefully pieced together and in an interview with the director Jennifer Kent, David Ehrlich from ""The Dissolve"" Kent said ""I did storyboard"" the film ""starts very centered, everything is framed very centered and composed,"" ""and things start to become more discordant visually."" The mise-en-scene in each shot alludes to Amelia's current state of mind and hints at future events. There are lamps placed near Amelia in certain scenes that portray her character. In the beginning of the film there are two lamps lighting the room up, but the lamp shade next Amelia is clouded compared to the lamp shade next to Samuel. Lastly, both sounds, within the story and part of the scenes, build the tension and create an uncomfortable atmosphere. Also, the ambient sounds, music, and the leitmotif when Amelia is experiencing high stress and anxiety also add another layer of uneasiness. In the scenes when Amelia is flipping through the torn pages of the same book (Mister Babadook) she disposed of herself a couple nights before, the leitmotif is playing throughout as she reads through new found horrors and illustrations of her murdering her son. The Babadook is a unique film that takes a step back from the basic structure of a horror movie and takes a step closer to a more living, contemporary sense of horror. The Babdook is definitely a well written and directed film and deserves more praise than simply being a ""smart film."""

","The Babadook-spoiler alert <br/><br/>The film The Babadook directed by Jennifer Kent beautifully represents just how seriously the condition of depression can take over our lives. The narrative is laid out to give important details of this single mother's life in the perfect timing to keep the audience involved in what she is going through. Weighed down by the sudden, tragic death of her husband just before delivering her child, Amelia goes about living her life whilst keeping these feelings suppressed. She treats her son, Samuel, in an almost-too- nice sort of fashion, surely trying to ignore the resentment she has for her husband's death. Nothing changes until Mister Babadook enters their life. The story book shows up randomly, perhaps representing a change in the ability for her to contain the depression. The metaphorical use of Mister Babadook perfectly represents her depression boiling over the edge to a point where she has no control. Kent's subtle and simplistic directing adds to the tension creating a building suspension throughout the film. The house along with Amelia's appearance seem to decay as the tension build, showing how Mister Babadook (or her depression) is rapidly taking over. However, Mister Babadook is hardly seen in whole, mostly coming across as simply a sound, or as his disguise which easily looks like a man (likely representing her husband). This could show how the depression is not seen but it's always there, haunting you. Ultimately, Amelia learns to control Mister Babadook keeping him as a sort of ""pet"", and not only suppress her depression but accepts it. Overall this is not a typical gory horror movie, but the haunting psychological effects will stay with you for much longer."
"bsball-69546","7","4","6","27 March 2017"," The Babadook: Not Just Another Monster Under the Bed
","Jennifer Kent aims to explore the psyche of the anxious in this one of a kind film. While this movie lacks the originality of the ""monster under the bed"" idea, the innovation comes alive when we as an audience realize the monster is created from our minds. The American horror genre traditionally will keep one, and only one, living creature safe: the children. However, the Babadook pushes that norm to its limits. While Sam does not ever actually ever become a victim, the bloody corpse of Sam from Amelia's vivid imagination is real enough. Of course, it is the imagination of the mother, the monstrous feminine, which is the true monster. While the Babadook can put on a funny hat, smile, and pretend everything is normal, the suppression of anxiety can lead to a horrifying creature when the cap is lifted. This is similar to how Jack Nicholson becomes the monster in The Shining (1980). The Babadook can also creep up on us, getting closer and closer if we do not slow down and look around. By the way, the monster can also be created through the lack of sleep as most of us can relate to. This film also throws into question the validity of rationality in regard to the thoughts of the mentally ill. Do we disregard the warnings of the mentally handicapped because of their condition? Or do we consider them to be geniuses because they have such a nontraditional thought process? Most might gravitate towards the former, but Kent might suggest the latter may true as Sam warns his mother many times of the monster Amelia is turning into. I appreciated Kent's suggestion to slow down and take a break from our anxious lives periodically. After all, the best way to get someone to listen is to scare them into doing it."

","Jennifer Kent's, The Babadook (2014), manages to instill a level of horror and psychological terror in its audience that can rival any of the horror film greats while still maintaining its own unique identity and individual style. The Babadook does not rely on cheap jump scares and an onslaught of gore to scare its audience like many modern horror films have done. Rather, it calls upon its monster to provide commentary on mental illness and the psychological impact it can have on not only its sufferers but the people around them as well. Kent's monster on its own would be freaky to have in your house but on screen wouldn't do much to terrorize the majority of audiences, especially avid horror film fans. What makes this movie so terrifying however is what Kent uses her monster to represent. The allegory of the Babadook as Amelia's depression highlights the horror of mental illness. The personification of the disorder allows for it to be looked at in a new, terrifying light. Just like Amelia couldn't prevent the Babadook from entering her home and threatening both her and her son's sanity and safety, she can't prevent her depression from doing the same. From the first hint that the monster might be real, to her chilling confession of ""I'm sick, Sam. I need help"" it is clear that she is not in control of her own thoughts and actions. The monster has gained the upper hand and her depression has taken over her life. Seeing how much the presence of this monster can effect a person and how dangerous they can become because of it is what provides the psychological terror to this movie. A terror that is accentuated further with the chilling discovery at the end that even once to monster appears to have been defeated, it is still there, waiting under the surface, attempting to attack again, demonstrating that mental illness can never truly be defeated."
"tylerhkummer","8","4","6","27 March 2017"," It's absolutely worth a watch
","There are three huge things that made me really enjoy watching this movie, the design, the symbolism and the intelligence of the characters. Most horror movies I do not really like because what we are meant to be afraid of can be entirely lost when the monster shown does not live up to the hype the movie created around it. The only visual of the monster in this movie is through drawings and distorted visuals, we are never shown entirely what the monster is we just know it might take several shapes. I feel not knowing what I am afraid of can add a whole new level of scare, because I'm not sure what it is that is supposed to be scaring me. Another problem some horror movies have is that I stop thinking about it when the movie ends. There really isn't anything more for me to think about in the movie, it's just over now. This problem is fixed here with an interesting level of symbolism, and a lot of the symbolism can be interpreted to be several things. Not entirely knowing what I just watched and having the viewer think of their own meaning and conclusion can add a lot of replay value to this movie. You may think of an entirely different way to think about the movie after watching it for the x amount of times. The third thing I liked was that the main cast were pretty intelligent people, which is basically a long living trope in horror movies that the cast are really dumb and begging to die. I was never annoyed with how situations handled were played out, anything dumb the characters did outside of engaging with the monster is a flaw in their character. Meaning that not everyone is perfect and I feel something when watching each of the characters go through their day. I felt just sad watching the way the characters engage with each other because it is clear that something in their lives is missing, and something in your life is missing if you don't watch this movie."

","The Babadook perfectly explores the true horror of grief and all of its ugliness. From the very beginning, the audience is placed in the routine of a mother plagued by the loss of her husband and the needs of a troubled child. The film clashes the issues of Amelia's need to feel loved and how grief does not only effect one person. Samuel feels like an outcast from not having a father, and tries to compensate for the attention by acting out and demand for attention that it pushes the viewer and Amelia off the edge. This interaction of misplaced emotion is the hidden grief personified as the Babadook. Sam is tormented by the Babadook and tries to fight it as Amelia tries to pretend that it does not exist, as most adults do to put on a happy face. The Babadook constantly references underneath because that is where it is festering, to grow and grow until you snap. The snapping point is when you let the anger in, and you become the monster that has cultivated in your head. The mother is literally invaded by the Babadook as she cannot ignore it any longer. Amelia is only able to expel the monster because of Samuel's offering of support and care to let Amelia finally address her own inner demons. But it does not get rid of the Babadook. That is because grief will never go away. You will always know the pain and have these demons in the back of your head, and it is up to you if you let them control you. Amelia takes control and sends the Babadook back underneath where it belongs, but with a cost. Demons require to be feed to stay subdued and calm."
"kldberry","8","4","6","27 March 2017"," Spooked by the Babadook
","SPOILER ALERTS!<br/><br/>The psychological horror that is The Babadook captivates the audience with the all too terrifying reality of single-parenthood after losing your spouse. Before the tragic event of losing her husband on the way to the hospital to give birth to their son, Amelia wrote children's books. This is a silent nod of her being the author of The Babadook. Whether she wrote this before or after cannot be confirmed, but it is probable she, in a fit of depression, grief, or rage, wrote the second version that had her killing the dog, her son, and herself. The Babadook is an allegory of her mental illness. Jenifer Kent did a wonderful job representing the horrors of fighting the monsters in our heads, instead of the typical monster movies of fighting the ones under our beds. Mental illness is not always present or a constant problem. It lurks, like the Babadook, in the shadows of your mind (the house), and each person with a mental illness has their own distinct form of one (the different monsters' children ""see"" under the bed). I think the ending, of her feeding the Babadook with worms, is a metaphor of her acknowledging her depression. You normally hear people say, ""I don't want to open that can of worms,"" when referring to something they don't want to discuss. In this case, Amelia has finally recognized she has a mental illness and is trying to get a hold of it. Dealing with mental illness is a constant battle, which is why one can never truly get rid of the Babadook."

","There are movies that are loud and upfront with their horror, such as John Carpenter's Halloween. But then there are movies such as Jennifer Kent's The Babadook, that are very subtle about their terror playing off of ideas and concepts that leave a lasting impact hours after the film has ended. This is not meant to bash the wonderful slasher that is Halloween, but instead praises The Babadook for its supreme use of tension and atmosphere to terrify the audience.<br/><br/>In this film, Essie Davis plays Amelia, a single mom caring for her young son named Samuel (Noah Wiseman) who is terrified of monsters, while at the same time dealing with her husband's death. One night Samuel picks the book Mister Babadook for Amelia to read, it talks about how the ""Babadook"" comes and scares kids. Both Amelia and Samuel appear to be terrified from the book, this initiates the beginning of their horrifying journey. <br/><br/>Jennifer Kent has orchestrated a haunting film that leaves a lasting impressing. From the use of high and low-key lighting to amplify the tension to the brilliant quietness which haunts the film, each and every detail in the film help builds an overwhelming sense of suspense. As a critique, most horror films nowadays tend to overplay their shock factor or ""jump scares"" in their film. While this might be horrifying, it does not leave a lasting impression. The Babadook achieves a perfect balance between horror and terror, leading to an utterly terrifying masterpiece. I give Jennifer Kent's The Babadook a 10/10"
"baconhawkzdamax","9","4","6","27 March 2017"," A Bad Book Indeed
","It has been a while since a movie has managed to legitimately scare me on some level but the Babadook managed to do just that. Along with its more terrifying aspects of supernatural qualities, it greatly expresses what many people go through when dealing with depression or grief. The allegory of the Mister Babadook book to how bad thought grow and change once they begin to manifest was extremely important as to how this movie shows character development. At the beginning everything is fine with the mother and son but as memories of the mother's husband reemerge, the Babadook enters their lives. Throughout the movie, the mother and son are fighting the Babadook while it is attempting to ruin their lives. He first shows up in the form of a red and black pop-up book that is entirely colored and written with black ink. This black ink begins to be a motif through the movie as it progresses. When the mother rips apart the book, you can see the ink all over her hands. This is the first indication that the Babadook is leeching into her and she can't seem to quite get rid of it. Once the fears of the Babadook die back down, the ink on her hands seems to go away. The black ink comes up later once the mother is untied and ""defeats"" the Babadook for herself by throwing up the black ink and purging herself from the leeching qualities of the Babadook. Lastly it shows up as a black rose at the end which represents how traumatic events can morph into small ""inklings"" *dun-dun-tss* of something beautiful. Overall, this movie shows in a great way how depression evolves, takes over and then leaves."

","An experience that each one of us can relate to is loss. Jennifer Kent's, The Babadook, forces us to engage in the challenging aftermath after losing a husband and a father years after the accident. The exhausting toll this tragedy has on a widowed, single mother and the isolating development of a hyperactive child in a single parent home creates an immediate, empathetic relationship that has the audience feeling desperately sad and vulnerable. The dark and dull mise-en- scene brings to life the gloomy, melancholy demeanor of Sam and Amelia's home that leave the two characters plagued off from the people who love them most. The draping and dramatic shadows that cover every inch of the house encloses the monster lurking inside, patiently waiting for the right time to attack. I applaud Jennifer Kent for creating such a possessive, haunting, and original type of monster that feeds off our deepest fears. I also want to acknowledge Essie Davis' undeniably brilliant portrayal of Amelia's character development from beginning to end. This psychoanalytical horror divides the audience's perception of what we want to see and what we actually see. The Babadook is not a film filled with gore that will leave you petrified and gasping for air, but the compelling suspense and creepy atmosphere will leave you evaluating what scares you more: the monsters under your bed or the monsters in your head."

","I was triggered to review the movie especially when I noticed that the reviewers only gave it a 6.8 out of 10. I'm very saddened that horror movie fans will be discouraged to watch such a topnotch movie once they see such a low rating.<br/><br/>The Babadook might not be the typical horror movie one expects when knowing it falls under the ""horror"" genre; for example, you won't find it anywhere close to A Nightmare on Elm Street, or the Exorcist or Child's Play. This is mostly because of the director's decision to deprive the movie from any 'jump scares' which most modern horror movies try to abundantly offer the audience, and in return wasting other elements which will account for the movie's horror aspects.<br/><br/>The Babadook narrates an obnoxious story of a husband and wife, which turns tragic after an accident in which the wife gives birth to her troubled child. The visual effects may not be the most appealing and the 'scares' might not be so intriguing, but the story-line is finely put. The movie succeeds in creating a tension which will keep your nervous system anticipated throughout.

","This Australian chiller follows single mother Amelia and her troubled six year old son Samuel. She hasn't got over the loss of her husband, who was killed in a car crash as he drove her to hospital on the day of Samuel's birth, and he believes that there are monsters in the house and has even gone as far as making weapons to fight them off. His behaviour affects his relationships with other children and ultimately his mother removes him from his school. Each might she reads him a story, one day he hands her a book she hasn't seen before; ""Mister Babadook'. The story is distinctly creepy and Samuel is screaming before the end. Soon he is convinced that The Babadook is real and becomes more troubled; a doctor suggests he sees a psychiatrist and proscribes some pills to help him sleep. Amelia however can't sleep; she gets more and more exhausted and starts to see things things that may or may not be there. She tears up the book and throws it away only for it to be returned; glued back together and disturbingly there is more to the story and ending that gradually starts to come true for her.<br/><br/>This is a superior chiller; eschewing the jump-scares, gore and other excesses of most horror films it works by having an oppressive atmosphere and a protagonist whose exhaustion is almost contagious. Essie Davis does a great job as Amelia as the character gradually changes from a concerned mother at the end of her tether to an exhausted woman to a potential threat to her child. Noah Wiseman is also impressive as young Samuel; a distinctly creepy child. What special effects there are are distinctly old-school; shaking beds and objects moving about. While it is quite different I couldn't help being reminded of 'The Exorcist' times although here it is the mother who seems to be effected and the possible possession is far less obvious. Writer/director Jennifer Kent does a fine job gradually increasing the tension till things are distinctly creepy. There aren't many scenes that are scary in themselves but the creepiness was enough to give me goose bumps. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody looking for a good chiller."

","A single mother struggles to cope with raising her troubled child. Having never faced up to the death of her husband, and possibly suffering depression of her own, she begins to suspect a supernatural presence in her home The Babadook is a disturbing genre hybrid, part horror, part psychological thriller. It evokes the uncanny in self-aware tonal moments, when daylight scenes can seem as threatening as the black of night. Amelia (an inspired Essie Davis) wanders around in a fug, sleep-deprived and still grieving seven years after the death of her husband. Amelia's problem is to resolve how she feels about her son Samuel, the inadvertent cause of her husband's death, born on the day of the car accident that took her spouse. How can a mother possibly not love her child? The manual Samuel (a quite startling performance from young Noah Wiseman) provides the answer. Samuel is what less-informed times used to refer to as 'a handful.' Is the Babadook real or a figment of Ameila's increasingly disturbed mind? The film does a wonderful job of exploring this central theme. Budget limitations at times show themselves - shadow is amply deployed, and sound design is a little less complex than required - but they hardly detract from a very satisfying example of a genre typified by Hitchcock's Vertigo. Highly recommended."

Then strange and more violent acts start happening, as she starts having visions of her deceased husband.<br/><br/>Jennifer Kent, directs the film with a very claustrophobic feel, so that the main characters are always feeling trapped and unable to escape from their environment. The Babadook is filled with intelligent symbolism, and metaphors for the viewer think about during the film, and long after it's ended. The film deals with Issues about how fear attracts fear, and how not dealing with our problems, can bring the deepest parts of our subconscious to life. <br/><br/>The film is boosted by two strong performances from the lead actors. Davis portrays a grieving mother who is at the end of her rope, with her son, as she begins to lose sight of reality. Wiseman gives a star making performance in his first film.

","Don't let the movie's somewhat silly title discourage you from watching ""The Babadook"". If you like a proper horror movie that is driven by an interesting storyline and good acting then ""The Babadook"" should be on your list to watch. It doesn't, however, unlike many other horror movies, rely on shocks and to make you jump in your seat tactics. And that is what makes this horror movie stand out.<br/><br/>The story is about widowed Amelia and her son Samuel who are trying to cope with the tragic loss of husband and father. When introduced to a children's storybook titled Mister Babadook, Samuel starts acting strange and claiming that the babadook is around him. Slowly as unexplainable things start to occur, Amelia realize that they are indeed not alone.<br/><br/>While ""The Babadook"" is not the ultimate scarefest, then it is definitely a horror movie that you should take the time to watch, because director Jennifer Kent really managed to build up suspense slowly throughout the course of the movie. But a lot of credit goes to Essie Davis (playing Amelia) and Noah Wiseman (playing Samuel) because their acting performances were just amazing.<br/><br/>One thing that I was missing more of in the movie was more scenes where we could have seen more of the mysterious babadook creature. Sure, having limited exposure for it adds to the suspense and mystery, but it would have been so much more entertaining if we had gotten more footage with the babadook.<br/><br/>""The Babadook"" was a much needed addition to the horror genre.

","This movie is brilliant, the more I think about it the clearer it gets. It's not a horror movie, it's actually a psychological drama about grief, depression, rage, anger, resentment and all other difficult emotions.<br/><br/>The Babadook doesn't exist in reality, it exist in the mind of the main character. She has been trying to suppress it for 7 years since the accident that killed he husband. You can see that she feels resentment towards her son, you can see that thru the movie in her actions and words, just like the book said (If it's in a word. Or it's in a look. You can't get rid of ... The Babadook). She rejects her sons affection in few scenes. She's resentful and angry and she can't hide it, it wants to come out. Mother is devastated by her husbands death, she blames herself and her son because of the fact that he was born on the day of the accident and the accident happened while they were driving to hospital to give birth to him.<br/><br/>She keeps all her husbands belongings and memories of him in the basement which in my opinion represents her subconscious mind, she refuses to talk about it and gets upset every time someone mentions it. The world expects her to move one but she can't. So she's suppressing those difficult emotions, trying to be ""normal"" avoiding to face them but they can't be suppressed, the more she tries the monster becomes bigger and scarier. She actually created it, its not some paranormal entity, it's real. At one point she mentions the fact that she used to write children books before which can point us to the possibility that she's the one who made the book. No one ever actually sees the book except her and her son but it's not really clear if he can see what she's seeing or he's just getting scared by the story she's telling. Its seems that the book is a creation of her mind, of the part of her mind that she's not even aware of, the part that is about to get out. Her son is aware of this, he's aware of his mother's shadow and he's trying to protect them both. <br/><br/>The shadow or the Babadook is there all the time, lurking in the shadows, hunting her dreams, dictating her actions more and more until it completely overwhelms her. So eventually she faces the shadow head on, she acknowledge it's existence which made the shadow deflate instantly. After that shadow runs away and hide in the basement, into subconscious but this time mother knows about it and she doesn't try to suppress it, she goes there and face it every day, she take a bowl of worms there to feed it. She's aware of the fact that the shadow will never go away but now she learned how to live with it.<br/><br/>Its just brilliant, I don't know if the attention to details was intentional (I don't see why it wouldn't be) or not but the psychological aspect of this movie is just brilliant. Its a horror story with monsters and everything else that comes with the label but at the same time its real, it shows real humans and their emotions, problems of grief, depression, loss, difficulties of single parenting.<br/><br/>So kudos to the director. We need more woman horror directors that's for sure. And great acting by the protagonists there. just brilliant."

"johcanada","8","4","6","21 October 2015"," For all the right reasons
","If you want a good and true horror movie than I would be doing an injustice if I did not recommend this movie. There are a lot of different horror movies out there: blood and gore, with cheesy or lame set ups like any movie with Jason, Freddy, or Chucky; gritty classics and homages like evil dead or cabin in the woods; or the too joking to be scary or nothing but jump scares like John dies at the end or, well everything else Hollywood sends out and calls horror basically falls into the jump scare category. Even found footage movies seem to be nothing but jump scare after jump scare if they are trying to make it a horror movie. Now don't get me wrong, I like Jason and Freddy. I like cabin in the woods and John dies at the end. I like the old and even the new evil dead. For me though, there is just something special about this movie.<br/><br/>If you are expecting a lot of jump scares than go watch sinister. This movie has few if any that I can recall. This movie reminds me a lot of Oculus, which has some good moments and if you haven't seen I would also recommend. Babadook goes farther though. Babadook to me is if you took Oculus, stripped all the exposition and back story, changed the antagonist thing, removed the father, and then asked Stanley Kubrick to direct the movie as a horror. There really isn't any filler to give us a why. No kids lost in the woods eating cherries or secret realm of demons. The horror plot explanation is ""because plot"" and that's all we need. Look at silent hill 2 compared to silent hill when they started trying to explain things.<br/><br/>The Babadook is creepy. It is not jump scare scary. You might never jump once. The Babadook is the kind of horror that gets inside you and makes you feel uncomfortable. Whether it is the mother and her plight, the kid and, well the kid is messed, or anything else. It isn't the type of horror to give you a quick thrill. It is the type of horror to get inside you and make you feel uncomfortable, and then haunt you the babadook plot line without ratcheting back anything else. By the end of the movie you should the horror feeling of ""did I turn the tap water off"" or ""did I leave my account logged in and computer still on"" kind of discomfort should be present and just hope nobody visits later that night, and knocks, three, times."

","I don't think people get the whole concept of horror movies anymore. What makes a good horror movie after all? Cheap jump scares? The amount of times you yell from panic? The whole movie was based in construction of fear, and I really find that truly awesome. They picked a subject people usually find it silly and turned it into a nightmare. The lighting in the movie was really smart, so was the color correction they picked for the entire sequence.

After reading it, weird things go on and the kid starts believing that the monster is real. It was expertly shot and each scene sends fear down your spine. What really stands out is how great the editing was. It made us fear the night sequences in the movie and it was so terrifying that I had to pause the movie a few times in the last half hour. The story is also really powerful as it displays the characters emotions real well and it does a nice job setting up what they're going through. This movie has everything that many other modern horror films don't have. The horror genre might be dying out but this movie shows us that it's not completely gone. This movie is definitely up there with horror classics like ""The Shining"" and ""The Exorcist"". Let's just hope that this brand of horror won't be dying out.

The lack of jump scares and gore made this movie more of a thriller than anything else, but this was also a good thing as it did not need those jump scares or gore to make it scary. The lack of sexual content was also great, as I have noticed a lot of movies depend on sex appeal to draw in audiences. The Babadook also had great acting, especially in the son!

","Touted as the scariest movie of the year and loved by critics, audiences and filmmakers alike (which pretty much never happens) this little independent feature is admittedly the best horror to come out of Australia that I can remember. That said, it's only competition is that God-awful ""Wolf Creek"", so...<br/><br/>Synopsis: The anniversary of the death of her husband is always a hard time of year for Amelia (Essie Davis, who is actually pretty great in this). But compounded with the fact that her bratty child has not only gotten himself kicked out of grade school due to his unusual hobby of constructing homemade projectiles, but also recently made her read a book, which may have summoned a demon called the Babadook (a taker of children) into the house, which just so happens to coincide with her going a little crazy herself.<br/><br/>Though writer/director Jennifer Kent's first attempt at a feature is more miss than hit, all in all, ""The Babadook"" is filmed quite well. And though there are absolutely no scares (IN THIS HORROR FILM) the moments when Amelia is descending into madness definitely displays Kent's distinctive voice in the horror genre.<br/><br/>Final Thought: Yes, the 3rd Act is a mess of clunky visuals, wasted potential and a final few sequences that are pretty damn confusing, plain and simple. And ""The Babadook"" is a horror film that isn't scary at all, unless you count a child who constantly throws tantrums as terrifying; which for some is quite terrifying. The fact that the underlying theme at the heart of the conflict between the mother and her child and the Babadook, may come down to the fact that a mother can hate her own child, is not only fairly untapped territory and quite morbid, but also pretty interesting. But again, whatever interest I had mounted up to that point, was totally scared off by this shockingly disappointing ending; even by Video on Demand standards."

I have been disappointed so many times recently by the latest horror films, I had begin to think the genre had become saturated with high-budget, over-hyped movies that fail to deliver any real scares. It seems horror movies nowadays are made to try and cater for too much of a wide audience. Babadook says 'screw you' to the Transformers fans who need everything spelt out to them, and instead takes a whole new approach. I couldn't help but notice the lack of music in the scare scenes, the lack of the obligatory house trashing scenes and the dog that actually gets killed and not comes running back to its owner for a happy ending.

"theblackscythe","10","15","33","28 October 2014"," A twisted and cerebral horror masterpiece.
","(Halloween Horror Reviews #14)<br/><br/>Rarely are horror films this effective. The Babadook sets out to do a few things, and nails every single one of them. It curls toenails, dries mouths, opens eyes. It is legitimately one of the genres best entries in over a decade.<br/><br/>The first reason for this masterpieces effect is the phenomenal performance by Essie Davies. She dominates the screen throughout and presents fragility, doubt, menace and realism in everything she does. We relate with everything she does and thinks (we delve deeply into her psyche through use of dream sequences) and are driven to to shivering fright as the horrors unfold around her. In conjunction with this career making performance is Noah Wiseman, portraying a young boy haunted by his separation from others and his mother's guilt and fear. He is believably and highly likable in a part that so easily could have failed or become overbearing. Instead of this however, he brings a sense of dread and danger to the scenario by his vulnerability and sympathetic mannerisms. <br/><br/>The director has control over her atmosphere to a level that would impress Kubrick or Romero, it is a truly staggering achievement in modern horror. The beautifully washed-out set design, the prevalent shadows and the careful lighting. I particularly praise the shots of barren trees against the stark white sky, it was a poignant source of chills for me and was essential in forming the film's harsh and uninviting world. The film oozes with passion and care, and the atmosphere was clearly the focus of much of these passions.<br/><br/>The Babadook has a refined emotional range rarely seen in lesser horror fare. It brings catharsis, wonder and immense sympathy before the horror begins and creates a fully formed connection with both of the main characters before the true chills begin. The final 20 minute stretch can best be described as a glorious crescendo of various emotions, all with freakish implications and subtexts. You feel like you've entered a fresh layer of Hell, and are overwhelmed with unease and persistent cloying dread.<br/><br/>In conclusion The Babadook stole my heart, before promptly forcing it though the emotional wringer. It should stand as one of THE all time classics and will affect its audience in varied and totally unexpected ways. It is one of the most joyfully surprising film experiences that I have ever had. I hope that every member of this creative team goes on to have sparkling careers of their own.<br/><br/>I would also like to personally thank the Kickstarter contributors for this film's art budget. Thank you for allowing me to experience this cinematic powerhouse in it's full glory."

","Not many films that I went in with high expectation and came out with the same feeling as I was expecting. From its skillful directing to brilliant script along with creepy sound effects and gleefully insane performance, this film succeeds greatly and effectively on these elements.

However, this is a great FUN for those who enjoy more of a psychological type of horror film over those who prefer gores and cheap scares but overall, this is such a masterfully crafted and suspenseful horror film that you have to see it for yourself to believe in how perfect everything comes together as a whole movie.

"d_m_s","5","13","28","2 November 2015"," Average film, didn't live up to potential, silly ending.
","Summary: main characters are an annoying whiney-voiced, screamy child and his mother who is suffering from depression (and possibly mania, hallucinations etc) after the death of they boy's father in a car accident when he was driving her to the hospital to give birth to said whiney-voiced son. <br/><br/>For no seemingly apparent reason the mother starts to have a very serious breakdown. She is still depressed from the death of her husband but this was about 8 or 9 years ago so this has been a very slow breakdown! The annoying kid has been playing up at school and this exasperates matters. <br/><br/>So one night the boy asks his mum to read The Babadook to him. The Babadook is a children's book that has appeared on the kid's shelf out of nowhere, with no explanation and no question from the mother. The Book is quite a scary one for a child and hints at a demon coming into the house to frighten and/or possess and/or kill the occupants. It would appear that, in Ring-esque fashion, reading the book somehow starts the chain of events that allows The Babadook to enter the house. <br/><br/>So anyway, the kid starts seeing stuff and has a fit. Then the mum starts seeing stuff. Then the mum gets possessed, goes a bit mental, kills the dog. Then at the end the kid and mother somehow (though not really clear how) exorcise the demon. The demon then seems to be contained in their basement and they collect worms to feed it with (sounds daft? It is). <br/><br/>There is the slightest hint that the mother may have written the book and my interpretation of the film is that she did, and that she just had a breakdown and the demon is all in her mind. And they keep it in the basement and feed it worms. <br/><br/>Review: The concept was decent, the book was creepy and there were one or two scenes that were a bit spooky (though I never felt this film got anywhere near as good or as scary as it could have been). The pace was a bit slow, the 2 main characters were annoying and the sub-characters were unessential, badly written padding and even more annoying than the main characters. I thought the ending was a bit naff. While it did entertain us for Halloween night, I think this was a pretty average film and given the annoying characters and lack of scares, it doesn't have any repeat viewing value."

","I will start out by saying that i am not a huge fan of horror. I like horror movies that are scary but also mysterious/thrilling. This movie just didn't entertain me. The positives were that the kid was a pretty good actor. I thought the camera work was very effective, the coloring in this movie was different and it worked. The one part i found to be actually pretty horrifying was the mirror scene. It was certainly a creepy film but it wasn't good creepy. The problem i have with these types of films is that they rely on startling the viewer too much with quick twitch flashes. The only scary parts are the ones in which things jump out unexpectedly. I am just not into that, what i like is a story that is scary yet sorta realistic. Some of my favorites are Sixth Sense, The Shining, Shutter Island, Saw, 28 Days Later, etc. The plot in this film i could never relate to. If your main objective in watching a scary movie is to be scared then this movie might work for you. I'm just tired of these types of movies, they are all the same in my opinion.<br/><br/>5.5/10 Not as good as i had hoped. It sorta starts slowly and then there are a few worthwhile scenes towards the end of the movie but ultimately not very scary or interesting."

","... and the best to come from kickstarter, yet.<br/><br/>I was surprised by this movie. I heard that 'The Babadook' was worth a look, but I am weary when it comes to horror-movie recommendations these days. <br/><br/>'The Babadook' follows the story of a single mother overwhelmed by her life. She has an exhaustive job, a problematic child and not yet handled the death of her husband. One day her overly-imaginative son finds a rather unsettling children's book, featuring a bogeyman called 'The Babadook'. Soon after that strange events start to occur.<br/><br/>The movie blurs the lines between horror and psychological thriller/drama. For me it is open to interpretation if the Babadook is real, or if it is 'just' the mother loosing grip with reality and spiraling down into schizophrenia. In both cases the movie shines especially because of the fantastic performance of the lead, Essie Davis, which makes you fear for her character, even as her condition gets worse and worse. <br/><br/>The movie deviates refreshingly from horror formula: It completely forgoes worn out jump scare noises, builds tension through atmosphere and focuses on the characters and how the events impact on the rest of their lives (how it should be)."

","Amelia (Essie Davis) has struggled to raise her six year old son, Samuel, since her husband died whilst driving her to the hospital to give birth. After withdrawing Samuel from school due to his behavioral issues, Amelia finds a book in their house entitled ""Mister Babadook"". One night, she reads Sam the book, despite its dark, frightening nature. Since that night, Amelia and Samuel begin to experience strange happenings wherever they go, despite Amelia's insistence that the Babadook isn't real. However, after throwing the book away, it soon returns to her doorstep with a new warning; the more you deny the existence of the Babadook, the stronger its presence will be felt.<br/><br/>As stated in my recent review for the annoyingly average Annabelle, 2014 has been a mixed year for horror. But, when it gets it right, it really gets it right, as shown with Oculus. Which is why it's such a relief to be able to say that The Babadook exceeds every horror film released this year. In fact, it probably surpasses every horror film from the last decade. This is real horror. No over reliance on blood or gore, no abundance of cheap jump scares; The Babadook crafts genuine tension from beginning to end, surrounded by sympathetic characters with an emotionally heavy story to guide the film through to its sublimely terrifying final act. Old fashioned, stylistic and loaded with sheer, genuine terror, The Babadook is all you could really ask for when it comes to horror.<br/><br/>It helps that the lead role of Amelia is played by Essie Davis, an actress previously unbeknownst to me, but certainly one to watch for the future. Amelia's character goes through a horrific change throughout this film; from caring and compassionate, to desperate and demonic. Davis tackles every scene with commitment, and she fuels her character with just the right emotional level in order to make us care about her, and go on that emotional roller coaster with her. Very much a female fronted film, The Babadook is directed, written, produced and led by women; a refreshing alteration from the predominantly male driven film industry. Jennifer Kent, with her first time in the directing chair, goes about this film with precision and intention, and the result is a knockout.<br/><br/>My favourite element of The Babadook is unquestionably the way it looks visually. For the vast majority of the film, Kent employs a heavy detraction of colour; some of the external scenes may as well be shot in black and white. By withdrawing heavy colours from the film, we are immediately drawn into the dark atmosphere; The Babadook is dark both emotionally and aesthetically. Kent also uses unusual framing for many scenes, and this adds to both the tension and the visual complexity of the film. We open with a breathtaking shot; a medium close up of Amelia's face while she endures the car crash that preceded both the birth of her child and the death of her husband. This is a contrast used repeatedly throughout the film, especially the final act. The scene in which the Babadook appears in the form of Amelia's deceased husband asking for their son to join him is a moment that is both visually stunning and emotionally harrowing, but commands our attention to appreciate the weight of what is actually happening to Amelia. And it deserves it.<br/><br/>But thanks to Kent's innovative visual style and old fashioned approach, The Babadook is truly horrifying. Kent uses the first half of the film to build us into the mythology of the Babadook and to allow us to buy into the characters. By only having two main protagonists, this is much easier than the standard father-mother- two-children cast most typical horrors offer. But once we reach that mid point, the film explodes into a frenzy of jumps, frights and horrors, and each come so quickly after the last that you've barely had time to recover. The Babadook itself is fantastically designed, as creepy as it is memorable. The same can also be said for Jed Kurzel's score, which accompanies the film's tone to perfection and allows even the most frightening moments to be pushed even that little bit further. But most of the fear comes through the emotional bond between Amelia and Samuel; between mother and son. Their relationship is the real underlying narrative that guides the film from act to act, and it works seamlessly.<br/><br/>I really hope The Babadook is successful commercially. It would be awful for an underwhelming and generally disliked film like Annabelle to make a monumental profit if a masterclass in horror like this doesn't fare as well. The Babadook is truly original, something that has been lacking in horror for quite a few years now. This takes you back to the days of The Exorcist or the original Halloween, in which sound and emotion can be used as both a narrative tool and a means for fear. In years time, when people look back at the great films of the horror genre, I can only hope that The Babadook is recognised as one of the best. In the endless swarm of found footage, jump-scare ridden, unoriginal ""horrors"" that we're subjected to these days, The Babadook stands high and proud as one of the greatest ever produced in its genre.<br/><br/>To Summarise: Boldly directed, emotionally powerful, and loaded with enough pure horror to last a lifetime, The Babadook is a brilliantly refreshing take on a decaying genre."

","This is a whopper of a horror film. The performances by Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman as the mother and son were so authentic I was pulled way into the plot within the first 10-15 minutes. Watching Davis' gradual descent into madness (or was it?) was very reminiscent of Polanski's ""Repulsion,"" however I felt this film was much more effective. ""The Babadook"" goes into some taboo territories that I've never seen explored in a movie before, and at times it almost becomes unbearable to watch. There is an atmosphere of uneasiness throughout most of its running time. I really hope this gets a formal U.S. release, it's one of the most original as well as one of the creepiest films I've ever seen. Reading Jennifer Kent's filmography, it looks as though she hasn't done a lot of directing; hopefully after the success of this we'll see more of her work."

I will also consider a horror movie worthy of finding itself a spot on my shelf if it has a really clever premise, or some dynamite interpretations of a familiar horror trope.

""The Babadook"" is most certainly worthy of finding itself an immortal spot in my roster and if you want a truly frightening and very intelligent horror film, do no miss out on this one.<br/><br/>Before I get to the premise of the film, let me ask you this. Have you ever heard someone tell you they consider their pet to be a real member of their family? I'd say that applies to my cat, but sometimes he really makes me angry. He knocks things over, wakes me up when I want to keep sleeping, I have to clean out his litter box and don't even get me started when he scratches me. I love the beast, but there are days when he infuriates me. Imagine that you had a pet like that. Adorable at times, but mostly it's an animal that misbehaved. Now imagine that one day, you hear a knock on your door and through the peephole, you see a monster, the stuff from your nightmares. It tells you that it will never stop haunting you and that if the lights in your house go out, it's coming in through the shadows. You only have one chance of saving yourself... open the door and feed it your pet. Now, on a regular day, you might tell the monster to go jump off a bridge because you love Mr. Whiskers over here... but what if at that particular moment your feline happened to knock over a very valuable dish your grandmother gave you, and it shattered into a million pieces... wouldn't you be tempted to get two birds with one stone by giving that monster your bad cat? This movie contains that kind of complexity and those kinds of scary ideas.<br/><br/>This film is about two things. The first is about a mother (Essie Davis as Amelia) who's at the end of her rope. Work is not particularly stimulating, her heart is still broken over the loss of her husband and even worse, she lives with a monster in the form of her son, Sam (Noah Wiseman). He's always misbehaving, destroying things, embarrassing her, pushing away her friends and family with his tantrums and inappropriate little stories. It's enough to drive you crazy! What this movie is also about is a book called ""Mr. Babadook"". Once you read it, you've been marked. You think the creepy illustrations inside are frightening? It's nothing compared to seeing that nightmare fuel of a figure sneaking out of the shadows and getting ready to do who knows what to you.<br/><br/>Having lived with a misbehaving little boy, as well as several siblings I can assure you that children are sweet sometimes, but they can also be demons. This movie shows a child at his absolute worst. There were times where I didn't know where the movie was going because I wasn't sure if this was a true horror story with a monster summoned from who knows where and ready to do unimaginable terrors onto this poor family, or if it was documentation of what happens when a stressed mind finally snaps. The movie keeps you guessing throughout and it's a great way to keep the terror flowing continuously. Is it a combination of factors that makes Amelia see this demon, meaning that a normal solution could be found... or is it an actual monster, at which point there is very little, if any hope? What tends to frighten me are the simple things: a white face looking through your window in the middle of the night, a man with a saw running after you for no reason, the dark, things I love being turned against me. ""The Babadook"" is a great example of a simple premise expanded upon enough to make a full-length story without giving away too much. What if there actually is something hiding in the closet at night when all the lights are out? What if believing in monsters was the key to making it go away, but acknowledging it meant confirming an even more terrifying fact, that monsters ARE REAL? What if you realize one day that you actually do hate your son, and that you're a bad parent? Those are what I call primal fears. Anyone can be afraid of this, unlike something really specific, like sharks or spiders. I was totally engrossed in the story until it became overwhelming. I found myself gripping the arm rests of my chair very tightly multiple times and I screamed like a little girl at least once.<br/><br/>On top of being effective and being a multi-layered movie, I admire ""The Babadook"" for having some terrific performances. Child actors often spell trouble, but Noah Wiseman is absolutely perfect here. I also thought that the movie had some really interesting points of character development throughout. How I felt about these people at the beginning was very different from what I felt at the end. Finally, I am so frightened of this movie that I absolutely must get myself a copy of the actual book that causes all of the terror. Will I ever read it? Not unless I want to skip out on some sleep, but the idea of owning it fascinates me. I thought it was inventive, intelligent, clever and truly horrifying. It's the best new horror film I've seen in a while. (Theatrical version on the big screen, March 26, 2015)"
"brchthethird","10","11","23","16 December 2014"," More than just a great horror film - One of this year's best
","Once in a while, there's a film you see that manages to subvert all your expectations and turns out to be something completely different, something better and deeper. THE BABADOOK is one of those films. I'd actually been aware of it for several months before finally getting the chance to see it, occasionally visiting its IMDb page and seeing glowing reviews come in from everyone who I follow. Now having watched it twice, I think I understand what's going on, and without a doubt it is one of the best horror films I've ever seen. More than just having a creepy atmosphere and some jump scares, it explores deep emotional themes in a highly metaphorical and truly unsettling way.<br/><br/>Without giving too much away, the basic story is about a single mother, Amelia (Essie Davis), and her child (Noah Wiseman), Samuel. Samuel is a rather difficult child, and Amelia is doing her best to raise him. One night, after waking up from a nightmare, Samuel picks a book for his mother to read to him: The Babadook. After this, strange things start to happen and they begin to sense a sinister presence with them in the house.<br/><br/>Now, earlier I said that it explores emotional themes. One in particular is that of grief and the loss of a loved one. Again, doing my best not to get into spoiler territory, this is key to understanding what happens in the film. I thought Essie Davis did a remarkable job as a mother who is plagued by grief and her emotional range in this film was amazing. Noah Wiseman also does a great job, especially for a child actor, as her son. At first, he's very bratty and unlikeable, but he gradually changes over the course of the film and you begin to understand him more as a character and a person. The supporting characters aren't as developed, but they merely provide a basis for how to view the events that transpire and as a conduit for the audience.<br/><br/>As far as horror films go, you could come away wondering what the big deal was, but then you'd have missed the point entirely. There are some typical horror movie scares and tropes, but all of that is window-dressing for the psychological horror that lies at the core. There is a creature, but it's only used and shown as much as needed. Also, in contrast to most horror movies these days, every effect was achieved practically or in-camera, quite the necessity for a low-budget film like this. I can't really think of anything bad to say. The only thing I'll caution is to go into this with an open mind, and to expect something a little more subtle than you might be used to. Other than that, I can't recommend this highly enough. Not just one of the best horror movies this year, but one of the best, period."
"keithmoon66","9","11","23","4 November 2014"," A very good chiller
","I wondered why this was rated so poorly compared to the critic reviews. It seems as though people only want big loud scares in a horror movie these days. <br/><br/>The Shining and The Exorcist were clearly influences on this film and they were terrifying but also great films for character.<br/><br/>The Babadook adds elements of We need to talk about Kevin and it makes a proper film that I'd like to watch again. Yes the child is annoying but that adds to the discomfort you feel for the mother, who puts in a brilliant performance. The setting is bleak and you feel as if the two main characters are alone. It seems as though this is very purposeful as they aren't able to get help from either the two characters close to the family or the police.<br/><br/>It is a wonder why the mother would continue to live in that house 7 years after her husband dies and why Australian TV is so art-house and vintage but these are minor issues. <br/><br/>I would not like to watch this film again alone in the middle of the night."

","Watched this film with my two kids Friday night. Well to say the film had a lasting effect on the kids is an under statement. They couldn't take their little eyes off the film yet were scared out of their skin. I'm not sure either of them have slept since and today is Monday. All they've done since is ask is the babadook real. I tell them he not real but kids seem to believe everything you tell them bar the truth. I loved the film too. Its quite an original film and abit trippy too as someone else said. No gore or bad language but very effective in getting a few scares and making the babadook believable. I had a look under my own bed later that night :-) The acting in the film was Oscar standard. The mother looked like she hadn't slept in 6 months(my kids soon) and the son(noah) was absolutely brilliant. I really enjoyed the film and I know my kids will remember it for a long long time to come..... Huge congratulations to all involved with the film."

","""You can't get rid of the Babadook."" Samuel (Noah Wiseman) <br/><br/>The monsters they do live inside us, except, of course, when they also inhabit our humble homes, which is the stuff of horror films for over a hundred years. In that well-prescribed genre rests Jennifer Kent's disturbing The Babadook, one of the best psycho-horror films in recent years.<br/><br/>Almost jumping off a children's terrorizing pop-up book, Mister Babadook, the titular monster and typical kids' bogeyman, is first of all an obvious metaphor for the demon that dogs a mom, Amelia ( the fine Essie Davis), after losing her husband in a car accident as she is going to give birth to her 6 year-old son, Samuel. As they try to deal with the loss and its resentments, mom and son can't shake the terror of losing dad and husband, nor can the guilt-ridden Samuel let go of the feeling that Babadook is in their lives for the long haul: ""You can bring me the boy,"" says Babadook, in a statement redolent of revenge and resentment.<br/><br/>Actually seeing the monster as it invades their house is rare, as it should be, given the suspenseful emphasis on the son's growing obsession with the ghoul's presence and Mom's increasing mania. In other words, this film works as a psychological study almost better than a horror story.<br/><br/>In some ways it reminds me of The Innocents, and in other ways it is notably a successful rendition of the modern female fighting elements that used to be reserved for the flawed male (think of The Shining as a shining example of the male-dominated horror flick).<br/><br/>First-time Australian director Kent's relaxed depiction of the possession until the effective climax and denouement goes a long way to let the audience consider the psychological ramifications of profound loss. Rarely does she gives us the standard clichÃ©s like false alarms and banging doors; rather she lets the horror emanate from the seemingly possessed Samuel and mom's emerging dementia.<br/><br/>""Don't let it in.""

","I've been very excited about this release and was not disappointed. It follows the story of a young mother and her son, both very isolated and suffering from her sons apparent social problems.<br/><br/>The meticulously executed cinematography and mise en scene from the beginning give you a chill from the first moment of the film - every single set, shot, piece of furniture and lighting angle add to the creepiness not just of the location, but of the mother and sons insipid world which is shrouded with the traumatic death of the father and husband of the family some years earlier.<br/><br/>We don't get a full glimpse of the force stalking the family, only subtle hints in shadows and atmospheric effects throughout the film.<br/><br/>A mix of psychological horror, thriller and possession story that will be a delight for any horror movie fan."
"Gray_Balloon_Bob","10","14","31","27 October 2014"," Carves a pit into your stomach that won't feel whole for long after the film has ended. Utterly masterful.
","I don't want to give the film a number, because numbers are too limiting and don't really encapsulate the essence of a film. A 10 suggests a film to be completely perfect, and although I believe The Babadook is, it still seems almost hyperbolic. A number is just a digestible verdict of a compendium of thoughts, so rather than this continued waffling I'll actually try to articulate my opinion of the film. <br/><br/>I'm no connoisseur of Horror cinema, and really couldn't confidently point out all the influences and tropes that make up each film, but as a general self-confessed film buff I'd like to, with some measure of certainty, declare this a masterpiece. Again, hyperbolic. But I don't bestow that phrase lightly. It is one of the most overwhelming, emotionally exhausting films I've had the pleasure of seeing. It is a complete drainage of the psyche; not an unwelcome one like Lucy (2014) that in its stupidity and banality seems like an intellectual thief trying to rob you of your enjoyment, but a welcome fatigue, one that in tiring you invites you to enjoy every frame available to the eye. (Which is limited in this event, as your shirt will be desperately pulled up to your forehead, as you try to wish away the terror of this spectacle)<br/><br/>The atmosphere is so perfectly realised from the get-go. The subdued and repressed blues and greys of the house in which the film largely takes place, and the drab and tediously homely colours of our protagonist Amelia's clothes set the tone immediately, and also forewarn us as to what we've gotten ourselves in to. The set-design is immaculate; the house empty and sparsely decorated enough to put us at unease and yet accurately reflect the psychology and financial struggle of the mother Amelia. On this note, I should say the film is true to life. The premise, which sees a soon-to-be mother (Essie Davies) lose her Husband in childbirth and mid-journey to hospital, and never recover from this loss, is not glossed over, the material implications of this never ignored. In American cinema, particularly horror and comedy, we always see the world through this filter of artifice. The people are so perfect and privileged, and their world is so infuriatingly unperturbed before whatever horror or mishap it is that sets the plot rolling. <br/><br/>Our mother, and her son, Samuel (Noah Wiseman) do not have a happy life when we first see them, and their modest-at-best-household conveys this perfectly. Amelia diligently works to support herself and her son, yet Samuel is a troubled and exasperated young boy, plagued by the child's irrationality, and a young boy's longing for a father he never had, and so she is constantly fighting for some peace of mind. She herself is still reeling from her husband's death. The opening sequence sets this premise, yet in the world of the intangible nightmare; the sound is muted and drowned, and Amelia crashes back to bed. (The sound design reminded me briefly of the Exorcist, with its surreal use of silence) She is a vulnerable woman, instantly sympathetic in her plight, and is a true triumph of character that American counter-parts don't give us. She has a mental precariousness and financial instability that is wholly relatable.<br/><br/>As she increasingly grows exhausted and frail, we feel as if we are too. Her and the son, whom the film allows to share such a sincere and tender, yet unstable relationship, steal our sympathy, and we are emotionally involved without realising it. The dynamic of mother-son relationship is so unfiltered in its unflinching domesticity, that as we progress and the horrors unfold we are almost screaming of them to be allowed some relief. Some shred of respite. Essie Davies is most comparable to Mia Farrow in Rosemary's Baby, and her performance is inarguably equal. Without theatrics or over-the-top hysterics, she marvellously plays the psychologically unravelling mother. Noah Wiseman offers one of the best child performances I've seen. <br/><br/>I watched The Conjuring last night, and it is plagued by all the flaws I described. The people in it are ultimately just hollow tools, puppets to orchestrate some mild scares for the audience, but the Babadook is so far removed from that, that it's undoubtedly triumphant. They are real people. And we care for them, completely. Jennifer Kent's direction and script-work, and the two leading performances, the only significant (in size) performances, are utterly magnificent. The other character, The Babadook itself, is a masterpiece in tease, in taunting the imagination but never revealing itself to the eye. It largely inhabits a book in which the characters read, and these illustrations are malevolent, so sinister in their creation that they are enough to haunt our dreams for weeks. When the creature does manifest itself in some vague physical form, obscured in shadow, it is almost more than enough. <br/><br/>The Babadook doesn't do jump-scares. Nothing throw-away or cheap. What it does do is slowly encroaching terror, like a shadow gradually invading your periphery. As the characters fall into terror, so do we. The gnawing anxiety in my stomach was such that I considered leaving the screening to calm myself. <br/><br/>The cinematography, the presentation of the film is subtle, and always lets the anxiety unfurl. An early example, a transition, in which sinister shadows travel across a duvet in a time-lapse like fashion is ambiguous in its nature, and offers us no comfort. Are they the shadows of some malevolent presence, or can we seek a rational explanation, such as the shadows of the sun progressing with the day? The film maintains this careful ambiguity, to the point that the film can work on two levels. But ultimately, it is one of these levels which best fits, and encapsulates the idea of the film: There is nothing more destructive than the human consciousness."

","""The Babadook"" is an effective thriller which climbs inside your head and drags all your worst fears and insecurities to the surface.

He is seeing a monster that entered their home through the pages of a children's book. Together, they must fight to remove the sinister creature from their lives while they spiral more and more into insanity.<br/><br/>Although I've heard complaints from some that they never really show the monster, I find that to be a part of the mystery surrounding ""The Babadook."" You only get fleeting glimpses of what the creature truly is. I see it as a combination of Dr. Caligari and a Spanish horror icon known as Coffin Joe. That's all I'll give away about its appearance.<br/><br/>""The Babadook"" is unrated but could hold an R. A sexually explicit scene with no nudity is found. It also includes violence involving a child. Many times the child is dishing out the violence. Frightening and intense sequences of the monster are guaranteed to frighten viewers. There's also profanity and the child is given a sedative to help him sleep. <br/><br/>""The Babadook"" truly is an exercise in psychological horror that must be seen.

","Once again we have a typical 21st century bad horror movie. It is a shame that horror movies have stopped being horror stricken and just went to horrible. Ever since Freddy started hacking and slashing through dreams, horror movies have become nothing more than blood-f-e-s-t. This movie is no different it is supposed to be highly suspenseful --that is why you never see the monster-- but the woman actress portrays her character as just another nagging, dominant, arrogant, female. She blunders her way through the entire movie demanding her point of view be the one that dominates her life and everyone around her. This is typical to females and is in no way scary to the divorced male. if the viewer were to take the monster out of the plot, it would not be hard to convert this movie over to an insane mother flick. It is with great hope that in the next 50 to 150 years Hollywood will stop trying to emulate Chinese style directing and story-line and plot; and will actually go back to the wonderful habits they used to stand for as when Hitchcock actually was doing some of the best suspense movies in film history."

"210west","4","20","48","5 December 2014"," 2014's two most annoying characters
","I really should stop taking Joseph Morgenstern (the Wall Street Journal's elderly movie critic) seriously. It's clear he tends to overpraise ""little"" films, low-budget films, especially when, as in this case, he's inexplicably smitten with the lead actress. He certainly steered me wrong on this one.<br/><br/>Essie Davis, the actress in question, has had a pretty impressive career during which she's played everything from a farm wife to a flapper detective, but here she turns in a really irritating, relentlessly one-note performance -- at least for the first half of the film. (In the second half, she turns in an only-slightly-less-irritating performance on a different single note; see below.) <br/><br/>As a widow saddled with a particularly uncute, neurotic,perpetually nagging seven-year-old son, Davis keeps her face frozen ina single expression, that of a Brave Little Martyr who's barely coping with the awfulness of her life; with her heavy-lidded eyes and (so it seems) lack of makeup, she always looks as if she's either about to cry or has just finished crying. In every scene -- I mean absolutely every friggin' scene -- she has loose, unkempt strands of hair hanging off the side of her face and a wisp or two over her eyes; you want to yell, ""For Chrissake, comb your hair! Pull your damned hair out of your eyes!"" Clearly that's the director's way of never letting you forget, even for a second, that Davis is supposed to be a Frazzled Woman at the End of Her Tether.<br/><br/>She and her son -- did I mention that he's really annoying? (even Joseph Morgenstern thought so) -- live in a creepy, shadow-filled old house that seems much too large for the two of them, with sinister long dark corridors, an imposing staircase, doors that open on their own, and electricity that's always mysteriously going off, plunging the place in darkness. At night, needless to say, the house makes all the usual creepy-old-haunted-house noises. It also contains the requisite Scary Basement. <br/><br/>I feel as if I've seen this creepy old house or its equivalent way too many times before -- in a million horror movies, in fact, dating from the early talkies right up to ""The Conjuring."" <br/><br/>What's more, at various dramatic points in the film, plaster walls split -- sound familiar? -- and at one point the mother peels back some wallpaper and large black beetles come crawling out. This last phenomenon, though, may be Only in Her Head. (Apparently there are people, judging from some of the comments I've seen on this site, who actually think it's a brilliantly original notion to maintain some ambiguity as to whether a horror tale's events have a supernatural or a psychological explanation. Sorry, folks, that's old hat.) <br/><br/>Another ancient rule that this film scrupulously follows is that, despite all the creepy things that go on in the house, the characters continue to live there.<br/><br/>And then there's the book, the nasty, somewhat Edward Gory-ish illustrated children's pop-up book that gives the movie its title and its maybe-real, maybe-imaginary, never-quite-glimpsed monster. The book itself (nicely designed, incidentally, by a heavy-duty far-left feminist of uncertain gender named Alexandra ""Alex"" Juhasz) is an exceedingly clever creation, right down to the old-fashioned-looking lettering (or font?) of the text. But the fact that this evil volume proves infallibly prophetic (the Babadook knocks three times, etc., just as the book warns), and the way it keeps reappearing, even after it's thrown away and later torn to pieces, is just ho-hum predictable.<br/><br/>So is the fact that the family dog ends up dead -- a plot point that's thuddingly obvious from the moment we first spy the animal, even before we see the dog killed in the book. It's practically a requirement of the genre.<br/><br/>(But speaking of this book, it's rather puzzling: I don't recall the mother ever looking at the title page to see who the author is, or even if any author is listed. Which is it supposed to be, a one-of-a-kind handmade item or an actual published children's book? You'd think a modern-day mother might do something as prosaic as looking it up on the Internet.) <br/><br/>An additional genre cliché: the way the people in the movie who'd normally be expected to provide help -- like the (caricatured) police, (caricatured) social workers, and to some extent a psychiatrist and the woman's own sister -- prove to be callous, stiff, dense, unsympathetic, and generally unhelpful.<br/><br/>But then, who in his right mind would want to hang around with that mother and son anyway? I began to find them tedious -- the yammering, neurotic, demanding kid and his long-suffering, put-upon mother -- within the first ten minutes. <br/><br/>So I was relieved when, in the second half of the movie, she finally cracked up and was transformed into a raving madwoman, Murderous Mom, stalking around the house with a carving knife in time-honored horror-movie fashion. At least, in this mode, she seemed less weak and insipid.<br/><br/>Still, this reverse one-note performance soon began to grate; the mother (the boy, too, come to think of it) simply spent too much time yelling and screaming. (One of the commenters on this site complained that all that hollering gave him a headache. I know what he meant.) Really, the sort of thing that deserves our applause is the rare horror movie that manages to generate fear softly and quietly.<br/><br/>P.S. I noticed that ""Babadook"" publicity quotes a highly laudatory tweet from ""Exorcist"" director William Friedkin. Frankly, I'm mystified that the creator of several bona fide classics could praise so joyless and derivative a film. Perhaps, like Morgenstern and other critics, Friedkin is inclined to be overly generous to low-budget indies. Maybe he's gone a bit senile. Or maybe he relished this film's occasional over-the-top ""Exorcist""-type moments, including a gravity-defying bed and something vaguely reminiscent of the earlier film's vomiting scene."

"sean73267326","10","12","26","23 November 2014"," Future classic.
","If ever there's a film that's destined to be thoroughly misunderstood, it's The Babadook. All the trailers have it pegged to be an outright horror movie, filled with jumpscares and gore. Thankfully nothing could be further from the truth. Though it is a horror, this debut feature from Jennifer Kent relies on undercurrents of sadness and looming violence, an eerie atmosphere, and in my opinion, the scariest movie villain since little Regan chilled our blood in The Exorcist.<br/><br/>Back to it being misunderstood, though. It's already being criticized for all the things that make it great, simply because the trailers have misled people. This is also a thoughtful film that borders on being a flat-out drama examining a borderline-abusive mother-son relationship in the wake of extreme grief; albeit with a seemingly haunted kids book in tow. Brilliant as it is, the typical weekend horror movie audience aren't going to appreciate that, and so it has already received tons of backlash. So I warn you now; if you want jumpscares, gore, people being dragged across rooms etc. go see Annabelle or rent out Hostel, because this film will probably not be to your taste.<br/><br/>To those of you who aren't after those kinds of films (those of you with attention spans), this is an amazing, haunting film. As one reviewer pointed it, it plays out a bit like an extremely dark Tim Burton film, with it's slightly Gothic style and grim colour palate. As a horror, it's actually very effective. As I mentioned above, the titular character is extremely sinister and creepy, and is sure to join the ranks of legendary horror villains. He's used sparingly though, and the film manages to create many scary moments without him too; the kids book causing all the trouble is chilling to the bone, and Essie Davis is bone-rattling as a dangerously unhinged character (for that matter... I smell Oscar buzz for her role here).<br/><br/>As a drama, it's emotional and raw without ever running into camp (which could have happened very, very easily with this material). I won't ruin any of it (and I urge you to avoid reviews that do), but it makes for fascinating viewing that calls to mind both Pan's Labyrinth and The Exorcist, with a dash of the less fantastical We Need to Talk About Kevin, which this film actually beats, in my book.<br/><br/>This is definitely one of the best films of 2014, and a film that's destined for classic status, misunderstood or not."
"oj1709","10","12","26","12 November 2014"," One of the best horror films I've ever seen.
","Original and terrifying. I signed up to IMDb to type a quick review on this brilliant film. I'm surprised at the number of negative reviews. This is probably because those who've given this movie a negative review simply don't understand the ending.<br/><br/>This film is probably not for everyone. Its definitely not your average horror film. If your looking for cheap scares look elsewhere. Its different and very original and the ending is what makes me give this 10 out of 10. <br/><br/>As a huge horror fan this film is probably up there with the greats! the acting and setting is outstanding. I loved the film score also. This isn't a film that contains cheap scares from beginning to end like the majority of horrors these days. Its a film that'll really get under your skin. 10 out of 10! its a must watch"
"Rendanlovell","7","12","26","4 November 2014"," Original and Intensely Unsettling
","The Babadook is an indie film out of Australia so it's understandable if you haven't heard of this one. Essie Davis plays Amelia. The mother of a very troubled child. Sam. We join the family 7 years after her husband died in a car accident. And it's very clear early on that the relationship between mother and son is not very strong at all. Watching as she curls up on the opposite side of the bed after her son has a nightmare is heartbreaking. <br/><br/>But all this is made possible thanks to a powerhouse performance from Essie Davis. The other actors around her have spotty performances but Davis delivers an Awe inspiring one. She displays the characters grief and pain beautifully. Without her even speaking it's apparent what she has gone through and is going through. <br/><br/>But the meat of the story is served up about 30 minutes in when Sam has his mother read a book about a monster called The Babadook. This is where the film gets intensely creepy and unsettling. It reminds me of the classic film Alien. Using atmosphere to it's advantage. I was terrified for nearly half the movie and You really only see the Babadook a spare few times. But listening helplessly as he whispers his name in a deep throaty voice is instantly nerve racking.<br/><br/>Not only is the Babadook incredibly disturbing but Essie Davis is as well. I won't give anything up but man, he scared the pants off me near the end of the film. Even with all this going on movie has the balls to make you question everything that is happening. It truly is a superb and ambitious Psychological Horror. The only downside is the ending feels a bit unsatisfying. But hey, you can't get rid of the Babadook.<br/><br/>Overall The Babadook is an emotionally heavy movie with some real depth to it. Not to mention a truly impressive and unnerving performance from Essie Davis. The Babadook could quite possibly be the best Horror movie of the year."

","Horror is my favourite category, if I'm flicking through Sky Movies, Netflix or going to the Cinema you can guarantee I will be watching a horror film, so much so that I have made my self a bit immune to horror films, I went to see Annabelle recently, fairly boring, can't even be bothered with Ouija but this film I found genuinely scary.<br/><br/>Lets start with the spoiler here, The Babadook is a metaphor for the mothers hatred towards her son because of the death of her husband, the ending refers to the fact she can control that hatred, she can 'lock it away' but she still has to nourish it and recognise that it is always going to be here, thus the book saying that you have to let it in, it will become you and the worms in the basement. Once you understand that you can realise how clever the film actually is.<br/><br/>The Babadook himself I found pretty scary, the brief glimpses, the movement across the ceiling and particularly the voice! BAABAAADOOOOOK! I also love the realistic reactions of the character, for instance rather than going to see what was knocking on her bedroom door, she throws her duvet over her head, I can safely say that is probably how I would react to that situation, who doesn't feel safer under a duvet? I have noticed a lot of reviews state that this film isn't jumpy, I would have to disagree, the mothers sudden outburst and the camera movements make for some very intense viewing, I thought I was going to break my husbands hand, and along with the child's very impressive acting it makes this film a winner in my eyes.<br/><br/>I see this film becoming a horror classic and I will be recommending all to see."

","This being what I would say is the most terrifying movie ever, The Babadook shows you that evil can lurk anywhere. The film is set in a Australian town and follows Amelia and her son Samuel. The film starts on a car accident that includes Amelia and her husband, it happened whilst on the way to the hospital to give birth to her son. Six years later, Samuel begins to have nightmares about a monster that he thinks will kill him in real life. Then, one night, Samuel wants his mother to read him a story, so he goes on his shelf and finds a book named 'Mister Babadook'. After this a mysterious presence starts to terrorise the family and sends the mother into a paranoid mess. This movie avoids the cliché jump scares and still makes the audience feel like they would rather be somewhere else. The terrifying film is director Jennifer Kent's first and will certainly not be her last"

I am a big horror film buff and this was just a joke, seemed like it was made in the 70's, you know, when they weren't scary!!! Even the babadook was a jokey looking character.

"begob","4","24","60","16 November 2014"," Not a horror
","This shouldn't have been pitched as a horror. It's a study in the developing psychosis of a poor single mother with an ungovernable child.<br/><br/>The pace is slow, colours mostly drained and grey, and the mood is depressing. The two main characters are sympathetic, especially the boy who is played really well. I actually had a twinge of concern for the actor at one point, wondering if it was appropriate to have an adult screaming at him. <br/><br/>The other characters were poorly drawn and didn't really fit in. Why have two social workers instead of one, why was the babadook in the parkinson's lady's house, why wasn't the sister involved in the end? None of them really matters to the story.<br/><br/>So after an hour you have a story perfectly consistent with a depressed woman under pressure who begins to have hallucinations and poses a threat to her child. Why not play that out?<br/><br/>Instead we get a flimsy supernatural intervention and a tacked on ending to what was a realistic story. By that point the child's behavioural problems have been externalised after a couple of nights on sedatives, and the mother has switched to full blown mental collapse after being infected by The Thing in the shadows. Bit of a mess, really - although I did enjoy the twist where the boy ties his mother up to save her.<br/><br/>Some of the sound was good. I liked the moaning wind. The shadows were good, and the time lapse on the mother's face under the sheet as night passed was impressive.<br/><br/>ps. Thanks to nybred4 for the anagram of the title.

That's not horror to me, anyway. There doesn't need to be a monster, either, just the shadows and promise of one will do. Suspense would be nice, though.

"igorgoncalves428","8","13","29","13 September 2014"," Iconic Character
","I watched the movie called Babadook and I must say I quite liked the movie because the type of horror distinguished himself from the others and left out the jumpscares advancing to the horror itself, had incredible performances from the two lead actors, Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman, a good story that led us to sympathize with the characters and to fear for them, and even a tone and a soundtrack that stand out. For me it's 8 on a scale of 1 to 10, only because there weren't so many horror scenes as I expected, perhaps due to low budget. However, it was a great movie that really worked thanks to Jennifer Kent's amazing storytelling, and let's hope they launch The Babadook Book because I really loved its iconic character."
"mistercsays1","7","13","29","19 May 2014"," The Babadook is Worth a Look
","Australian genre films are a rare breed. Particularly those that secure a wide international release on the back of critical buzz emanating from the likes of Sundance and other festivals. For those reasons alone, The Babadook has already achieved much more than many of the Australian made horror films that have preceded it. Of course, the ultimate test will be bums on seats and there is no reason to think that the film won't muster strong audience support. Shot in Adelaide and funded partly through Kickstarter contributions, The Babadook is the first feature for director Jennifer Kent, who also wrote the screenplay derived from her own short film. There are no big frights here and it could even be argued that the film is as much a psychological thriller as it is a horror, but the story draws you in and piques your curiosity in a way that has you constantly trying to guess what will happen next. There is much ambiguity in the story and the characters that inhabit it, but there is sufficient spookiness to satisfy those who like their films dark and twisted.<br/><br/>Essie Davis, perhaps best known for her television work in The Slap and Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries, plays Amelia, the fraught mother of six-year-old Samuel, a child who is driving her to the point of despair with his demanding behaviour. Amelia's husband Oskar (Benjamin Winspear) was killed driving her to the hospital on the night Samuel was born and it this tragic turn of events that has defined the mother-son relationship ever since. You see, despite her best efforts to outwardly hide such feelings and be the mother she is expected to be - publicly defending Sam's petulance at every turn - Amelia really doesn't her like her son all that much and it is this tension that serves as the catalyst for what follows. Juggling the demands of Samuel with her work in an aged care facility, Amelia's state of mind starts to deteriorate to the point where she finds it difficult to separate her reality from the hallucinations that haunt her. When a mysterious children's book titled Mister Babadook seemingly unleashes a sinister presence in the house, things become decidedly disturbing. Using the picture book as the source of the terror enables the use of simplistic, yet effective, design in the creation of an almost cartoonish presence that still manages to exude the requisite level of menace.<br/><br/>Whilst the film does rely on horror clichés to a certain extent - from the suitably sinister-looking house with the obligatory out-of-bounds basement, levitation, creaking floorboards, flickering lights, shapes in the shadows and people being flung around the room by forces unseen – it certainly shies away from the gore and bloodshed non which so many other movies rely to compensate for their shortcomings in other areas. Similarly, most of the minor roles consist of stereotyped characters – the disbelieving police, the angry school teacher, an overbearing boss, the nasty sister – all of which serve to isolate Amelia even more in her state of anguish. However, it is this sense of isolation, combined with the uncertainty over the nature of the threat, which causes so much of the tension. Is there really a supernatural presence or is Amelia simply in a state of psychosis? Ultimately, Kent leaves it up to the audience to decide. There are other characters introduced who it seems might play a significant role - such as elderly neighbour Mrs Roach (Barbara West) and co-worker Robbie (Daniel Henshall) – however their significance in the story amounts to very little.<br/><br/>Davis endures a lot as Amelia, a pale, exhausted figure who unravels in the most extreme way. In his first ever screen role, Noah Wiseman is equal parts cutesy and creepy as Samuel, alternating between volatile and affectionate on a whim, constructing all manner of weapons to ward off the monsters he believes are lurking under his bed. Kent draws upon classic imagery from the likes of Georges Melies to provide a visual representation of Amelia's state of mind as she spends night after night unable to sleep, staring blankly at the television. On many levels, The Babadook is a success and should appeal to horror aficionados as well as those more interested in psychological drama. This is a more than satisfactory addition to the horror oeuvre and is proof positive that Australia can do genre just as well as anybody else."

First off...... it's not a horror movie. It wasn't even scary. It was a lame Drama more than anything else. I understand this movie was made on a tight budget.

","(74%) While most cinema goers wasted their Halloween horror movie night with what I hear is total dross ""Ouija"", this on the other hand with fewer than half the screenings by all rights should have been the number 1 movie of choice during the spookiest period of the year. The sad thing is that those who missed out on this, missed out on one of the best new horror movies I've seen in quite a long time. First of all Essie Davis provides one of the finest performances of the year, in any genre, she's flawless in this; while young Noah Wiseman as a troubled boy never fails to convince. The direction is top notch, and the production values in general for a low budget horror movie are never any other than seamless alongside the likes of last year's more forgettable ""the conjuring"". There's a touch of ""A nightmare on Elm street"", a bit of ""Poltergeist"", some family drama/comedy, but overall this is its own movie, and all horror fans should seek it out."

","I was bored during long periods of this film. The dull setting, spare dialog and humdrum lives of the characters didn't help matters. A woman loses her husband in a car crash when he is driving her to the hospital to have her son. Somehow, five years later, this contributes to a visitation by a spiky-handed monster via a storybook. The only reason I can see that the movie is collecting so much praise is because it represents a more woman-centred world than do most horror genre films. It is a bit like The Shining but a lot of the scenes (cockroaches behind the fridge which disappear when someone else arrives) are straight out of cliché central. In fact, that's how I would sum it up: it's The Shining minus Jack Nicholas. There is an unusual ending which is some compensation but it doesn't quite make up for wasting 90 minutes of my life."

Essie Davis excels at creating tension and inciting sympathy, even if you don't know what to think of her character. Noah Wisemen is amazing. The first time I watched it, I thought his performance was over the top, but upon a second watching I realize he was pitch perfect. The film is atmospheric and creepy and truly, truly terrifying - if you interpret it the way I did. <br/><br/>I love that Jennifer Kent had her feature film debut this way, and that some of the budget was crowd-funded.

","This psychological horror movie is definitely worth watching. It isn't for everyone, but no movie is. In the beginning of the movie, you'll might think that the boy is nothing but an annoying and very weird little brat, that he's just looking for attention all this time. Then, the tables turn. You'll fully understand his situation. You'll understand that he's just trying to protect himself, and his mom, who's becoming possessed - I can't think of a better way to describe it - by the Babadook. Some people don't like this movie because it isn't filled with jump scares and because you'll never really get to see the Babadook - which I find terrifying, to me, it's scarier to not really know what you're up against. There is nothing but a constant tense. And it really creeped me out. To be honest, I don't really like jump scares, but I almost started wishing for them, knowing that they'd probably end this disturbing vibe.<br/><br/>Their first encounter with the Babadook starts of very peacefully, with the mysterious pop-up book they found on the bookshelf. It seems normal at first, but turns out to be very disturbing. Amelia hides the book, she doesn't want her son to see it again. But this doesn't seem to help. She tears the pages apart and throws the book out, to find it on her doorstep later on. <br/><br/>This is a very symbolic movie about a women being pursued by depression, grief and her past. She sinlently blamed Samuel for his fathers death, and physically expresses this near the end of the film. This is a real horror film. It's really scary because it tells about real emotions, real grief and depression, which are represented by the Babadook -for those who hadn't figured yet. Lots of people are getting confused by the worm-scene at the end of the film. I don't really get the reference either, but I guess it's safe to assume that the worms are some kind of sacrifice, which they have to make to please the monster in their basement. Since you never get rid of the Babadook. Since you never really get rid of grief."
"tieman64","Null","6","11","12 January 2015"," Mommy knows best
","""Suppressed grief suffocates. It rages within the breast, and multiplies its strength."" - Ovid <br/><br/>Clichés abound in ""The Babadook"", a critically acclaimed film by writer-director Jennifer Kent. The plot? After the death of her husband, Amelia (Essie Davis) begins to resent her son Sam (Noah Wiseman). The domestic strains of motherhood, combined with Amelia's repressed grief, have led to Amelia lashing out at her kid. She does not want him in her life, doesn't want the responsibilities he entails and, more importantly, hates the way he reminds her of her dead spouse. As the film progresses, Amelia will actively blame Sam for her husband's death.<br/><br/>As Amelia's unconscious and conscious worlds collide, Amelia descends into madness. At first she merely neglects her maternal duties (""If you're hungry, why don't you eat ***t?""), but eventually outright wishes that Sam were dead. Sam instinctively suspects that something threatening lurks in the family home, but cannot fathom that his mother is the source of this evil. Instead, he displaces his fears onto ""the Babadook"", a shadowy creature. Amelia insists that this creature does not exist. There are no monsters, she tells her son. I am not a monster.<br/><br/>The Babadook is initially introduced as a character from one of Sam's storybooks. ""When you realise what's underneath, you'll wish you were dead,"" the book states. It henceforth becomes clear that the the Babadook serves a protective function. It is Amelia's means of externalising pain and so not fully experiencing grief. For Amelia, facing (and eventually becoming) a ghoul is infinitely preferable to confronting the overwhelming tragedy of a husband who died on the cusp of fatherhood. Significantly, Amelia spends the film avoiding conversations about her dead spouse. She adopts a strategy of silence and avoidance. To confront is too traumatic.<br/><br/>""Supernatural monsters are expurgations of ourselves,"" George Romero once wrote. ""By distinguishing them from us, we hope to destroy them and so exorcise the monsters within."" No surprise then that, phonetically, ""baba dook"" means ""father grief"" in several languages (Hindia, Arabic etc). Amelia eventually realises this herself; she is the Babadook. She is the beast. And the beast's unconscious desires are always within her.<br/><br/>After an extended battle with her son, Amelia metaphorically vomits the ink from which the Babadook storybook was written, and then locks the ""creature"" in her home basement. Having taken control of her unconscious inclinations, she periodically visits and feeds the ""beast"". Whether she is dangerously nurturing her hate, or whether she is merely responsibly keeping it at bay and so ""healthily"" creating a place for grief to live, is left up to the audience.<br/><br/>Obvious, heavy-handed and predictable, everything ""The Babadook"" does – aesthetically and thematically - is lifted from somewhere else. The film's mother and child relationship recalls ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""The Exorcist"". Its descent into over-the-top supernatural violence recalls ""Carrie"" - another film about the return of the maternally repressed - as well as the wackily repressed characters of other Brian De Palma horror films (""Raising Cain"", ""Dressed to Kill""). Elsewhere the film's scratchy, low-tech monsters recall the sputtering monsters of the ""Ring"" franchise, the beasts of Tourner's ""Night of the Demon"", Lynch's ""Eraserhead"" - itself a film about parental fears - and the ghostly shadow monsters of ""Intruders"" (2014) and ""Vanishing on 7th Street"". Throw in the ""repression/denial"" themes of Kubrick's ""The Shining"" and Haneke's ""Hidden"", the ""parental anxieties"" of horror films like ""Take Shelter"" and ""Don't Look Now"", as well as references to ""Ghostbusters"", ""Night of the Hunter"", ""Nosferatu"" and Polanski's ""Repulsion"", another film about the female unconscious, and you have a film which plays like a flatly shot homage to better movies. Rather than art, ""The Babadook"" feels like an amalgamation of trends.<br/><br/>The political movements of the late 1950s and 1960s gave rise to horror films in which paternal or patriarchal figureheads were questioned, undermined and unmasked. One of the best of these films was Nicholas Ray's ""Bigger Than Life"", in which a father - pushed by the pressures of a class and status obsessed society - descends into madness and attempts to kill his son. George Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"" likewise begins with Daddy and State revealed to be dangerous goof-balls. During this period, virtually all major horror films sought to dethrone Daddy, to question Symbolic Power, from the sexist creeps in ""Rosemarry's Baby"" and ""The Stepford Wives"", to the anti-authoritarian ""The Crazies"". This trend ended, roughly, with Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"", a film in which ""caretakers"", be they literal fathers, or the appointed figureheads of tribes, nations and power-brokers, engage in cycles of violence against those they claim to protect. For Kubrick, spaces are haunted not by monsters, but by the weight of history itself, and Daddy's a genocidal, infanticidal maniac due to a seemingly inescapable feedback loop: Man represses because he repeats and repeats because he represses. During this period, Steven Spielberg was one of the few mainstream auteurs to churn out horror movies which went against these counter-cultural trends. His Daddies were rehabilitated, and portrayed as guardians worth re-embracing.<br/><br/>Crazy women were in vogue in late 1980s, early 1990s cinema (hysterectomy and hysteria are derived from the same word, the latter implying that maternity and madness are one and the same). But infanticide by women, or the hating of kids by their mothers, was a bit too politically incorrect for the time period. Nevertheless, Jean Luc-Godard made ""Hail Mary"" in 1985, an esoteric masterpiece about maternity being a kind of imposition, or rape, foisted upon women by an uncaring Nature. We then had films like ""AntiChrist"" and ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"", part of the wave of modern horror films to which ""The Babadook"" belongs. In each film, mothers seek the eradication of their inconvenient sons. Only in ""The Babadook"" does mommy reconcile with her maternal responsibilities.<br/><br/>6/10 – Worth one viewing."
"ajones-30268","9","8","16","30 March 2015"," You Can't Get Rid Of The Babadook
","A few spoilers!<br/><br/>The Babadook is considered a brilliantly, smart movie, and rightfully so. Unlike many horror films, The Babadook does not rely on jump factors, a serial killer, or even a paranormal entity. It is an amazing portrayal of the monster that evolves from suppressing our depression, anger, and sadness. The Mister Babadook book appears on Samuel's bookshelf around the time of his birthday, which is also the premature death of his father. This is where we see Amelia's frustration and hatred for Samuel, which is exactly what the Babadook wanted to happen. Mister Babadook said, ""it's in a word or in a look, you can't get rid of the Babadook"" which can be applied to a few different scenarios Amelia is battling. When someone brings up Oskar or she sees pictures or his belongings, her disdain for Samuel is revealed. It also correlates to anything Sam does or says, because throughout the movie she gets increasingly angrier with him. The Babadook is a representation of the suppression of anger, depression, and hides in the shadows; just as people hide their negative feelings and depression. The Babadook figure in the book is portrayed as a shadow that lingers over Amelia, which symbolizes her lurking grief and depression. Throughout the film, with the use of high key lighting, we see and feel Amelia's exhaustion. High key lighting allows the audience to see her bags and lines on her face, which is amazingly done because I could physically feel with how she felt. Jennifer Kent does an excellent job of utilizing chiaroscuro with Amelia wearing light colors, but always being in the dark. The Babadook also is only seen in the shadows and even then, it is indistinguishable, which allows the view's imagination to take over. Low-key lighting was used brilliantly to have Amelia appear crazed and demented, and it provokes spine-tingling chills. Even when Amelia fights to get rid of the Babadook and Samuel tries to expel it with some tender-loving care, it goes in to submission, but does not leave their house. This just goes to show that you can never get rid of the Babadook."
"kraftwerk32","10","8","16","1 February 2015"," Take one look and you can never get rid of the Babadook
","The reviews here are clearly divided into those who loved and those who hated it, mainly because this is not classic horror. The Babadook is actually more a psychological drama that uses it's monster as a metaphor for how we deal with our fears, our grief, our pain. For Amelia, a widowed mother with a young, difficult child, her suppressed trauma begins to manifest itself as a horrendous creature, first in her dreams, later in real life. As her mental state spirals downwards, her life and that of her son come in mortal danger. What makes the film so scary and touching is that we all can (at least partially) relate to those dark feelings that conjured up the apparition. A tour de force for Essie Davis who gives us a stellar performance as the troubled Amelia. The whole film is highly stylized, in some parts maybe a touch too much, when in becomes almost Tim-Burton-esque, but the atmosphere it creates does work perfectly."

Rating 9/10,The plot was good the acting by cast was amazing especially by (Jennifer Kent)The mother .The hole movie is dark with black colors around in every single clip and lots of greats elements of horror without the use of jumpscares, that's why The babadook is one of my best horror films.To explaine what i mean, few jump scares maybe 1 or 2 in the film babadook is a horror movie from the atmosphere that is costing to the viewer and the ""monster ""that is trying to build off...With not spoiling much Babadook is interesting from the start till it ends and the story is getting deeper and deeper. The negative point I didn't like is few of the voices the ""monster""Was doing,it was little weird an unfiting with the tone of the film...<br/><br/>To sum up the film was creepy at it best and a very enjoyable horror that most of the horrors should be today. Final review 9/10 for the reasons I have mention.A must see horror movie"
"CountJonnie","8","8","16","22 November 2014"," A bit of everything (horror, thriller, drama) and it's all good!!
","I try to watch every horror movie possible, desperately seeking for a scare, often appalled by how bad or cheesy they are. To give you a taste: I liked Jeepers Creepers, Descent, VHS, Insidious and Cabin in the Woods.<br/><br/>After so many clones of 6th Sense, remakes and sequels, I didn't know what to expect. But unlike many other movies, the atmosphere in Babadook grabs you within the first minutes and won't let you go. Within those same minutes, you'll grow to either love or hate the main characters (mother and child), only to realize that it is because of their flawless acting.<br/><br/>The characters are worked out perfectly, in a genuine creepy and almost claustrophobic setting. The horror is lurking from the shadow but doesn't ruin the movie with predictable scares. Obviously the scare work is not done by clichés or effects, but by atmosphere, acting and not knowing what to expect. The movies also uses symbols and metaphors which I can't explain without giving stuff away, but they don't overuse it in the way they did with ""Only God Forgives"".<br/><br/>This is a movie you need to watch one times for the delightful scares, and than one more time to make you think. Now that makes this movie special."
"snipermurph01","8","8","16","16 November 2014"," Truly terrifying for all the right reasons.
","This film is in every way a true ""horror"". It scares you in places you never knew you had. Whats most horrific is the sinister tone throughout the entire film, not just the monster itself. The appearance of the monster is revealed right away, which is strange for most horror movies. But here it is done well, meaning that when the beast is finally revealed, you might just soil yourself. You are scared by the sick images and the possessive thoughts of the stressed and somewhat insane widowed mother, instead of the usual pop-up jump-scare. Also, you cannot help but notice the outstanding acting (especially of child actor Noah Wiseman who plays the role of a young kid with behavioral problems). Not to mention the incredible and unique sound design. A must watch for horror fanatics. <br/><br/>Overall, it's a great Aussie horror movie with superb acting and sound design, and an odd twist."

","I'm a newcomer to horror movies. I don't know all there is to know nor can I compare this film to many other like it, but when I did succumb to my inner longing to see this movie I was not at all disappointed. I may or may not be like many of you horror fans, when your in your room or at the cinema and you are watching a truly good horror movie, it's like nothing else. It's exhilarating, your heart beating like a drum, your adrenalin pumping and a light sweat beginning to appear on your brow. If you love all of those things than you must give this film a go. I bought the DVD and upon pressing play I spent nearly the remaining 90 minutes whimpering in the corner of my couch, blanket tucked tightly around myself and every now and then when things were quiet I would quickly turn behind me just to check that 'The Babadook' was not haunting my late night horror sessions. Not only is this movie scary it told a meaningful story, the themes that were explored are easily relatable and it forms these characters into living breathing human beings, they are brought to life so vividly. When you watch a film and your so invested in what is happening that you forget it's a movie, is truly a special thing. You forget about everything and you think solely about the story, about the characters and about how much you are not sleeping tonight. This you know your watching a well made film. This movie legitimately unsettled me, Jennifer Kent's superb way of crafting an atmosphere that oozed tension, this film's way of expanding upon themes such as loneliness and grief is masterful and bring with it an emotional punch. Along with an astounding performance by both Essie Davis (Amelia) and Noah Wiseman (Samuel) this shapes up as a fantastic horror movie that I recommend anyone to see, I don't care if you love horror movies or you hate them because a lot of this movie isn't about the horror there is a lot more to it and for this reason I have given 'The Babadook' a 9 out of 10."
"jeremyharrison007","9","11","24","5 November 2014"," A very, very pleasant surprise.
","This film, as my title mentions, was a complete surprise for me. I saw the trailer a while back, and thought it looked okay; it seemed like it would either be not bad or not good at all.<br/><br/>When I started watching it, I fully expected it to be another lukewarm horror film with flat characters I don't care about. Boy, was I wrong The movie has some of the best, most believable characters I've seen in a horror film in a long time. Before the horror even started, I found I was intrigued, saddened by and even a little disturbed by the situation of the main character and her son. It's a very sad and almost pathetic setup of a mother buried in grief who secretly deeply resents her troubled son. Having such believable characters really helps in a horror movie, as when the horror actually happens later on, you genuinely feel for the characters. This is something many horror films get wrong, but The Babadook got very,, very right.<br/><br/>The direction of the film is stylish and inventive, and I hope the director gets to make another horror film, or any film really, sooner rather than later. I don't like making claims like this, as I'm probably a bit ignorant on what qualifies for such a claim, but the main actress gave an Oscar worthy performance in my opinion, and the child actor was also very impressive. The horror is kept, for the most part, to the imagination. Another thing I really appreciated was how open to interpretation the story is, it's the kind of story you could discuss with friends for a long time and still not all agree on what it all meant.<br/><br/>I feel like the film makers should have gone with another title, as the current one might turn people away, which is a shame because not only is this one of the best horror films of the year, I could comfortably say it is one of the best films of the year, period. Highly recommended."

","I didn't know what to expect going into this small Australian horror movie but I came out horrified about how frightening this movie is, Normally I don't like horror films these days because of the cheap and lazy jump scares, But The Babadook doesn't rely on such things the film uses lightening and great sound design for it's scares.<br/><br/>There are two things that make this movie stand above all other generic horror films from the last 5 years which is Essie Davis performance in the main role of a parent of the child who is being seeing this monster , her descent into madness is better than any other over the top generic performances from other horror films from what I have seen this year so far she is a shoe in for a best actress Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>The second is the monster itself not only the design of it but how it is portrayed on screen, the look alone is terrifying (Think Papa Lazarou and then some) it's presents itself on screen with really seeing his face and thing that I found really creepy is his hands which you see quite often coming out of the shadow. Not much is heard from the Babadook except for the weird screams and quietly says Babadook.<br/><br/>This movie is one I will be watching for years to come, for fans of Eraserhead this watch is essential."
"panther_husky","9","11","24","1 November 2014"," Brilliant
","What a wonderfully crafted piece of work. Some chilling scenes and Essie Davies was just brilliant. Her facial expression was enough to see what a great actress she is. She played the part to ""T"".<br/><br/>Daniel Henshal's role as the son was acted quite well, though there were scenes that made you feel like you wanted to wring his neck. (lol) The psychological aspect of the movie was the most haunting and as for the Babadook, well, there are scenes which does creep you out!<br/><br/>Overall, it is a movie that must be watched.

","Because it does nothing (or cannot) to prevent professional reviewers from praising bad movies and giving them 10 stars.<br/><br/>Don't believe the payed reviews. This movie is just plain awful! It has a lot of problems on so many levels, it's a B-movie and overall should not have a score higher than 5 stars. I'm giving it 1 star, trying to normalize a bit its overrating.<br/><br/>Biggest problem: it's not at all scary! Apart from that, the story is not well developed, you don't know what exactly is happening and why. The ""horror"" part takes 45 minutes to arrive. Acting is B-movie-like, main characters are annoying to the point you can't feel any sympathy for them. The mother trying to kill her son makes you even hate her (even though he is annoying).<br/><br/>And then the film industry wonders why people are stopping going to cinemas and are downloading movies from the internet for free..."

","I was really excited to watch since IMDb has an slightly average rating. But this was one of worst movies I ever seen. The only thing here positive and remarkable was the acting of an very young kid. Mother does also a good melodramatic acting but on other scenes she is way predictable. But probably were the 2 good things of the film. The story behind is completely non sense, rubbish, forced, etc. Im not rating badly because is not an horror movie as it is classified (which in fact is not) but for me that isn't even the point. The point is that is a so weak movie in every aspect. Its so bad its hard to find a category to fit this movie really. I have seen during 45 min and I felt stopped in the time and in the same scenes,no excitement , no surprises, nothing. Obviously i couldn't see it till the end and I've just forward straight to the end.<br/><br/>a big disappointment and it shows that many users of IMDb don't have an idea of what should be made a good movie."

","This movie definitely isn't for everyone, if you like the pop out horror then this is not for you, however if you like psychological thrillers then this movie is right up your alley! I have read a lot of the reviews on here, good and bad, all the bad ones were because people didn't understand the movie. After you watch it, take a moment to think about what's really going on, if you have to do some research, everything that happened is explained in the movie, it's just not obvious.<br/><br/>I did like the movie, it was interesting, a bit too slow, and they could have showed the babadook more (one of the scariest faces I have ever seen) for being a low budget film it was worth the watch. The child's actions through the beginning of the movie were a bit to much, but I'm sure any child would act out like that with people saying the things that were said to him. I have to admit for a 6 year old he's pretty smart! <br/><br/>Don't let a bad review stop you from watching this, decide for yourself, but make sure you pay attention to even the smallest details."

It was poor in every other way.<br/><br/>Story was terrible, the dialogue amateur, the set design awful and clearly a sound stage, acting was overwrought and unrealistic, the directing unimaginative and it features what must be the least scary villain in all horror history.

Then I watched it again; start to finish. I hate to admit, after reading all these glowing reviews, that I just don't get it. There was a monster but it didn't DO anything. And that lunatic hyper-active screaming kid didn't seem to add anything to my inability to find the monster. Yeah, the mother was nuts. Yeah, the kid was nuts.

","First of all I can only assume that the good reviews that this film has received are from infants or people that have never watched a decent horror film. Either that or the makers have paid people to rate it up. Early on in the film I thought, ""yeah this might get scary soon"". An hour or so later the film ended. I have never left a review on a film before and I have seen so many. I only watch horror films and I believe I know the difference between a good one and a bad one. If you put this film in the 'Adam's family' or 'Beetlejuice' category, then you might be slightly (emphasis on slightly) scared. All in all this filmed sucked worse than a drunk toothless hooker.

","Jennifer Kent's ""The Babadook,"" took me by surprise. Watching the trailer, I was expecting an average monster flick full of jump scares and forced scenes. Instead, I gripped the arms of my chair as I was taken for a ride on what I would say is the best horror movie since James Wan's ""The Conjuring,"" and the most original horror story since ""Insidious."" <br/><br/>Actress Essie Davis- stepping out from behind the stage curtain and onto the big screen -gives a tremendous performance as a widowed mother who cannot outrun her past. In his early age acting debut, Noah Wiseman's performance as a very troubled young boy is exceptional, especially for an actor his age. While many movie-goers will be disappointed in the lack of on-screen presence for the antagonist, Kent makes sure to keep you on the edge of your seat for the duration of the film. This is not your granny's haunted house movie; this is a pure psychological-thriller and a True Horror film that does not need frightening images or sudden loud noises to make you shake in your chair or sleep with the lights on. True Horror fans will love ""The Babadook,"" and look forward to future Jennifer Kent films; however, movie-goers seeking cheap scares, gore, expensive CGI creatures, and teen romance will be extremely disappointed."
"MattBirk","9","10","22","2 December 2014"," Best Horror Movie of 2014
","The Babadook has to be one of the best directorial debuts of all time, it's simply amazing to watch the amount of skill involved in the movie with no previous experience. This is the sort of movie that focuses on a strong story which is built on a very strong emotional foundation, which is most likely why critics are praising the film. This certainly is not your typical monster movie, it's much more deep and intellectual than that, and that is why I enjoyed it so much. There are no straightforward answers, everything is left to the viewer for interpretation. I have to admit I was expecting a different type of movie, something that featured a mysterious monster wreaking havoc inside the house walls (based on the trailer for the film), but was still not disappointed (I've been waiting for this movie for over a year!). The Babadook focuses on the relationship between a mother and her son, it's not your straightforward loving relationship either, it's much more complicated & wretched than that. I can't go too much more in depth than that without giving away too much of how the movie plays out. <br/><br/>A lot of people have labeled this 'the scariest movie of all time', which of course immediately raises peoples expectations and when that happens, almost never will a movie live up to that title. However, the movie is absolutely scary, Jennifer Kent knows just how to manipulate the darkness in the frame and only shows us part of the villain and lets our imaginations do the rest. Plus on a technical level, I think the design of Mister Babadook is amazing, he couldn't be more intimidating, especially since we only see the outline of his true form. Nothing in the movie comes 'easy', it's almost all up for us to decide and I think that is the brilliance of the movie, everything in the movie represents some sort of a metaphor. The Babadook is easily the best horror movie of the year (given It Follows comes out in 2015), and marks the start of a very promising career for Jennifer Kent.<br/><br/>Full Review at - www.simplefilmreviews.com"
"The_late_Buddy_Ryan","8","10","22","29 November 2014"," Single mom + spooky kid + scary monster = instant horror classic
","This ambitious Aussie film fits into the same horror subgenre as ""The Exorcist, "" ""The Shining"" and ""The Sixth Sense""—single (or almost single) mother's spooky child makes contact with scary supernatural entity. A brittle young widow, Amelia (a blond Essie Davis, of ""Miss Fisher's Mysteries""), is having trouble coping with her seven-year-old son, Sam, a fragile-looking boy who's plagued by nightmares; among other peculiarities, he goes around with a homemade dart gun and cricket-ball catapult to ward off monsters. W/d Jennifer Kent's come up with a great high concept: a creepy pop-up book, ""Mister Babadook,"" suddenly appears on Sam's bookshelf, with a sheaf of blank pages at the end hinting at further horrors to come. <br/><br/>The climactic scenes, when the Babadook, a wedge-toothed, scarecrowlike apparition, gets under Amelia's skin in earnest, have topnotch-horror-film momentum, and the script gains enough of your trust with its subtle and involving buildup that you may be willing, as I was, to spend a little time puzzling out the meaning of it all when it's over. Purists have dismissed this one as a softcore Freudian fantasy, not really a horror film at all, but if you're not too rigid about categories, I think you'll be impressed by the artistry of the opening scenes, and no matter what you decide the Babadook stands for—the son's anxiety, the mother's depression and her longing for her dead husband (or for death itself), the son's awareness of her accumulated resentment, all of the above, or just another scary monster—I think you'll agree that it has to be kept well fed and strictly in its place. Essie Davis, a model of upper-crust composure in ""Miss Fisher,"" really gets to stretch in this one. Now in theatrical release, ""The Babadook"" is available from Time Warner on demand."

","Forget the silly name, The Babadook is an amazing little piece of film. It's not that people are disliking it, as I believe they are misunderstanding just how deep it is. I would bet money that most people missed the whole point of it because the director gives just tiny hints along the way.<br/><br/>On the surface it comes across as the story of a mythical creature called Mister Babadook... A monster that somehow finds its way into the lives of the two characters. However, it's the ""somehow"" that tips you off to the real story here. Don't just limit this movie to a haunted book, that's doing a disservice. Think of what the Babadook symbolizes during the film, there are a couple of very specific flashbacks and ""visions"" that point to what exactly the monster might really be. I won't spoil it, but I guarantee it adds a whole new dimension to the story... And makes this slice of celluloid and tight little thriller that side steps the conventions and goes for the psychological scares. It reminded me of The Orphanage and Dark Water, with some Shining on top.<br/><br/>The way she slowly becomes affected by the monster, and how it plays out in the end, all work perfectly due to some top notch acting by the two leads and a brilliant scriptwriter.

Amelia, genuinely frightened by her son's behavior, is forced to medicate him.<br/><br/>They are so many bad horror films out there right now that I'm pretty tired and sick of seeing, but The Babadook is not like those films. This horror movie did something that Annabelle or Ouija couldn't do, and that is try to be original and scary.<br/><br/>Babadook is a movie that got under my skin if I got to be honest. The chilling and uneasy atmosphere and it's sense of fear that this movie truly nails it for me and not like most horror films today that lost that sense fear and just allow on lazy Jump scars. The acting in this movie was so real and so top notch that I got to say that Essie Davis did excellent in this movie, even the little kid did good.<br/><br/>The other thing that this movie get's right is the fact it says ""F'ck jump scares"", and tries to scary the viewing auditions and not be throwing loud sounds to make some people jump a little bit, no it goes for the good old fashioned method of a good horror film and that is showing frighting images that will stick in your mind until the movie is over.<br/><br/>My only problems with this movie is it's slow at the beginning and the ending to the movie was a bit ridiculous if I got to say.<br/><br/>But overall The Babadook is more than you're cliché monster movie, it focus on doubt's and depression which made the movie even scary, because if you got doubt's and depression running throw your head and meanwhile there might be something out there after you and your kid then it can mess with your mind and cause terror."

","I had the pleasure of viewing ""The Babadook"" at the recent Melbourne Premiere screening. Being a fan of the Thriller/Horror genre it is refreshing to see an original story that delivers the goods. I congratulate writer/ Director Jennifer Kent on creating a terrific, intelligent and original tale that doesn't suffer from its limited budget. Essie Davis is superb in the role of Amelia,a dedicated single mother who struggles to contain her hyper-energetic and over imaginative son Sam, played with emotional talent by a young star in the making,Noah Wiseman. The bond between mother and son is completely believable and director Kent manages to extract incredible and powerful performances from the two actors.

"estebangonzalez10","7","7","14","20 January 2015"," Impressive first feature film from Jennifer Kent
","""If it's in a word, or it's in a look, you can't get rid of  The Babadook.""<br/><br/>When William Friedkin claimed that he had never seen a more terrifying film than The Babadook, I was certain that I needed to see this. I'm not a huge horror fan, but I was pleasantly surprised with 2013's The Conjuring, so I went into this with high expectations knowing there is hope for the genre. The film didn't disappoint despite never actually being scary. I don't think that director, Jennifer Kent, was interested in scaring her audience, but rather in creating an uneasy atmosphere that would keep us engaged. She succeeded because while I was watching The Babadook I couldn't help but compare it to some other horror classics like Kubrick's The Shining and Polanski's Rosemary's Baby. Kent spends time in creating an unsettling atmosphere with some annoying characters and isn't interested in creating jump scares like so many horror films tend to do nowadays. The Babadook takes its time to build the right atmosphere and you are rewarded with your patience during the final third act. It is more of a psychological horror film than a graphically violent one. It is almost as if you are watching a dark drama at times. There is more to this film than simply scaring the audience and once the film is over you'll realize that there is meaning behind the narrative. It sort of plays out as a metaphor exploring interesting ideas which I wouldn't want to get into because it would involve spoiling some aspects of the film, but it is clear that there is a surreal undercurrent to the film which effectively says something about the way we deal with grief and parenting. Jennifer Kent's first feature film was a breath of fresh air in the horror department while feeling as a classic at the same time. She will be a director whose work I will be looking forward to in the future. Her screenplay was also smartly written and I know that audiences will benefit from a rewatch because there is a meaning behind everything that is going on. There is an interesting undertone to this film which will only build its reputation over time. If you just look at this film as a monster film you will be disappointed because it has a different agenda.<br/><br/>Building a creepy atmosphere isn't enough for a horror film to succeed; you need characters you can engage with. I know that some of the complaints with this film had to do with the fact that the characters were all annoying and that made it hard to engage with, but in my opinion it worked perfectly for what it was trying to do. Essie Davis gives one of the best performances of the year and was a big part of why the creepy atmosphere worked so well. She plays a grieving mother who lost her husband on the day her first son was born. Her son is a problematic and hyperactive kid who is constantly giving her mother grief. He keeps on repeating that there are monsters in the house and always gets in trouble in school for his odd behavior. He's played brilliantly by Noah Wiseman and he effectively gets on the audience's nerves as well. Her mother doesn't really know how to handle him and when they come across a strange book named The Babadook weird strange begin to happen in the house. Essie Davis's character looks incredibly stressed throughout the film and her physical transformation is incredible. Noah Wiseman is one of those rare child actors who actually makes his character feel authentic and believable even when he is throwing tantrums and fits. I was impressed by the performances in this low budget film and they only add to an incredible tense and unsettling atmosphere. I was never scarred by this film, but I did feel uneasy and I also loved what it was trying to communicate. The Babadook is one of those films you should see now before Hollywood comes up with a terrible remake and ruins it. I hope it also marks a change of pace in the way horror films should be approached from now on."

","Ba-baba—Dook-Dook! No jump scares are needed to hold your breath when you're watching The Babadook.<br/><br/>You should not expect a classic horror movie.

The unceasing anxiety of mother and child is depicted through tremendously evocative, pertinent, and meaningful metaphors.<br/><br/>Anyone who likes thrillers and psychological questions, especially about coping mechanisms, should watch the Babadook.

This is horror, pure and simple.<br/><br/>Jennifer Kent has done something outstanding here, by creating a film that is actually frightening. She scared the hell out of me, and I much appreciate it.<br/><br/>So bring some friends. Turn out the lights. Cover yourself in blankets. Turn up the sound. But don't let in The Babadook."

","Seeing the title, i was hesitant with the movie. I mean, it's a little ridiculous and it got me thinking it's some kind of throwaway comedy/horror. But, NO! This movie blew my expectations out of the water. I was trying to close my ears and eyes when the scares started yet i can't miss a scene of this gem.<br/><br/>It is a story about a grieving mother with a single child after the death of the father seven years later. Coping from her grief, one day her son found a storybook named 'Mister Babadook'. And then... I just can't tell you 'cause it would only ruin the surprise!<br/><br/>I gotta tell you i was not expecting much. But, everything seems to be running smoothly. From its' cinematography to its' acting. The actors did an excellent job portraying the bleak family, bringing tension to the highest level possible.

"christopher256_98","9","5","9","25 May 2017"," One of the Elites of Modern Horror Film
","The Babadook, masterfully directed by Jennifer Kent is one of the best horror movies of recent years--possibly of recent decades. In her stunning directorial debut, the Australian Kent shows not merely promise as a filmmaker, but the kind of rare talent that seldom shows through this strongly so soon. Creepy, tension filled, and mostly free of tired horror clichÃ©s, it is something special.<br/><br/>The film stars Essie Davis in a terrific emotional turn as Amelia, a widowed mother still years later in a funk of despair over the loss of her husband, in addition to having difficult young child Samuel, played by Noah Wiseman. Samuel talks of dark subjects, makes weapons, and is prone to violent outbursts; he gets suspended from school and causes his devoted-if-emotionally-distant mother barriers with among others her sister and a potential love interest, and society generally. As they become more isolated from society, things get stranger and more distressing in their home, especially when what appears to be a kid's pop-up book, that Amelia can't recall seeing before, called The Babadookâ€”those pages are a terrific artistic creation in themselvesâ€”is discovered, and when read is found to be nothing innocent at all. It builds on a spine-chilling atmosphere with events and details, one and then another, very effectively, and hits the viewer with along the way moments of startling fright that add to but never overshadow the main situation. Motivations for certain acts aren't always clear, but that only adds, not detracts, from the overall effect.<br/><br/>This is in the running for my favorite horror film since the turn of the century: a genuinely scary film with a great pacing, two strong lead performances, and enough originality to keep it interesting throughout. Beyond all it is Kent, who wrote the film as well as directed it, who deserves large credit for the success.<br/><br/>About the same time as this film came out another horror film was released, also by a woman directing her first feature film, and that I think also ranks among the best modern examples of the genre: Ana Lily Amirpour's A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night. What Kent and Amirpour prove I think is that if more female talent was given a chance to make the films they are capable of, or the kinds they desire, that many more would shine, and studios are doing a disservice by not considering filmmakers of that gender more often. I can probably count on one hand the number of horror movies since 2000 made by men that I could put alongside either of these two."

","I admit, at the start of the film, I found the kid so annoying that I wanted whatever monster comes along to eat it. Of course, the kid is meant to be like this, which is a sign of the excellent acting Babadook has.<br/><br/>More than that, though, Babadook is scary. It's not too original, it is rather predictable, but it doesn't matter. On the contrary, expecting the monster doesn't make it any less creepy.<br/><br/>But still, there is one thing I felt was handled wrongly. Throughout most of the film, there are hints thrown, abundantly, that the Babadook isn't real. The phantom cockroach infestation, when the neighbour's name is Roach. Or the casual mention that Amelia used to write, ""kids' stuff"", which is a huge wink that she is the one who wrote Babadook, and probably then stitched it together after tearing it up. This all ends up being a distraction, smoke and mirrors, when we are clearly told the monster is real. And it feels rather cheap. Personally, I feel that the story should have followed that narrative and simply deliver a mother who hallucinates, goes insane and murders her son. It wouldn't be a twist or anything, it's been done. A lot. But the end result would be much scarier. Though perhaps too morose and likely not crowd-friendly, but ending up with some sort of cellar-bound incarnate horror pet felt out of character."
"MaximumMadness","10","5","9","29 October 2016"," ""The Babadook""- A new classic in the world of horror.
","It's not too often that I am as amazed and enthralled with a film as I was with 2014's phenomena of horror ""The Babadook."" It's a film that from its very first moment has you captive in its dark tale of grief and suffering, unable to turn away from the screen because you are so completely absorbed into the exquisitely crafted narrative. Clever and deliciously frightening, it's easily a new classic in the world of horror.<br/><br/>In the six years that have passed since the tragic loss of her husband in a car accident, Amelia Vanek (Essie Davis) has lead a troubled and depressing existence as the single mother of her deeply troubled son Samuel. (Noah Wiseman) One night, as she goes to read Samuel a bedtime story, he suggests a mysterious book that Amelia was previously unaware of: ""Mr. Babadook"", the story of a frightening creature that stalks and tortures those who become aware of its existence. Samuel is disturbed by the twisted story and the images contained therein, and soon, becomes obsessed with the idea that Mr. Babadook is all too real. At the same time, mysterious phenomena begin to plague the largely sleepless Amelia, and it appears that with her quickly-slipping sanity, she too will begin to see the demented figure that has started to torment her son's fragile psyche.<br/><br/>Written and directed by Jennifer Kent, ""The Babadook"" is a powerhouse of emotional terror, dealing with complex themes of grief, depression, mental illness and even hatred. It's very clever in its use of ambiguous and evocative storytelling, allowing the audience to reach their own conclusions and to theorize on the goings-on in many key sequences. Like many greats of the genre, it's a film that from the start encourages critical analysis and personal interpretation, which helps each and every person take from it what they will. It's filled to burst with metaphorical imagery and hauntingly atmospheric visual motifs, leading to an all-encompassing sense of dread that very few films in the past have managed to capture. I was left in literal awe with just how exquisitely crafted a tale it was, and Kent deserves nothing but the utmost praise and respect for what she accomplishes here.<br/><br/>This is also very much an actor's film, relying heavily on the presentation of a single mother and her child on the brink of collapse. Not only does the script perfectly establish and continue to flesh out our two leads throughout the running time, but both Davis and Wiseman are revelations for the film. Davis gives a performance that in every way deserves all the recognition she could receive. It's the role of a lifetime, and she consistently knocks it out of the part as a mother pushed to and over the edge by the circumstances of her life- both those in and out of her control. She is simply incredible and makes for one of the most compelling leads in a horror film I've seen in some time. Wiseman is a very talented and lovable child actor, and he does great with the part of the deeply troubled Samuel. Samuel is a disturbed young boy who is obsessed with his mother, and is obviously dealing with the repercussions of growing up without a father. Wiseman does exceptionally well for a boy as young as he is, and injects a lot of complexity beneath the surface. Bravo, young sir. Bravo.<br/><br/>Beyond that, every facet of the production is absolutely spot-on and contributes towards creating a masterpiece of modern cinema. Radek Ladczuk's stunning cinematography perfectly compliments the complex and tragic nature of the storyline, delivering us beautifully crafted images that work wonders for the tale being told. Composer Jed Kurzel does a fine job with crafting a subtle and appropriate score that accentuates every scene with class and elegance without distracting from what we are seeing. Production and costume design is top-notch stuff, creating a world that feels true to life while also having just a slight enough hint of exaggeration to build towards the moody sense of tone established. And the editing by Simon Njoo is just spot-on, with a grand sense of pacing that helps each and every scene build in tension like a wire ready to snap at any instant.<br/><br/>There is only one simple and elegant way to say it- ""The Babadook"" is a flawless classic in the genre. Despite only being two years old at the time I write this review, it has already shown itself to be one of the greatest horror films ever crafted, and it will without doubt continue to be admired for years, decades and generations to come. And thus, it easily earns a perfect 10 out of 10 from me. Worth seeing for everyone who loves cinema, horror or otherwise."

","The Babadook has the all the intimacy of an independent film with the adrenaline of a big budget thriller. <br/><br/>Steeped in metaphor, Jennifer Kent examines the lives of ""disadvantaged"" families through a paranormal lens, crafting a tale that is as inspirational as it is thrilling. The minimalist approach in both camera and scoring leaves a void that is filled with apprehension, sympathy, and at times, terror.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a cheap, run of the mill horror film, this is not for you. If you're looking for a refreshing dive into an equally harrowing story, watch now."

Maybe I'm just a sucker for intelligent, allegorical fables. It is becoming increasingly rare to find films and their subject matter treated with such care. The closest I can come to nanny comparable films would be The Shining, The Mist and Pan's Labyrinth. <br/><br/>I really loved the practical effects ... a nice departure from the abundance of cgi films are subject to these days.<br/><br/>It's a slow burn, but the lead up time really pays off ....

"InaneSwine","8","5","9","20 February 2016"," A terrifying experience - Jennifer Kent hits the nail on the head
","Looking through some of my reviews for more recent horror films, I seem to react with genuine surprise whenever I come across one that I've actually enjoyed. And I think that's mainly due to the fact that almost all modern horror films are the same. They don't pay much thought to character development, story or drama, and are just concerned with forcing bigger screams from its audience and making them throw their popcorn higher and higher into the air. If people leave a cinema laughing about a horror film they just saw, it has failed to deliver. If they are quiet and exhausted, then it really has frightened its audience.<br/><br/>The Babadook, first and foremost, is a terrifying experience. Not entirely because of its supernatural elements and the villainous entity, but because of the drama and tension surrounding the unstable family unit that Amelia and Samuel inhabit. Though a single parent raising an unmanageable child may be a well trodden premise, particularly in a horror story, it is compounded by an expertly written and heartfelt script, authentic performances - Essie Davis is outstanding - and a horrifying exploration of a parent's descent into madness, the kind not executed this well in horror films since The Shining.<br/><br/>When the supernatural elements do emerge, the third act begins to falter slightly, and the melodrama of the dialogue threatens to encroach soap opera territory. But what chilled me to the bone was watching the mother - influenced by this evil being - chasing her son around their dilapidated house, hurting him and threatening him, and realising that this is how some children live their lives, without influence of the Babadook. I'm sure this was director/writer Jennifer Kent's intention, and she's absolutely hit the nail on the head.<br/><br/>I never did like sleep much anyway."

However, this is not a movie for fans of cheap jump scares. This movie will make you think about it though...<br/><br/>MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD<br/><br/>The Babadook is RIPE with symbolism. If you don't find out that the monster symbolizes the mom's grief, the ending will be very unsatisfying.

"bneathanaprlmoon","8","5","9","1 January 2016"," Beautifully novel work, truly refreshing
","Horror is a film genre so bogged down with sub-mediocre works it's almost easy to dismiss in its modern form. But every five years or so a film comes along that breathes new life into the medium (and then, sadly, spawns untold lacklustre copycats for the next decade). Past examples include The Blair Witch Project, The Ring, and The Cabin in the Woods. The Babadook is more than worthy addition to that pantheon. <br/><br/>Excellent acting, tastefully done special effects, a lack of cheap jump scares, and a greater emphasis on human emotional darkness than supernatural spookiness are among the film's best qualities. Very simple and streamlined production, not bogged down with superfluous characters, scenes, or plot details."

","Right off the bat this film is wonderful. From the bleek color palet to the wonderful shots, it's definitely eye candy. I would say this is more of something that is creepy rather then a horror that is filled with jump scares. Most of the ""Spine Tingling"" moments are when the antagonist is out of the shot but all you hear are then noises and things going on in the background. Another thing this film excelled in is the character development. I left feeling great sympathy for our protagonists through out the whole film. The boy played the best acting in my opinion although everyone did an amazing job. This is one of those films where its best to watch in the dark and alone."
"Cathex","9","5","9","12 October 2015"," Truly Horrifying
","In terms of horror films, you will find few quite as truly horrific as this one. Not only is the plot thrilling and layered with all kinds of terrifying possibilities, the script, acting and direction are sometimes so good that its actually hard to watch.<br/><br/>If you're used to factory line horrors, which churn out jump scares with meaningless stories, then you might find The Babadook a bit outside of your comfort zone. But if, like me, you revel in talented directing, rich metaphors and incredible screen writing, then this is the film for you.<br/><br/>The film has a wonderfully subjective subtext, and massively succeeds in conveying a real sense of the main characters madness through brilliantly inventive directing. It is reminiscent of Polanski's The Tenant in some parts, and just as well presented, but also manages to create something new and fresh.<br/><br/>Honestly though, I've seen hundreds of horror movies, most of them are simply annoying, and a few of them are quite scary, but this film was at times genuinely terrifying. And I haven't felt that way about a movie since I was about ten! <br/><br/>Viewer discretion should be advised however, as the film does tread dangerously close to the issue of child abuse so those who are particularly sensitive in that regard may want to steer clear.<br/><br/>Its not a horror movie for those who don't really want to be horrified. And to me, that means its excellent."
"the_chili_pepper","9","5","9","3 September 2015"," A Terrifyingly Terrific Masterpiece of Horror.
","Concept: A mother and her son deal with a supernatural force that threatens the small shell of a family that they have left, along with their very lives.<br/><br/>Acting: The acting in this movie for a horror film is extraordinary. Essie Davis, the mother, gives an Oscar worthy performance here. Her decent into madness is truly unsettling and terrifying. Noah Wisemann does a superb job as the son. Starting out in this film you sympathize heavily with the mother and less with the son. In fact you start out hating the son because he's so annoying, and honestly I feel this is done on purpose. It causes the movie to feel deeply unsettling. It's really well done, especially a kind of role reversal later, when you start to identify with the son more. Really great job by this very small cast.<br/><br/>Cinematography: There are a lot of really cool creepy shots in this movie. It's really cool to see jumps in the camera at times, kind of like stutters but not really, it's hard to describe honestly. Some shots also mess with your mind a little but in a subtle way. You might possibly see the babadook in the background, sometimes shadows look like him, sometimes you see delusions through the eyes of the mother. It's really a clever job. Later on I'll make more of a point on this, but it supports this idea that the babadook is kind of a thinking person's horror movie.<br/><br/>Direction: Jennifer Kent made one hell of a directorial debut in cinema here. The way the story is structured and how so much is done with so little is really to be admired. In some ways it's a throwback to old horror movies and in some ways its new entirely. Jennifer Kent knows what makes a great horror film and that's suspense and Dread. There are no jump scares as you know them in this film, all the terror comes from deeply unsettling material and deeply unnerving content. I feel like Jennifer Kent wanted to do 2 things with this film 1: make the next truly great horror film.<br/><br/>2: make that horror film so much more than just some horror film.<br/><br/>She accomplished both. This is a story truly about grief with a monster setting or perhaps even allegory. And it truly left me unnerved after my first viewing, even my second and third and even now it still truly creeps me out.<br/><br/>Score: The score is relatively small and it's kind of refreshing. It adds to the suspense. What is really impressive here is the sound design. Every single sound plays a role in building tension, Kent Realizes this, which I applaud her for. It's so well done that I think it's the best use of sound in film that I've heard in years.<br/><br/>Opinion: I truly love, adore and respect this movie, it isn't done true justice without watching it in the dark and with a good sound system (whether that's headphones or a theater/home theater set up). For my review I watched the blu ray with some surround sound headphones and it really got to me even though it's my 4th time seeing it. I think this should be the ideal for all horror films to strive for. It's definitely in my top 5 horror films. Everything about is great. I don't think its for the normal horror audience that's marketed towards now but this is a true horror film. Say what you want about it, love it or hate it, I truly believe this movie is what horror is about, not cheap jump scares or any kind of scares for that matter but deep unsettling dread.<br/><br/>Watch-ability: All colors of the rainbow. After one viewing I don't know how many people would want to see it again except for horror buffs. But I feel like horror buffs who love the genre would truly appreciate this film and re-watch it for all the little nuances and symbolism.<br/><br/>Overall Grade: A"
"Screen_Blitz","9","5","9","22 July 2015"," Twisted and spine-chilling thriller you shouldn't watch alone
","This Austrailian horror-thriller follows Amelia (Essie Davis), a widowed mother who's husband was killed in a car crash, and is struggling trying to raise her six-year-old son Sam (Noah Wiseman), who has violent tantrums and copes with an extreme fear of monsters under his bed. One night, when she reads him book titled ""The Babadook"", about a mysterious figure that lurks at night. Amelia and her son become endangered when ""The Babadook"", the mysterious character from the book, comes to life and unleashes an unimaginable terror in their house. This film was directed and written by Jennifer Kent in her directorial debut.<br/><br/>The Badadook is by far the scariest movie I've seen since The Conjuring (2013). It left me at the edge of my seat for awhile. Instead for relying on cheap jump scares that most horror films nowadays are known for, this film goes for straight horror by constantly building up suspense so that it will leave you slowly backing away from the screen. It does take away awhile (maybe 45 minutes) for all the scares to arrive, but when they happen, it immediately sends chills to your spine. The Babadook, which is this eerily dark figure with a coat and a hat, is the scariest part of the film. In the scene when it slowly emerges from the dark and scares Amelia and her son, my heart just started pounding. This scene was so creepy and unnerving to the point where I felt the Babadook was gonna come out jump at me. Then you have Amelia, who becomes possessed by the grotesque figure and begins exhibiting nightmare-ish behavior, like vomiting blood and screaming unnaturally. This film just took me by a surprise at every turn.<br/><br/>The Babadook is truly one of the scariest of this decade. If you are a fan of horror films, this would be the best choice. However, don't watch it alone. Find a friend or a family member like a brother, sister, or cousin to watch this with. This is a really frightening movie, especially when you're by yourself."
"angryitalian","9","5","9","21 July 2015"," ""The Babadook"": A NEW Horror Classic
","I am a poor lad, having been born in 1999. Now, I live in an age where classic horror is dead and the term ""horror"" has became a joke with modern ""horror"" movies like Ouija, Devil's Due, Smiley and the once great Paranormal Activity franchise taking the meaning of ""horror"" for ""an orgy of endless, predictable jumpscares"". This leaves few good modern horror movies like The Conjuring, Sinister, and The Ring to carry the torch of what horror once was and can still be.<br/><br/>Now, The Babadook has arrived.<br/><br/>I'm unsure of how jumpscares became a necessity for horror, and while I'm not completely against jumpscares, it's all too easy to get tired of them once you see them coming before they're on screen. Even good horror films have one or two jumpscares, but they create a creepy, ominous atmosphere well-deserving of at least one pass.<br/><br/>The Babadook challenges this theory by creating one of the most eerie, unsettling, dark, nightmarish inducing atmospheres ever put to modern horror...and not a single jumpscare is thrown out.<br/><br/>The film's story at heart is not about the monster haunting them (more on that later), but the family being tortured by it's lingering presence. The family, a mother, Amelia, and a son, Samuel, live a rather pathetic existence, with Amelia spiraling further into depression after the death of her husband in a car accident, while her son concocts small wooden weapons to protect himself against the ""imaginary"" monsters of their house. When Amelia reads Samuel a story called ""The Babadook"" for bed, the Babadook makes his grand entrance.<br/><br/>Aside from delivering a refreshing, unsettling atmosphere, The Babadook seems to have something almost no horror films, even good ones, have; a soulful story. The interactions between the Amelia and Samuel are perhaps the heartfelt (and heartbreaking) moments in recent cinematic history as the main theme of the film is dealing with grief and depression; a subject that no horror film, and even many other movies, do not tackle it with this force.<br/><br/>The main characters, portrayed by Noah Wiseman and Esse Davis, each gave award-worthy performances as a mother and son going from day to day living a bleak, dis-interesting lifestyle filled with grief and depression. And the film, with subtle yet obvious symbolism, uses the Babadook monster as a euphemism for grief and depression.<br/><br/>Before wrapping up, I'd like to back my point up how jumpscares have swallowed what good, genuine horror is in modern films; due to the lack of cheap, clichÃ© scares, small audiences saw this while larger audiences saw jumpscare-riddled horror films leading to The Babadook never getting a full release in theaters. So my advice to you, reader: don't watch thinking you'll get your regular dose of clichÃ©s, watch knowing this a soulful story under the guise of a terrifying, unsettling horror atmosphere.<br/><br/>Watch ""The Babadook"" if you can, it's on DVD and Netflix, as this film is going to be remembered as a THE horror classic of the 21st century."
"almosalami","9","5","9","20 July 2015"," This is the most refreshing awesome classic horror that I've seen ever
","I will get to the slight problems I have with the movie in a second, but firstly, I've got to seriously praise this film. One of the things I really really love about this film is it does not have the incredibly stupid jump scare thing that almost all horror films have. Now that alone doesn't make a horror good. So, how did the film handle the alternative to jump scares? Absolutely amazingly. The tension was built so freaken well. We didn't get jump scares. We got a whole lot better. Whenever the Babadook appeared, we saw him in his completeness and saw him approach steadily, with every increasing intensity coupled with great sound effects (I will address the voice in a sec) and truly great acting from Essie Davis and an awesome child performance from Noah Wiseman. Seriously, the great child acting really stood out for me. Now, to get into the details, let's talk about the plot. While you can predict that the end will be that the monster will be cleared up or dead or whatever (I won't spoil what actually happens), the story really isn't about that. The monster, and how the characters develop over the story (and seriously, TALK ABOUT THE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT) all come together to produce this great metaphor for depression and great study into how human behavior in cases of extreme stress and tight circumstances. And while the overall plot is 'predictable', the specific scenes are not, and all of them are set up with great tension and buildup and terror, with many moments legit taking you off guard. There are many great scenes that are stuck in my mind and to me make movie history (like the scenes with the reading of the book, the scenes when a certain character gets crazy; I won't mention more cuz you should see for yourself), and all of this makes for a great story. Now, I also mentioned the characters and performances, and boy do these aspects shine in this film. The kid is actually, while incredibly annoying at times (though, to the discerning viewer, understably so), pretty cool with how he protects himself and his mother and how he is actually a good kid and a lot deeper than the viewer might initially think. In fact, by the end of the film, you go through a steady and complete 180 on the kid, and I always love that, because it reveals that humans are a lot more complex that we give them credit for. And the mother as well, how she deals with stress and depression, how she is gradually spiraling downwards and gets more and more desperate is so well written, so well directed, I can't praise this enough. They felt real, and are leaps beyond so many of these stupid horror movie characters that the mainstream audience has gotten used to. There are no moments where you think ""Why the hell is that character doing that? Why are they so stupid?"" No! None of that, and that is so dang refreshing. I loved it. And is this movie scary? Hell yes. For three days afterward, I kept imagining the Babadook in my closet, or on the walls, or in the darkness where I couldn't see, which is crazy cuz all we ever see is his outline! (And just on a tangent, I love the name Babadook. It is kind of catchy and iconic and really added to the character for me :).) And while the Babadook himself is really creepy due to his creepy smile and very large brooding figure, the reason the film is scary is the great cinematography (I mean wow, I always have my gripes of how something is shot in a film, but with this, almost none) and great sound effects and audio. I've mentioned, but I defiantly mention it again. THERE ARE NO STUPID JUMP SCARES! THIS IS ACTUALLY LEGITIMATELY WELL DIRECTED! WOO!! Now, to the issues. While I loved the fact that this film completely avoided a lot of clichÃ©s, it went a little bit too far at the end in not completely showing the Babadook. I felt like while the final scenes were powerful, it would've been even better if we actually saw the Babadook and him really physically harming the characters and them being in even more peril that what they already were. Also, there are a few characters that don't really fit too well in this world that is set up. For instance, there is the friend of the mother. Now, it is actually pretty realistic that she would venture into resent of the mother with how long she has been depressed and aloof, and especially how she would resent her child, there are times when she went a bit overboard, and it kind of felt like it wasn't really her but just how the rest of the scene was. What I mean is, while everything that happens with the kid and the scene is intense, some parts of the scene are a bit exaggerated so they meet with this intensity and at times, this is over the top. There is also the kind of clichÃ© of how the police officers won't help her, even though, at the very least, they would superficially investigate the case to satisfy such a desperate woman. However, the good far far outweighs the bad and the good is further boosted by this film being soooo refreshing from all the horror we've seen lately that I can't help but give this film a near perfect score. The score is 4.5/5, but really, it is more a 4.9/5, and this is one of my favorite horror films."

The movie is a psychological horror movie which is why it is phenomenal and provides a long term sensation of true terror.

","""The best horror movie in years"" tends to be the key phrase to use when describing a genuinely good horror film. However, I think modern horror tends to get a bad reputation due to the amount rubbish produced. We've had endless Paranormal Activity films which seem to make big money and the appalling Human Centipede movies seem to make big noise, but these films aren't especially 'good'. Unfortunately though, they tend to overshadow the fantastic horror films we have been getting recently such as: You're Next, The Sacrament and Cheap Thrills to name a few. The Babadook can now pop itself onto that list. In fact, I'd say that it's easily the best and scariest supernatural horror film since the underrated Sinister. <br/><br/>The Babadook still seems to get quite a lot of criticism for some reason though. To be fair, the trailers do make it look like some sort of run-of-the-mill jumpy ghost story, so perhaps audiences were disappointed when they got a film full of rich characterisation, domestic drama and psychological depth. I wasn't. The Babadook certainly isn't your typical supernatural horror film though. We're not even given a glimpse of the Babadook himself until about 50 minutes into the film, but this doesn't matter because the central themes and characters are so strong.<br/><br/>There seems to be some debate as to whether this is a supernatural or psychological horror film. Some think that it leaves it up for the viewer to decide, but I thought that director Jennifer Kent was making it quite obvious that this was a film about a woman going mad. It's very much in the same vein of The Shining and Repulsion as our hero slowly descends into a total schizophrenic onslaught of terror. As a result, we're given a much deeper and character-driven film about grief, motherhood and madness.<br/><br/>The heart of the film is the relationship between a mother and son. Both actors are pretty extraordinary, especially the mother played by Elsie Davis who gives an incredibly strong and shattering performance. Many have described the boy as the most annoying child to ever appear in a film, which is a pretty bold statement and one which I wouldn't necessarily disagree with! The decision to make the boy as painfully annoying as chewing a wasp is an extremely conscious one though as we're put directly into the shoes of the mother. Amelia finds her son extremely hard to love as she subconsciously blames him for the death of her husband. By the end of the film we end up feeling as crazy as Amelia!<br/><br/>The first hour is actually a very sad one as we see Amelia become slowly isolated from people as her life becomes increasingly more hectic. No one seems to understand her grief and no one wants to know her because of Samuel (the impossibly annoying son). Therefore her descent into madness is a wonderfully realistic one. It's also quite frightening. I'm not one to get scared in horror films, I can watch The Exorcist on my own and feel no fright what so ever, however there were some scenes in The Babadook which made my hair stand on end. The last half hour basically just tries its best to scare the trouser off you and it succeeds! Jennifer Kent is extremely masterful in creating tension and scares. I can't think of one jump scare in the entire film which is so unusual and commendable. Instead, we're left terrified from nightmarish imagery and sounds. I dare anyone note to get chilled to the core when the Babadook is hovering over the bed chanting 'baba-dook-dook-DOOOK!'<br/><br/>The Babadook is so much more than just a 'scary' film though. It carries so much depth if you're willing to read into it more. It has a genuinely interesting and engaging character at the centre of it and is willing to throw the audience right into the middle of her mental breakdown. It's also really well-made, especially considering the teeny weeny budget. The production design is pretty outstanding and the infamous Mister Babadook book itself is beautifully made. This is a film which horror fans should welcome to their bosom. It's genuinely scary, masterfully directed and has a super screenplay to match. What more could you want? It's also a great advert for contraception if your partner is starting to get broody."
"chalyras","10","5","9","14 May 2015"," Hauntingly Beautiful!
","This film is hauntingly beautifully sad. The essence of the movie lies within the two main characters who are trying to come to grips with their loss. So it's quite understandable that at first they experience a range of emotions which is brought on with the dark character Babadook ( unlike Dr. Seuss). Nevertheless both characters endured till the end yet the mother showed how brave and courageous when she fought for control of her emotions as well as her son who had enough love and faith for the both of them. The sub text in the movie also shows how faith, love and hope can help two people to endure and overcome whatever the obstacle may be. Overall, in my opinion, the storyline encompassed with the environment really brings out the qualities and the capabilities that lie within not just the main characters but within all humans."

","It's always refreshing to see the way a new film director jumps into the feature film making and then tries out his own thing to come up with different. Sometime it works, sometimes it doesn't. But from the movies which I came across even if it doesn't works there is always something new in these first feature film. I saw this movie ""Submarine"" from Richard Ayode â€“ his first feature film, felt the same newness in every aspect of that film. Same thing I felt in this film. <br/><br/>If you compare ""The Babadook"" to any main stream horror movie you will find this movie differ from them in many areas. The way this movie is pictured is kind of sad and depressing like overall ambiance of the movie but that really adds to the creepiness of the movie.<br/><br/>The cast did a fabulous job special mention for the Noah Wiseman. He portrayed the child â€“ Samuel in the movie has very good face when it comes to the expression. I hope to see many more film in future from-Writer/Director Jennifer Kent who is definitely in my list of directors to look forward to.<br/><br/>There was talk about the whether ""the Babadook"" is real ghost or it just the figment of imagination.

","A film that in my belief; was one of the greatest paranormal films of this generation. A film that understands the psychology behind the genre. Understands the fear of the unseen.<br/><br/>The film plays on that. You never really see the Babadook, but you feel his presence, and when you do see him you never see his face. <br/><br/>The film also plays with tension, plays with this through sound. Sound is a another thing. 50% of a horror movie should be based around sounds, because all the great horror movies of the past would not have been, without the sounds. Example being John Carpenters Halloween. Without the sounds, or the music; the film would not be the masterpiece it is.<br/><br/>These two factors should always be in a horror film. Its a formula that if done correctly; makes for a great horror flick. Something that this movie does. If you are a fan of horror films, or Paranormal films you will enjoy this one. It has always been hard for me to be afraid of horror films, and most of the ones that have been coming out; example being the paranormal franchise. But this film had me crying with fear, it gave me nightmares, something I haven't had in a long while."
"Callum_Hofler","7","8","17","15 November 2014"," An Effective and Harrowing Australian Horror
","The Babadook reaffirms a few beliefs of mine that I've seemed to have lost over the past few years, namely that horror is not a lost art form; film-makers are still capable of producing material and visual artistry which infuses fear into the heart of the viewer. It also reaffirms the notion that Australia is a country which is very much capable of providing strong and intelligent writers and directors to the mainstream horror community, with Jennifer Kent's debut picture proving to be one of a very harrowing nature, and one that shall undoubtedly stick with me long into the night ahead.<br/><br/>Headed by one of the most insanely confronting and intense performances of the year thanks to the exceptional Essie Davis, the entire film is incredibly stylish and well constructed on a technical level, as well as being efficiently paced and building a tension that does not let up until the final few minutes, those final few minutes being but slightly anticlimactic in comparison to the sensational build-up. The build-up itself is absolutely effective, producing scares all throughout before the inevitable final confrontation, though thanks to the aforementioned Davis' performance, we are able to conjure up enough confidence, alongside the main character Amelia, to confront and battle the monster at hand.<br/><br/>Though interestingly enough, what propels The Babadook into a category of its own is its refusal to fit into the role of a conventional and generic monster film. Kent tries desperately hard to craft a motion picture that spreads outside its initial genre, and instead expands to a number of different ideas and messages, namely that of grief. In fact, a good way to describe The Babadook is to consider it a confrontation with grief itself, and battling the things that continue to cause us pain and suffering long after the event that has caused such has passed; when we lose a loved one or a friend, we often internalize the damage caused to us. The Babadook represents one woman's attempts to battle such, and to stand forth and tackle the issue head on. In regards to the attempts to branch outside of the horror genre, Kent excels.<br/><br/>The cinematography and sound design are each worthy of acclaim, as well as the score; all of these are instrumental in building one of the best atmospheres seen or felt all year. The camera often reacts based on the monster's movements by stopping a close-up as a bump goes off in the background, and this immediately adds a different tension than what we're used to; there is a certain anticipation in this sense, as the camera then continues on in its movements alongside Amelia. The sound design and score are equally as harrowing, both increasing in pitch and volume as the monster becomes more and more prominent within the film. Child-like music, filled with light piano and other innocent sounds occur as The Babadook becomes the main feature of the film, so we're already highly on edge, but the sound design turns overtly creepy as the sounds and volumes begin to heavily contrast with each other; as the monster nears, heavy and shrill instrumentation plays out to warn us of the inevitable doom, only to be stopped as the protagonist focuses on a different piece of interest. All of these components help to dramatically further the film into a tension ridden class of its own.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film falls slightly within its first 15 minutes, the picture often over-emphasizing certain events within this brief portion of time, commonly to poor effect. The aforementioned ending is also anticlimactic, and the tension is not held as well as one would imagine during the finale of the film. Nevertheless, The Babadook is captivating horror, and a film which will undoubtedly stay with me for a good while. It contains brilliant performances from all involved, whether it be the sensational Essie Davis, the captivating Noah Wiseman or the creepy Benjamin Winspear, and it contains a great quantity of technical brilliance. Ultimately though, it transcends many other horror films by using the monster as a means for a higher message and battle, one that exists on the path to the subconscious of a highly tortured woman. It's a beautifully filmed movie, and one that shall not quickly be forgotten.<br/><br/>8.3/10<br/><br/>You can check out longer and more elaborate reviews at www.entjunkie.blogspot.com"
"themissingpatient","7","8","17","15 November 2014"," Hope for the horror genre
","Thanks to the Paranormal Activity and Saw sequels, the horror genre has been left in an embarrassing state. We've been over-dosed on PG-13 ghost stories, that desperately rely on jump-scares, and torture-porn, filled with some of the most horrible acting to ever be put on-screen. Both so formulaic, they're predictable to the point of being boring. Then along comes a little indie film from Australia called The Babadook.<br/><br/>The Babadook is a children's book a young boy with an over-active imagination finds, mysteriously, on his bookshelf one night for his widowed, over-worked and sleep deprived mother to read to him. What is found in the book not only traumatizes the boy but also scares the mother. Soon the mother and son are being haunted by The Babadook, a monster that feeds off denial. Is the boy mentally disturbed and intentionally trying to drive his mother crazy or is the mother trying to give herself a reason to murder her son? Is The Babadook real or is the real monster a suppressed part of one of the characters? <br/><br/>The film begins and builds with excellence, masterfully directed by Jennifer Kent. It has a dash of influence from David Lynch and is somewhat reminiscent of Guillermo del Toro's earlier work. The first 75 minutes make for a truly intense and terrifying ride filled with spectacular visuals. Unfortunately, The Babadook suffers from too many missed opportunities within the story and the conclusion is more ridiculous than frightening. It makes it seem as if the filmmakers were uncertain as to whether they wanted to create a haunted house story, a monster movie or a psychological thriller. This causes more confusion than necessary, as the monster movie aspect undermines the reality and depth of the psychological thriller.<br/><br/>While it doesn't break any new ground, The Babadook is genuinely scary and unpredictable. Despite the ending, Jennifer Kent proves to be a powerful director we should keep an eye on."
"peterp-450-298716","8","8","17","13 November 2014"," What an excellent and breathtaking psycho-horror that grabs you and holds you and won't let you go.
","""If it's in a word, or it's in a look You can't get rid of the Babadook.""<br/><br/>For a horror to be successful, there are several opportunities for hands. Either you use gore elements in such a way that blood, guts and all sorts of other slimy ingredients start dripping, slipping and flowing from the screen. Either an old known creepy veteran (vampire, werewolf or serial killer) shows up and during nocturnal activities scares the life out of people. Or you use a bus-load of ""from the underworld"" derived demons, who take control of a weak person or some ramshackle building and should be exorcised by applying religious rituals what leads to objects flying around and an in foreign language speaking monstrous-looking possessed person. ""The Babadook"" has none of this. This subtle horror story uses dark corners and grim,sinister sounds. It's a story that can be interpreted in different ways and in which the phenomenon of ""The Babadook"" appears by reading a children's book which popped up suddenly in Samuel's bookcase. It's the same as in ""Candyman"" where the legendary figure Candyman appeared when chanting his name five times in front of a mirror or as in ""Evil Dead"" when the demons were released after a tape with ancient ritual texts was played.<br/><br/>Six years after the fatal accident that killed her husband Oskar (Benjamin Winspear), Amelia (Essie Davis) is still processing this heavy loss and tries to make ends meet as a single mother, together with her son Samuel (Noah Wiseman). The accident happened on the way to the hospital when Amelia was about to give birth. A traumatic experience that disrupted her relationship with Samuel. You can be sure that Amelia is torn by guilt and her feelings for Samuel balances between affection and blame. Samuel also did not emerge unscathed from this life event and is anything but an easy boy. At a certain moments I assumed that the unruly and hyper-kinetic child Samuel, was the thread in this horror. What a nightmare it is to raise such a hysterical child! The hysteria is also fueled by the irrational fear Samuel has for monsters, what leads to a daily ritual of checking closets and other spaces, the inability to control him, Samuel who can't function in a normal way in a group with all the consequences and the sleepless nights. And when ""The Babadook"" even starts to wander in the dark corners of the house of this dysfunctional family, total insanity is not far away and Amelia is on the verge of a complete nervous breakdown.<br/><br/>The Australian writer and director Jennifer Kent manages to mix the well-known ""fear of monsters under the bed""-item with traumatic life events and an emotional state of mind into a dizzying downward spiral that leads to total insanity. It's not horror elements and terrifying frights that enables this, but the excellent performances of Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman. Essie Davis plays an extremely complicated character who, as the film progresses, degenerates psychologically and needs to drag herself fatigued,depressed and hopeless through life. Kent clearly focused on the portrayal of this mother-figure and very minutely Amelia's psyche is exposed. Noah Wiseman manages to portray Samuel as a very annoying, uncontrollable and confused boy with an obsession for weapons, which he needs to defeat the evil monsters with. This obsession gets him expelled from school and injures the snooty daughter of Amelia's sister. With his bulging eyes and pale skin, he looks sick and obviously you have both pity on him and on the other hand he's so unbearable that you would prefer to smack his head against a brick wall. Just as his mum wished to do at a particular moment. Would he be such a brat in reality than this performance is nothing special. Otherwise it's a masterful acting performance. ""The Babadook"" is ultimately a kind of ""Edward Scissorhands"" dressed like a magician. A caricature as pictured in the inky pop-up book.<br/><br/>""The Babadook"" is not your average horror and was subtly elaborated. It can easily be called the most original and bizarre horror of the year. The seasoned horror fans will not find it truly terrifying and some patience will be asked from the impatient horror fans to endure the slow build up. But put that aside and you can enjoy an excellent psychological horror that'll still haunt your thoughts for some time. It's your choice to decide whether this film is an observation out of the perspective of Amelia or whether it's a manifestation that arose from her psychological mess. I thought there were some hints that suggest that we are witnessing the nightmare Amelia lives in. Or ""The Babadook"" is just another bogeyman that can be placed in the gallery together with his colleagues. <br/><br/>""Ba-ba-ba ... dook! Dook ! DOOOOOKH !

","Seeing the trailer I was so hyped for this movie I can't even tell you. I love horrors but am very picky & hard to scare.I found the book really creepy & figured a good soils plot was finally gracing the genre after a long time. Sadly the book is the only scary thing here and soon disappears literally up in smoke like the first half's promise of a gripping and resolved storyline. The beginning is pretty good, you feel the mother's exhaustion, tension and sense of isolation but to be grieving so much after 7 years makes you wonder why its taken 7 years to get this far? It begins to seem far fetched. I grew up with a grieving parent who had tendencies to alcohol and medication abuse abuse and act violently and irrationally then emotionlly so the switch In the mother's persona and sons reaction is relatable if not a bit OTT. I get it, babadook is meant to be the anger a and pain manifested from grief but the execution is poor. The basement scene where she feeds it made me want to put my head in my hands with frustration as it made the whole story ludicrous. The ending is lazy and too soon.. The mother goes mental, her kid stabs and restrains her, she pukes, yells at the babadook then locks it up with her husband's things and pacifies it with bugs her kid catches a after a simple knock on the door makes her snap out of killing her dog and trying to kill her kid, all of which have no further mention or consequence.suddenly she's back at work and back to being the perfect lovely calm person and mother, kid has his birthday, the end. Its kind of a sweet ending to see her pain is managed after she faces her husbands death, again having lost someone I relate to the grief, denial anger and acceptance as well as the vivid nightmares and day hallucinations fro. Grief so this was quite believable but the whole film seemed to be missing something and felt so cliché. They should have gone full horror which would have worked, or marketed this as a drama/psychological thriller to avoid being so misleading. Watch it, but keep an open mind and don't expect too much."

","*May contain minor spoilers if you are a picky brat who likes to complain about everything*<br/><br/>I recently watched this and enjoyed it very much. For me, there were only a couple moments that I would actually call ""scary"", but the movie was very effective in what it was meant to do. <br/><br/>They did a great job at building up the absolute frustration of the mother. If you have suffered from Insomnia, you can understand just how hard that is. Now, add on top of that a clingy child with behavioral issues, and that would just be too much. <br/><br/>The mother did a great job acting, I was very impressed. So did the child. <br/><br/>The Babadook was pretty creepy, and effective. They didn't rely on a bunch of jump scares or the face going back and forth super fast deal that too many movies have these days. There were some typical things about it, but they added some new elements to it that I enjoyed. The ""creature"" combined with the book was pretty cool... <br/><br/>I have seen this compared to the movie: The Canal. <br/><br/>I have seen both, but they are VERY different movies IMO. I enjoyed both movies, but got a totally different vibe from each. <br/><br/>I could feel the Mother's frustration in this movie, but also her love for her child, how lonely she was, etc. That was done extremely well. <br/><br/>So, I give this an 8/10. I was excited to see it when I saw the trailer, and I was not let down. I was glued to my screen the whole movie.

The story is really good, you can see Jennifer Kent has a unique way to tell a story, and she is very creative. The actors were amazing, Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman had a really good connection and were lovable characters, which is a very difficult thing to find in a movie nowadays. You fear for them and you want them to just keep going. The sound design and the tone of the movie are also unique and help you distinguish this great movie from others. It might have some things that remind you of others movies, but that's normal because it still is original and gives something worth remembering. I loved the movie and I will watch it more times.

","As a Halloween treat I went to see The Babadook. I've waited a long time for the film to get here from Australia and I really enjoyed it. Not a traditional horror movie. No big shocks to make you jump and no slasher gore either. A darkly claustrophobic film with 2 brilliant central performances. <br/><br/>It's the story of a woman and her son who are terrorised by a ghoul from a bedtime book. The book is wonderfully horrible. I found it especially odd how the Babadook in the book seems to resemble the boy in some ways.<br/><br/>It triggered memories of horror films I saw in the 70s and 80s, films that left a lingering unease in the back of my mind as the lights went out at night. The electrical buzzing reminded me of the intense soundscapes from Eraserhead. The TV montages as she flicks channels increase the sense of psychological breakdown.<br/><br/>Spoiler alert: the whole nightmarish situation is very clearly the mother's anger at her child who she blames for the death of his father. Her mental anguish fuels the whole psychodrama.<br/><br/>I don't think everyone in the theatre felt the same as me. If you go expecting a traditional horror film you could be disappointed. If you are open to a dark, psychological drama with nightmarish overtones then you might feel like I did."

","The Babadook is not a scary movie as movies like Annabelle aspire to be, because it never relies on jump scares to put a fear in you. Instead it works a build up through its emphasis on psychological terror as the story becomes clear and one becomes aware or thinks he is of what horror lies in the future. The characters are etched beautifully giving them a depth and humanity, something that is so rare in horror genre. And it is because of the brilliance of the director that we come to empathise with each of the characters, no matter how monstrous their actions may seem. Having compared it to movies like Annabelle, I think it would be unjust on my part to say that it does not derive from them. But the things that it derives add to its brilliance. Annabelle is a supernatural horror movie with supernatural being physically tangible. The element is concrete. The audience knows it is there. It exists. And this adds to the terror, to know that there are creatures of darkness, literally. But Babadook does the exact opposite. It makes a real life monster through its strong metaphors and tells it with the surrealism that is so beautifully done by the director that by the time we are done with the movie, we know that Babadook does not exist literally but metaphorically. And therein lies the terror and optimism of Babadook. Few may get turned off by the ending, but it worked for me and I am giving it an extra one mark for wrapping up the story so beautifully."

This has transcended the realm of horror and into a thought provoking drama. This can be looked at as a horror movie, sure. But, it is a dark look at the human psyche, paranoia, childish tendencies, and most prominent of all, Depression. I think the part I love about this movie the most is that it uses real scares there isn't a single jump scar. Trust me I have seen the movie 5 times.

","I can easily understand how this film might seem a disappointment for anyone seeking out a monster flick, as the title ""monster"" does not receive a great deal of screen time. If one expects buckets of blood or a high body count from your horror, again this is not your film. But for those who enjoy a little substance with their scare, you could do far worse than The Babadook. The fear in this film is pervading and intimately tied to the human experience in all its unpredictable subjectivity, and despite the backdrop of children's fantasy, much more real than the scares usually meted our in the horror genre. Unfortunately, the reveal is held out a little too long, and the audience gets to the punch before the film throws it, so long as you're not waiting for a literal axe to fall.

It delves deep into psychological trauma and the grief that can be led on by the death of a loved one.<br/><br/>Let me start off by saying this movie was, fantastic. It isn't often you see a horror movie that isn't just relatable to certain people, but to the human race as a collective. At one point or another everyone has a feeling of guilt, repression or grief etc. It is also one of the very few horror movies that isn't rife with ridiculous clichés. Maybe one or two but you can't avoid them all.<br/><br/>What makes this movie scary? Most, or pretty much ALL horror movies these day rely on jump scares or gore to frighten the viewers. This movie has none of that. They rely on special effects and CGI to make the monster look scary, because they focus too much on that, they lose whats really important. At first sight this is a monster movie, but when you get further into the story you realize that it isn't hat you first though. The Babadook isn't just some monster. Monster movies don't scare, because the people watching them know they're not real. But the Babadook IS real. It's about a persons shadow self taking over your conscience mind. The shadow self is a persons negative feelings, all their fears and regrets that is put into your unconscious and out of mind. The Babadook isn't just some random monster. It is real. and it exists in all of us.<br/><br/>Even William Friedkin director of the Exorcist, which I would consider the scariest movie of all time, said ""Iv'e never seen a more terrifying film than 'The Babadook'"" coming from a man who knows what makes a good horror film. He knows that what is scary about this movie isn't just whats on the surface. It's what lies within. Grab a pen and notepad Hollywood, because THIS, is how you make a horror film.<br/><br/>8.6/10"

The movie kinda reminds me of The Shining, with the kid being Danny and the mother being a mixture of Jack and Wendy. Speaking of the kid, he is really annoying throughout the film. Overall, the film is not scary AT ALL, it's kinda bland and it's not anything worth watching again"

","People are generally pretty dumb. When the average person watches a movie, they want to laugh, see explosions, be scared or feel closer to their loved ones. This is a movie for the High Tension, Se7en, A Clockwork Orange, Anti-Christ, Taxi Driver, Requiem for a Dream, Blue Velvet and The Silence of the Lambs crowd. One of its biggest problems is that people think it's a horror movie, it's not. It's a psychological thriller. People see the boogie man and think that's all that it is...it isn't. Although, I do dig the Man in the Beaver Hat.<br/><br/>The synopsis is pretty basic, a single (widowed) woman has a bratty kid that she can't deal with. One night, she reads him a bedtime story that begins to haunt them. They have to deal with it. The End.<br/><br/>Anybody who gave a negative review of this movie, saw that film which I just described but this is not Saw or Friday the 13th. This movie is way more thought out than that. Most people simply don't want to think that hard...but I do, which is why I am writing this review.<br/><br/>If you were hoping for a scary movie with jump scares and gore, there are literally thousands of them. Although this movie has a little of that, this isn't one of them. For the record, I love a lot of those movies too but I also like movies that are smart. This movie is smart. If you don't get it, you're either too dumb or you lacked the attention span to care. I have talked to several people who didn't like this movie and they all thought (as did many reviewers) that it was some ""boogie man"" flick and they all seemed to tune out at the halfway point. That's when you really need to pay attention to this movie. If you watched the whole thing and paid attention to it and you still didn't get it, well, I am sorry but you're an idiot. I mean, they kind of spell it out for you, you were just too dead set on the Michael Meyers in the shadows to realize it.<br/><br/>I believe in being honest with people and I stand by my statement, regardless of the backlashes or negativity my comments might create. I grow tired of catering to morons. If you haven't felt offended yet, then, this movie may just be for you. Honestly, it was harder to watch the second time around for me because I knew what the outcome was going to be.<br/><br/>I don't want to spoil the movie but if you watch it, remember to think for yourself and pay attention when the book shows up on the doorstep. Just remember...<br/><br/>""Whether in a word or in a look, you can't get rid of The Babadook..."""
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","4","7","19 June 2017"," The horror of ""The Babadook"" comes from a different place than it appears
","Horror – especially demons and monsters – as metaphor for psychological trauma isn't a novel idea by any stretch, but Jennifer Kent's ""The Babadook"" is a particularly riveting execution of this concept. Combining modern horror archetypes (e.g. the supernatural, possession, creepy children's things) with emotional family drama, ""The Babadook"" powerfully taps into fears both imagined and painfully real.<br/><br/>""The Babadook"" gets under the skin by anchoring its story in the relationship of a single mother, Amelia (Essie Davis), and her son, Samuel (Noah Wiseman), whose behavioral challenges are a source of great anxiety for both of them. Samuel is 6 years old and always talking of monsters, building weapons and requiring a lot of his mother's attention. His school wants to pull him out of his class to address his behavior. As a result, Amelia barely sleeps, and compounding matters is that she's still wrestling with the loss of her husband, who died rushing her to the hospital for Samuel to be born.<br/><br/>After 20 minutes of solidly establishing the relatable woes of parenthood and how easily misunderstood children are, Samuel pulls an unusual bedtime story off his bookshelf about a boogeyman-type figure named the Babadook who comes to scare children. This only aggravates their sleeping problems, of course, but eventually the book's warnings start to take an eerily real turn.<br/><br/>What makes ""The Babadook"" stand out from similar contemporary boogeyman/supernatural horror films is that the child isn't affected nearly as much as the mother. The focal point of the story gradually shifts to Amelia, to the point that we are just as terrified of what she might do as the stress and lack of sleep continues to compound as we are with the Babadook. This shift really takes hold when a new version of the book appears on Amelia's doorstep after she had torn up the pages, this time featuring disturbing new illustrations. <br/><br/>Kent does excellent work behind the camera with D.P. Radek Ladczuk using a myriad of techniques including the incorporation of shadow and quick cuts between effectively posed shots to keep the suspense flowing in virtually every scene. The synergy between Kent and Davis is extremely evident as well, and Davis really drives home the roller coaster of emotions (and sanity) her character endures. It's one of the best horror performances in a film of this contemporary style. (She's also strangely reminiscent of Kirsten Dunst, but that's merely an observation.)<br/><br/>The connection between the supernatural elements of the Babadook and the ways it represents a manifestation of Amerlia's personal trauma and feelings is kept just tenuous and mysterious enough to work. If the Babadook weren't connected to her psychology at all, the film would feel like any other horror movie; if it were merely in her mind, we would have no reason to be kept in suspense. The balance and relationship between the two – Babadook as a real children's monster and as one's personal demons – keeps the film compelling and ultimately renders it a success.<br/><br/>Needless to say, the juicier, more interesting side of that balance is the psychological side. The way the events of the film push mother and child toward a much-needed reckoning gives the movie its savvy and poetic sensibilities. Maybe ""The Babadook"" isn't as scary or thrilling or bloody (definitely no payoff in that regard) as its contemporaries (I'd argue it is, though I'm admittedly not a horror junkie), but the dread it induces from its non-supernatural elements is another kind of terror altogether.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","Just an outstanding movie! I don't really know from where to start. Awesome acting, frightening story, frightening scenes, eerie, plot twisting, announced but unexpected ending, some quite touching drama characteristics, sad storyline, family problems. To put it this way, and amazing mixture of real life struggle with a fictional, scary content.<br/><br/>Story is a bit worn our, single mother, boy with special abilities... but trust me, this movie has something special in it. Boy is, by the way, just an amazing character, so smart and innovative, protective, brave... Just amazing . His mother is too. Movie contains a calm a slow beginning, just as wanted in a horror. It has consistent turn for the worse. And yet, it has unexpected turns. It has twists, but fluid story at the same time. Mind games, scary, horrorlike content (voices, dark spots, death scenes, MONSTER)... everything a solid horror needs to have.<br/><br/>And the name... I feel in love with it and couldn't stop saying it. Baba-ba dook, doook, doook. My new name for boogieman.<br/><br/>Definitely a movie worth watching and if there wasn't few mistakes, it would got a 10 from me. It gave me chills down the spine. And any movie that can make me, even for a second, to be afraid of dark, will make into my favorites."

It's a fairly low budget film so don't expect Hollywood dressings. <br/><br/>However this film struck me in that it cleverly intertwines several quite complex ideas around a very creepy character...the Babadook.<br/><br/>At the end you will not be disappointed with what this film has to offer!

"joshtrew","9","4","7","18 April 2017"," An extremely chilling film that shook me to the bone
","I love this film, mainly because of how i relate to the film and how much it terrified me. I saw a lot of myself in the child; I feel that I was like the child in this film. I would set traps for a monster I was convinced existed yet never did. However here it does and it's terrifying. Between this film and The Conjuring I am never owning a house with a basement.<br/><br/>This film uses excellent cinematography and sound design to make even the most humble and mundane shots seem terrifying. The constant shrieking of the main boy may annoy some people, or it may add to your level of terror. Either way it really got under my skin in the best way possible.<br/><br/>Essie Davis leads this film extremely well, while she does seem to freak out a bit too much in the first act, the rest of the film she is a captivating and terrifying character when she needs to be. She plays the grieving mother extremely well with a good sense that she is hurting and her sons bluntness and overwhelming fear of the Babadook really isn't helping.<br/><br/>The ending of the film is really the only part that bugs me. From now on there are major spoilers so be warned. The film ends with us knowing that they are basically caring for the Babadook in the basement. While this subverts expectations and pays off the extended metaphor that the Babadook is their grief, it left me feeling that the main conflict of the film still wasn't solved. The film is also inconsistent about when Amelia (the mother) can and can't see the Babadook, lessening the effects of some scenes.<br/><br/>Other than that, the film did an amazing job at terrifying me, and I feel that it showed the right amount of the Babadook. A lot of people disagree but I feel that the good looks we get in the second act really help to imagine what the beast would look like when it came to the climactic showdown between the family and the Babadook.<br/><br/>Overall, masterfully writing and directing, phenomenal sound editing and design along with beautiful cinematography lead me to give this film a 9/10. A better ending would have helped me love the film more but as it stands it's a terrifying horror film that I highly recommend checking out. It's out on DVD and Blu Ray, as well as on the UK Netflix and iTunes, and probably other streaming services."
"ahimme","9","4","7","27 March 2017"," You can't get rid of ""The Babadook"".
","With a name like ""The Babadook"", this film is expected to be a story about an urban legend becoming reality. However, what Jennifer Kent presents is far more than an ordinary, creepy tale. What ""The Babadook"" depicts is the projection of the distressed human mind, of inner fears and despair. These feelings are manifested through a struggling single mother, Amelia, and her six-year-old child, Samuel, who just so happens to be obsessed with learning of his deceased father. His inquisitions become an ongoing burden for the mother, who has never overcome the death of her husband. What we witness is a very realistic scenario of a mother trying to cope with a troublesome child and a young boy trying to grow up with the absence of a father. Both characters find solace in their nightly bedtime stories, until one particular book obstructs their ritual. <br/><br/>Kent's tale of a monster that preys on your biggest vulnerabilities goes beyond anything we witness in nightmares. If you've ever experienced sleep paralysis, you will surely identify with Amelia. The monster that haunts her son also torments her, leaving her unable to sleep because closing her eyes means entering a world of constant agony, causing her to be paralyzed by fear. Kent manages to place you in the home of these two characters, making you battle with reality, fantasy, and the subconscious. <br/><br/>Through the use of color and lighting you will be transported into the land of the Babadook- a place where only dull colors exist and happiness is unheard of. Kent's continuous use of blue and green hues add to the film's feeling of melancholy and the characters' trance-like state of living. Kent also makes sure to incorporate shadows in the most disturbing of places, playing with your panic of unveiling the Babadook. <br/><br/>""The Babadook"" is labeled as a psychological horror because it truly plays with your perceptions, confronting you with the question of whether the Babadook is real or simply the fragment of an agitated woman's imagination. If you're looking for a horror film that features the typical killing- machine monster, then ""The Babadook"" is not it. However, if you understand the monsters that are capable of forming inside the human mind, you will surely accept Jennifer Kent's directorial debut as a smart, intriguing, yet horrifying film."
"niamhacostello","10","4","7","27 March 2017"," You will Never Feel Terror Quite like The Babadook (Contains Spoilers)
","The Babadook will not only slowly creep up behind you, steadily intensifying and sending chills up your spine, but it will make you wish you never opened that big red book. The Babadook was one of the most meticulous and well-made films I have seen. The Babadook will not give you cheesy and expected jump scares, instead it will crawl under your bed and you will know its there. The psychological terrors that The Babadook expertly instills into the audience establishes the feeling of true horror. Every child and parent can remember a time when they read a bedtime story, and to think one night you may pick up that large, blood colored book with the title: Mister Babadook and your life will never be the same. Amelia, Sam's mother, had two choices, to ignore the Babadook's existence, or to fight back and stand strong to protect the only family she had left. Like every mother, Amelia brushed off her seemingly disobedient son's crazed stories of this petrifying dark figure; her denial seems to add to the suspense and horror of this film. We as the audience just want to yell out, ""Stop being stupid, listen to Sam!"" The basis of this film invokes very real emotions in the audience. The dark creature embodies Amelia's fear and suffering since her husband's death; as her fear grows, the Babadook gets stronger. The Babadook manifests as Amelia's grief, epitomizing the detrimental repercussions of letting our nightmares control our lives. This sense of verisimilitude taps into the audience's true human fears. Grief is a powerful creature that lives inside each one of us. Just as Amelia tries to repress her grief and sorrow, so do we. However, this film subtly proves that living in denial of our fears is the quickest way to allow them to take over our ability to function. We must face the vicious thoughts that haunt our minds instead of surrendering to our psyche and allowing it to transform into the shape-shifting, black shadow that will take over if you allow it to. The Babadook was an intense and captivating film, showing us that not all monsters are men in masks, but that the real monster can be a figment of our imagination which we fail to control."

","If you want a movie to thrill your inner demons you have to look no further than the Babadook. This psychological horror delves into the symbolic spectrum of our innermost monsters brought to life in a transition from outer to inner demons that torment the troubled mother. Can this monster be overcome through love and the will power of the mother is the real question that thrills the viewer throughout this film. This story centers around two characters, Samuel and Amelia, a child and single mother still plagued by the loss of her husband and Samuel's father. The bleak ambient lighting combined with the dull misc-en-scene of the gray lifeless house in which most of the story takes place help the audience to sympathize with the troubled mother and express her grief burdened world. At the same time throughout the film the child's high pitched screams and reckless behavior from his overactive imagination and fear of monsters further agitates the mother's fragile state. With this atmosphere in place the monster created straight from a child's imagination is introduced through a storybook. The monster who only gets stronger the more it is denied torments the little family and the mother especially. The mother becomes through her denial of the monster the monster herself. This psychological transition is seen as her outbursts towards her son's behavior continues to grow in ferocity. This grows and the monster grows as well and allows the viewer to see the parallel and the question again becomes can she overcome that monster."

"willwoodmill","6","4","7","11 April 2016"," A flawed but scary modern horror film
","The Babadook is a 2014 horror film directed by Jennifer Kent. (It's actually the feature length debut for Kent) The Babadook tells the story of Amelia, (played by Essie Davis.) a single mother struggling to raise her constantly disobeying child, Samuel. (played by Noah Wiseman.) One day when Amelia is putting Samuel to sleep, he finds a mysterious book on the book shelf titled 'The Babadook,' and asks his mother to read to him as a bed time story. The book ends up being utterly terrifying, resulting in Amelia getting rid of it. But strange things begin to happen and Amelia slowly becomes paranoid that something is after her and Samuel.<br/><br/>The Babadook is the film that gets a lot of stuff right, and a lot of stuff wrong. But first lets focus on the positive. Probably the best thing I can say about The Babadook is that it really, really tries to impress and frighten its audience. In a day when horror movies are all generic copies of each-other with predictable and cheap scares, it's a nice treat to see one that actually takes its time setting up a mood and atmosphere, and one that never relies on overused jump-scares to try and frighten the audience. But not only does the film actually try to be original and creative with its scares. It is actually scary. The Babadook is one of the only films I can think off that actually caused me to lose sleep over how scared I was by it. The scenes involving the book are executed perfectly, and I would be amazed if anyone wasn't completely terrified of them. Another positive is that all the actors do really solid jobs in their roles, especially Esse Davis. (Though the kid is incredibly annoying throughout the first half of the film.) <br/><br/>But I think it's time we started talking about where the film messes up. For one the film is a little obvious and heavy-handed with its symbolism and message. I'm not against a horror film having either of these things, in fact I'm completely for it. But a little subtlety would be nice. If you somehow haven't heard what the film is metaphor I won't spoil it, but let's just say there's no way you're gonna miss it. Another much larger problem is the third act, it is just way, way, way too overblown. They spend the first hour with some great set-up, and than they completely blow it in the last half-hour. They shove way to much in the later part of the film and you end up with a lot of unnecessarily parts, and eventually it just feels like the film is trying to artificially stretch its length to 90 mins. I really think they could have had a much better film if they just cut 15-20 mins off it. Another major problem I have with the film is the ending, it really ham-fisted and it seems like it console tell goes against the whole idea of the film.<br/><br/>In short The Babadook has some really good stuff, and some not so good stuff. But I would still definitely recommend it. Even though it has its problems because it's so nice to see a modern horror film, actually try to be good and original, and even better to see one that's legitimately scary. <br/><br/>6.4/10"

","Every now and again we stumble across a new and innovative looking film trailer that pricks up our senses, giving us hope that there are still original ideas left in the over troped world of cinema. Trailers, which bring us that feeling which my lucky generation had during the Indie era of filmmaking. Where a story didn't fit a mold that was set years before by the cookie cutter flicks which became the standard. New concepts tackling bigger issues than man saves damsel in distress or god forbid another B.S. horror villain that will spews out the next big franchise. Many moons ago I came across one such trailer (as many on the internet did) called The Babadook (2014). ""What the hell is a Babdook?"" was an utterance heard anytime I recommended it to family or friends. ""Just watch,"" was always my reply. And with that, let's hop in the Wayback machine and check out a trailer posted many months ago: All caught up. Wonderful. Let's get into it then.<br/><br/>The Babadook, directed by first time feature writer/director Jennifer Kent, tells the story of a single mother named Amelia (played disconcertingly perfect by Essie Davis) who is coming to grips with both the death of her husband as well as the trying needs of her only son Samuel (Noah Wiseman in an unnervingly strong performance), who, after finding a strange pop-up book, believes an evil entity named The Babadook has become more than just a character from the macabre bedtime tale. After strange occurrences around her home coupled with Samuel's increasingly erratic behavior continue, Amelia begins to break. Disturbed by her Samuel's obsession with protecting her from the (possibly) imaginary being, Amelia lapses into a mental state which questions whether there is something wrong with her weapon building son or have her own limit of stress driven her over the edge of sanity."

""The Babadook"" is a STRONG film that deals with mother and child troubles-- which are common, by the way. However, in this case, their trouble is much bigger than the ordinary fights parents and children usually have; Amelia, the mother, gets completely out of mind because she notices her son is quite eccentric-- as if she wasn't either. There are a lot of scary scenes, with a plot utilizing some elements of the classic ""The Shining""-- no matter whether director confesses it or not. The scenario, also, is very dark, delivering all the Gothic atmosphere this film deserves.

Very similar to Kubrick's Shining in a number of ways.<br/><br/>Sadly, there are also far too many people who believe the Saw movie series to be the epitome of horror films. That's why there are so many people who gave bad reviews. There are no jump-scares, there's very little gore, and the characters aren't cardboard. Some of the negative reviewers rightfully hate both the primary characters, yet don't grasp that the *reason* they hate them is central to understanding...<br/><br/>SPOILER<br/><br/>The child IS a horrible little monster, who has been over-indulged by his weak, fawning mother, because she is masking her grief and resentment. The audience is MEANT to hate some of their characteristics.<br/><br/>I only found weakness towards the end of the film. Someone explains the ending as symbolism with a very art-house context within the comments section, and it makes sense through that lens. The mother & child essentially have met their psychotic issues and embraced them. However, using that lens means that the entire film really had to have been the mother's insanity - kind of like the movie Jacob's Ladder<br/><br/>The film could have been absolutely devastating if there was a bit more rationale for the Babadook being retained, and the ending scenes not quite so heavenly. There was a sense of being unfinished - if deliberate, it wasn't a good decision.

The Babadook takes an everyday concept, bedtime stories, and makes it into something we can fear, not dissimilar to what The Ring did (for me, the top modern horror).<br/><br/>Like several films of its genre, what we do not see is often more eerie than what we are shown. I felt the ending let the film down somewhat, but I know that many will disagree with that. I have read opinions of the ending and still feel that there was too much symbolism; the 'monster' concept was more successful than any readings that the conclusion prompts.<br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend watching The Babadook.

Whether it be the 1930s Universal Movie Monsters which were updates of long-told folk tales or the Slasher boom of the 1970s and 1980s with their commentary on the fallibility of our own parents, a good horror movie has always been one which knows how to push our buttons and is not afraid to, well, scare us. Unfortunately, many horror movies over the last couple of decades have taken the superficial route of quiet-loud dynamics and/or excessive gore to get byand oh how boring it is. However, Writer/Director Jennifer Kent has delivered something which, although not a ""classic"", nevertheless takes the horror back to the disturbing territory where it thrives.<br/><br/>Amelia (Essie Davis) is a single mother struggling to cope. She is still finding it difficult to deal with the violent death of her husband several years before and her young son Samuel (Noah Wiseman) is terrified by a monster which he believes is haunting him. At first Amelia dismisses his claims as a particularly disruptive form of childish imagination but when a creepy book is delivered which tells the story of Mr. Babadook, she begins to suspect that a sinister presence is indeed nearby.<br/><br/>The film then shows Amelia as she slowly unravels and succumbs to the monsters malevolence, in the process becoming a threat to both herself and Samuel. Upto this point the movie has crafted a bleak and empty atmosphere illustrative of the emotional landscape of a woman at the end of her tether. However, from this point on the movie shifts into brutal and horrifying territory. Now, don't get me wrongeven at its most terrifying moments, the film never once resorts to the cheap scare-tactics so overemployed by contemporary horrors. Instead, the scares build on the actions of the characters which have been meticulously built on the carefully constructed atmosphere.<br/><br/>By the end I felt exhausted from the ordeal of watching someone purge (literally) the corrosive effects of grief to rediscover the fundamental values of their existence. Heavy stuff, and certainly an emotional weight not something usually ascribed to the horror genre. Which is the real tragedyas this kind of emotional raw-nerve is precisely the ground horror was built to explore.<br/><br/>In some ways it reminded me of Andrzej Zulawski's 'Possession' (1981) in that, while still a horror, it is more art-house than grind-house. For this reason the film may confuse or alienate some. However, if you have a real regard for the potential of the genre then it is well worth a watch."
"Billy_Crash","8","4","7","13 May 2015"," There's Depth in Horror...
","If you live under a rock and haven't heard, THE BABADOOK (Australia, 2014) is supposed to be the greatest horror in the past ten years. Even THE EXORCIST's William Friedkin said it's ""the most frightening movie I've ever seen."" Coming from the director of what many consider to be the scariest movie of all time, that's saying something. Still, I was skeptical; though my intrigue was peaked just enough to order first time feature director Jennifer Kent's film.<br/><br/>If you didn't know, a successful crowdfunding campaign earned Kent a little over $34,000, which apparently went to the art department. Beforehand, the Australian acted in several projects, and directed two shorts and a television episode. I have not seen her previous work, but after watching THE BABADOOK, I know there are many features in her future.<br/><br/>THE BABADOOK stars Essie Davis (Amelia) as a struggling single mother with a rambunctious and creepy son, played by Noah Wiseman (Samuel). Davis is absolutely phenomenal, whether she's sheepish, scared, or on the psycho-mom warpath. Wiseman is equally fantastic as he goes from a socially inept persona to a kid on a mission. In fact, regardless of the role, every actor delivered. It's clear they all had the required skills, but Kent definitely got them to bring their collective best to every take.<br/><br/>To close out the trinity, cinematographer Radek Ladczuk brings a remarkable balance of light and dark, along with some interesting camera angles, to create a foreboding atmosphere that never wanes. Thanks to this big three of directing, acting, and photography, each scene is loaded with top-flight layers to keep us focused on the screen, and ready to march forward with each character and whatever situation awaits them.<br/><br/>Most of the action takes place in Amelia's home as she and her son face the uncanny in the guise of Babadook. Sure, the name sounds silly, but it's an anagram for ""a bad book"", and Babadook does not play. The most interesting element of the narrative is how the whacked out child and semi-stable mom change mental roles as the film progresses. Mom may not be able to handle the uncanny, but Samuel steps up as if he's waited his whole young life to prove himself – and this is his coming of age moment.<br/><br/>As we all know, movies work or don't work depending upon what we bring to the film. Sure, many scoff or outright dismiss THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and PARANORMAL ACTIVITY for several reasons, but both movies worked for me (especially PA) because they both played on my childhood fears and nightmares. THE BABADOOK may work on those who have young children. When they fear for Samuel, they actually fear what might happen to their child. And as parents, they probably fear holding onto themselves in the face of ""the other"", much as Amelia does. If so, one can understand all the over-hype and five star ratings. Yes, I felt a couple of little jolts, but nothing substantial, and I never really feared for the characters or my own sanity. After all, at this level, what would really happen to a child in a major independent film?<br/><br/>Although I have a couple of questions regarding the end of the tale, and although fear didn't sweep me away, the overall execution is enough to warrant 3.5 if not 4 stars. I lean towards the latter because of Kent, Davis, Wiseman, Ladczuk, and even Jed Kurzel's music, which tied in seamlessly with the story. Overall, THE BABADOOK is a great dramatic horror, but nothing to keep you awake at night. <br/><br/>More horror at www.crashpalaceproductions.com"
"alexjacome1997","8","4","7","29 April 2015"," A great piece of psychological, supernatural, and creature horror.
","This was a phenomenal piece of horror. This movie recaptures what made horror movies great in the past. This film took everything that the horror industry has ignored and runs with it. Likable characters, great acting, and hardly any jump scares. Its all in the subtleties. The atmosphere is astonishingly uncomfortable and eerie. The uncanny nature of all the actors is palatable. The movie isn't perfect however. The kids performance was less than stellar even for kid performances. The lower budget is obvious when sound effects abruptly cut off indicating that they were put in later. The sound the Babadook makes in the trailer is cut off because if you heard the sound in the movie, the sound clip cuts off before the end of the 'k' sound. A few times the sound of banging doesn't echo and just plays and ends. The camera work was odd. Several times the mom lays under her covers and then the sun rises. Not bad, just weird. The ending really disappointed me. I won't spoil it here, but its not fitting. Other than that, its quite excellent. Its on Netflix, so give it a look!"
"gavinwoolman","10","4","7","28 April 2015"," Flipping brilliant
","This movie is brilliant. <br/><br/>It's unnerving - it gets under your skin in the best way. It's not about jump scares, or stupid little cheap loud bangs. I sat there thinking ""I'm OK, this is fine, I'm not scared"" only to realize at the next scary scene that my soul was trembling. It's the kind of scary that the shining, the blair witch project, and (I think) games like 'Amnesia' achieve. <br/><br/>If you only watch horror movies for the jump scares - then you won't enjoy this. Go watch random loud noises or something. But if you find horror films that make you feel as if ants are crawling over your skin, as if your bones are being shaken from within, then you'll enjoy this."
"quanticprophecy","9","4","7","23 April 2015"," Simply put the best horror film i've seen in years
","Reviewing a horror film without spoiling it is next to impossible. So please just go and watch this film as blind as possible so you ca enjoy everything it has to offer. So very LIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD.<br/><br/>Seriously i have nothing bad to say about this film so here we go with the good. The performances are incredible. Not only from the mother(seriously this is Oscar nomination worthy) but also from her son who couldn't be more than 10 years old. No jump scares is also a godsend in this day in age.<br/><br/>But really the 2 best things about this film are it's unrelenting tension and incredible horror gimmick. Like most of my favourite horror gimmicks(how death works in Final Destination, the 8mm films in Sinister or the VHS in The Ring) this will captivate you and terrify you in equal measure. All i will say is that it's a book.<br/><br/>But really it's all about the tension. The second the book is introduced the movie grabs your balls and doesn't let go. You will fear every sound and everything you see or don't see and really it's a feeling that can only be experienced and not explained.<br/><br/>It also is a thinking man's horror film. It probably won't stop you from sleeping but it will definitely make you think and wonder about what just happened in the past 1h30. It's very clear but also open to interpretation which is a very hard thing to do especially in horror films.<br/><br/>So if you like to allow your body to contort in your couch in fear then turn off the lights, pump up the sound and enjoy a truly well crafted piece of horror.<br/><br/>This has been a green review"
"moonlitsky-64015","9","4","7","21 April 2015"," no jump scares, but definitely liked
","First, I would like to say that those giving this movie a low rating, like a one, have a didn't appreciation for horror movies than I do. This movie doesn't have scares, in my opinion, and it's completely okay without it. Sometimes, horror movies are about the tale itself. If you were to read a story about the bogey man as Ann adult, would you be scared? No. You'll have doubts of his existence. However, that doesn't mean the story isn't horrifying! That's how this movie is. It's actually interesting, because the characters aren't all over the place. The mother reacts like most people would while in denial. The kid made me want to hit him in the beginning, and I felt bad for the mother. I won't go into the details about it, because you should see it for yourself."
"jordantdowney","10","4","7","19 April 2015"," A Masterful depiction of true emotional horror
","Never before have I ever felt such a powerful urge to review a movie.<br/><br/>The Babadook puts you in the shoes of Amelia, a single mother raising a seemingly troubled child. They are then haunted by this sinister presence known as the Babadook, which early in the story manifests itself as a children's horror story. But oh, it is so much more.<br/><br/>This film was cursed with a marketing team who pushed it to be a monster movie, which is unfortunately unsurprising in today's day of lazy, Hollywood jump-scare horror. Let me first begin by stating that I have never once considered myself to be a fan of the horror genre, probably thanks to the crap we are typically served and pay big bucks to see every year.<br/><br/>I thought this film was phenomenal. The pacing is perfect, with a slow but cumulating eeriness that makes you impressively uncomfortable. The characters are also so well fleshed-out and believable that even though I desperately wanted to stop watching by the final third of the run time, I was so invested that I just HAD to know if Amelia and her son would end up OK. The sound effects are very well timed, not overused, and will chill you to the bone. Trust me when I say that if you endure through this unnerving experience, you will be rewarded.<br/><br/>This film is a dark, disturbing, & masterful portrayal of deep depression and grief. It got under my skin in all the right ways, climaxing in what is probably the most emotional any film has ever made me. If you or anyone you love has ever dealt with depression, you most certainly will cry. And you will like it. <br/><br/>10/10. A wonderful debut film by Jennifer Kent. Im sure I will be unraveling this one for weeks."
"flipperdipper","8","4","7","14 April 2015"," It was good ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
","This movie really shocked me on how good it was (Not the best movie, but better then i expected). Honestly I expected it to be a steaming pile of crap, but in the end it turned out great. The acting was really good (Except the child actor smiled at times he clearly wasn't supposed to). The writing for the mother was absolutely fantastic and I think that the actress help as well. And the directing was awesome too, though the part where the creature is crawling on the ceiling was kind-of silly. <br/><br/>The monster didn't really scare me that much, whenever it was on screen it looked kind of silly (The name babadook doesn't really help it.) Honestly when I saw the dog I instantly thought it going to die... And it did. So some of the things were pretty predictable and the practical effects on the monster were pretty cheesy. <br/><br/>Over all this film is defiantly worth seeing if you like the slow decent into insanity from a character (like I do)."
"c_cross-47287","7","7","15","1 April 2015"," The Babadook review
","The Babadook is considered such a smart film by critics for many reasons. One of the main ones being that it is so different. It stands out from other films by not having simple jump scares, instead it elongates the scaring process which creates dread and suspense for the audience. This aspect makes it stand out because it is not as predictable as typical Hollywood horror films can be. The film really taps into the audience's emotions through the psychological instability of the main character, Amelia, and her issues with her son. It is clear that many viewers would be able to connect with the tragic circumstances she had to face, rather than the idea of experiencing a supernatural being. Either way the film allows viewers to make their own interpretations as to what the Babadook really is. Throughout the film Amelia is seen struggling with the mystery of what the Babadook is and what it will do to her family. From the very beginning of the film she is portrayed as someone who is soft spoken but emotionally and psychologically strong. As the story goes on the audience sees her transform as her fears crack through her tough exterior and her sanity begins to be questioned. As time went on she began to represent the idea of Scopophilia. A warning from the Babadook was ""Once you look underneath you'd wish you were dead."" That idea alone implanted the fear of looking inside her. That fear is easily translated to the audience, which makes the viewer curious but fearful at the same time. In essence this makes the film one you don't want to look away from. Though it was not very scary as a whole, it was well made and different from the typical horror film. Definitely worth watching."
"s3276169","10","7","15","4 January 2015"," A metaphor for ones inner demons
","DEPENDING ON WHETHER YOU AGREE WITH MY INTERPRETATION COULD BE SAID TO CONTAIN SPOILERS. <br/><br/>Without giving too much away the main theme of this movie is not an imaginary monster come to life. The true theme of this film is traumatic loss, how we cope or fail to cope with it and how, if possible, we somehow reconcile our inner demons. <br/><br/>Its clear from the outset that the main character has, in fact, tragically and irrecoverably failed to deal with her personal demons. If you pay close attention I do not think this can in any way be denied. <br/><br/>The final scene really spells out what has happened. Like the young boys magic tricks its hardly real. Its the conjuring of a fevered mind wanting to wash away the awful reality of what it has done and replace it with a beautiful, if illogical, fantasy. <br/><br/>There is a secondary theme here too about the manner in which family, employers and authorities treat those who are under extreme pressure as a result of loss. Its damning assessment too, one that speaks stridently and honestly of indifference and selfishness. <br/><br/>There are no happy endings in the Babadook. Its a hard, sad watch but also very compelling and emotional. There is a positive message too for those willing to listen. Don't ignore others suffering, don't turn your back, expect better from yourself personally, from those around you and your government. A timely message in an age where people seem to care less and less about one another. <br/><br/>What more can I say. Yet another superb Australian film that employs an exceptional cast and is masterfully directed. Ten out of ten from me."
"rprince-832-6294","8","7","15","26 November 2014"," Soooooo creepy and really uncomfortable.
","-The Babadook follows ""a single mother, plagued by the violent death of her husband, (who) battles with her son's fear of a monster lurking in the house, but soon discovers a sinister presence all around her."" (IMDb's description) It is a scary suspense film that would probably be classified as a horror film when put into a broad category. Don't care for scary films? That's okay you don't have to read the review then! -Easily the scariest movie of the year. I mean oh my gosh was that creepy! -The story itself is somewhat cliché, but when it combines effective elements from films like The Shining or Paranormal Activity, it is pulled off quite well actually! -The pace is good. It's got an incredibly unnerving tone to the entire film. Again in a cliché style, it's really dark and uncomfortable. And creepy. Sooooo creepy.<br/><br/>-The acting is convincing. Especially the kid.<br/><br/>-The music is really creepy. I have to give major props to the sound editing too! If the sound had not been good, the film would not have been as good.<br/><br/>-The scares themselves were great! I love a film that doesn't use jumpscares! There were scares for sure! But most were suspenseful, of thematically terrifying! You don't really even see the Babadook that much, but he's got to be one of the most intimidating presences I've seen in a film. Also I was going to rag on it for only having scares at night, but then it showed up in the day and I died! -Content: I have no idea what the film is rated actually. There is some brief violence, a suggestive scene, and some brief language. Mostly it's just uncomfortable to watch. It's either a heavy PG-13 of a light R. Either way I wouldn't recommend if for anyone young.<br/><br/>-So The Babadook takes some horror clichés, blended with good acting and great sound to make my favorite horror film of the year! (And the only one I saw this year) It's really uncomfortable, so I am only going to give it a 7/10, but The Babadook is worth watching on Netflix/Redbox when it comes out! (If you like scary films)"

WTF!"
"robsta23","7","8","18","14 March 2015"," I'm Not a Fan of the Horror Genre, This One is Worth It
","I've always found the horror genre uninteresting since many films within the genre seem so similar and because their sole purpose is give the audience a thrill rather than convey a good story (I guess you can make a similar argument for comedy). This being the first horror movie I have seen in a while, I have to say I am glad to see it. It's good, but still doesn't live up to the hype I heard from a few different people.<br/><br/>The Babadook is scary in regard to suspense rather than by moments meant to startle, which I find predictable and boring. My heart would race as I saw part, but not all, of the titular Babadook, waiting and bracing myself to see what is ""underneath."" I highly prefer this type of thrill to the ""startling"" horror movie. What makes it even better is it was able to do this with an independent budget - well done Jennifer Kent.<br/><br/>My favorite sequence, and the sequence I was most frightened by, is when the book Mr. Babadook reappears and is put back together with new text, threatening the woman and her child. In fact, it was the most disturbing, yet simple, moment I have experienced in horror films in a long time.<br/><br/>However, I don't give most horror movies a chance, and there are aspects within the Babadook that convey why I pass on watching horror movies. First, the kid is super annoying. The point of the character is for him to be annoying/a burden to his mother, but his acting is terrible. I don't care if he's a kid; actors are meant to convey distinct character, and this kid just whined no matter what emotion/mood he was meant to convey in the moment.<br/><br/>Also, towards the conclusion, the mother finds out this creature is a spirit, and just happens to know that if she can get this spirit in the basement she can tame it like a pet. Where did this knowledge/success come from?<br/><br/>I really liked the theme of trust in this movie - the kid struggles with whether he should trust his mother or not since she is clearly possessed by the Babadook from time to time. It is satisfying to see the woman and her son in a once again happy relationship, but this movie seems formulaic to the horror genre at times."

Skillfully shot by Radek Ladczuk with a palette of black, greys and desaturated blue/greens giving the film a funereal, gaunt look with unsettling framing of 'something' just lurking within and a nerve jangling sound design by Frank Lipson.

","Moves in alongside Audition, Devil's Backbone, Drag Me To Hell, Behind the Mask, Let the Right One In, Scream, Sinister, Pontypool, and The Decent as one of my top ten favorite horror flicks of the last two decades(just ahead of Drag Me To Hell #10 and Sinister at #9). There's been some others of late come close like I Saw the Devil, Maniac, Citadel, and a few others, but this is the kind of horror film that comes around once every couple of years if you're lucky.<br/><br/>When looking at the best over the last 5-10 years - the Aussies rule! I'm starting to watch more and more Aussie horror flicks lately because the ratio of good horror flicks versus bad one's from the Aussie's is strides better than what you'll find coming out of Hollywood ""Babadook"" has everything you want from a horror film. It's genuinely frightening, visually dazzling, and thought-provoking. The lead, Essie Davis, is absolutely fantastic. She definitely drives this film with a truly amazing performance, and the young Noah Wiseman is also great.<br/><br/>THe film doesn't rush, but it also doesn't drag. It builds to a Poltergeist like crescendo, and pins the viewer against their seat, clutching the armrest, and grinding their teeth.<br/><br/>Highly recommend this one! 84/100... will likely hold onto a top 10-15 spot come years end(which will likely be out of about 100 films, or at least that's about what I average per year), and that's high, recently rare praise for ANY horror flick. Not bad for a film I hadn't even heard of. Shame on Hollywood for spoon-feeding us all that crap this past Halloween when stuff like this should have been all the rage at your local theater. And 6.9? Really? I imagine this score will slowly rise to the 7.5 range, and even that seems a tad low IMO. Hope it helps. See it whether or not you're a fan of the genre."
"eonbluedan-1","8","9","21","28 November 2014"," Not perfect but certainly refreshing
","We had the usual slew this year of Halloween fodder; from the people who brought us 'Insidious' and 'Paranormal Activity' came....more of the same. It's not that all these movies are necessarily bad, although to call 'The Conjuring' prequel 'Annaebelle' anything more might be a push, but the stories are generally paint-by-numbers, the abused jump-scare technique becomes tired fast, and in the case of 'Ouija', it could be fairly argued that watching paint dry might be more interesting. Part of this Autumn parade, and sadly overshadowed by every other film, was the Australian release 'The Babadook', starring the generally unfamiliar Essie Davies and the disturbingly in-tune 6-year-old Noah Wiseman.<br/><br/>'The Babadook' is, for the most part, an intense two-hander, telling the story of Amelia, in a suspended state of grief after the loss of her husband years earlier, struggling to balance her work and the upbringing of her son Samuel; Davies and Wiseman play parent and child respectively. Samuel is difficult at the best of times; despite an abundance of affection for his mother, he exhibits a lack of obedience and apparently attention-seeking behaviour, which ranges from performing magic tricks to exasperating temper tantrums to efforts that are potentially lethal! Accompanying this is his growing obsession with protecting himself from the monsters that stalk him in his room and at school. One night little Samuel chooses a new bedtime story from the bookshelf, the mysterious, wonderfully designed, over-sized pop-up called 'The Babadook'. With only mild concern as to where this book actually came from, Ameliea begins to read. It is not long before the book is closed, the nightmarish thing left unfinished, but it is too late; Samuel is terrified of the man who will apparently come to get him, the man who they will not be able to get rid of. Other reviews may reveal more, but that is as much setup as I think one needs.<br/><br/>Performances from both main parties are nothing short of phenomenal, with Davies in particular immediately touting an Oscar nomination with her range and ability to go to some uncomfortable places; her intensity brings to mind the forgotten Naomi Watts performance in 'Mulholland Drive'. No expense is spared on classic set and sound design, everything catering to the immersion and ever more startling and bleak tone. The movie is shot with a true artist's eye and edited with clear care; you can really see Kent's adoration of truly classic horror in silent cinema. On the downside, there is a moment that goes into territory that wouldn't be at all out of place in a David Lynch film, which can be said to be one metaphor too far, and speaking personally, a couple more intensely frightening moments with Mr Babadook himself would not have been pushing it too hard. That said, it is to Kent's credit that she eschews most conventions, and dresses those which might normally threaten to be trite in narrative importance rather than simply using them as shock fodder.<br/><br/>The big question about any film adorned with such praise as this one is obviously, is it frightening? My answer to that is no, I did not find the film scary in the sense of being kept up at night. That is, however, only my response and says little about how much another person might react, or indeed about how much I actually enjoyed the film, which is another matter entirely. It is also not a question any one person will answer the same way; horror in cinema is a broad spectrum and whether one even classes 'The Babadook' as a horror depends on one's understanding of, and exposure to, the whole spectrum of the genre. If when you think horror, it is only the recent entourage of James Wan-style gore-fests and jump-scare fuelled ghost stories that come to mind, 'The Babadook' is liable to disappoint you, given its marketing. If, on the other hand, you see that horror can address psychological terror, that a story can ring terrifyingly true on an internal, emotional level, and you can cite 'Let The Right One In', and perhaps more pertinently in this case, 'We Need To Talk About Kevin', Stephen King's 'The Shining' and Polanski's 'Repulsion' as works that scare, then get ready for what you might consider the most refreshing piece of horror for a long time! After all, what was the last horror film you saw all about ""the power of love"". This is how writer/director Jennifer Kent explained the story to the young Wiseman, and she was being absolutely sincere.<br/><br/>Going by this evidence, I don't doubt that Kent will one day make a masterpiece; this is, after all, one of the strongest directorial debuts I have seen, and whilst 'The Babadook' is perhaps not the film we were promised by the posters, it is nevertheless a surprisingly multi-faceted, emotionally affecting, gorgeous slice of dark imagination, which sincerely addresses a most real and important issue."
"stickbob123","10","10","24","27 November 2014"," Don't Let It In!!
","In my opinion, horror films have taken a serious dive in quality in the last couple of decades. And the ones that are good don't do much to forward the genre, they simply imitate films of the 70s very well (i.e., ""The Conjuring""--which, don't get me wrong, I love, but I'm just saying the style isn't original at all). ""The Babadook"" is different. Essie Davis plays Amelia, a woman struggling with the absence of her husband, who was killed in a car accident. Now she's left alone to raise her troubled son, Samuel. When Samuel finds an ominous children's book titled ""Mr. Babadook,"" they begin to be stalked by a supernatural force. Not exactly a hugely original concept, but the terror it delivers feels totally fresh and Essie Davis' performance is Oscar worthy--her character is whipped back and forth from grief, anger, insanity, hopelessness and it's terrifying to watch. Noah Wiseman also does a very good job of playing her son, which is an equally challenging role, especially for a boy so young. <br/><br/>For me, most of the best horror films take something that is found commonly scary--like isolation, death, or loss of sanity--and it portrays it in an uncommon way. And that is what the Babadook does. He's this terrifying, supernatural force that represents so much to both Amelia and Samuel and he's made visible to them, taking the fears they hold in the back of their minds and putting them in front of both of them in an aggressive, physical form. There's plenty of symbolism throughout the movie, but it's pretty hard to think about while watching it since you'll be too busy being scared out of your wits. If you're a horror fan, this one is for you."

","The Babadook is the story of a strange supernatural creature that arrives after being read about in a book, which itself just ""appears"" on a child's shelf. It then begins to torment a troubled woman, haunted by the death of her husband, and her likewise- troubled son with a history of behavioral problems. Pretty standard.<br/><br/>The first hour of the movie is spent wanting to slap the spoiled children before things take a dark turn, as the woman begins a rapid decent into insanity spurned on by her son's insistence that the Babadook is real-- and it wants to hurt them. <br/><br/>Well-acted and atmospheric, yet too boring to be considered a good film-- the creepiest parts of the movie were the horrific illustrations in the pop-up book that seemed to serve as the vessel for the Babadook's arrival.<br/><br/>While not terribly bad, I was still left wondering if anyone is still frightened by films of this ilk, and why I still feel compelled to watch them."
"vandelour","3","16","44","14 December 2014"," So much potential, so little resolution
","Babadook is an expansion of a ten minute short done by the director in earlier years. She should have kept it as a short and skipped the 'long' version. The pacing is.. well methodical I guess. The two actors do a good job, the photography is fine, the sound is a little over the top but what the film really lacks is a horror movie plot. Monster movies usually have a monster in them and Babadook plays games with the core element so much that by the time the movie ended I was confused, unsatisfied and scratching my head at the absence of a climax. Gave it a '3' because the lead actress was excellent, the kid did his role well and all the secondary characters were fine. <br/><br/>Any monster movie done reasonably well can have scary moments but there's gotta be more to it than loud noises and quick editing. Asking the audience to fill in the gaps doesn't cut it. <br/><br/>And no, its no 'Exorcist' or 'Haunting of Hill House', thats for sure."

","I totally can see the director was trying to achieve. It seems to me this is a story about mental break down after a tragic loss, and eventual recovery (of sorts). But .... and it's a big BUT. From the beginning the characters are totally unlikable. The mother seems rather trashy and neurotic from film minute 1, the son is horribly obnoxious and generally a pain in the behind - also from film minute 1. The home is chaotic, adding to the general impression of a mental breakdown in process. There's also a dog there, even he isn't very likable, as far as dog likability goes. And of course it is killed (the only reason for it's inclusion?). They simply are unlikable - to me I couldn't care less if Babadook ate the whole street.<br/><br/>Also one moment, possibly not important in the general flow of things, is the visit of the mother colleague from work. Upon hearing the brat isn't sick, he just vanishes from the story - but it adds to the general doom, gloom and surreal feeling of the movie.<br/><br/>Then finally getting over the characters and their dog aren't likable - the movie ends. Good riddance. I've seen worse, I've definitely seen much better."

I had the advantage of seeing it with absolutely zero expectations, I literally had no idea what it was about or even what genre it was, my wife just told me ""you have to check this out!"" and that was it.

"RevRonster","10","5","10","13 February 2015"," Absolutely amazing and both emotionaly and terrifying!
","I don't want to come off like a horror movie snob but I've watched so many horror films in my young life that I have a hard time finding something that actually scares me or even gives me the creeps. If I were to throw out an estimate, I would say that 1 out of every 20 horror films actually spook me in any way. That's not good averages, in my opinion. However, I've always found that the best, and most original, horror films always exists outside the United States and, over the years, I've found that foreign made scary flicks scare me greater than any cheap ""found footage"" film ever has. ""The Babadook"" is just another one to add to that list <br/><br/>This Australian film doesn't bother relying on gimmicks that are extremely popular in American horror film media and also doesn't bother with the cheap, and easy, jump scare. Instead, this film crafts an unsettling and bleak atmosphere and has it dance with shadows, creepy imagery, and sounds that result in stronger scares than all the horror films released in the last ten years. However, aside from the very amazing horror work, the film also tells a captivating and emotional story that centers on a single mother trying to bury her grief after losing her husband and deal with being a single parent. This mixes amazing well with the horror and crafts deep symbolism that just isn't seen in most fluff that is produced in this genre.<br/><br/>Overall, ""The Babadook"" is one of the strongest horror films I've seen in a long time. Even more impressive was the fact it was the feature length directorial debut of Jennifer Kent (who also wrote it) but it shows no signs of an individual's first outing in the director's chair making a feature. The film feels like it was made by a seasoned pro that has an eerie understand about horror and pure, uncut psychological terror. I am excited to see more tales of terror from Kent."
"truenorthriver","9","5","10","22 February 2015"," Awesome Psychological movie
","Babadook is an outstanding movie. The story begins in a real slow pace, taking time to introduce the characters and the situations that they are involved. It becomes quite clear that this is not a monster movie. No on the contrary the Babadook is a movie in which you can feel terrified by the circumstances that the family is living. Many of us live sheltered of all danger and needs. Our Maslow bottom pyramid is really well served and the things in the top, become such mindless things that we take for granted. But imaging the terror through a children's eye, or maybe exploring what is a tortured/depressed and torn mind of the protagonist was the real terror for me. The monster appears to highlight each and every pain that she and her son feels.<br/><br/>The boy had an outstanding act. The protagonist was superb. There were some minor flaws, but the fact that it did not harmed the movies plot. All and all, Babadook is not the Exorcist, but it was so damn close."
"CrisMovieCorner","10","5","10","4 February 2015"," Modern Horror at its finest!
","The Babadook is based on director Jennifer Kent's short from 2005 entitled ""Monster"", this is her debut into directing a feature which is hard to believe when watching the film. Jennifer delivers a truly disturbing Horror film, that from start to finish will have your brain going a mile a minute trying to work out what the heck is going on.<br/><br/>The MAIN thing you have to understand going into this film, is not just about The Babadook as a monster, I don't really want to say too much about it without ruining the story. The Horror isn't fast paced and in your face like a lot of films in recent years, it is a slow burner that makes you feel invested in the characters and thrives on the tension the director builds in scenes. Director Kimberly Peirce who directed Carrie in 2013 should take a look at this film and see where she went wrong in the tension building department, while Carrie failed in drawing the viewer in, The Babadook thrives doing such.<br/><br/>The acting of Essie Davis was incredible she really encapsulates the loving mother who is right at the point of snapping due to circumstances surrounding her life. She is extremely convincing in her portrayal of the character even down to the pale and exhausted look of a single mother living on no sleep and a young child who borders on a monster himself. As for said child Noah Wiseman was brilliant in his role of Samuel he really had that disturbing creepy vibe you reminding me of Miko Hughes as Gage Creed in Pet Sematary. As I read on another review ""There are times when the pair almost fuse into one traumatised entity."" I couldn't agree more, they really bounced off each other great, but at times they really did feel like the one character fighting the monster.<br/><br/>Some long serving Horror fans may find this a bit different to what they are used to, The Babadook monster serves as a secondary factor in the film. The story itself is the main character, a truly terrifying story filled with scares, tension and twists second to none. While the film still has its ""traditional"" scares, it plays on the larger story of life and coming to terms with huge drastic and emotional changes we all succumb to in our daily lives and gives us lovers of the genre something new to enjoy instead of loud noises to make us jump.<br/><br/>Well wasn't this the shock of the year when it comes to Horror, who would have thought a little known Australian film would have had cinephiles from all backgrounds watching. I personally know people who dislike Horror as a genre but genuinely enjoyed this film. Everything about this film was incredible considering the genre and the fact it is a feature debut, the film will stick with you for days thinking about how well written and directed it really was. I will admit at times it is hard to bare with Samuel's crying/moaning early on, to the point you're wanting the ""monster"" to get him ha, but when you sit back and think about it after the fact he acts exactly how ALL children would in such scenario. It is films like this that make me incredible happy to be a lover of the Horror art form, truly hope some more Horror comes from Jennifer Kent in the future if her debut is anything to go by, she can only get better."

","I am not going to do any long review or give anything away but after many tears waiting i watched a horror that had some hype and was not left feeling cheated by the end! I love horror movies and have seen far too many. In recent years people have been left watching bad recycled horrors in which you can correctly predict what will happen, who will die, in what order and how the end will almost certainly be left on a cliffhanger--or better known as a director/producer who is thinking of lining their pockets more than constructing a proper end to a film and not thinking of another rubbish franchise. How people regarded the Conjuring as better than this ill never know. It had moments of course like all half backed horrors which know how to pull strings but that is rarely more than that. This was different. Perhaps the fact it didn't come out of the US is partly why it managed to stay clear of the usual flaws.<br/><br/>Anyway, enough from me.

The way the book in the movie is written is original, making you see ""monsters"" from a new different perspective, maybe a really cute one. In the beginning you think it's a classic horror like many others, but there are some great plot twists which can change your mind and make you wonder what the movie is really about. You have to pay attention to understand it. The movie should have been more explicit, because i had to read the plot explanation after watching it. And this is not only me saying it."

","This is a great film - directed and written by Jennifer Kent using, in part I believe, a city arts grant in Adeleide after some experience working on a Lars Von Trier film. The Babadook lives up to its critical praise with excellent pacing, camera-work, style, suspense and character development.<br/><br/>The picture follows the aftermath of a widowed, down-at-the-heels care worker and her dysfunctional son, who are both being stalked, and invaded, by an evil creature from a children's book. The evil spirit, known as 'the Babadook' is sort of a homage to twenties German expressionist horror, and the overall tone is at times similar to the Shining, or the Exorcist.<br/><br/>In fact, a few key scenes are overly derivative of those classic films, but its undeniable that Kent knows how to craft just enough suspense, foreboding, and helplessness to create a genuinely remarkable film. Its not without blood and violence, of course, but the film keeps these elements offscreen, or to a minimum, focussing on psychological terror and, well, darkness.<br/><br/>This film only shows its limited budget in terms of its small cast, as the delivery and cinematography are all first rate, every camera move and editing sequence feels like the work of a quality filmmaker. Worth watching, although not if you're overly 'afraid of scary movies.'<br/><br/>The writer/director also offers signed copies of the haunted book from the films official website if you are a fan of this movie."
"joris-nightwalker","7","5","10","5 January 2015"," Lovely horror flick
","The Babadook has been labeled the best Australian horror movie in years. I've got not much to compare to, but I do recognize a good horror picture when I see one. While you won't have to prepare for jump scares, gallons of blood or unbearable tension, Jennifer Kent's movie relies on the expressions of the actors and the psychological darkness surrounding the story. Essie Davis and child actor Noah Wiseman give their best making their facial expressions speak a thousand words and mostly they succeed. In addition, I think it is possible to read a subtext in this movie: the Babadook being the psychological terror of not being able to cope with reality. Of course that's just a possible interpretation (although I like the metaphorical layer of the ending when looking at the movie this way). The kind of horror that adds a pinch of Dark Touch to movies like Mama, Sinister and Oculus. Recommended!"
"westerby04","5","16","45","10 October 2014"," A drama about depression and bereavement with horror elements
","I attended the UK premiere last night. It was a double feature and the Babadook was screened after The Evil Dead 2 which may have influenced the audience's reaction to the film.<br/><br/>The main theme of the story is coping with depression and bereavement.This film felt more like a drama with minor horror elements than a full horror film.<br/><br/>There is a slow build over the first 30-40 minutes before The Babadook actually appears on screen. During this time quite a few members of the audience broke out into conversations. It struggled to hold the audiences attention. When The Babadook does appear, the horror scenes are a disappointment. The Babadook looks almost identical to the Hitcher from The Mighty Boosh comedy series. I didn't find it frightening in the least.<br/><br/>The film attempts 1 or 2 ""jump scares"" that didn't really land with the audience at my screening. It followed a very formulaic beat. It certainly is not Sinister or Insidious in that regard.<br/><br/>I thought all the characters in the film were unlikeable. Every single Character is shown at some point to say spiteful things to other characters. The young boy in the film is portrayed as the character you should root for but the child actor is so annoying it makes it difficult to care for him. He's a child so annoying that his mother and auntie can't even stand him. He screams and shouts almost all of his dialogue and his voice will annoy you by the mid way point of the film. By the end of the film I really didn't care who died and who lived.<br/><br/>The positives: The film does try to be intelligent and carries a message. The metaphor for depression and bereavement are great ideas but are so unsubtle I felt like I was being hit over the head with it by the director shouting ""do you get it?? the monster is depression!!"" The cinematography and lighting is fantastic. There are some beautiful shots in the film and the way the house transforms at night is really enjoyable to see.<br/><br/>I would not recommend this film to cinema goers looking for a fun popcorn horror movie. There is no comic relief at all in this film. I left feeling as tired and depressed as the characters on screen. The depressing themes and slow build make this film a chore to get through. The first act does build tension and the set up with the childs storybook is a great idea. Unfortunately, the film fails to deliver upon that set up in act 2 and 3."
"gand7","10","6","13","5 February 2015"," A solid watch.
","I argued with my friend recently about the quality of this film the other day. We both agreed that it was marketed poorly as a horror film and we both disagreed on the ""creep factor"". He told me he couldn't get into it, that it was drawn out and boring. I asked him to go back and watch it again in the middle of the night, alone and with no distractions. He came back and told me it was intense.<br/><br/>Turns out the problem for him was the yammering groups of teenagers chuckling and being general annoyances, sitting on their smartphones and asking their friends every three minutes ""what happened?"" when he watched it at the cinemas. I'm gonna go ahead and assume many of these one-star reviews are from ""torture porn"" aficionados hoping for lots of blood, gore and awful death scenes, or from kids who were on their Facebook pages for much of the film, because if you involve yourself in the movie, it's actually really damned good. If you catch the allegory, which I doubt the slasher/TP viewers could even fathom, then you would see the ending is quite well constructed.<br/><br/>All in all, for a modestly budgeted film, the presentation is great. It's bleak and depressing and cruel and not particularly enjoyable in any sense of the word, but then that's what it sets out to be; A true ""horror movie"" in every sense of the term. It's hard-hitting and close to home, the acting is fantastic, the production values are great, the sound editing is skin-crawling in a good way. I've got nothing but praise for this effort. Ignore the one-stars. Just watch it and judge for yourself, but make sure you watch it alone in an empty house in the middle of the night and not surrounded by teenagers on smartphones that are just going to ruin the atmosphere."

If you think horror movie should contain some supernatural elements and gore then you wouldn't like this movie. The movie was built showing how life is affected by trauma and how important it is to overcome one's fear however big and scary the fears might be to be able to see the true colors of life. The movie made more and more sense when I started to think about the various things happened through out the story line on watching it for one more time.

","This is a very realistic tale about a single distraught mother descending into madness since life just being what it is, through the eyes of her own and her child. I have seen this too many times in real life. I have seen this in, sadly, nearly every relationship around me, including my own horrible upbringing, which eventually led to both my father and my mother committing suicide in very messy ways. We're talking most of my friends, my own family, and as an example; this new girl that I'm seeing. She has a four year old daughter who is awesome, but she's stubborn and a piercing yeller, and had they not been brought into my life as well as I in theirs just a couple weeks ago, things would have gone horribly wrong. I've just met her, and we are still trying to work things out regarding her and her daughters safety from themselves. Don't have a family. Don't have kids. Don't create life because, as they say in this film, life will be very treacherous and circumstances will soon make you find yourself alone in situations which neither you, your friends or ANY government authority can handle. Why would you want to inflict the very pain of existence upon your own child, should you have one? Why would you want to create a family just to have something to do, to have someone to be accountable to, to create meaning of your own life. Creating life is a selfish act which has, will and do murder us all. It's not that you shouldn't be happy, go ahead be happy, have sex and lots of it and have fun. But be careful, because you are literally giving the child you will have all the horror it will experience. And prolonging the human race is not necessarily a reward in itself, because you haven't even figured out why YOU are in the first place, you haven't even figured out why existence IS in the first place, and all the nightmares it can provide your family with, should you have one. On the surface this is a horror story about a child's book. Great acting, scripting, direction, everything. And very creepy as well, without any jump scares. But at the end of the day, this is a warning. You shouldn't play god, no matter how safe you think you play. Because in 999999 times out of a million , this will happen. Parents projecting and passing on their own demons onto their children. Your children. I don't even have to promise you, just look around."

","Greetings again from the darkness. There is nothing more frightening than the thoughts that occur within the recesses of our own mind. And therein lies the problem with so many ""horror"" movies. We may squirm and cover our eyes while watching the latest slasher film, but to stick with us as real horror, a film must tap into those internal, psychological fears that we each carry. This first feature film from writer/director Jennifer Kent does that so effectively that I am hesitant to write much more than  go see this one (but of course, I will).<br/><br/>Ms. Kent has fully developed her award winning short film Monster from 2005. With a limited budget of around $2 million, she has figured out a way to utilize many horror staples: a misfit child, the family dog, an old house with creaky floors and doors, a musty basement, old reliables like under the bed and in the closet, open windows, and the always effective knocks on the door. Combine these touches with an incredibly creepy and dramatically graphically illustrated children's book, and terrific characters in the mom and her young son, and all the elements are in place for a suspenseful and terrifying film that is a throwback to the good old days.<br/><br/>It's easy to spot the influences of such classics as William Friedkin's The Exorcist (1973), Stanley Kubrick's The Shining (1980), and Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), but Ms. Kent has her own style with the camera and expertly creates an atmosphere of widely disparate mood swings grounded in believable characters. Essie Davis (The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions) delivers an extraordinary performance as Amelia, whose husband died en route to the hospital as she gave birth to their son. Noah Wiseman plays Samuel, the now 7 year old boy who has behavioral issues, fears the monster under his bed, and recognizes the resentment his mom feels towards him as a constant reminder of the death that occurred on the day of his birth. Wiseman looks like a cross between Elijah Wood in Witness and Danny in The Shining  only he is much more energetic and animated than either of those characters.<br/><br/>The suspense builds as Amelia's lack of sleep progressively wears her down, as her job and parenting responsibilities rob her of any down time or relaxation. She can't even get through a solo release in bed without her frightened son barging in for security. The dynamic between mother, son and dead husband/father elevate this to a level of psychological thrills that we don't often get on screen. There are so many superb moments to ""enjoy"". The amount of blood present is minimal, especially in comparison to modern day slashers. It's much more about how grief and stress can affect us in sinister ways. In addition to the influences already listed, there is also a tip of the cap to pioneer Georges Mêlées and his use of magic in the early days of film. Babadook may be an anagram for ""a bad book"", but it's also now synonymous with a really good horror movie!"

","The Babadook directed by Jennifer Kent and starring Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman is a straight up psychological horror film. It can be called an art-house horror film. But it would be unfair to call it a monster film,because although there is the presence of a monster in the film, but the storyline represents so much more than just a family being stalked by a monster. There are deep layers to it that the discerning viewer will be able to grasp. The deep psychological undertones of this film and the overall meaning of the storyline makes it a very creepy and disturbing experience. However people who have become accustomed to jump scares will not find any sympathy for The Babadook.<br/><br/>The acting by Essie Davis is absolutely amazingly fantastic. She is one of the main reasons why the film works this much. She completely commands the screen with her presence and makes her performance unforgettable. The direction and screenplay by Jennifer Kent are also masterful. The way this film is directed takes the viewer back to the 60s and 70s when the genre of psychological horror and metaphorical horror had not yet been submerged by cheap slashers and jump scares. The Babadook reminded me of Kubrick's The Shining and Polanski's Repulsion in the best way possible.<br/><br/>The Babadook is the kind of film that might not startle you and make you jump, but it will linger in your head and bother you with thoughts that are the most disturbing."

","The BABADOOK is one of those rare films that transcends from beyond the screen and truly interacts with the senses. It is an atmospheric and visceral journey that will clot your guts and coke you of air with its delivery and its, sometimes frightening, symbolic imagery. <br/><br/>Some may make the remark that bias with my take on the film due to my Australian origin, however this couldn't be any further from the truth. I have found many Australian films prior to be quite caught up in their own little culture and very rarely acknowledge a greater way to craft a story due to their heavy fixation on the Australian psyche and an urge to alienate ""us"" from all other cultures, you could say that Australians are often pretentious in their crafting of a visual narrative. <br/><br/>However, I found this pretentious sense to be quite absent from this film. As you can clearly visualize the directors goal, which isn't to demonstrate how wacky and zany Australians can be (with the exception of that infuriating brat Samuel). And it is due to this higher level of presentation that I find the BABADOOK to stand out from the speckled puddle of Australian movies. <br/><br/>Now in all respects on the surface the film is quite dim, a bit, its just another monster movie. Although, that is only the surface... I was surprised when I looked at the many reviews of this film, and I was shocked to discover the few amount of people that acknowledged the deeper aspect of this film. This isn't just a film about a scary sound that goes bump in the night, but its the slow returning of grief from the stubborn mind. This film manages to capture what it is like when the flood gates of sadness are held at bay until their evident collapse. The ignoring of what is gone and can never come back, that is what the BABADOOK entails, its the dark struggle within that must one day be wretched from within. also the excellent delivery of the candy box assortment of scares is also one facet to be fond of, not just the scares but also the moments of bliss too. I occasionally think about the film and a moment that I had forgotten about comes back to mind and I think in utter delight ""oh, wasn't that brilliant,"" and not Manny films can manage that. However not every movie is without its flaws, and to me the ending of this film feels quite flat. In mentioning that fact, the ending only seems frail if looked upon from its outer layer, a deeper analysis does help sturdy the foundations of its accent to the final seconds. <br/><br/>The BABADOOK is a film that is deep, nightmarishly frightening and with am excellent message to boot: that the containment of grief is dangerous, and the lounger you hide from harsh reality, the stronger it grows.

","So often films with great trailers end up disappointing. This was definitely not the case with The Babadook. Although not what I expected, the film lived up to, if not surpassed all of my expectations. The suspense is fantastic, although slow to start it brilliantly sets the tone in the first 40-50 minutes, with both the Mother and child giving extremely good performances. The creepy monster and old house routine produces some nice scares throughout, and I have to say I found the noises it made terrifying. So many horror films go way too far with the jumps and scares, but I often find, as I did with this film that less is more, and the lack visual representation of the Babadook (it is often just seen as a shadow or glimpsed briefly) allowed my imagination to flow, making the whole premise more scary. This isn't a conventional horror, and the focus on the characters instead of the Babadook made it scary in a much deeper way than ghosts and ghouls ever could. If you are looking to see this film with the intent of getting a few jumps and going home, then you will be disappointed. I have seen so many 1 star reviews of people who just didn't get the film at all. If you enjoy a psychological horror with a deep meaning behind it (and is terrifying) then you will love this film. The best horror, and in fact film I have seen in a while."

","Not bad at all but let me say that not every horror buff will like this kind of horror. It do has it moments but it also is a slow builder. There's not that much of horror going on in fact but it's the way it is shot and the use of lighting that gives a special feeling and don't forget the performance of the two main leads.<br/><br/>The story itself is rather simple. A mother and her annoying child are living together when the father has died by accident. But their child is a real pain in the *ss at home and at school, so the mother decide to read him a book, The Babadook. It's some kind of weird book and the child gets obsessed with it and start to see things but after a while the mother does too, the babadook is alive. <br/><br/>It's once the book comes alive in their mind that some creepy shots and eerie atmospheres appear and that's what makes this flick great. Not only that, when the mother is watching TV you also see shots of other classics and the Black Sabbath's (1963) most scary moment is here also to watch.<br/><br/>The Babadook is a flick that must have it from it's creepy moments and not for the gore (which isn't in it) like other horrors. As said earlier, not for everybody but once seen you will not forget it, or you will find it eerie or you will find it rather boring, the choice is yours.<br/><br/>Gore 0,5/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5"

","Since The Conjuring, this movie is what should be the definition of the horror genre. It's smart, engaging and downright amazing. The cast has acted well and done justice to their characters. No cheap jumpy scares. Every scare has a proper build-up, body and an ending. The creature of The Babadook is a novel and interesting idea. Story keeps moving. The environment where the story takes place is creepy and does in fact give you chills. <br/><br/>I will recommend it to anyone who wants a sensible horror movie.

"acidrosesrijit","9","7","16","23 November 2014"," Childhood Fears
","Children can have the creepiest things in their minds and are sometimes the cruelest beings on this planet. Perhaps, because they are still linked to some primal fear memory. The Babadook is a child's fear manifested in our adult world. An aspect of fear that we try to control and overcome. But this also makes us question that how far exactly are we from it? The world with its material attractions dull our senses, desensitize us to these things. But, that's exactly what we would like to believe in the waking world. Because, when we go to sleep and darkness lays its heavy hands on our eyelids, we return to a primordial soup of memories that we both like to remember and forget at the same time. This tension, I believe, is the stuff of nightmares and childhood fears, that we try all the time to keep at bay.<br/><br/>How this fear is manifested and given shape by a mother's guilt forms the second layer of the story. Guilt, despair, and hopelessness give rise to strange manifestations in our fragile minds, especially when we don't have a support system. People start breaking up. This is exemplified by the mother, who loses her husband in a car crash, when he was driving her to the hospital to have her baby. The child is born, and is seen by the mother as the cause for her unhappiness. This externalization of the loss and the cause for blame is, of course, at a subconscious level. But her veneer of strength slowly crumbles as the days pass and she becomes less of a mother and something else altogether. After bearing this unhappiness for seven long years, she slowly teeters off the edge of her sanity. The onset of loneliness, depression, and ultimately insanity form the major themes in this film. The lack of sleep, imaginary noises, and the strain of consoling a constantly scared child creates havoc on the mother's nerves and is manifested in the looming and ever-growing shadow of The Babadook. <br/><br/>The name, ""Babadook"" is nonsensical, and I feel, it's a name that actually is a forced word, manufactured to rhyme with the children's poem – ""If it's in a word, or if it's in a book/ You can't get rid of the Babadook."" Maybe, it's something to do with Baba Yaga? Who knows? We do that sometimes; manufacture stuff, in our own minds to fit stuff into place. But, in this case, it goes horribly wrong.<br/><br/>Themes of motherhood, single parenting and a child's imagination are extant throughout the film. We can, at least identify with one or more themes in the film. As children, we have always imagined our toys to life, given monstrous shapes in the dark to clothes bunched up in the corner of a roomand so on.<br/><br/>Stylistically, this film creates a feel of claustrophobia and suffocation, more so, by the use of minimal color. The blue seems grey, the grey seems greyer, the whites are never really white, and the blacks just get darker still.<br/><br/>This film, I think, is comparable in many ways to The Shining, Jacob's Ladder, Angel Heart, The Sixth Sense, The Machinist and books such as The Believers (Robert Arthur) and The Haunting of Hill House (Shirley Jackson). For people with an appetite for old school terror and scares, this film is definitely recommended."
"ecce-platypus","10","7","16","2 November 2014"," Best ending in a long time
","Several reviewers said that the last 15 minutes were disappointing. But they're the greatest part of the movie! Sure, it's not some generic, idiotic horror, it's more complex than that, horror is a tool, there's so much layers in the movie, and it's actually a debut, first full length film by this female director, which is also important, considering feminist themes in the movie. The end is ambivalent, it's not one-sided pro or anti-feminist, it goes deeper. A debut with a 30.000$ budget, I mean, what else should anyone say when they hear a 30.000$ budget, and the film looks great. A director has to be given a chance to make more movies. Of course it's not a masterpiece, but for God's sake, if you watched Insidious, Conjuring or Annabelle than you've already wasted 5 hours of your life, and Babadook is definitely not a waste."
"alucardvenom","8","7","16","1 November 2014"," Excellent debut
","I really like Australian movies, especially their horror and exploitation movies, so when this was announced I was exited because I liked the basic idea and trailer was interesting... and it didn't disappoint.<br/><br/>Made on tight budget, ""The Babadook"" looks lot more expensive then it actually is. It takes for about 30 minutes for a movie to finally start, and once things get going, the atmosphere and mood turns more and more tense. There are several scenes that are well made and quite effective, like ""book reading"" when book itself more or less explains to the audiences (or to it's main hero) what is going to happen. It's just a well made scene with really good sense of plotting. <br/><br/>We as the audience know far more in advance what could happen to our two lead characters, which only adds to sense of dread and unease, because we know some of those things will eventually come on screen.<br/><br/>Other note is that ""Badabook"" is quite simple in it's plot. There are no dozens of unnecessary twist that only end up ruining the movie. It is what it is and only ends up building upon it's basic premise. That doesn't mean that movie doesn't add some additional elements to it's story, but it keeps it simple in it's core.<br/><br/>While well directed, movie was perfectly aware of it's budget limitations, so there are no glossy effects, which only work well for the movie. It should also be noted that movie, while lacking in effects, is backup by really strong acting by Essie Davis."
"JvH48","8","7","16","5 October 2014"," Very spooky experience, better than assumed after having read the synopsis
","I saw this film at the Imagine (sf/horror/fantasy) filmfestival Amsterdam 2014. It was a very spooky experience, gradually speeding up to get creepier and creepier. The son's behavior was annoying some of the time, asking for attention and often playing dangerous games, however not unusual for his age. The only minus point is that the final scene left me puzzled, and seemed not a logical consequence of what happened before.<br/><br/>Being a very young, presumably inexperienced actor, the boy does very well. He is annoying some of the time, but that is an inherent part of his role. On its turn, his behavior could not be helped and was a logical consequence of his compulsive eager to defend his mother from evil, becoming apparent after having found the book of Babadook and reading it together. He made his weaponry out of miscellaneous household material, which was a very nice touch, certainly serving as icing on the cake of his superior performance.<br/><br/>Of course, a bed moved, some doors creaked, often there were very dark, human-shaped figures on walls and ceilings, lights faltered or died suddenly, and more such standard tools of the (horror) trade. But it was never over-the-top in the context of movies of this genre. Such events became more frequent later on in the story, until a climax just before the final very quiet scene. At first, one could have thought that the events we witnessed, were only present in the imagination of the mother, but some of the later experiences are shared between mother and son, like the aforementioned moving bed.<br/><br/>All in all, in spite of the seemingly less attractive story that I derived from the synopsis beforehand, the end result was much better than I had expected. Added to that, the mother and son acted spotless and believable. They were sometimes annoying and did not behave sensibly, but that is obviously an integral part of their role and fits in the story line, so no problem.<br/><br/>(*** ALERT *** SPOILER AHEAD ***) The only thing I failed to understand was the peaceful ending. It seems related to delivering a bowl of worms in the cellar, which is a bit usual to say the least. This happened on the boy's birthday, also remembering the day the father died while driving on the way to maternity hospital. A party was to be held later that day (his cousin would/could not come as he pushed her lately and made her fall). Mother and son eat peacefully in the garden, and then the credits appear, so we'll never know whether this party is for real, nor whether there were many attendants (doubtful, given the son's deviant behavior in the past, when eventually no one wanted to play with him). We also have no information how and why the disturbances ended, nor what could have been the answer to the mother's repeated question ""What is it that you want??"". Anyway, something seems to have satisfied the hostile visitor, and the bowl of worms definitely has something to do with it. Yet, all this may be the most logical (is that relevant in a horror movie?) wrap up of the plot. I certainly can live with this as a solution, given the thriller qualities of the preceding scenes."
"3xHCCH","7","7","16","23 September 2014"," Unexpected Horror Gem
","At first I was not thinking of watching ""The Babadook."" The title sounded corny. There were no known actors. The trailer was dull and unpromising. Everything about it screamed bad B-movie. Surprisingly though, when initial reviews were coming out, they were all very positive. In fact, there were even respected critics who rated it a 5/5, very rare in the horror genre. With these excellent endorsements, I was compelled to go watch it in order to see what the fuss is all about.<br/><br/>Amelia is a young widow with a seven year-old son, Samuel. Her husband Oskar died violently while he was taking her to the hospital to give birth. The sweet and kind Amelia, who works as a caretaker in a nursing home, is not really moving on well from her traumatic experience, and her special child Samuel's excessive hyperactivity and monster phobia is aggravating her woes.<br/><br/>One day, Samuel picks out a new book off his shelf called ""Mr. Babbadook"". As Amelia began to read this hard-bound pop-up book, she realizes that this had disturbing images and even more disturbing words. From that moment on, ""Mr. Babadook"" with his top hat, overcoat, shadowy form and long sharp fingers, would insidiously insinuate itself into the lives of mother and child, until all hell literally breaks loose in their household.<br/><br/>Writer/director Jennifer Kent was lucky that the two actors who played mother and child, Essie Davis as Amelia and Noah Wiseman as Samuel, captured her vision perfectly. Davis was subtle and convincing in her dramatic transformation from mild-mannered nurse to a raving virago. Despite his gentle age, Wiseman was able to portray Samuel's difficult behavioral condition and his efforts to protect his mother at all costs. <br/><br/>I totally see what the critics loved about this film, It was a throwback to simpler times when there were limited special effects and effective scares were dependent on the skill of the director to create these creepy moments. Whoever designed the Babadook pop-up book deserves praise because it really looked so unnerving, especially in its second incarnation. More than just the technical matters of film-making though, the director succeeds in setting up and elaborating the problematic relationship between mother and child and that was essential to make the whole film work.<br/><br/>During the parts when the Babadook was already exerting his negative influence on the family, the tension developed was very thick and the suspense can be unbearably uncomfortable. It was not really about scaring the audience scream silly, This film will make you reflect about the true nature of the sinister Babadook and what it represents. While it does not totally shake off its B-movie feel, especially with the awkwardly puzzling ending with the bowl of worms, but this humble Australian film definitely achieves its objectives as horror-drama with sterling results. 7/10."
"snowfre","9","3","5","4 November 2019"," Among the best horror movies ever made.
","Jennifer Kent's directorial debut could not have been better, ""The Babadook"" is one of the most original horror movies out there that dares walk its own path in one of the most overly crowded genres in the industry. In this film, single-mother Amelia (Davis) struggles to give her eccentric son Samuel (Wiseman) and a stable childhood following the death of his father (Winspear). As they find a children's book with not a very happy ending, they are haunted by the horrifying - but well dressed - entity, the Babadook. The film is without doubt, in my opinion, some of the scariest horror movies released in this decade, as the mother decent into madness following the arrival of the Babadook, an increasing feeling of isolation crawls upon you which inflicts much more scares than the menace himself, who is sparsely seen, making him more fearful when he finally appears. Throughout ""The Babadook"", the atmosphere and grayish filter adds to the overlaying cloud of unease surrounding the entire story. To me, Kent has created a horror film close to perfection which challenges the innovativeness of the horror industry. More should dare to take leaps into the unexpected since that often brings many more scares than your usually jump scares or overused ghosts. The hype over this film is understandable, and deservingly so, not many movies has had me scared like this. And also, in contrast to an absolute majority of scary movies out there, the film's themes and characters can be analyzed and discussed after. Is the Babadook real or just a reflection of a mother's depression and its subsequent effects on a small child. The more humorous analysis of the title character being a sad, depressed gay man is maybe less to study but nevertheless shows the impact on popular culture this astonishing horror movie has had."

","PROS: To start off, I have literally never seen a better kid actor. The two main characters were able to deliver a perfect film with no faults in their delivery whatsoever. The actors gave everything you want and then some to their performance, it was quite remarkable. It was so good that it helped the rest of the film tremendously. The characters were able to move along with the build up of tension at the same rate which made the movie progress smoothly. The build up was very terrorizing as well. It was so good that it gave me chills to watch. Something that I look for in movies is how smoothly the transition is from, climax to falling action, and this movie was able to let the viewer simmer on what they just had watched which was nice. The director was careful enough to let the development of the falling action carry the last few scenes of the film, this made the resolution of the film more impactful. To continue, the resolution was very well composed. I enjoyed the movie greatly because of the way the ending wrapped up everything nicely. <br/><br/>CONS: The one thing that stuck out like a sore thumb was the crazy amounts of plot holes and unanswered questions. To start off, the way the characters changed throughout the film was so bizarre. One minute the mother was sane, then crazy, then sane again; then the son was crazy, then sane, then crazy, then sane, and these transitions happened so abruptly and it caused too much disorganization for my liking. Another part that was frustrating was the Babadook himself. I know this might spoil some things in the movie, but the Babadook was quite agonizing to conceptualize. He did real life things like move things, recreate things, make phone calls, inhabit bodies, and all this time the whole point of the Babadook was to be a metaphor for grief which it didn't deliver. I was torn by the Babadook because it wasn't developed well enough in the film. I know their was a lot of cons, but PLEASE watch this movie! It is so good.<br/><br/>www.chorror.com"

The movie excellently visualizes the internal struggle that Amelia (Essie Davis) deals with on a regular basis, and how that internal struggle presents itself and impacts her son, Samuel (Noah Wiseman), and other members of her community. As the anniversary of his death draws nearer as the film progresses, the viewer begins to understand just how frightening a memory can be and just how detrimental that memory can be to relationships between family and friends. Kent concurrently generates anticipation, suspense and horror as viewers wait to see if Amelia's psychosis can be contained and controlled, or if it will eventually overpower Amelia's freewill and rational thinking and cause her to do things she would not dream of doing. Whatever the result may be, viewers are guaranteed to have trouble falling asleep at night, as the knock of The Babadook resonates in their thoughts: ba Ba-ba DOOK! DOOK! DOOK!"
"jacobmjohnson","9","3","5","27 March 2017"," The Truest Horror of All
","Many horror films rely on cheap cinematic thrills or attractive actors to get viewers adrenaline going. Jennifer Kent's The Babadook, however, ignores these conventions and instead chooses to rely on nothing but our own inner demons to shock. After the death of her husband, single mother Amelia is seen struggling to deal with the grief of the loss while also raising her son Samuel. By default, Amelia, just like many parents, choose to ignore these emotions, and prioritizes her son instead. When a monster, who is known as the Babadook, starts to follow and play off the family's fears, viewers watch as this unbreakable bond between mother and son is jeprodized - proving to be one of the scariest aspects of the film. The Babadook is intelligent for the fact that it plays on our personal fears of the struggle with loss, a parent's love, and neglecting our mental health and the issues that tend to arise when we are most vulnerable. Many people who have not experienced a major loss in life will likely find it hard to understand or appreciate this film - which is fine, as that is not Kent's intention. The Australian director is smart in the ways she intricately positions the Babadook, a supernatural monster, as a representation of depression and heartbreak. May it be through the use of imagery, color schemes, or tension, we as viewers are given the indication that the Babadook is not the only thing troubling this family - and Kent want us to know this. We are supposed to be rooting for this duo to finally overcome both the physical and internal obstacles in their lives. By the end of the film, it's almost as if we're not scared by the Babadook itself, but more by how a death of a loved one can consume us until we're the unrecognizable monster ourselves - the truest horror of all."
"lilshaf","7","3","5","27 March 2017"," Babadook review
","SPOILER ALERT<br/><br/>In this film, as in many other horror films, somewhere along the line you realize that the thing to be feared the most is, in fact, your very own fear. Not to say that monsters are not real, however, more to say that they can only exist to the degree that we let them. Knowing this will help you identify the true identity of the Babadook and the extensive metaphorical network that director Jennifer Kent creates throughout the film. From the very first scene of the movie, that is brought to us in the form of a dream and a flashback in one, it becomes obvious what the trauma is that haunts both the mother and son throughout the film, in a literal sense. The trauma that is from the loss of their husband/father. It is the mise en scene that first shows their joint depressions. The absence of color represents the absence of the husband/father and the collective loss of happiness that results. The next part of the metaphor is the sons fear of all of these monsters. The more adamant he becomes about the existence of these monsters (especially the babadook) the more frustrated and irritated the mother becomes. As her depression strengthens throughout the film, so does the Babadook, explaining the true allegory. The reason the mom denied the monsters existence for so long, is actually her denying her depression's existence. Only at the end when the two of them are jointly fighting against her depression (the Babadook) do they succeed in creating a happy life together. This is representative of most people who are dealing with depression needing help from their loved ones in order to establish healthy coping methods. Even after viewing the full film and having time to digest the content, it seems to leave many viewers wondering which parts were real or dreams. This is actually a key part of the metaphor. Depression's effects can be deceptive and exhausting. Certain things can be made very literal or real to depressed people, and the question becomes not, ""what is real?"" but rather, ""what is real to them?"" The Babadook is very real to the two main characters, even at the end of the film. When viewed critically, this metaphor can be extended to every issue and character's objective relating to the plot which is why it is known as a ""smart film."""
"michellelfernandeza","8","3","5","27 March 2017"," The Monsters in our Head
","The Babadook is an interesting film that preys on our childhood fears and brings them to life in this dramatic turn of events between a widowed mother, Amelia, and her young son, Samuel. Although it took me two times to watch this film in its entirety, I was able to finally appreciate the psychological and emotional aspect the film was truly about. The pages of a terrifying children's book come alive throughout a series of unsettling events beginning with Amelia's subtle possession by the creepy figure of the narrative, The Babadook, as the intertextuality of the film pays homage to the classic horror film, The Exorcist (William Friedkin, 1973; USA). The utter annoyance of the young boy, Samuel, and the toll his antics has on both Amelia and her obvious depression, keeps you connected to Amelia's exhaustion and annoyance throughout the film. However, once you notice that Samuel's constant concern over The Babadook is a very real fear and that the creature does intend to hurt him and his mother, you are left with a sense of shock that this irritating child was right all along and only wanted to protect Amelia. The cool colors of the film and dark lighting used transports you to a state of watching that makes you feel as dull as how Amelia currently views her life. The Babadook brilliantly uses a typical ""scary monster in the closet"" figure to ultimately symbolically and literally depict how Amelia's depression is consuming her and makes the connection between an actual monster to the monsters in our head. The film simultaneously hints at the fact that if we try to repress these monsters within, it could lead to them growing into larger, powerful, all-consuming entities."
"cndial","8","3","5","27 March 2017"," Once You Let Him In
","Raw, creepy, and thought-provoking: The Babadook is designed to give the viewer an inside perspective on what depression feels and looks like, and it succeeds. In The Babadook, there is no romanticizing this disease, which is cleverly disguised as Mister Babadook. Jennifer Kent's first feature-length film was not wasted with this incredible picture. Beautiful cinematography and allegorical expression are used brilliantly to cover a subject that is sometimes kept in the basement, under lock and key.<br/><br/>We are introduced to Amelia Vannick (Essie Davis) and her son Samuel (Noah Wiseman), and instantaneously, due to the superb mise-en-scène, it is painfully obvious that this is a tense household. The feelings that are presented through the use of these elements give such believable verisimilitude that it is hard not to imagine yourself in Amelia's situation.<br/><br/>This idea of a single mom coping with the antics of a child afraid of ""demons"" isn't the only part of the movie that engages in intertextuality with The Exorcist (1973). There are also images of the bed moving abruptly, as well as the idea of possession. The Babadook, however, keeps it fresh by making a switch from the possession of the child and innocence to possession of the motherly figure.<br/><br/>This film is an excellent display of concepts that have been covered in other films many times over, but they're used here in novel and unanticipated ways. The Babadook also brings into the mainstream a disease that affects so many people and is oftentimes kept out of the house, for fear it might overwhelm. Jennifer Kent poses an important question: If we don't address the problems we are facing, will they eventually take us over?"

","All aboard for the heart-wrenching, tear inducing emotional ﻿﻿﻿﻿ride of the Babadook! A classic Australian family has been done wrong by the sudden death and removal from their lives with of their father and husband. The film., created in 2014 really takes audiences away from the new genre of horror that runs the world of horror, especially past 1990. The use of gore and outrageously uncomfortable situations to instill fear and blood-curling screams from the audience members is not the only way to terrify them anymore. Though, The Babadook, directed by Jennifer Kent, steers itself far from the horror, blood-stained, scream indulging path of the genre itself. Using psychological punches while the emotionally unstable, depressed mother cares, or tries to care for her overly loud, obsessive, needy. attention-deprived father Kent shows us slight glances into the ;ad of the Babadook and how it feeds on the negative feelings of children and doubtful parents. The spooky, imaginable creature-like man feeds on the lives of the despair. so it seems quite coincidental this child's book find itself on their shelf. The storybook character shows his dark, hideous, shadow filled face in the film, creating a possession over he mother who needs some help herself, though not from the child book devil. This possession of his mother leaves the son in terror and confusion throughout the film, until the slightly revealing end. Of course, like any good story book, this film leaves a cliff hanger. Audiences shouldn't prepare to scream, bring an extra pair of underwear, or where a turtleneck to cover your eyes. What audiences should do to prepare for this film? Open your eyes, check under the bed, in the closet, and behind the curtains!"
"richie_w-41138","8","3","5","27 March 2017"," When Depression Becomes Your Inner Demon
","The Babadook takes a unique approach to horror which is why most people do not find the movie good or scary. This film is smart because instead of taking the approach of jump scares or a scary monster, Kent decides to go after pure, terrifying emotions such as grief and depression which make the viewers have a sense of discomfort. The mother in this film is going through an incredibly hard time with not only being reminded of her dead husband around every corner, but also her son struggling in school and being disobedient. Not only was she struggling but her son is also struggling and we see both characters dealing with these emotions which are conveyed through lighting and mise-en- scene. Kent uses a relatively gray color scheme and places multiple objects in the frame to correlate the Babadook to her husband. This connection is important to realize because it is what makes the movie so beautiful and gives it a much deeper meaning. The Babadook is an allegory for the level of her depression and grief, which is expressed non-stop throughout the film throughout the monster's actions. Kent does an incredible job at capturing these emotions and conveying an uncomfortable feeling to the audience. Overall, I think that The Babadook is a revisionist film that is able to make the audience relate to the emotions the mother and son are going through while still encompassing some of the horror elements found in films such as It Follows to an extent."

This film by Jennifer Kent puts us with a grieving mother and her hyperactive son after their father and husband was killed in a car accident. This film is not your typical monster horror film. Kent presents the Babadook in a way that has you questioning whether it's a real monster or a figment of her imagination. It's a very smart film because of how Kent leaves up to question whether this monster is real or just a manifestation of her grief. The way the Babadook is associated with the mother throughout the book, looming over her, and the mother's slow decent into following what the book prophesized. I believe the Babadook as an allegory to the mother's grief of losing her husband as well as the build up from her hyperactive son getting underneath her skin is a great way to keep the audience guessing all the way up until the end. The camera work along with the music and lighting gives us this sense of perpetual anxiety that this mother goes through every day and that built up can manifest into something as scary as the Babadook or as scary as how she treats her song when she's under its influence. The suppression of the Babadook to the basement can be mapped to her suppressing her grief and keeping it under control in the basement while still feeding it from time to time, sort of how grief works in the real world. Overall the film was a fantastic portrayal emotional trouble along with a strong residual sense of fear after the film is over."

","I'm tired of people mistaking this for a regular monster movie. It's NOT about an entity or a scaring creature. <br/><br/>*** spoiler ***<br/><br/>It's about a mother who hates her own child. The whole fear we see in the movie comes from the imminent danger of her killing her son. <br/><br/>But such hate feeling is too terrible for them (mother and son) to acknowledge, so the Babadook is an allegory their minds create to deal with it without addressing it directly.<br/><br/>The concept is unusual and the performances are priceless. A really deep deep and strong movie."

","A brilliant depiction of what it is like to live in a home ravaged by grief. The innovative cinematography forces discomfort upon the viewer, who will surely be terrified if not taking solace in the idea that Mr. Babadook is the filmmaker's metaphor, not a corporeal entity. Just remember, the more you deny, the stronger he gets."

","Version I saw: UK cinema release<br/><br/>Actors: 7/10<br/><br/>Plot/script: 7/10<br/><br/>Photography/visual style: 7/10<br/><br/>Music/score: 7/10<br/><br/>Overall: 7/10<br/><br/>There was a great deal of hype in horror circles surrounding the release of The Babadook. It was called 'revolutionary', a 'masterpiece', and all despite the title bizarrely invoking cheesy 80s novelty party song 'Agadoo' in my mind. Australia is not without any track record of horror films, but nothing of this kind.<br/><br/>In terms of type, The Babadook blends gore, jump-scares, creepy chills and oppressive psychological horror, and this is the first impressive aspect. Writer/director Jennifer Kent clearly has a command of all the different tools of the genre. There is great work in music, sound and especially make-up too.<br/><br/>Crucially though, it is all in service of the story and the ideas being explored. SOME SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT ONWARD. Like many such films, The Babadook has a central mystery about whether the terrors stalking the main characters are real or imagined, and ultimately, it doesn't matter. The 'monster' is a metaphor for the demons of depression and anxiety that stalk main character Amelia (Essie Davis), and the danger of her repression of her issues. The message is one that I have seen very rarely elsewhere: the characters win by confronting her demons, acknowledging them, and not defeating them, but instead learning to live with them. That is what impressed me most of all about the film.<br/><br/>It's not revolutionary though. I don't think it's a masterpiece either. The kid is not a very good actor, for a start. Besides, there are lots of very good horror films, of which this is only one, and singling it out denies all of them. Watch The Babadook, but watch those films too."
"tyson-hunsaker","9","3","5","8 February 2017"," The terrifying, psychological horror nightmares are made of
","The Babadook came as a surprise upon viewing it for the first time. Expectations were low considering what footage was available. At a glance, this film can appear low-budget and uninteresting. Perhaps these low expectations can serve the audience well and allow some more enjoyment from this chilling psychological horror. <br/><br/>The film centers on a single mother raising her son alone while being haunted by a storybook she reads called Mister Babadook. As the premonitions become more intense, the line between reality and illusion is blurred and confused. The darker and deeper elements of the film involve terrifying representations of mental illness and insanity. As the story progresses, darkness deepens as the character's dark and tragic past is revealed as well as it's horrifying future of murder. In fact, when the mother's terrible forecast of her insane acts are known, it's hard to keep that jaw from dropping. <br/><br/>Technically, The Babadook is completely competent and doesn't disappoint with any obvious continuity errors. At times some lighting seems a little too apparent but it's not frequent enough to present any serious issues. Sound effects and editing are woven perfectly into the story to give the viewer a sense of terror and disorientation. <br/><br/>Performances were very solid all across the board, particularly from the lead actress whose performance is quite outstanding. Even the boy who plays her son delivers some memorable scenes of scare and terror as he describes his visions of this creature. The imagery of this Babadook creature itself is one that'll stick in the viewer's nightmares.<br/><br/>Although the film is genuinely unsettling and skin crawling, some pacing issues keep the frightening concepts at baby possibly too long which can result in more waiting than watching. However, when the guitar strings of tension so to speak to indeed snap, the snap makes all that waiting worth it. Especially during the final thirty minutes when the mother's utter spiral into insanity becomes nauseating. <br/><br/>For any fan of psychological horror this film comes highly recommended. It may not be the best horror ever seen but it does rank high in a genre that finds difficulty in effectively delivering deeper scares. It's scary and should shake the core of any viewer. Strong horror like The Babadook is one that definitely shouldn't be missed."
"rhettmeddersthomas","8","3","5","8 February 2017"," The absolute best horror movie since The Shining and Silence of the Lambs
","There is way to much to say about this movie, it was one of the greatest horror movies I've ever seen (The Shining still remains my favorite). <br/><br/>The first thing I'm gonna talk about here is the lighting; this is the greatest lighting you will ever see in a movie. It makes EVERY SINGLE SCENE terrifying. Even the scenes when nothing was happening, and the mom and her son are just sitting there. You have the most unsettling feeling watching this movie, and I think that about 60% of the reason this movie was so horrifying was the lighting.<br/><br/>The Camera Work: This is some of the best camera-work I've ever seen in a movie. Just like the lighting, it gives you this terrible feeling like you know something is going to happen. The camera-work in this movie I think is some of the best, I would say maybe the fifth best I've seen (behind Gravity, La La Land, Saving Private Ryan,and The Shining). <br/><br/>The Acting: The acting in this movie was pretty good, I liked the child actor, he did a great job portraying an annoying b*tchy kid, but you could understand what he was going through. The lead actress does an amazing job actually, and I personally think she deserved to have been nominated for Best Actress in the 2014 Academy Awards. She wouldn't have won because the Academy doesn't like Horror, Action, or Sci-fi movies for the important awards (excluding Silence of the Lambs). The leading character almost reminded me of Jack from The Shining, you're just slowly watching this character descend into madness, but unlike the Shining, there is a resolution in the end. <br/><br/>The Story: I really enjoyed this story, like I said, you're kind of watching our lead character slowly go mad from the evil presence that haunts her. It's more than just the modern day cliché horror movie that all have the same plot. The plot of those movies are: A creepy kid does something creepy, the relative of the kid tries to help, the demon attacks the person, they get rid of the demon, the end. That is not what this movie is at all, it's way darker, way scarier, and doesn't rely completely on jump scares to carry the movie to the finish. Every modern horror movie except this and It Follows relies on jump scares. Lights Out, Annabelle, all Paranormal Activity sequels after the first one. They're all the same. The Babadook does something different and new, and I feel like not enough people saw this amazing movie. <br/><br/>Critical Acclaim: It's rating on Rotten Tomatoes is 98%, Metascore is 86, it won 46 awards. IMDb decided to give it a 6.8/10, and that is criminal. That is the lowest rating of a movie I enjoyed so much. IMDb needs to give good movies a better rating (The Revenant, Zero Dark Thirty, Gravity, any Wes Anderson film, The Babadook)."

","CONTAINS SPOILERS CONTAINS SPOILERS CONTAINS SPOILERS CONTAINS SPOILERS I put off watching this due to how many bad reviews I saw and how many people I came across that had nothing to say about it other than to mock it. But I finally sat down to watch it while answering some emails and quickly found the emails completely forgotten.<br/><br/>This isn't a jump and scare type of horror, and I personally found the times the Babadook was crawling around a bit funny. If you base the movie off of him alone it looks like another sorta bad sorta funny horror. The children's book was scarily adorable and I want it, and I've found myself walking around the house saying, 'Ba ba dook dook dook,' all night.<br/><br/>That all alone made it an okay movie. But what made it good was every other bit. The way he lurks in the shadows always had you nervous every time there was a dark corner. The way the little boy annoys the hell out of you at first then wins you over with how pathetic he is. It nearly broke my heart when he was trying to tell his mommy he was hungry and there was no food in the fridge. The way friends and family react to them is so uncomfortable and just really gets you into the story. The mother takes every idea of depression you can have and plays them beautifully. The real story and the real horror is the relationship between them and the lows it reaches at times. I feel like they could have gone more into detail with certain bits, like the home visit that ended so quickly. The ending had a bit of a twist but still left you uneasy and rather sad for everyone the entire time.<br/><br/>Well worth the watch even if the dinosaur noises were a bit distracting."

","In a century where few horror movies stand out, we have ""Babadook,"" the film that tells the story of Amelia (Essie Davis), a single mother who creates a troublesome son by herself, causing depression, anguish, and anger. With sections reminiscent of Repulsa (64) and the Enlightened One (80), ""Babadook"" is a script show, all the characters are absurdly well built, and it looks like the movie only has an hour and a half. For many moments we forget the supernatural, because what terrifies us is the life of Amelia, and the film becomes so human that when the supernatural comes, we really get scared, a story where the human aspect of the characters are very well built in the Making me forget the supernatural and mystery, we can say that it is a script that Stephen King would approve, I confess that I went to watch the film for a recommendation of a friend, and with a certain prejudice, but the photograph of the film won me completely in the first 5 minutes, This extremely dark photograph with a palette of colors turned to gray, from the first minute something in the film bothers you, with a precise soundtrack and brilliant performances, Essie Davis is frighteningly perfect, and Noah Wiseman makes you believe in his madness only with You look at it. The big mistake of the movie is his third act, all of it is a sin, in trying to fight against the bad he relieves himself and puts himself at the level of all other mediums for bad horror films. Of course the film has a message, it's all an allegory, the monster is much deeper than just a monster, it's all an analogy behind involving depression and madness, but the movie that has its first two great acts, And a third dumb and simple that normalizes and disappoints, but it is worth very much, although the film is no longer genius due to sheer lack of imagination, the script is given to the common in the last minutes. But lastly, ""Babadook"" is worth it, because it is mostly different, and for lovers of terror, it is a delight."
"thelastblogontheleft","9","3","5","19 December 2016"," Understated Horror
","This movie honestly impressed the hell out of me because I feel like it delivered on so many different aspects of horror. Many horror movies — or movies in general — can wind up being very two-dimensional. But this movie could stand solidly on its own as a classic horror movie or as a psychological thriller — it melded both together in a seamless way.<br/><br/>The basic storyline has Amelia, played by Essie Davis, as a single mother raising her soon-to-be 7-year-old son. Her husband died in the car crash they both experienced on the way to the hospital to deliver said son, Samuel (played by Noah Wiseman, who gives one of the most intense and genuine performances I've seen by ANY child), and there's a palpable distance — almost hatred, at times — that you feel from Amelia in her interactions with him. To make things monumentally more complicated, Samuel is a difficult child, to say the least. He spends most of his time building (and practicing with) weapons he has concocted to protect them from imaginary monsters he is convinced will take her away from him, speaking his mind (to the chagrin of teachers and strangers alike), and occasionally injuring his cousin (causing his aunt Claire, played by Hayley McElhinney, to share some of that hatred towards him).<br/><br/>The extend to which you can FEEL Amelia's exhaustion and desperation is impressive. As much as you know that Samuel is, ultimately, innocent and really quite vulnerable, the direction of the movie makes you share in her frustration, wondering why he can't just be easier to deal with.<br/><br/>It doesn't take long before they are getting ready for bed one night and he brings her a mysterious book she's never seen before: The Babadook. The book itself is downright creepy, with crude drawings and a terrifying message. They're both visually shaken by it, but Amelia decides to hide it away and mistakenly thinks it's over.<br/><br/>Some of the encounters with The Babadook were some of the best I've seen in any movie — understated and yet truly terrifying: insistent pounding at the door when the repaired book reappears, a mysterious outfit hanging without mention at the police station, or my favorite: when she sees him lurking in the corner of her neighbor's house. Like I said, psychological horror aside, it's a damn good scary movie.<br/><br/>After Mr. Babadook makes his appearance, the movie takes an even more desperate turn — Amelia had previously been yearning for sleep, and now she's fighting to stay awake and protect her and Samuel from this unknown and dangerous force. This sort of blurred reality starts to set in, like the hiss between two radio stations, and it's obvious that things are starting to unravel. Samuel's concern for Amelia is so touching, and yet you can see her withdrawing from him even more than before, and soon becoming violent. He is torn between wanting to protect and help her and following his instinct to run, and any bitterness you felt towards him has long since dissolved as you feel nothing but sympathy for this situation he was born into by no fault of his own.<br/><br/>The climax of the movie — with Amelia clutching Samuel as she literally just screams in the face of her monster until it retreats — blew my freaking socks off. I thought it wrapped up well with an obvious shift in her approach to Samuel and to parenting — she now embraces his quirks, supports his emotions, and could give two shits about what others think of them or how they judge them. She has learned to live with her demons — quite literally — and while it's technically a happy ending, there's a very dark underbelly there, too, which I appreciated as someone who understands mental illness, grief, and depression from the side of experience.<br/><br/>One of the best movies I've seen in a long time!"
"Prichards12345","9","3","5","13 November 2016"," One of the most original horror films in decades
","Black is the colour of this movie. A colour pallet of deep dark blacks and greyish whites. And there is a very good reason for this.<br/><br/>In this stunningly original and absorbing horror-drama Amelia (Esse Davis) struggles to cope with the loss of her husband in a car crash. She was in labour at the time, and during the ride to hospital the tragedy occurs. Amelia's son Samuel (Noah Wiseman) appears to be a disturbed young child, and as the story develops we get the feeling that she has subliminal resentment over her son's inadvertently being the cause of her husband's death. It's about 5 years later but she is still struggling to move on.<br/><br/>Although there is the usual weird kid in it any form of horror cliché ends there. This film is different; not for everyone, yet a treat for those of us who thought all originality was lacking in today's movies. When Amelia reads a story book to her son she finds it dreadfully frightening. A horrible monster - The Babadook literally springs out of the pages at her as a 3D cutout; and it isn't long before he is assuming corporeal form...<br/><br/>The Babadook himself appears to be modelled on the Lon Chaney vampire character from London After Midnight (still a lost film, sadly), but he's extremely frightening and enormously effective.<br/><br/>The conclusion has thrown a lot of people, but for my money it's simply that Amelia has synthesised her latent terrible grief into the form of the monster - he's literally a metaphor for the terrible black depression that has engulfed her; and once her true feelings come out, she's able to deal with him.<br/><br/>I thought this was a brilliant film, and can't understand the rating this movie has at all. The acting from both Davis and Wiseman is first rate. But hey that's showbiz!"
"notafanof","7","3","5","7 September 2016"," Bababadooook
","The most unnerving film I have seen in a long time. Babadook perfectly replicated the feeling of tense dread brought on by sleep deprivation and anxiety. This is not a pleasant movie. And I probably will not bring myself to watch it again. The main character is very well realized, and I could sympathize with her plight. The kid in this film annoyed me at the beginning, but he was nothing compared to the unpleasant emotions this film summoned from me. The first hour of this film is fantastic. It's creepy and, at times, absolutely terrifying. The film has a lot of subtext to it that is, sadly, overdone in the final thirty minutes. I wish they would have kept it subtle for the entire movie, but it really started to become obvious by the final act as to what the movie was about. The film falls apart in the final act and becomes very cheesy. The ending was quite strange, but I do understand what it was getting at. Feed the beast your worms, and hope for the best. A good film that could've been great if it could have just held on a bit longer in its final act. 7 out if 10."

I missed this when it first came out - a genuinely scary horror film, it said, one of the best horrors for years.<br/><br/>Sorry, but it falls short, possibly on the basis of false advertising. It is nicely creepy, with a sense of enveloping dread, and the cast are all very good, especially young Noah Wiseman as a truly annoying little boy (but then, he's supposed to be). Had it been staged (and advertised) as a psychological thriller, then it would have been utterly successful. However, it is sold as, and turns out to be, a horror movie, in which endeavour it is considerably less successful. In particular, it promises much and delivers little, and it has a dumb resolution. Still, at least it didn't have one of those unconvincing shock endings which turns everything on its tail.<br/><br/>And it was so nearly really good."

","""The Babadook"" grows on you. I saw it one night, and thought it was just OK. But next morning, reconsidering the tedium I experienced in a few spots which I thought were mere horror film clichés, I realized they really were psycho-plot points, and my appreciation for the movie changed considerably. When we remember those moments as well as a couple of scenes that seem incongruous or unresolved (as when the mother finds a photograph in which the face of her husband has been scratched and, after facing and shouting to her little son, their relation goes from tender to wild and back) , you know that the movie is not only telling you a horror tale (because the Babadook is certainly an entity freely moving in the shadows of the house where the protagonists live, and in their neighbor's home) but also paints a frenetic psychotic portrait, since the beginning when the little boy warns his mother of the intentions of the evil presence. Produced in Australia and directed by Jennifer Kent, many persons find a connection between the movie and Polanski, Tarkovsky and even ""Home Alone, but as other reviewers elsewhere do, Andrzej Zulawski's ""Possession"" and Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"" were the two movies I thought of. In both films and ""The Babadook"" there is a strong connection between horror and the psychological disintegration of the leading characters, which in the end denies all Aristotelian progression and undermine whatever happy ending you may imagine. Essie Davis as the mother and Noah Wiseman as the son (I hope he does not turn into another case of child actor going bananas) are very good, and illustrator Alex Juhasz' concepts of the Babadook and its book are really outstanding. A fine cinematic experience."

","This may not be the movie for you if you watch it expecting to be scared by the ""monster"". What scared me the most about this movie is how great it was in showing that the scariest monsters are within, and very much a real thing people deal with in their lives.<br/><br/>I sat watching a good portion of this movie with wide eyes and mouth open in shock. Not once did the movie make me jump, but I have to admit it's been a long time since a movie made me feel so unnerved. I really appreciated the lack of jump scares too. Most of what passes as horror in movies lately is a series of short suspenseful moments followed by a ""gotcha"" jump scare. Kind of like walking through a good haunted house on Halloween. This movie on the other hand, is like that feeling you might get when the power goes out and you're alone. You start hearing noises that would normally be familiar but put you on edge given the situation. Subtle fear starts to build as your imagination runs wild with possibilities as to what might be going on around you.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and set aside reservations about watching this movie for scares. Try to see past the action happening in the movie and imagine what is going on from the perspective of the main characters. If you really let it in, you will be scared. Especially considering that ""The Babadook"" affects almost 1 in 4 people in the world."

The Babadook is too deep of a film for me to just offer up a simple ""I like this film because of its depth, mystery and special effects. (and yes I do like the film for these things – and so much more!)"" It is begging for thoughtful analysis. Or maybe it's just my analytical mind that desires such an examination. It is a film rich with symbolism, so much so that I cannot help but dive underneath the layers to see what is lurking from within.<br/><br/>On the surface, the film is a ""monster hiding in closet"" story - a child's nightmare, etc. The monster in this film is a shadowy figure called ""The Babadook"". But the film is much more than this.<br/><br/>he Babadook represents all the repressed feelings that dwell within the mother and son twosome since the death of Oskar Vanek. Up and until Amelia encounters The Babadook, Sam's impressions of him are left to the viewer's imagination. Perhaps this is because his fears, though no less real, are more vague. He never knew his father, but still he suffers from his absence. He lacks discipline and courage. Having a mother who is unbalanced and overstressed does not help his situation. Sensing Amelia's hesitations about being a mother, he feels insecure.<br/><br/>Amelia has never properly grieved. She has buried many emotions and they are bubbling to the surface. Sorrow and sadness are definitely part of the mix, but she possesses feelings that are much more toxic. She is bitter. Her husband died so the Sam might be brought into this world. She blames Sam for this. She even hates him at times. Through her eyes, we see the shadowy creature. We see it possess her, and this is when her bitterness is in full form. She even admits that she would have been happier had he died instead of her husband.<br/><br/>Although Amelia is behaving cruelly, Sam still loves her and comes to her aid. Together they defeat Mister Babadook. But they don't kill him. Rather, he flees to the basement of the house. There he stays. Mother and son are happy at the film's end. They love each other. Both have said some hurtful things to the other, but this is what can happen when a hodge-podge of negative feelings goes unchecked. The feelings fester and amalgamate and create a character that is foreign to the host that harbors such sentiments. People become monsters; unrecognizable abominations of their former selves.<br/><br/>The Babadook is a great film. Thankfully, it lacks ""high-octane"" scares and gore. In its place there is good old' fashioned story-telling and mood development. Oh, and great artwork! Mister Babadook appears genuinely creepy"

"CineMuseFilms","7","3","5","10 February 2016"," Australian filmmakers remain on top for horror and psychological thrillers.
","Its odd to think that film audiences pay good money to experience fear, confusion and even physical discomfort. Maybe its to heighten the pleasures of everyday normality after the show. This film is an unusual hybrid of two closely related but different genres for which Australian filmmakers are acclaimed around the world: the horror and the psychological thriller. The former emphasises bloodshed and the supernatural, the latter leans toward forms of madness with bizarre and deadly outcomes. The difference is important because The Babadook (2014) is devised to be both, and each genre leads to very different interpretations of what we see.<br/><br/>Its a straightforward story about a single mother Amelia whose husband died on the way to the hospital when her son Samuel was born. Amelia is finding it increasingly hard to raise Sam and even his cousins do not want to be near him on his seventh birthday. He believes that a scary Dr Seuss-type character called the Babadook creeps out of the storybook that his mother reads to him at night. This is where the twin film genres diverge. The para-normal happenings can be seen as classic horror, with no logical explanation necessary, just a complete suspension of disbelief. On the other hand, we may be seeing a classic case study in delayed bereavement psychosis, and everything we see is happening only in Amelia's mind.<br/><br/>The anxiety-inducing lighting and camera-work carry the atmospherics of the story, but the acting performance of Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman are simply outstanding. Essie transitions between a struggling but likable mother to a woman well beyond the brink of utter despair to complete madness. For his age, Noah shows an extraordinary gift for acting and those huge innocent eyes only accentuate the terror we see. Both actors have the critical element of plausibility that sustains the gradually escalating tension throughout the film. If you are a fan of either fear genre, this is one of the best in the current crop."

","I'm a bit torn with this movie. it's a low budget independent film that makes zero attempt to hide that fact, nothing fancy here just one really creepy movie.<br/><br/>My main beef with it is the first 30 minute set up, ever had to suffer through a birthday party with a million fussy kids screaming in your ears? yep that's all condensed into one kid that takes the spot light throughout the first one third of the movie with a mother who just looks on helplessly... <br/><br/>Now the main event follows as the babadook ""makes his presence known"" indirectly in the movie, none of the classic jump scares or gore- ific scenes that usual films have. just that creepy undertone that keeps the suspense tight.<br/><br/>If you manage to get through the first one third of the film (yes this is a film, not a movie. big difference!) you'll find something creative and haunting. it lost points for the really bad start that made me lose interest and shelve the DVD for weeks before watching it again."

","Finally a descent horror movie. Not one with these stupid hand camera's done. In 2014, that was a sick year of using hand camera's. And most people don't like it here. Here we still appreciate a good story with suspense. This movie has a good decent story and a lot of suspense. Next good thing about it is also, that you never know, what's going to happen next. The sound and graphics are also very good. Not pushed or over the top. This isn't a typical GORE movie, so don't expect that. This is more like for example: jumps, creepy ghost things, but also some twists. I really hope there comes a second part, because I (In Belgium) loved it very much. Finally something descent for your money. We have waited here in Belgium, for a good horror movie without those stupid hand-camera's. Maybe you like it in America, but we in Europe still want a descent movie with good actors, like in this one."
"jaimeweida","9","3","5","29 October 2015"," Not for the faint-hearted!
","I agree with all other reviewers who have said the 1-star reviews of this film don't do it justice. I'm a horror fan and for the past year people have been urging me to watch this film. I had a day off today and finally watched it on Netflix. I am VERY picky about my horror films and it scared me, which is hard to do. Someone else here compared it to ""The Shining;"" I'd also cite ""The Abandoned"" (another GREAT, under-appreciated horror film) and Shirley Jackson's classic novel ""The Haunting of Hill House."" ""The Babadook"" isn't fast-paced, isn't in the standard blockbuster horror model, and isn't even that gory. But it is *fantastically* creepy.<br/><br/>****BEWARE! HERE THERE BE SPOILERS!!!*************<br/><br/>At the end of the film I wasn't completely sure WHAT actually had happened. A lot of reviewers here have criticized the ending. However, we have an unreliable narrative here. The mother's perspective has already been revealed as unreliable on a number of occasions - for example, when she ""sees"" the roaches in the kitchen and in the car (don't forget the helpful-yet-kind-of-emotionally-hurtful neighbour's name is Mrs. Roach) and her experience at the police station. And, as the police suggest, who is to say she didn't create the book herself? Is she drawn into her son's madness, is he drawn into hers, or is the Babadook drawing them both in? There is a psychological term, ""folie a deux,"" for a relationship in which two people who are not entirely stable alone become severely unstable when around each other because they feed off each others' illness (Cronenberg's ""Dead Ringers"" is a great example of this, as well as the novel ""My Brother's Keeper). At first, I thought this was going to be a film about an overstressed mom dealing with an unbalanced child. As the film progressed, her own imbalance became more pronounced (and don't forget she's dealing with severe sleep deprivation through most of the film, heightening the hallucinogenic overtones). I found myself wondering if the sister's seeming hostility was actually foreshadowing the mother's mental illness and if her sister's behaviour was reflecting years of dealing with an unbalanced sister and nephew. The bingo scene also can be viewed in that light; on one hand, it's kind of funny. On the other hand, it may reveal a sadistic streak in the mother's character as she ""messes with"" the helpless dementia patients. <br/><br/>There is some VERY dark stuff going on beneath the surface of the plot. At first I was very annoyed about the ""vibrator"" scene - it seemed like a cheap way to shoehorn some sexual content into the film. However, as the Babadook and the madness in the house becomes increasingly associated with the dead husband, I started thinking about a sort of ""reverse"" Oedipal complex where the mother resents the son for depriving her of a sexual life and sexual satisfaction. Listen with a Freudian ear to the son's repeated statement: ""Don't let him in."" :P SO MUCH of the horror occurs while the main characters are in bed. While it is *certainly* not unusual for a mother to sleep in the same bed as a young son, especially one who is having severe nightmares and night terrors, that ""sleeping together"" seems to take on a more symbolic aspect in the film.<br/><br/>So what really happens at the end? Does the mother literally have the Babadook imprisoned in the basement, feeding him phallic worms to keep him quiet? Or has she ""repressed"" her own insanity into the cellar of her mind? Remember that she tells her son he can visit the Babadook ""when you're older"" - a stereotypical parental response when kids ask about sex.<br/><br/>*********SPOILERS OVER**********************<br/><br/>This is not a gore-fest, nor is it the kind of ""turn-your-brain-off-and-watch-people-being- killed-in-inventive-ways"" type of horror. It's creepy, it's challenging, and it is upsetting on a very profound and almost subconscious level. I don't have children, but I recently acquired a niece ;) and some of the mother-son interactions really bothered me. The Babadook character was terrifying and, to me, even more terrifying for the mystery surrounding him. This film kept me up late tonight and spurred me to write my first-ever IMDb review. If you give it a chance, it may haunt you as it's already haunting me."

","The Babadook is one of the best horror movies I've seen since Sinister. It is scary, engaging , and it makes you think about it a while after viewing it. The terror here does not come from cheap jump- scares , but from tension built from atmosphere and psychological horror. <br/><br/>The story is great because it deals with universal themes like grief, loneliness, and resentment. The music here is also quite effective and creepy and not overly used . The visuals are very unique and creepy . There is not an excessive amount of cgi used here , thankfully.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty good , although some may find the young boy a little annoying at first. The pacing is a little slow at first but the final third of the movie is pretty intense without being super gory . The ending may be a little ambiguous but I felt satisfied by it.<br/><br/>I would recommend The Babadook to anyone who enjoys scary , atmospheric horror like Sinister or Insidious . If you're looking for something besides lame remakes or cheesy found footage horror, give The Babadook a try."
"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","7","3","5","23 October 2015"," This shows that most horror films are best made indie style, few work with big budget studios
","There always seems to be a common trend for the horror films that truly scare its audience. Some examples from the past several decades are films like The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974), Halloween (1978), The Blair Witch Project (1999) and Paranormal Activity (2007). They were all films with meager budgets but received positive reviews critically and box office draws commercially. They also had green lit sequels not many people enjoyed, except for the hardcore followers. There's a subtle difference between making a film independently Vs with the help of a studio. Unless the studio really believes that the director knows what they're doing, most of the time studios will intervene at some point and begin tampering with the director's vision. This leads to cuts, edits, reshoots and changes that most directors do not intend on doing thus fully altering their dream product. Meanwhile for indie filmmakers, directors have a much more limited cabinet of tools such as money (mainly) and resources, yet there's no studio to get involved.<br/><br/>Making her directorial/screen writing debut, Jennifer Kent heads this Australian horror film that demonstrates that most horror films continue to be more effective when made independently than working with big budget studios. The story is about a widow named Amelia (Essie Davis) and her son Samuel (Noah Wiseman) being stalked by an ominous entity known as The Babadook that's making their lives more stressed than it already was. Being that there have been multiple times when films do poorly because the writer to the script was also the director, it's surprising to see how this movie escapes most of those blunders. The majority of the surrounding subplots are presented for the right reasons and help the viewer understand how they affect the main characters. Also the writing barely, if any at all contains the typical horror tropes one would expect to see in your everyday mainstream ghoul flick. One area that stands out as none productive to the plot, is the subplot of Amelia's coworker Robbie (Daniel Henshall) who initially feels like he wants to be with her but it is quickly dropped half way through. Once realized, it didn't feel necessary to begin with.<br/><br/>There's also the case of continuity errors and why some things are left unchecked. Yet, these are things that usually happen in every film and it's not the most abundant here. If there's anything else that doesn't make sense it's the antagonist's motives. Clearly heard in the movie, the character states ""give me the boy"", but for what? What's the purpose? Some backstory or mythology would be appreciated for such an iconic figure. This is it for gripes though, the characters are likable and the audience will care for them and the situations they are put into - specifically dealing with sweet neighbors like Mrs. Roach (Barbara West) and the cautious Aunt Claire (Hayley McElhinney). Even The Babadook (played by Tim Purcell) himself is somewhat likable because of just how strange and demonic the character is and how he goes about scaring the living daylights out of this family. The method that The Babadook goes about doing his business is not exactly the newest of things but it certainly is effective.<br/><br/>Initially, The Babadook is introduced via bedtime story book that has pop-up figures and its own little nursery rhyme. However as the pages continue to turn, the images become darker and darker foreshadowing possible events. Mind you that's just the beginning. The Babadook is a creature that loves to play mind games. Its movement is rigid, makes cockroach or cicada-like sounds and its voice is raspy almost like its speech being choked out. The design is also something noteworthy too, resembling that of a scarecrow. The violence is not hefty either. There are a couple moments that look painful but nothing that is on the dismemberment level. Jennifer Kent's direction relies more on scaring her viewers by giving them minimal elements to work with. That includes just seeing things for a moment and then disappearing or focusing on a simple object that may have a bigger purpose. It's those kinds of scenes that can give a viewer chills because of the insecurity that it generates.<br/><br/>Radek Ladczuk as the cameraman for this production made good use of his surroundings. The house Amelia and her son live in, is exactly what other characters mention it as - depressing. It's a house of melancholy colors that accentuate the mood and tone of the story ten fold. What's best about Ladczuk's work is treating the camera as if they were eyes. By this, if the camera moves in on a character and a sound is made, the camera stops completely. After a brief pause the camera moves again. It actually creates more tension in the scene. Ladczuk's other method is not moving the camera at all. There are some shots where the lens just focuses on a dark hallway or a shadow of a stairway railing. It gives the feeling that there's something else inside the house. The musical score composed by Jed Kurzel is surprisingly effective even though much of the film is silent. There are some intrinsic tunes provided by thumping timpani and bells. It's a foreboding sound that will definitely create uneasiness. Plus, no jump scare stings!<br/><br/>Rarely do mainstream horror films produce such chills when it comes to ghosts and midnight ghouls, but not here. It's unfortunate that it still has some problems either having a useless subplot or motivations left unexplained but that doesn't stop it in its tracks. With sympathetic characters, an iconic villain, unconventional cinematography, direction and music, this indie horror film surpasses several other horror properties popular studios have exploited."

","I thought this movie was BRILLIANT... one of the better horror films that I've seen in many a year... tense, gripping with outstanding visuals and an excellent, original, layered story which can be enjoyed on multiple levels (literally and symbolically)... What's more, the performances of the two leads were amazing... this, IMO, gets back to what truly makes an excellent horror film and makes it truly creepy, scary and intense... our reaction is driven by the setting, the atmosphere, the images, the music, the subtle sounds and, most of all, the performances... Essie Davis is incredible and she handles an extremely complex role very well and you feel her frustration and terror... Finally, the film never resorts to what I believe is the bane of horror in the last 20 years: never does it use cheap jump scares (and, in the hand of a lesser director, there would have been 30+ opportunities to do so)... As a result, the scary moments aren't just a quick punch to the stomach which you shrug off in a few seconds but, instead, they linger in your brain and under your skin for well after the film is over... again, absolutely loved it and I hope we can see more films that are like this because they are few and far between these days...

","As a big horror fan, I was looking forward to the babadook and it was a brilliant watch. It's basically a good old fashioned boogeyman story about a widow mum, who's left bringing up her needy little boy who has some behaviour issues. A book (mr babadook) appears and the mum reads it but soon realises the content is not for children as it tells the story of mr babadook who comes into your room at night and terrorizes you.. And that's what he does. Once she reads the book, mr babadook starts to appear. Pretty freaked out she burns the book but it comes back re written with an evil end about a mum killing her boy. There are many similar boogeyman / ghost movies but this one was different. It feels real with lots of tension. I won't give too much away but the ending is great, as mr babadook is real. The mum and child set a trap and kind of end up keeping him forever!<br/><br/>The mum is fantastic at playing a drained widow and equally the little boy plays quite the brat, but you cannot help but feel sorry for them both.

I think it was even wrong to put this film in the ""horror"" category. Possibly it could have some interest, as a portrayal of life as a single mum to an only child with behavioral problems. Many people today can relate to THAT part. But in that case the supernatural element (or whatever it was) should not have been there at all. In my experience, it almost never works out well to try to combine something supernatural with something more actual, current or serious, such as social realism."

","I think, Babadok is a new wave of New Brave World philosophical cinema where characters materialize their fears, hate, and inner evils into popular folk villains. Bottom line, woman who is so fed up with her autistic child's behavior, diverges her hatred toward him (her child) and ex-husband (also genetically accountable for a child being physically unbearable). She expressing her contradictory feelings toward boy who drives her crazy in form of folkloric hallucinations which are at the same time support her madness, propelling the plot forward. In reality, Babadook is an identity of her madness which many mothers with many autistic children would go through. The director's vision defined this feeling and mapped it with strong intense diabolic association. The importance of this movie is conserved between lines of its symbolism, showing a real feelings of rage that overpowers autistic mother in distress and agony. At the end, she comes in terms with her hate which is real and it is normal. Sometimes, we have to come in terms with ugly side of our psychos. Remarkable that movie will have hard time among all that sugar-coated political correctness where mothers are supposed to be religiously programmed for good only zombies who never feel anything diabolic at all.

"johnnymurphy15","9","8","20","28 November 2014"," Relying on tone and atmosphere rather than just being jumpy!
","Horror is a genre I have a love/hate relationship with. Many aspects of the genre are what got me interested in cinema in the first place. The music, the low angle shots, the sense of dread and unease and the memorable and tense scenes. However, I feel especially with modern horror, you really have to dig deep to find something of an alternative to the formulaic so called 'cattle prod' cinema which is churned out at such an unduly excessive rate. If you were to dig so deep and end up 'down under', you will find quite possibly a new saviour of this stagnant genre named Jennifer Kent who wrote and Directed this excellent film 'The Babadook'.<br/><br/>The film focuses on a family consisting of a struggling single mother Amelia (Essie Davis) and her wayward 7 year old son Samuel (Noah Wiseman). The background of the family is revealed to us in Amelia's dream sequence showing her husband dying in a drowning accident on the way to the hospital to give birth to Samuel. Now that his birthday is coming up, Amelia is haunted by this memory and prefers to celebrate Samuel's birthday a week or two after the actual date. With Samuel's over-active imagination, his obsession with making weapons and his fear of monsters under the bed and in the closet, Amelia becomes increasingly concerned. Her concern increasingly turns to anxiety and madness when his behaviour harms his young cousin when he pushes her off a tree house. When Amelia reads a story to Samuel at night when he gets scared, he picks out this mysterious book on the shelf called 'The Babadook'. The book has morbid, Gothic illustrations depicting a demon who comes into the house. When the narrative gets too scary, Amelia stops reading, but what she starts noticing is that more illustrations and narration appear on the pages, completing a horrific story of a women possessed murdering her dog and child. The Demon starts to appear in a cloaked, menacing, shadow like figure, turning Amelia's world into something frightening with a constant sense of foreboding. With her son's behaviour becoming more difficult, Amelia finds herself becoming like the character in the book.<br/><br/>For me, the film works brilliantly on a symbolic level. The book and the demon itself represents Amelia's darkest thoughts and what she is capable of if she keeps her tragic past buried. It is a film about the plight of a single mother and the terrifying thought that beneath the compassionate maternal motherly instincts of protecting her child, there may be dark thoughts of freeing herself from what can sometimes be a hopeless situation, particularly if you are dealing with behavioural problems. The story unfolds itself at a perfect pace and the scare's are more subtle and rooted in the characters. It is not only a film to scare, but a film which really connects in an emotional level making you feel sad at Amelia's situation, and you have much sympathy for Samuel too. Instead of concentrating on individual frights, I feel Jennifer Kent was going for a darkly atmospheric tone which remains consistent throughout the whole movie. There is constantly an unnerving sense of trepidation as you feel the narrative revealed to Amelia in the book is going to manifest itself in reality. You really don't want it to go that way as you care for the characters so much, but because 'you can't get rid if the Babadook' it feels like it might just happen.<br/><br/>There are a wide range of influences Kent utilises from both classic and modern horror respectively. We see Amelia watching old silent horror movies with a monster looking similar to the Babadook and there were parts that reminded me of 'The Grudge'. I feel that Kent really understands the genre, which is why I feel this is a step up from the majority of horror films which rely solely on fright and shock.<br/><br/>Essie Davis gives a very strong performance as the single mother who has an underlying fear and resentment of her child and Noah Wiseman gives an equally stunning performance as the boy who is in fear of his mother. I feel this kind of taboo subject matter works brilliantly in horror films as we are all afraid of our deep, underlying feelings which we choose to bury and ignore. Kent has made a fantastic debut here. Not only could it easily be best horror film this year, but one of the best films! Check out my film blog - www.projectionistreview.wordpress.com"
"brando647","7","4","8","19 December 2015"," The Heartwarming Tale of a Single Mom and her Poltergeist Raising her Wildly Undisciplined Son...
","THE BABADOOK was a decent movie but I was disappointed after my first viewing thanks to all the hype behind it. There were a bunch of reviews touting it as terrifying and one of the scariest films of the year; I'm pretty sure there was even a quote from William Friedkin (director of THE EXORCIST) praising it as the most terrifying movie he's ever seen. The film, from first-time feature director Jennifer Kent, is about Amelia (Essie Davis) and her son Samuel (Noah Wiseman). Samuel's father died in a car accident driving a pregnant Amelia to the hospital the day Samuel was born, so it's just been the two of them ever since. It's been rough going, with Amelia stuck in a thankless job and Samuel developing behavioral issues. Severe behavioral issues. He's getting in trouble in schoolfor bringing homemade weapons and his own aunt can't stand to be around him. Then, one night, Amelia goes to read Samuel a bedtime story and discovers a strange new book on the shelf, ""The Babadook"". It's a twisted little pop-up book that scares the wits out of Samuel and, as if that isn't bad enough, it's merely the start of a series of bizarre occurrences. Soon Samuel is ""seeing"" the Babadook and he becomes petrified that the shadowy creature is invading their home. Amelia's frustration with the boy skyrockets when he acts out against this invisible specter but we begin to wonderis it Amelia's years of frustration boiling over or has the Babadook found a host?<br/><br/>Maybe it's just me. Maybe I'm just desensitized but THE BABADOOK wasn't much of a horror film. Thriller, sure. Certainly a drama. But I wouldn't classify it as horror. I was never at any point scared of anything. These warped expectations ruined my initial viewing. I'd bought the movie, reading so much good about it, and sat down with a couple beers for a good scare. Halfway through, I was so put-off by the misdirection that I couldn't be bothered to care. It wasn't until my second viewing, this time know what I was getting in to, that I began to recognize it as a good film. It still wasn't scary but, since I was watching it fresh, I was able to recognize how talented the filmmakers were at creating a constant state of suspense. THE BABADOOK is a very tense film. The visuals are drab and drained of color; Amelia's house is full of cool blue shades and shadowy corners. The rising tension throughout the beginning of the film is slow but you can see it all building up to the point where it'll burst. You can't help but sympathize with Amelia in the beginning; her job sucks and her son is a royal pain. Samuel appears to have two modes: hyperkinetic and screaming. It's not surprise that she's as burnt out as she is, having dealt with this life for years with no one by her side. Anyone could go nuts in such a rut.<br/><br/>Then the Babadook arrives and it's too much for Amelia to bear. Things get interesting and I love that, the second time around, I noticed that it's not all as cut and dry as I'd thought. I realized that it leaves it ambiguous whether there really is a supernatural being haunting their little family or perhaps Amelia has finally just snapped and everything occurring in the film is her unconscious mind acting out. It's only really this element that keeps the film all that interesting and I've read some interesting interpretations online. But does it stand out in the genre? Not really; not to me. If you're thinking of checking out THE BABADOOK, manage your expectations and don't let the hype get them too high. It's pretty slowly paced and can feel as if it's dragging at times. The final act where everything finally falls apart is pretty entertaining. In terms of casting, this is essentially a two-person show with Davis and Wiseman. Davis does a fine job as the increasingly fragile Amelia and Wisemanwellyou get used to his antics as the film progresses and, despite his annoying nature, you'll most likely be on his side by the end. There are a few minor characters. Barbara West is their kind, elderly neighbor who is always on the verge of getting involved when things have obviously taken a turn for the worse in Amelia's home but was never bothered enough to get the authorities involved. Amelia's snobbish sister Claire (Hayley McElhinney) sees her sister's suffering but couldn't seem to care less. Really, the Babadook should stop worrying about Samuel and needs to focus his energies on the useless people surrounding Amelia. That, I think we could all agree on. Anyway, THE BABADOOK, while not as game-changing as some critics might want you to believe, is a serviceable supernatural (?) thriller and is probably worth your time if you're bored on a quiet night."

","This movie is insane. This film managed to stick with me like few others have been able to do. Never since Sinister has my heart been beating so quickly, my mind racing and my senses heightened to even the slightest bump in the night. Needless to say, I enjoyed The Babadook very much.<br/><br/>For one thing, the film is heavy on atmosphere and immersing the viewer in the experience without even being completely aware of it doing so. This film is very blue, the walls of the house, the curtains, most of the furniture is all in a sort of melancholy indigo that has a habit of creating an atmosphere of sorrow and general negativity. Meanwhile other scenes appear grainy and often have a dull sort of hue that really emphasizes the overall presence of a dilemma for our main characters to face.<br/><br/>Another great quality of this film is it's acting, predominantly the two main characters Amelia and her son Samuel. These two both give great performances. Amelia is someone that I find more and more real as I watch her. Sure her actions in the film are at times not something normal human beings would typically do. But with the things that she goes through it can be said that there is a reasonable motivation behind her behavior. Huge props to Essie Davis for her role as Amelia. Noah Wiseman also does a great job as Samuel who is a psychopathic kid who is prone to violence and sporadic behavior . But along with his mother, Samuel's reactions are strange but certainly not unreal.<br/><br/>But most importantly as a horror film should be, this film is horrifyingly scary. There were several occasion where I had to cover my eyes. The movie even had one scare during the climax involving Samuel that gave me chills and my jaw actually dropped as the scene unfolded, it was that scary folks.<br/><br/>In conclusion, go see this movie! I can honestly without a doubt say this is one of the greatest horror movies I've ever scene. Even if horror isn't your thing, I'd still highly recommend giving The Babadook a shot. You won't regret it."

","I had big expectations when I went to see this film. The reviews are great, and it has went down well at the box Office around the world too.<br/><br/>But, It did not live up to my expectations. First of all, I found it not scary enough. It should make you jump once in a while, but it doesn't.<br/><br/>I also have problems With the plot and the story. A young, distressed mother tries to cope with her demanding and somehow disturbed young son. They have a struggle in they're daily life. The mother soon finds she is suffering from insomnia, and seems to becoming seriously mentally ill, totally worn out as she is. Meanhvile her son has made contact with a scary creature called The Babadook. This part of the film actually works fine. The actors portray this struggle convincing and we sees to be watching a psychological drama, with people who are living on the edge.<br/><br/>But, when the Babadook appears it somehow does not work for me. The scary monster is somehow misplaced into this story, and I did not like the special effects, which seems outdated. This film wants too much for it,s own good. I found therefore it not to be a very good scary film.<br/><br/>I have seldom been in at the cinema during this sort of film, only to discover that the audience chat, and laugh at the wrong places. I think the mainly young audience did not expect the melodrama that takes place here.<br/><br/>But the acting is really strong, the scars are not. It you expect a new film like Sinister, you will be let down."
"bryank-04844","10","4","8","11 August 2015"," 'The Babadook' is quite possibly the scariest film since Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining'.
","If you've met me, you would instantly know that I'm one of the biggest advocates of the horror genre. I just have to get my hands on every horror title and at least view it once. No matter if it's a terrible B-movie, one that has a treasure trove of blood and entrails, or a slow burn psychological horror, I'm usually a fan of the horror genre in general. I love having nightmares more than the usual puppy dogs and ice cream dreams, and I love when a movie truly scares me so much so that I'm a bit frightened to walk down my dark hallway at night. I know it's a twisted mind set, and maybe it stems from my dad bringing me to see 'Aliens' at such a young age in the theater, but the horror genre is where I feel most at home.<br/><br/>Now over the past decade or two, there have been only a few select movies that have actually scared me. Most of the horror films as of recently rely on standard horror beats to muster up cheap, fast scares that come across more silly and stupid than anything. It's that 'once in a blue moon' where a horror film does everything right. And that blue moon is 'The Babadook', which is an Australian horror film written and directed by actress Jennifer Kent. 'The Babadook' is quite possibly the scariest film since Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining'. It's a story and film that will stay with you for days and keep you up in the middle of the night, scared to look out over the covers and walk alone down the dark hall in your home. It's not only one of the most frightening films I've ever seen, it's also a fairly endearing film too that shows the story of a single widowed mother of a young boy with an active imagination, and their struggle to keep a happy life.<br/><br/>Sam (Noah Wiseman) and his widowed mom Amelia (Essie Davis) seemingly lead a happy life together and are still trying to pick up the pieces after Sam's dad died on the day of hi birth. Amelia used to be a successful writer, but now takes care of the elderly in a nursing home to make ends meet. Meanwhile, her lively young boy Sam is having difficulties making friends at school and spends his time making wood and steel catapults to fight invisible monsters. Amelia reads a bed time story to Sam every night before he goes to bed, but one night a strange book shows up called 'The Babadook'. It's written like a children's story complete with pop-ups, but the story is quite sinister that depicts a giant shadowy creature that lurks around you and your house at all times, never leaves, and will eventually kill you.<br/><br/>Soon after she starts reading it to Sam, she realizes this is an evil book and tries to throw it away. Well of course the book shows up again and things start happening in the house to Sam and Amelia. Lights flicker, a strange and evil looking creature appear, one of the scariest voices echo through the house, and Sam and Emilia start to hallucinate. It's not a good situation. What makes 'The Babadook' so scary is it's character development between Sam and Amelia. You can tell there is a lot of love for each other there and they even make a pact to protect each other. By doing this, we feel very connected and attached to these people, and when evil starts to fly full circle, their transformations are even more terrifying.<br/><br/>The creature itself is something straight from your worst nightmares and not something you would ever want to see in person, let alone your dreams. There is an aspect of 'The Shining' put into this story and Essie Davis plays this aspect pitch perfect. Her voice octave range, body language and expressions sell every emotion and action so realistically that she deserves an acting award. And Wiseman's performance as Sam is excellent as well. 'The Babdook' doesn't rely on CG effects, gore, or cheap scares.<br/><br/>Every action and piece of dialogue is thoroughly thought out and executed, delivering one of the scariest films to ever grace the big screen. I can't wait to see this again and scare myself over and over."

","THE BABADOOK (2014) A REVIEW BY JP MAY 29, 2015<br/><br/>""Whether it's in a word or in a look, you can't get rid of the Babadook."" -I can think of no better way to sell a dark fairy tale bit of horror than a rhyming tagline. <br/><br/>MAAA-MAAAA-MOVIE CONDITIONING: A PREFACE The only thing that intrigued me more than the chilling trailer to Writer/Director Jennifer Kent's career-jump-starting psychological horror, or ""PSYCHORROR""-(TM by JP)-titled ""The Babadook"", it was the odd split of love & hate in the comment thread (where I'd exuberantly-posted the trailer), word-of-mouth, and even online.<br/><br/>Examples: ""I thought it was the best horror film I've seen in years!""-stated a fellow horror aficionado. ""I hated it,"" simply added by a distant comedic/horror-loving equal & also by a co-worker. Rotten Tomatoes gave it 96% while IMDb squeaked it just above mediocre with a 6.1.<br/><br/>It is rare to find such a defined variance in cinema. Whether we like it or not, humans are more alike than most care to admit. When it comes to entertainment, there is commonly a majority on the ""yay"" or ""nay"" that spells make-or-break for a film's acclaim & possible cult status. With this film, I can only venture to guess why there were those who did not care for-or even hated-what I consider the most intense, thought-provoking, manipulative, spooky, freaky, nightmare-conjuring instant classic in the horror canon arguably in more than 4 decades.<br/><br/>Perhaps some did not agree with certain parenting behavior, but not being a Dad myself (although I'm bordering on ""Daddy"" status), for Samuel's (Noah Wiseman) Mother Amelia (Essie Davis): a scarring combination of PTSD, a rambunctious child (Ritalin anyone?), and an often-thankless job—I hope were taken into consideration for all the Judge Judys out there. For those who downright hated it, I wonder if that is due to the constant anxiety throughout; comparable to saying what all Potter fans will unite upon: HATE Umbridge! But how many would agree Imelda Staunton's giggle-cringing/rage-inducing performance played a strong hand in bringing Rowling's despicable fear- capitalizing witch-bitch to fiery fruition? Okay maybe not in those many words, but you get the gist. Whatever the case may be, we are all entitled to our opinion (especially film), and I LOVED THIS INSANE GASP-FEST OF HORRORS!<br/><br/>HAAA-HAAA-HOLY SH*T!!! I THINK I JUST PIDDLED A BIT The extended AAAs in my usual section titles are one of the best examples of simple-but-effective fright tactics. I'll admit the trailer's turtle-heading hook left this viewer with: the scratchy, demonic rattle of guttural din implied to be the voice of the Babadook (Tim Purcell is credited as the title character & there is no person credited as ""Voice of Babadook"")—never truly left my head since it first slithered upstairs. Unlike most films nowadays whose previews exhaust every frame worthy of seeing, this unique unsettling-indie's surface had merely been scratched rather than a full-on possession (which may/may not apply to this film for those who have yet to experience it). Uneven flow as seemingly-erratic as the lead's uncertain psychological status added nicely to the dread. Stressful pitch blackness was accentuated by the painstakingly- tackled lighting cinematographer Radek Ladczuk carved into the creepy house's shadows (which were unwelcome characters in themselves) inhabiting the MANY smudge (cleansing)-needed corners. Sign of a great score parallels great editing: they flow without being noticed and do not distract from the story; both strong qualities here. The claustrophobic setting and unknown cause of the many attributable disturbances spin macabre theories up to (and even following) the climax, adding mystery to the mental mayhem already present. The Babadook creature's clever, shoestring-budget-turned- epic-scary ""pop-up"" design and all its movements, sounds, and goosebump-forcing shrieks stood proudly as an effective bit of squirm-infecting.<br/><br/>BAA-BAAA-BAD CHOICE FOR 1 JP DO-NOT-GO-THERE ELEMENT There are 2 types of fully-executed violence I am against in film. Though there IS an ATTEMPTED-rape in my book ""Downhome"", it DID further the satisfaction of the attacker's downfall. Otherwise, I would rather not tread that unpleasant path if at all possible. The other is harm to animals. The only exception would be ""Cujo"", but that's only to put the poor dog out of his misery. Sadly, Kent's script did apparently deem one of these ""JP-DON'Ts"" necessary to intensify threat levels to a ""SH*T JUST GOT REAL!""-status. Foreshadowing early-on does prepare viewers, but this one hoped it would not come to pass. I was sadly mistaken and although tastefully-implied just out-of-frame, the action caused a major strike against it. However, aside from little Noah Wiseman's migraine- worthy screams and occasional poor takes, there was really nothing else to mention dropping ""Babadook"" below a ""Better Than Average"" rating. However, prior to the 1-2 seconds of unfortunate cruelty, I had given it an ""Exceptional"".<br/><br/>Above all aforementioned ""Babadook"" benefits, even those who ""hated"" this film would most likely be lying simply to be contradictory NOT TO AGREE that Essie Davis's brilliantly-vicious performance proved just as-to equal to-all the way to surpassing the title monster's most-frightening-aspect-pedestal. She really embraced Amelia's disparaging spiral downwards to moments of discomfort few actors could convey with such effortlessness. If Davis's career does not pick up from here, the film industry is more doomed than I realized. The same can also be said for the lady in charge: Jennifer Kent. I only wish I had come up with this great addition to the horror elite where few reside e.g. the horror ""Criterion"".<br/><br/>JP'S VERDICT: 4 OUT OF 5 PAWS—BETTER THAN YOUR AVERAGE BEAR"
"Necroambulant","9","4","8","12 May 2015"," Worth the Hype
","The Babadook, like Sinister, is one of those horror movies that has far more of an impact if you happen to be a parent, I think. Personally, I found it to be a substantially more spooky movie than a lot of the things I've seen...relying less on jump scares than a sense of tension the narrative builds up in the viewer(s) combined with a genuinely creepy premise. This is one of those movies like Session 9, where you spend a good portion of the time unsure as to whether there is actually some supernatural agent imposing its malevolent will upon the character or if these apparent supernatural elements are manifestations of a psychological breaking point being reached. There is a very real transition that takes place within both of the protagonists through the course of the movie, especially where the son is concerned, going from a child that would legitimately drive any parent insane to the more stable and coherent voice in the household by the climax. There have been a number of good films to have come out of Australia over the years, but this one is going to be within my top five for some time to come, I suspect."
"skybrick736","8","4","8","30 April 2015"," The Babadook (8/10)
","Rarely, do horror movies that are all hype before release, or seen by the masses, actually deserve the acclamation, but The Babadook absolutely does. This Australian horror thriller bases its fright from a mysterious children's book called Mister Babadook. Once the mother, played by Essie Davis, reads the babadook book to her horribly behaved son, Noah Wiseman, all sorts of chaos ensues. At first it's hard to tell if Mister Babadook is real, or it's the characters imagination, but as the movie continues the pieces to the puzzle start getting put into place. It's unfortunate that the ending left out a few pieces leaving an empty taste after watching it. Anyway, the scares and tension is definitely there in this movie and is quite unsettling at parts. The direction is stellar, it's an original script and solid performance. As a longtime horror viewer it's hard to say movies scare me anymore but Babadook sure did make hairs stand on end and create some tensed up muscle moments. Make sure you don't miss out on The Babadook!"
"GIRFanatic","10","4","8","30 April 2015"," Very Good!
","I finally got to see The Babadook and watched it on Netflix. I was very impressed with how well done the movie was with direction, casting, and overall story and environment. The story involves a mother who comes under attack along with her son after reading a horrifying book. What's interesting is the routes the movie goes and how invested the audience gets in what's going on in the film. I was very horrified and scared not knowing what was truly attacking the son and the mom, and the payoff is very well done. The ending I also found to be both fitting and a nice end to the horrors the mother and son face in the film. I definitely recommend this film to anyone interested in horror movies or wanting to see a film that's a little odd in terms of visuals. 10/10!!"
"pm_alan","9","4","8","17 April 2015"," Finally.
","I've gotten away from writing reviews for quite some time, but felt obligated after seeing a respectable, yet still slighted rating of 6.9 for this brilliant piece of cinema. First of all, lets get the SMALL spoilers out of the way, because they are a GREAT example of why this movie is so great. If I remember correctly (I watched this 6 months ago, and I'm currently watching it and only halfway through) no one dies and there is very little to no gore. This film concentrates on genuine, psychological scares. I also haven't looked at the budget of this film, but my guess would be that there was a small budget used, yet this film has phenomenal, practical effects. The combination of the wardrobe/costumes and the lighting/camera work is nothing short of spectacular. Had I watched this movie as a child, I can only imagine, considering I used to be terrified of movies like Childs Play, It, and the Puppet Masters. There's a few scenes in this one where the costume, camera work, and lighting effects create truly disturbing scenes.<br/><br/>Although 6.9 is very respectable for a horror film, I just can't believe there are thousands rating this below a 7. I would be intrigued to hear those peoples favorite horror movies and their ratings for them. This movie for me is in the stratosphere of horror movies, such as The Exorcist, The Conjuring, The Thing, and Sinister. If the final scene in the bedroom had been a little more frightening I would have been tempted to rate this a 10, and out of the thousands of movies I've watched I've only given out 5-10 10/10 scores.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to anyone, and if you're a horror fan and on the fence, please do yourself a favor and watch The Babadook. In a genre that is highly saturated with pure garbage, from reliance on horrible CGI, to atrocious acting, to cheap jump scares or gore, the minds behind this movie simply understand how to effectively make a horror film. We get maybe 1 or 2 decent horror films a year, and probably 1-2 GREAT horror films every 3-5 years...this is one of the great ones."
"ijbsaddler","10","4","8","4 April 2015"," A tour de force of genuinely intelligent and frightening horror
","The Babadook is a magnificent film. It is so much more than a horror, it is a film about the nature of fear, grief and anxiety itself.<br/><br/>The trailer may indicate that this is a bog standard ""possessed child"" or quiet-quiet-quiet- jump movie. What is turns out to be, however, is a journey into grief, maternal anxiety, hallucinating and acute fatigue, rejection, love, fear, and psychological suppression. The nature of the Babadook is sufficiently opaque (at least initially) to further inject the film with a foreboding sense of paranoia. He is first introduced as a character in a creepy children's book, Mister Babadook, read by Amelia (Essie Davis) to her son Samuel (Noah Wiseman). The relationship between mother and son is at the front and centre of the story, already strained by the death of Samuel's father and brought to breaking point by manifestations of Samuel's own grief and fear. Is the Babadook merely a character in the story? Is he a real malevolent spirit haunting the boy? <br/><br/>As it turns out, the Babadook is neither, and it is not Samuel who is beset by most of the fear, anxiety and grief but his mother, who struggles to cope with everything to the point of descending into madness. As she feels her grip on her own sanity loosen, the activity of the Babadook intensifies, until she manages finally to suppress it, whereupon her relationship with Samuel is significantly healed.<br/><br/>A masterclass of a portrayal of naked grief, fear and anxiety, truly stellar performances from the two leads and genuine terror make this an astonishing, highly intelligent and gripping, haunting, captivating and deeply moving watch."

","The Babadook is a terrifying psychological thriller with a brilliant blend of drama and horror that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The Babadook explores heavy themes and their psychological effect on an individual. The Babadook has been brilliantly written, with excellent dialogue that puts the audience into the story and an interesting story that keeps the audience interested. The directing was great and managed to capture the concept of horror and provide a visual experience that terrified me. Every time the Babadook was mentioned, I was scared, because the character had been designed to be so terrifying and realistic that you believe the creature actually existed. However to actually sell something to the audience is a difficult process, and with great writing, clever directing and brilliant performances the process becomes much more achievable. Essie Davis delivered an award worthy performance, throughout the film she goes through an array of emotions, that require strong acting to complete. To summarise, The Babadook is the best horror film i have seen in years, with great acting, directing and superb writing from Jennifer Kent, The Babadook receives a 9/10."
"KineticSeoul","8","5","11","5 February 2015"," Ambiguous horror movie that I do appreciate
","This is a horror movie that I can understand why some people would really hate it and why some people would praise it. Mainly because it's a movie that needs to be looked at in a in-depth manner in order to be appreciated. When I was first watching this movie I found it spooky, but it didn't really terrify me or anything like that. But it's a movie that can leave an impression after the watch. Because the psychological and psychedelic aspect of this movie really did start to scare me afterward. I was creeped out before I was able to go to bed, and I am at a age where I don't do that anymore. I also found certain criticisms towards this movie by other critics to be unfair. Such as some critics pointing out that the Babadook is too ambiguous and there is no origin story it. There is a reason why the director decided to go in that vague direction and it works. I also enjoy movies where you think you got certain characters figured out, but they make this 360 degree turn. Which can only work if the direction and the engraving of the characteristics of the characters in the story has been done right. Now the cinematography, acting and sound really brings this movie to life with it's creepiness and dreamlike sequences. Overall, if you are a audience member that want to watch a scary jump scare movie with your girl or a guy than this one might not be for you. However if you are an audience member that can have the patience to focus and delve into the symbolic and psychological aspects of this film. Then you will probably at least appreciate it.<br/><br/>8.2/10"
"jaymzhimself","7","5","11","2 February 2015"," ""You can't get rid of the Babadook""
","First off: no, this is not a horror movie. It's a family drama with a dark atmosphere and several decent scares in it. But it's definitely not a horror movie. <br/><br/>With that out of the way, the Babadook actually is quite a good movie. It's a low- budget one which revolves mostly around the protagonist Amelia, a nurse in an elderly home, and her son Samuel. Samuel has very bad temper tantrums and can't sleep because of a boogeyman living in his closet, which comes out at night to haunt him. With no father in the picture, this obviously has it's toll on Amelia, but she copes. Or does she? As the nights become shorter and shorter for her, her burden becomes more and more heavier. <br/><br/>Off course the Babadook has its flaws. The small cast doesn't always deliver, and the usual clichés pass by (like mysterious cellars and cops that don't want to help a poor single mom). But overall, it's pretty well built-up and worth a watch. I rated it 7 stars, and I'm pretty picky with my ratings.<br/><br/>If you want see a teen-slasher movie, a haunted house or exorcist flick with blood and gore, you can skip this one. But if you want to feel uneasy in a more subtle way, try the Babadook. You'll be left thinking while the end credits roll over your screen. Have fun."
"william_herbert","8","5","11","1 February 2015"," An excellent marriage of the Horror and Drama genres
","Director Jennifer Kent has done an excellent job in two very difficult categories. She has married the Horror and Drama genres into a powerful psychological drama told in the fashion of a horror/possession story. She has also defeated numerous frustrating modern-day horror tropes that have plagued many recent movies in the genre. There is not a single clearly-intentioned jump scare in this film. <br/><br/>The film follows a single widowed mother and her six year-old son while they seemingly struggle with the son's terrible attitude and violent tendencies. As the film progresses, however, it becomes more apparent that the son's negative behavior is only what the mother perceives, and that he is simply lashing out due to a negligent, and perhaps borderline spiteful parent. The cause of this spitefulness stems from the loss of her husband in a catastrophic car crash on the day her son was born. The woman is clearly suffering from one or more mental disorders borne from that accident and the subsequent loss of her spouse. <br/><br/>If you noticed, I have hardly mentioned anything concerning the title of the film or any of the horror elements in the film. This is because the story focuses on the horror of losing a loved one, and perhaps the horror of living with psychological issues, and of living with loved ones suffering from psychological issues. The monster terrorizes the family and takes up somewhat significant screen-time. Despite this, however, the Babadook is not particularly significant to the plot and takes a backseat to the more pressing issue of a grieving mother, her struggles within her own mind, and the son's frightening experiences living in a house with an unstable parent.<br/><br/>This film is one that can be interpreted in many different ways. I chose to interpret it in a specific manner, as it has the most meaning to me personally, and will talk about that specifically. This is not the only way to interpret the film, and I would never claim for it to be even the most apt. It seemed to me that the Babadook represented two things throughout the movie, and wasn't actually a real monster. Firstly, and most importantly, it represented the mother's ""demons,"" or her battles with depression, PTSD, and possibly even schizophrenia. She can be seen at first to deny its existence, then to fear and submit to it, then to begin to battle it, and finally quell it. Secondly, the Babadook is the child's perspective of the mother when she is in her manic or violent state. He sees her as a monster, and wishes that his ""real"" mother would not ""let the monster in."" Because the child is six, it is perfectly reasonable to assume that the entire movie is from his perspective, and that we are seeing how a child rationalizes an abusive and disturbed parent's behavior, by separating the individual into two people in order to preserve the goodness of the parent-figure in order to cope.<br/><br/>All in all, I believe that the depth of and power of the directing, the skillful acting on both the adult and child cast members, the masterful audio work, and the extremely well-shot opening and ending sequences all contribute to a high-quality film. The movie receives an 8 instead of a 10 for me due to its occasional pacing issues, inability to reincorporate the book later on in the plot, and ham- handed roach-to-disease symbolism. A definite recommend on this one."
"Robert_duder","7","5","11","11 January 2015"," A very honest effort for an indie film
","My reason for watching this so quickly was it kept showing up on the best of 2014 Lists of various reviewers so I quickly became intrigued. Indie horror films can be huge hits or huge misses and I've seen plenty of both because I love the genre. People were saying this was the most terrifying film since the original Ringu film (one of the truly scary films ever made.) They aren't wrong. The Babadook's concept is nearly brilliant and some of the scenes are downright terrifying. They utilize their moderate budget to the best of their ability. You desperately want to see the mysterious Babadook but they brilliantly keep him mostly a mystery. Using the book and the cartoon on the TV definitely sends shivers up your spine. So all that works very well. Now one of their fatal fatal flaws is in casting. Nearly the entire film is a two person show so they need two very strong actors to carry this film. They completely missed the boat in casting the young child actor. But I'll get to that in a moment. The emotional intensity of this film is very high but they take it almost too far because it almost broaches on campy in certain scenes. The film is dark and dreary and harsh and that works so well so when you border on campy, it takes you away from it.<br/><br/>So I will start with the little boy that couldn't. Hopefully he never reads this because I would hate to upset him but he literally probably made a 9/10 film a solid 7 with just his performance. Newcomer Noah Wiseman is atrocious. He gets slightly better farther into the film but in the beginning he is insanely irritating, obnoxious and literally he comes across as handicapped in some way. If I were the mother of that child I would have gladly fed him to the Babadook. I don't understand why they made him so irritating. He's awful. I suppose if that's what they were going for than Wiseman nails it. But it ruins the movie period. Essie Davis who has a lot of experience is very, very good as the weary mother who is gradually possessed by the Babadook. Her breakdown is perfectly done and she is very good at looking terrified and broken. Some truly outrageous and terrifying things happen to her and she plays the scream queen role very well. I would love to see her return in a sequel if they ditch Wiseman. The relationship between them improves and he gets better and way less annoying in the end of the film but the damage is done.<br/><br/>The best thing about The Babadook is the writing and the setting. Jennifer Kent who writes and directs the film is mostly known for acting but she absolutely has some talent behind the camera. Instead of the film making you notice how little they change locations or how they hide things in the shadows, it feels like that is what you want out of this. Their home is very claustrophobic and the shots are tight on their face and it just makes you feel like you can't breath and it works very well for the movie.

","After a hard day shopping with my wife i was looking forward to settling down to a good horror. Babadook was picked due to all the stars and good reviews that was on the cover of the DVD case. Within two minutes of it starting i knew i wasted money on a movie that looked like it was made with a budget of ten pounds. The kid nearly gave me a nervous breakdown with his constant whining. As for the Babadook itself, very very poor indeed. I was glad when it ended, and even a day later i am traumatised by the the rubbish that my wife and i sat through. How people can rate this movie 10 out of ten is baffling me. Don't waste your money!"

","Why are so many of the reviews here giving this a 9 or 10 taking the time to insult everyone who feels otherwise? I get it with movies based on superheroes or popular book series -- they have rabid fans who lash out. But why this? It's just a horror movie. And, honestly, an overrated one. I'm not saying its bad. It's actually a good watch. But the praise is pretty over the top. It's a well-crafted movie of its type but not an instant classic or any of that hyperbole. One thing I was very happy about was that it actually did follow through with the advertised premise. As I was watching it, about midway through I became concerned this was not going to be a movie about a supernatural creature but rather a message movie about mental illness and child abuse. Thankfully the movie dispels that in the last twenty or so minutes.<br/><br/>It's a pretty good (but not great) movie with a couple of nice scares and shocks. However, I didn't find it to be as groundbreaking or unique as many other reviewers. Sometimes I think horror fans are dying of thirst so every little drop of water is oversold as being on par with ""fill in the blank with a classic horror film."" It's not all that. It's just not. And the mom and kid got on my nerves big time before the first hour was up. This is a movie with a lot of scenes of people being assholes. A lot of yelling, etc. If you're like me that stuff drains you after awhile. I had a headache by the end. Speaking of the end, I'm unsure how I feel about it. Kudos for not tying it all up too neatly but I didn't quite get what the hell Babadook was and, more importantly, why is it eating worms? I kinda like the weirdness of that. Hope they don't ruin it by doing a sequel. Who are we kidding, of course they will."

","In the last 5 years-heck make it 10 years-there are three horror movies of note: Get Out, It Follows, and this film. The key thing that elevates these above all others is the fact that the ""monster"" isn't just some subhuman, unstoppable killing machine. It has moral, ethical and emotional components-in other words the psychology of our own fears. Here it includes the fears many single mothers have that they can't raise their child alone and effectively keep him ""safe,"" combined with the survivor's guilt and intense grief at the loss of a loved one. These things are monstrous and can eat you alive (from your dark insides out). Great acting by the two leads and very good direction from its writer/director."

A product of German Expressionism with some Surrealist tones, this is a true visual experience with a unique stylistic approach.<br/><br/>A troubled mother struggling with grief finds herself at the mercy of her own fear and the fear of her son. This is a truly terrifying thought, that we as humans are able to plague our own lives causing our own destruction. Thus this movie is far beyond the simple minded fear of death, it is about the fear of living and I think this is a way for the filmmaker to tackle a very real problem today and that is of depression.<br/><br/>I found myself thinking about this movie for several days after watching it the first time until I finally sat down and watched it again, and despite some underexposed shots I still think that this film deserves an 8/10."

","Tension is fun isn't it. Right from the outside this has it in spades. Sparse swathes of near silence punctuated with loud noises, innocent at first, but constantly building. Our two main characters are damaged, the mother wears it on the outside, the child more internal, but between them the issues slide deeper and darker. A family failing to recover from tragic loss of a husband and father. The simple car crash device could seem hackneyed and their house, minimal grey and drab, well, what I'm saying is the tropes are all there. The spooky kid, a conduit for the unseen terror that lurks and the consuming madness it brings. What's real, what's fiction, as the mother's sanity unravels. It's fun to get mixed up in the fantasy, but there's something much more interesting in looking at what's driving this, the mother's depression, delusion, anxiety, sleep deprivation, parental inability, it's all fuel for a sometimes formulaic thriller, but one that still works really well. I'm never keen on the supernatural, but when it has some anchor in reality I'm on board and this walks the tightrope just right. It helps that both Essie Davies and Noah Wiseman work so well, especially as the screen is largely theirs and theirs alone and it's nice to see a film that knows how to play to its strengths.

","It's astounding, how well developed the movie's horror is. It starts with the childish imaginary terrors that the son of the protagonist suffers from at night. Whenever the son cannot sleep, the mother (the main character) soothes him and reads to him until he's back in the realm of dreams.
One evening, the son had a nightmare again and the mother let him choose the book, which she reads to him; it's called 'Mister Babadook'. At first, it looks like a beautifully drawn childrens book, but it quickly turns out to be anything but that. The son is genuinely terrified by it and even the mother is apprehensive.
A couple days later, the mother destroys and throws the book in the trash bin, but finds it, just the next day, lying in front of her home's door - the pages that she destroyed glued together. And from here on, the real terror starts.
The son claims again and again that he had encounters with the babadook in his bedroom and the mother hears strange noises and has visions of the clawed monster as well. The babadook grows in power until he is nearly omnipresent. After a heavy, terrifying fight against the babadook, which is the climax of movie, the mother and the son manage to lock the powerful monster in the home's basement, which makes it his life prison.<br/><br/>What also is really well done, is the fact that it's - for the most part of the film - not easy to say, if the events are just psychotic experiences of the mother and her son or if it's really happening.

","Babadook is a special film that takes seriousness with great complexity and stylism, presenting a spooky story through psychological terror (the ability to frighten us with our imagination rather than with the presentation of the monster, villain or enemy) and it does not fail in the unparalleled narrative quality and the sad, decaying and lost atmosphere it holds. I understand the critical reception of the film, after all it is a different shot in an oversaturated genre.<br/><br/>The Babadook is a psychological horror movie, full of unexplained mystery and scenes designed to keep us tense and stressed by the possibility of something. The suspense is real and remains constant throughout the film, being the main premise of this the ability we have to imagine things that are not there, in turn, it presents a story based on the pain of the loss of a loved one, combining the difficulties of fear of the unknown with the horror of eternal goodbye.<br/><br/>With excellent performances and an atmosphere built to give us a feeling of maximum discomfort, The Babadook manages to penetrate strongly between our nerves, especially if we investigate its surface and go deep into its depth.

","The Babadook is one of the best horror films I have ever seen.

IMO, The Babadook was marketed so poorly. The trailer prevented me from seeing it for a very long time. Monster thingy from a children's book? Meh. <br/><br/>BUT...once I saw it, it blew me away.<br/><br/>The Babadook is actually a very complex story with a multitude of layers. It is not your average supernatural monster movie. It builds tension, frustration, and dread expertly and then hits you where you least expect it to. <br/><br/>The acting is top notch, the cinematography is brilliant, and the mood is bleak and gritty and pulls you into the story that is unfolding. <br/><br/>It's a film that builds slowly while making you feel uncomfortable and impatient, but it's done on purpose. If you can sit back, let it happen and appreciate this fact, chances are The Babadook will be a worthwhile ride for you. <br/><br/>The Babadook does not spoon feed its audience and much is left to the viewer's interpretation but it manages to do it in a way that doesn't feel so distant or removed.

"montalvovanessa","7","2","3","27 March 2017"," Grief in women as the boogeyman (SPOILER ALERT)
","Jennifer Kant's film, The Babadook, is a brilliant film in where you find suspense and inclusively, great sound effects that keep the viewers ""over the edge."" Although the monster looked unrealistic, I find this film to be astounding due to the various ways Kant illustrates in showing the living hell a widow lives in their daily life. For instance, the falling down scenes were a great way to portray her devastation of the car accident in where her husband died. It demonstrates an internal emotion Amelia suffers through from the stress and resentment against her child that is largely built inside of her for years. A great indication to the stress has to be when she has trouble sleeping and it soon transfuses into her child. Additionally, scopophilia is used in a scene in where she is caught staring at a couple making out in the parking lot, which only prompted her fantasies. I imagine it is not a coincidence to learn that Amelia used to write children books in her spare time and a children book that was found in her bookshelf is the result of the appearance of the boogeyman. It is then suggested that the allegory of the boogeyman is the women who are in grief due to the death of their partners. Jennifer Kant used smart tactics throughout the film that showed Amelia's poor mentality and although she spent years trying to portray an image that she was all right. The boogeyman is that ugly part of Amelia that she had tried to bury, but is soon displaced when she kills her pet and made several attempts to do the same to her own child. Throughout the film it is shown an Amelia trying not to get the boogeyman get the best of her and Samuel fighting for his own life. In the final scenes, we are shown that even though she is learning to cope better in life, she will always have the boogeyman around her and the reason she is scared of the monster is because it makes her do terrible things that she would never imagine. This film is so great because it brings to light a topic that many women suffer through and is inclusively hard for others to understand, therefore to create grief as a monster was a brilliant way to show the audience what people live with."

","After losing her husband in a car accident on the same day of her son's birth, troubled widow Amelia (Essie Davis) must now deal with her grief from losing her husband while struggling to raise her troubled son Samuel (Noah Wiseman). When Samuel begins to believe that a monster has entered their home through the pages of a children's book, Amelia soon discovers that her son is telling the truth.<br/><br/>I've spoken about this before but I am a big fan of horror films. I don't mind either type of horror film, the more violent ones where the more graphic it is the better as long as its not gratuitous or the psychological horror films that like to play around with your mind. I prefer the latter so I was pleasantly surprised when I learned that this film was more like the second. Despite being the film being called The Babadook and featuring a monster that also called The Babadook, it does take a backseat here. The film chooses to focus on the relationship between the mother and the son. Without giving too much of the story away, the film is about how the family, more specifically the mother, is coping with the grief of losing her husband and having to take care of her unstable son and dealing with the stress coming from that. With Amelia having lost her husband and Samuel having lost his father, they only have each other and this fact strengthens their relationship. The fact also becomes very evident to the viewer while watching and because of this, it is their film. You don't mind this because of the performances of Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman. Davis embodies the character of Amelia beautifully as she portrays Amelia's fear and fragile mental state with ease making her feel real and genuine. Wiseman's Samuel may seem annoying and obnoxious at first but he is simply a kid acting the way one would if they were in that kind of a situation. There are no jump scares in this film as its horror stems from how the monsters seems to affect the family emotionally and their relationship. I like this better as it isn't simply stupid characters running from one scare to the next as is often seen in lesser horror films. It chooses to scare in a more subtle way. Some may be turned off by its pace as it does take a while to get going but I did not mind this as I was becoming invested in the characters and this helped me to better appreciate what happened later on. It's not too flashy, for lack of a better word, either but that is probably because of the film's budget but based on the story, it was not necessary. I think I can easily say that after watching this film that it is now in my top 5 favorite horror films and definitely in the top 5 films of 2014. Just give it some time and I swear you will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>Score: 9/10 keithlovesmovies.com"

"eliselrosenberger","10","1","1","8 April 2019"," Great Allegory!!!
","***SPOILER ALERT***
The Babadook, directed and written by Jennifer Kent, creatively uses the primitive foundation set by previous horror films that showcase our beloved monsters, such as Frankenstein and the Wolfman. As we learn more about main character Amelia, her son and the struggles they have overcome the last seven years with the loss of husband and father, we see that Kent gives this imaginative figure that haunts and lingers over their shoulders, the Babadook, a different face- mental illness. This film is very similar to Inside, directed by Alexandre Bustillo and Julien Maury, where again, a single mother finds herself depressed after the loss of her husband, and has to literally fight for her life against the monstrous feminine which was analogous of the inner demons of depression.
Amelia's character artfully evolves throughout the film, focusing on each stage of depression from denial to acceptance. She first denies the Babadook/ depression, but after she faces anger and bargaining, she soon accepts the Babadook/ depression, and is able to live with him in a coexisting matter. Using various angles, low key lighting and playing with darks and lights, Kent truly demonstrates the lingering depression and paranoia that mother, Amelia, has. As we see the Babadook doesn't only come at night, but haunts us all day, just as mental illness does. However, most of this film is shot at night, where Amelia and her son are home and most vulnerable in their everyday life. We often see Amelia watching television, with a close up of her face that is highly lit from the screen but swallowed by the darkness around her. Kent also uses camera angles that portray Amelia as cornered or trapped by the Babadook/ mental illness, by providing shots of her from above in bed alone, where again she is highly vulnerable.
This film also plays with sound by using everyday noises such as the opening and closing of doors, clashing of pots and pans and son on. Kent purposefully took these sounds and made them louder, almost giving a chaotic feel that we cannot escape. She also uses sounds of grasshoppers and other insects to provide an underlying theme of infestation- both of the house by literal roaches, but also of the mind by mental illness of depression and paranoia.
Overall, I highly recommend this film as it is highly creative and smart in demonstrating the battle of depression. Kent's The Babadook sets itself aside from other films, in that the main character overcomes depression- unlike other horror films that use depression as the monster such as, Inside by Bustillo and Maury, and Lights Out by David F. Sandberg where mother's with depression die. Kent gives us hope that we can live and coexist with our monstrous inner demons, giving a resolution and restoration to our problems."

The Babadook is a very highly praised film by many critics and movie lovers alike. This film has many surprising and unpredictable aspects to it. One of the most loved aspects of this film is the monster that is the Babadook. He represents your inner most fears as well as the truth hiding inside of us all. This film uses many techniques to help instill terror in its viewers as well as to show the real us. In this film, while reading the Babadook book, the mother Amelia, sees her ""inner most desires"" which are murdering her family. The Babadook pulls out our inner darkest desires which are more than irrational. The film paints Amelia as almost going insane worrying about the Babadook coming to visit her, and see starts seeing him everywhere, watching her every move. The Babadook also visits Amelia's son Samuel. He sees the monster before his mother ever does and she thinks that he is just making up crazy little kid stories. By the end of the film, we have seen the Babadook and seen how it takes over your life to fulfill your inner most desires. We also get to see the true terror of what the Babadook actually is. He is like a mix of a demon and a person all in one. He knows how to get in your mind and never leave. The Babadook is an allegory painted for us about our deepest darkest inner desires. He shows us what our souls truly want and in the most terrifying way possible. It is terrifying because it is what we actually want to be true and we realize how horrible we actually are. This film is a critically acclaimed horror film because it is so amazingly directed and portrayed to the viewers. I would recommend this film to anyone and everyone. Just don't forget to sleep with he lights on so the Babadook doesn't visit your mind tonight!"
"marcusjholley","9","1","1","8 April 2019"," Psychological Horror at its finest.
","*SPOILER ALERT*<br/><br/>Jennifer Kent's ""The Babadook"" (2014) is a brilliant psychological thriller reinvents the stereotypical paranormal monster film that keeps forming questions within the viewer while keeping them on the edge of their seat. Widowed mother, Amelia and her son Samuel stumble across a red children's book that introduces a monster called the Babadook. Lights begin to flicker, cockroaches crawl out from behind the fridge, and knocking on the dresser echoes through the house and the audience feels the presence of the Babadook. The ominous gargling voice of the monster ruffles into the phone as Amelia picks it up in the middle of the night and suddenly, she knows that Samuel is not one to cry wolf. The creativity of this film really stands out when we finally see the Babadook in his most powerful form. The psychological flare of different moods and levels of irritability and aggressiveness that both of the characters experience when the Babadook is attacking, are so personal as they thrive off what people fear. Similar to the ""The Exorcist""(1973) by William Friedkin, homage is paid through the scenes where the bed shakes and Samuel begins to find himself in trouble at school. The film does an excellent job of being unpredictable and not fully showing the monster throughout the film to keep you on edge. It is worth noting that it is not easy to get rid of this thing either. Amelia is introduced to an unprecedented level of fear when she discovers the mended children's book back on her front step as it relays a terrifying illustration of her killing Samuel and the dog. This is one of the many horrifying elements that keeps the viewer up all night just as it does for both Samuel and Amelia; as the Babadook is always lingering within the shadows."

","The movie The Babadook by Jennifer Kent is a film the forces the audience to use their minds to puzzle out the details of the film. The line between reality and dreams becomes blurred as Amelia's mind meshes the two together. The blue-cast and darker colors lent the film a dreamlike quality that made it difficult to distinguish between reality and Amelia's nightmares. The long shadows and dissonant music accompaniment make the viewers second guess whether Amelia was dreaming or awake. As the colors become more washed out and pale, the whispers at the edge of the discordant sounds became louder, jarring the audience and sending them to the edge of their seats. High shots combined with high key lighting left the audience feeling powerless and that there were secrets Kent was keeping from them. As the movie continues, sleep and awake further blend together as Amelia's dead husband demands that she bring Samuel to her. The movie cuts to Samuel as he watches his mother succumb to Babadook. The shadows lengthen and everything becomes darker as the monster firmly entrenches itself in Amelia's mind. As she desperately tries to regain control of herself, darkness engulfs her bedroom while she demands Babadook leave. Whining, high pitched sounds continue, the music reaches a high as Babadook is forced into a basement. It abruptly ends as Amelia and Samuel can finally rest easily. Throughout the entire movie, the director urges the audience to attempt to determine whether the events were rooted in Amelia's exhausted mind or reality. She weaves nightmarish villains slowly into the threads of reality until the viewers second guess themselves as Babadook appears whenever Amelia turns around. The dark shadows Amelia continuously lurks in only emphasizes how vulnerable she is to the nightmare her innocent son tries to warn her about. Just when the shadows seem darkest, Kent offers closure in the guise of a trapped Babadook and a shadow-free house that Amelia and Samuel now live in."

","It is depressing to see some people trashing this movie because it doesn't have jump scares. These are the same people who make Annabelle and Ouija blockbusters.<br/><br/>The Babadook is nothing like these cash grabs. It has a terrific screen play, written by debutante director Jennifer Kent herself. She is in my opinion one of the best horror filmmakers. She understands the genre and does not resort to cheap tricks to sell her movie to today's attention-lacking-and-hungry-for-jump-scares audience.<br/><br/>The lead performances by Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman are also amazing. This is a movie which will inspire debates about it's themes and layers among cinephiles. I just hope this doesn't become that underrated horror movie that everyone talks about but no one sees<br/><br/>But I am pretty sure some people will hate this movie if they watch it expecting a monster flick.

","Truly good horror movies do more than just dole out the jump scares and other cliches. Expertly written horror teases the idea that what is happening on screen actually has a plausible explanation - once we understand what is causing the characters to experience hallucinations and mental illness. The Babadook successfully manages this feat.<br/><br/>Amelia is a single parent grieving the loss of her husband while simultaneously raising her only son, who is showing signs of autism. While her son has an overactive imagination - seeing monsters and the like - the tension and isolation he causes to his mother's life leads her to a mental breakdown. Enter the Babadook, asking to be let in.<br/><br/>What makes the Babadook particularly special is that despite it's horror, it shows genuine compassion to people suffering from the real, invisible, and ever present monsters. Whether that be nurses looking after the elderly with dementia, a mother managing a son with autism, or the feelings of powerlessness experienced by community doctors and support workers. The strain of looking after others with mental problems often causes the carers to fall down into the same hole.<br/><br/>The Babadook is all the more grounded and terrifying because once the patient, intelligent, and observant viewer completes the necessary detective work from the clues in the film - the Babadook is unmasked for what it is.
What makes it truly terrifying, is that we could start seeing the Babadook all around us in our own society,"

","Babadook's beautiful combination of suspense and grief descends each of its audience members into a dark hole where a glimmer of hope is the only way out. The film is presented in such a way where character development and a story driven plot is displayed subtlety but also is very impactful on the viewer. The audience is truly able to sympathize with the main character's grief because there is no control of her surroundings. The sound produced throughout the film are harsh noises to make you cringe, from the grinding of teeth to the constant squeaking of breaks while the list goes on. These examples are few of many constant situations, noises, and images making the audience never able to become comfortable or safe. Babadook is its own work of art where this isn't a play-on from horror films in the past or using familiar horror movie tropes one may consistently see. Rather this psychological horror uses the suppression of this poor woman's grief to create this evil character the Babadook. Ultimately digging down to the fears of an everyday (slightly older) audience to create empathy and disruption of the everyday world. Jennifer Kent does a beautiful job of displaying a truly horrific roller coaster ride which doesn't need anything flashy to instill fear rather a dark realistic idea put into motion with the Babadook's character being an intricate part with all the right pieces falling into place."
"dbrady-83413","9","1","1","28 March 2018"," A deep look into the mind
","The Babadook is not your average everyday horror movie, instead of a ghost faced killer or horrific plague, we meet something more sinister, which is the mind. The Babadook does a great job of not showing you all the cards, it keeps you wondering about who/what the babadook really is. While not seeing the usual horror movie jump scares I still found myself at the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next. In the Babadook, we meet Amelia, a single mother struggling to raise her young boy Samuel following her husbands death. The story takes place in Amelia's home as she tries to voyage through life with Samuel. One night while putting Samuel to bed, she decides to read him a story, but this was not just any story, this was The Babadook. The book told the story of a being who comes down in the night and gets you, but this time the story did not stay on the page, instead Samuel began to see the babadook in the home. Samuel does his best to protect him and his mom from danger, but his attempts only create a rift between him and his mother, as the story progresses we see Amelia become more agitated to the point where she is possessed by the Babadook. Amelia, begins trying to kill Sam, forcing sam to use his craftiness to subdue his mother, and defeat the Babadook. In the end, rather than destroying the Babadook, Amelia was able to control it. The only question now is what really was the Babadook. In my opinion this is what makes the movie so great, is does not hold your hand, it forces you to look deeper to find the meaning. This film is a great allegory for mental illness, which is what the Babadook truly presents. In the movie we see as things get tougher for Amelia, the Babadook has a greater effect. That is because the Babadook never existed, it was all in Amelia's mind. As the story came to a close Amelia was able to control her mental illness, which is represented by the worms being consumed. This connects to everyday life, because The Babadook is everywhere, the only difference is it is up to you to decide how dangerous he can truly become."
"alec_pace","9","1","1","26 March 2018"," Tread Cautiously in The Babadook
","Audiences have been overwhelmed with the same genre tropes in horror films from the past few decades. From countless jump scares to insignificant horror monsters, audiences have been waiting for a horror film that exceeds and leaps over the rest. Is The Babadook that one that exceeds the rest? By just enough. Like its predecessors, The Babadook is plagued with the same traps in contemporary horror films that does nothing but bore the viewer. From the overdrawn score to the tawdry children's book chant of the Babadook, the film gives viewers a feeling that they've been there before. But, what makes The Babadook work is the hypnotic build-up of tension. And this tension is manifested from the conflict within Amelia. In the house, the overwhelming use of low-key lighting not only paints the ominous tone of the film, but also the inner turmoil that Amelia is struggling with. As the presence and pressure of The Babadook increases throughout the film, she becomes even more irritated and dangerous. She becomes more than just a helpless character in a classic horror film, but she morphs into the monster that is feared. Amelia symbolizes the breakdown of boundaries, becoming the embodiment of the abject. From the beginning, Samuel is presented as being the major conflict in the film. His frequent emotional outbursts and sometime violent behavior paints Samuel as the leading issue in Amelia's life. It is not until later in the film that the audience realizes that Amelia is the true destructive force. The constant close-ups of her face give the audience an intimate relationship with her and a deeper look into her emotional unraveling. And finally, the beautifully crafted allegory of mental health and instinctual repression is the major selling point to this film. Unlike many other modern horror films, The Babadook presents a great amount of character development and an in-depth analysis of a troubled individual. In this sense, The Babadook should be celebrated for not what it does well, but for what it does for its characters."
"richardmcauliffe-94421","9","1","1","26 March 2018"," The Babadook
","The Babadook is an Australian film directed by Jennifer Kent being her first feature length film. The film is about a widowed mother named Amelia Vannick (Essie Davis), her son Samuel Vannick (Noah Wiseman), and Samuel's obsession with being afraid of the monster within their home. Amelia at first takes this fear of monsters to be something that is normal for an adolescent boy, but soon finds out there is something lurking within the home when a book named Mr. Babadook finds its way into the home. The film gives us a look as to why Amelia is a widow, and how she is coping with it after all these years. On the anniversary of her husband's death the Babadook tends to grow in strength. The Babadook could be seen as an allegory to Amelia's crippling depression and sadness that she has dealt with for quite some time. The building of her emotions finally come out as a monster known as the Babadook. If you as a viewer are looking for jump scares within this film, you will not find any here. Rather, you will find a psychologically intense film that shows what true depression and sadness can do to a human being and what it can drive us to do. Jennifer Kent looks away from conventional horror films and the blood and gore that we may all be used to, instead she uses the human psyche as a plot point in this critically acclaimed film."
"seanasmyth","9","1","1","26 March 2018"," True Terror with a Great Plot
","I would highly recommend this movie. Not only was I shaking in my seat for most of the film, but the film is also eloquently designed. <br/><br/>POTENTIAL SPOILERS: There are two key contrasts in this film that made it so critically acclaimed, which are the physical vs psychological manifestation of the Babadook and mother vs son as the victim of the Babadook. These two contrasts are played on throughout the entire film to create an elegant story and fear around the Babadook. <br/><br/>ACTUAL SPOILERS: The mother/son as victim of the Babadook is seen multiple times throughout the film; such as, when the son has his manic fit and passes out and the mother becoming ""possessed"" in the later portion of the film. This contrast is used to develop the story of the babadook. As told in the book, the babadook feeds and grows off of the denial of it, which is seen in the mother's repression of babadook's existence. This only causes the babadook to grow stronger from the mother and attacks her more both physically and psychologically. This contrast of the babadook's manifestations is what truly makes this creature terrifying. The babadook attacks the mother through the fear and repression of what her eyes are seeing, but it specifically attacks her psyche to the point of possession in the later half of the film. These two contrasts create the perfect analogy for the allegory behind the babadook, which is the repression of her husband's death. This is shown perfectly through the effect that the babadook has on her and her son."

","*Spoiler Alert
 Throughout the beginning portion of this film, you may feel the need to pop an Addy (only if prescribed, of course). The Babadook is a film that starts agonizingly slow, however, do not let this cause you to make assumptions about the ending. The twists and turns are hardly predictable. Director Jennifer Kent brilliantly sets up the beginning to cause viewers to let their guards down. You most likely will fall into this trap as well. Amelia's rambunctious and annoying son Samuel is convinced that a monster is alive in their home. But of course, any sane adult would know monsters are not real, right? RIGHT?!
 The Babadook explores the confinements of the desperate mind and what it is truly capable of. If you believe a dark and dingy home is claustrophobic, imagine being stuck inside the immensely grieving mind of Amelia. She cannot get over her dead husband, and each time she looks at her son she is reminded of him. However, viewers get a quick glimpse of her husband, and holy damn, he was a hot, modern day Jesus (so we can kind of understand why she is hung up). In all seriousness, Amelia's desperate state of hopelessness takes her to places she never wanted to go; she becomes capable of committing unimaginable things without even knowing it. The most terrifying part of the whole film is that the Babadook is indeed real, and in all its horror, it may very well live inside each and every one of us. The posing question at hand is, are you going to let it in?"
"sarahmwieczorek","9","1","1","25 March 2018"," Grief and Terror
","Kent does a spectacular job relating a life full of grief to a bedtime story monster. Amelia's tragic events in her life are a reason for her depression and the hardship of loving her son. As Kent highlights the gloomy, dark colors throughout the movie, Amelia goes through her life living in the past and not realizing what a promising future her and her son could have. Both Amelia and her son are stuck with a children's book, ""The Babadook,"" which ends up haunting their lives. The monster portrays the never-ending grief Amelia has in her life. It is not easy to get rid of the monster just like it is difficult to come to terms with her past. Her son has an unbreakable bond with his mother when he swears to protect her no matter what. He believes the Babadook wants to kill him and his mother and after he is medicated, his thoughts become out of control. When Amelia realizes her son's hallucinations might be real, she realizes that her son has been warning her.<br/><br/>The allegory in The Babadook, I believe, is the grief someone can have once tragedy hits that person's life. That bottled up grief and no reason to move forward eats a person from the inside out. The monster in this movie portrays this by always coming back. In the end, grief will always be there, but there is ways to cope with it to not ruin the future."

It's okay to look under your bed for this film, as it provides unnerving terror through a children's book. Audiences are immersed in Amelia's family and the heartbreak they have endured over the years. Through a dark setting where one may call home, this family is being stalked by their past that has become their present. Amelia is on a constant journey of grief, allowing this emotion to anchor her in every physical and mental way possible. The Babadook portrays the burden of grief as a dark, intimidating figure who controls the mind and deprives this family of functioning by eerily weighing over the home and its occupants. This film shows audiences that one must come to terms and nurture such feelings, without allowing them to haunt their lives through a heartwarming ending between Amelia and her demon coexisting. <br/><br/>Whatever you do, do not let it in.

Let us see if the ones we love(d) will come back and haunt us with in the corners of our everyday lives in black trench coats, top hats and knitting needles nails...
While observing the clear depression displayed within the home and play of Amelia (the Mother) throughout the course of each scene we understand the sense of longing. Curiously though, even though this is a very smart and thought out book I have a question: Who left the Babadook book? Was it her dead husband (Oskar) who undeniable the Babadook has taken the shape of to control her? Or is it the way that we are able to see that poor Amelia cannot move on without Oskar? Besides that question we are able to see the beautiful increase of shadows within each shot until the Babadook has almost completely taken over. I'm not sure how Mrs. Kent pulled off such a beautiful and compelling story that pulls you in from beginning to end. But I can be sure of three things: 1. Don't read books that are left on your front porch. 2. BE sure to let things go, it's not healthy to hold onto them. 3. Don't let it in."

","If mental illness could be personified - then The Babadook would most certainly be one of the top contenders. This film is not an ordinary horror film saturated with nudity, gore, or cheap scares. Instead, director, Jennifer Kent, delivers an intellectual film artistically portraying the constant battle that the human mind engages in- the id vs. the ego. Many horror films will portray mental illness as mystical and terrifying for the sake of shock value, but this is where The Babadook differs from other horror films. In this film, mental illness itself is not the source of horror- the consequences of us neglecting our mental health is the source of horror. <br/><br/>The film's cinematography demonstrates how Amelia's grief has taken over her life. Her entire house is blue- from the wallpaper to the furniture. Blue is a color notoriously used to symbolize sadness, and in this film, it is used to color Amelia's grief. We also see a play between light and dark lighting in each scene, which is both a callback to German expressionism but also symbolizes the battle between Amelia's id vs. ego.<br/><br/> This film delivers a lesson that anyone could benefit from- Amelia is in a clear state of denial over the loss of her husband as she has locked away his belonging and photos in the basement (i.e her unconscious mind). The film shows us the return of the repressed by forcing Amelia to acknowledge her grief and fight it. She recognizes that she cannot outright get rid of her grief, but she can manage it- a crucial lesson for anyone who may suffer from mental illness."

","The first thing that comes to mind looking back on this movie after watching it is that every time Bugsy appeared on the screen I winced. Bugsy was the family pet. A cute dog. And this is a horror movie. And you know what happens to cute dogs in horror movies. Anyway ...<br/><br/>What a well crafted story this was. A young mother and her young son (Amelia and Samuel, played by Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman) are dealing with his upcoming birthday, I say ""dealing with"" because it's not a happy day for them. Samuel's father died on the very day Samuel was born, in a car crash getting his mother to the hospital. What becomes clear in the movie is that the father's death continues to torment both of them. As the movie starts, Samuel is a troubled child - unreasonably afraid of monsters (under the bed, in the closet and everywhere else) and with massive behavioural problems that make him unwelcome at school, unwelcome even by his aunt, friendless. He throws tantrums at the drop of a hat. And Amelia can't control him. One night he asks Amelia to read him a bed time story, and he picks a book called ""The Babadook."" Amelia doesn't know where it came from. It's bloody violent and graphic. And it unleashes something.<br/><br/>That much I understood, but from that point on I became confused about what exactly was happening. But even if confused, I was admiring this movie. It's one of the better horror movies I've seen in recent years. It leaves a great deal to the imagination. It ends on a somewhat ambiguous note, letting the viewer interpret this in pretty much whatever way the viewer chooses. Was the Babadook real? Was it a figment of Amelia's imagination? I really don't know. What I do know is that this is a creepy and scary movie. What I also know is that Davis and Wiseman handled their roles very well, indeed. I especially appreciated the way they seemed to ""flip"" about halfway through - with Samuel increasingly controlled and Amelia increasingly out of control. And in the midst of the horror"" - you feel sympathy for both Amelia and Samuel, because of the husband/father's death, and how that affects how they feel about themselves and how they feel about each other and how others look at them and treat them. Regardless of whether the Babadook is real or not, they both obviously have their monsters to deal with, buried deep within them and coming out every year I would think as the ""birthday"" approaches.<br/><br/>I give credit to the writers and to director Jennifer Kent. Kent set a great tone and atmosphere throughout the movie, and the writers avoided making this any sort of graphic, slasher-type horror movie and instead focused on Amelia and Samuel and how they dealt with this terrifying situation. This is truly a fine addition to the horror genre. (9/10)"

","I initially felt pretty discouraged from watching this movie. I remember attempting to start it a year or two ago and not getting past the first 5-10 minutes because I thought it moved too slow. I also heard it wasn't scary in the traditional horror movie sense (WRONG). Even though it was very well rated, I was too thirsty for exhilarating, chest-pumping horror to watch some slow moving indie movie that probably wouldn't even scare me.<br/><br/>Boy was I wrong. This film is S C A R Y: in more ways than one. Just the idea of parenting that out of control kid is terrifying, and seeing how helpless the mom was made me feel a deeper, more profound terror than anything that can be aroused by a slasher villain. Yet, this is not even close to the only thing scary about this movie. There are creepy supernatural elements, disturbing imagery, and moments of spontaneous and enduring horror. <br/><br/>I have a real soft spot for movies that play the ""No one believes me, they'll think I'm crazy, but I'm not!"" card, and The Babadook plays it HARD. This really puts a sour twist to the film, and it's hard not to feel really sorry for the mom. The main actress played the part really well, and one can definitely experience sincere feelings of desperation and dread through her. <br/><br/>It's not a perfect film because the ending kinda turned me off. Still, it's at least a high 8 from me, and I gave it 9 stars here because it's definitely one of the best modern horror movies out there. I wish I watched it sooner, but it seemed to be sold as some slow-moving, ""deep"", pseudo-horror film instead of the genuine horror movie that it actually is. I'd say it's more similar to The Exorcist than a film like The Others, which is a horror movie I'd describe as slow moving and not very scary. Definitely watch if you love horror."

Babadook ain't it. Babadook is different. It understands that throwing monsters at the screen or killing characters that we all know are expendable isn't what makes a horror movie scary. It is whatever is lurking deep within the human psyche. Not only the primal instinct of survival, but also the things we value the most. Abstract things like love, compassion, trust, happiness, acceptance. What makes this movie terryfing is the ever-looming threat to those things that we hold sacred.

It is not intended to make you scary, it is intended to have you understand your fears, and how you construct them both consciously and unconsciously. It says that the more you deny Babadook, the bigger it gets. Our emotions, especially intense ones are just like that. The more you try not to be scared, the more you get scared. Or the more you deny that you feel are afraid of something, the fear gets actually bigger inside you, unconsciously. As Freud says, ""the emotions that are repressed never go away."", as I remember. And at the end of the movie (here comes the spoiler), mom, who repressed her fear, experiences a catharsis of emotions, and faces herself. She differentiates between herself and her fear at this stage. Afterwards, everything becomes much more relaxed.<br/><br/>I am giving this movie 7 out of 10 because it fails to have the story in a concise way. It has excessive prolongations. Though, the story is worked in a clear way, and it is a really good one."

","This is straight up one of the smartest horror flicks of the last several years. That said, there is going to be one major, deciding factor when it comes to whether or not you can enjoy this movie- can you stomach the child actor? Unlike most child actors, he does a great job. But he's doing a great job at being an insufferable little brat. For some people, this great performance keeps them from liking the film. Personally, I found that it added to the tension and to the strength of the film's theme. <br/><br/>This movie is rooted heavily in metaphor. If you want a straight, black and white tale with no subtlety, go watch a slasher flick. If you're searching for an intelligent story that makes you look long and hard at some difficult truths, you'll enjoy this film. And along the way, you'll encounter some great, classic scares."

","The Babadook: Movie Review.<br/><br/>The film has well developed characters, emotional character depth and intensity and very interesting character performances. The Babadook is a very mature and intense film that shows real life horror emotions and heartfelt character moments. The atmospheric tone and vibe of the film is dark, scary and creepy. The movie does not rely on some cheap jump scares, it focuses on realistic fear and tension. Imagine the feeling and situation, where a mother is trying to kill her own child, its pretty terrifying.<br/><br/>The Babadook is an excellent film that depends on the horror of depression, loneliness, pain of losing someone, dealing with psychological mental issues, and fear of a monster lurking in the dark. The film does not relies on the common factors of horror, it's rather depends on its mystery and suspense factor. That's what makes the film more realistic and genuine towards its approach of genre based story telling.<br/><br/>The direction of Jennifer Kent is brilliant.The performances are great. Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman, both are amazing in their respective characters and have given solid performances. The issue with the film that its slow paced and takes little time to build itself.

"GrahamCrawford2005","6","1","1","22 January 2017"," The Babadook is real
","This is a movie I've wanted to see since it came out as it looked to be a fresh take on horror. In the trailers, the Babadook struck me as a terrifying new bogeyman sprung from some collective children's nightmare or the frightened child in us all. The first act of the film is great. It's got the spooky, misunderstood kid, the stressed out single mom barely holding it together and a sickening sense of their household inexorably slipping into the supernatural. The best scenes are where the mother reads from the mysterious children's book to her son about the Babadook and quickly realizes that she has unwittingly (or perhaps not so unwittingly) let a demonic force into their lives. The book itself is a delightfully dark and fiendishly clever creation, and one thinks, a building block for a Freddy-type franchise. (In fact, I would rate the book 10 stars, the movie 5.) <br/><br/>But then the movie turns inward and the mother becomes possessed by the Babadook, so for a long stretch we no longer see the entity. Instead we see the mother in the grips of possession. While this makes sense psychologically, watching someone being controlled by a demonic force is depressingly familiar territory. And watching a once-loving mother act abusively towards her small child is not only monotonous, it's not my idea of entertainment. The arty, ambiguous ending provides a lot of food for thought, though it will undoubtedly disappoint hardcore horror fans.<br/><br/>There's a lot of talk on the message board about whether the Babadook is indeed real or whether it's all in the mother and child's heads. There are good arguments on both sides, but I do believe it's real, if for no other reason than there's a lot of money to be made in potential Babadook sequels."

","Main Review - w/o spoilers:<br/><br/>To me, this movie is like a mixture of The Shinning and The Conjuring. I really enjoyed the first half of this movie. The main kid was an annoying little brat but, if you've ever been a mother, then you would understand. Also, if you've been through what this kid has been through, then I think you would understand even more. I liked the mixture of psychological and the traditional horror aspects that were in this movie. The directing, the acting, the pacing, and the musical score (to me) were all fantastic; all aspects of this movie were executed very well. However, towards the end of this movie I felt abet fatigued. I thought the movie was going in a good direction and then, boom! What I ended up with was not satisfying to me at all. This movies ending to me is absolute crap. The movie hints at what could've been a very sad, depressing, and emotional ending but, all I was left with was a big F you. However, this is a good creepy horror movie. If you love horror like I do then I highly recommend this. However, you may think this movie is going in one direction and it's brilliant, but then all of your hopes and dreams are shattered and then, you're left with nothing. You might feel that way... you might not but, I sure as hell did.<br/><br/>Now to the ending: If I had made this movie... this is how I would have ended it.<br/><br/>The mother kills the boy at the end, the cops come and arrest her, the mother gets into the back of a squad car disorient, later we discover that the mother is hospitalized, the mother doesn't remember killing her son, the mother blames the death of her son on the Babadook locked up in the basement, a doctor tells the mother that there was nothing in the basement and, we cut or fade out to the mother crying and having a psychotic breakdown, and then doctors rush in to hold her down... roll credits. The mother should have killed the boy. I know that's sick and sad but, that's what they we're hinting at. They had the balls to kill the dog but, they didn't have the balls to kill the boy and, they didn't have the balls to end this as a psychological horror movie rather then your all out ghost traditional crap. If the mother had killed the boy and we got a sad ending, then I'd give this movie a 10."
"bsnaybethany","6","7","18","29 October 2014"," Decent but not brilliant.
","I went to the cinema prepared to be scared. At no point did I feel remotely scared. It was a pretty good film (the idea was good) but some bits were a bit too 'Exorcist' for my liking. The storyline had a lot of potential but I don't think it fulfilled to a high level. I admit that some bits were really good and the acting from the boy cast as Samuel was really good and he portrayed the character to be as creepy as I expected him to be. I think that his character was the creepiest bit about it. I don't think it is remotely scary and found myself laughing out loud throughout, as were lots of the people in the cinema with me. So watch it for the storyline, not with the aim to be scared. Slight spoiler: don't watch if you hate animal injury/death."

Still, very much recommended, and I got a new scary (or funny, depending on how you look at it) catchphrase.

"Anyanwu","5","8","22","11 December 2014"," Well done but really not scary.
","It's been awhile since I've posted a review so I hope this helps. I did not come away from this film feeling haunted. A strong, mind that I did not say great, film leaves me with a feeling of dread even after the film. It really has to make me feel uneasy while watching and keeps my eyes glued to the screen. Lucky McGee's The Woman did that. The Babadook did not. It was well done in the sense that it sets the mood for bad things to happen but it did not push through all the way toward terror and dread. Jennifer Kent did a great job in her first film both in writing and direction. I would say Andres Muschietti's Mama had a stronger feel for horror. I'm not a fan of the stereotypical woman who is generally weak in the face of major horrific issues whether they be internal or external. And this may be My problem. One, a soft female protagonist and Two, the origin of the evil force. I went on the statement put out by William Friedkin that this was a great horror film. Friedkin's endorsement was the impetus since I rank The Exorcist as the greatest horror film of all time. Alien is next. Both have smart, strong female characters that face an evil that is external to their understanding of reality. So The Babadook scores low for me there. My criticism is probably more a result of my preference than what the film really delivers to a general audience. I cannot see why anyone would give it one or two stars. I think you have to have a bad looking film for that. But, I thought the mood that Kent sets was great it just didn't send me over into that dreaded feeling. And I surely didn't think about it once the film was over."

","I was genuinely disappointed. It's not often you see a horror film receive so much praise and I guess that put my expectations a bit high. I found the movie to move along quite slow. There were, in my opinion, very few scares. It was all build up and no delivery. I really disliked the characters to the point that they were becoming difficult to watch. First the child was unbearably annoying and then the mother. I understand that the family was meant to be portrayed in a troubled light but it was done in such a way that really made you hate them. All in all I think this film is extremely over rated. It isn't the worst paranormal film iv seen but it certainly is not the best."
"oOoBarracuda","1","5","12","7 April 2017"," The Babadook
","Horror movies are tough. Genre enthusiasts seem to constantly be reminiscing about the old days while new fans are enthralled with what they see, occasionally ignorant to what came before. The Babadook, the 2014 film by Jennifer Kent was heralded by many as the best horror film of 2014. As a horror enthusiast, I was excited to see the ""new take on horror"" that people were calling The Babadook. After my first viewing of The Babadook, I was simply disappointed, the more I thought about the film, however, the more I began to actively dislike it. The film stars Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman as a mother and son team who rely on each other as the only family they have left when suddenly their lives are interrupted by an evil spirit who seeks to possess those it comes into contact with. ""This premise of two people solely reliant upon each other who then have to deal with a possession sounds a bit like Rosemary's Baby,"" I thought to myself, making me even more eager to begin the film. I was wrong--so very wrong, and although I hesitate to say anyone else was wrong who called this a ""new"" horror film, I definitely don't see the hype surrounding it. I found The Babadook to not only be a poor excuse for a horror movie--it really never picks a genre, and that's fine but a film calling itself a horror movie should be, but a poor film altogether. Just add this one to the list of films I don't understand their widespread appeal.<br/><br/>Amelia (Essie Davis) is drudging through life as a single mother to her only son after losing her husband in a car accident on the day her son was born on the way to the hospital. Emotional exhaustion and depression has seemed to take over Amelia's life. Despite her dismal existence, she seems content to live in her somber solitude refusing to make plans or leave the house much. Amelia's son, Samuel (Noah Wiseman) is a large part of why they never leave the house; he has managed to ostracize all those around him, including his aunt and cousin with his behavior. Samuel makes weapons and takes them out of the house, he yells and screams, and is odd and unpleasant to be around. Despite his many behavior problems at school, Amelia always takes his side against authorities because Samuel knows exactly when to act affectionate towards his mother, manipulating her at every turn. Once Samuel is kicked out of another school, again, Amelia is at the end of her rope and decides to keep him home for awhile while trying to find another school for him to attend. One night before bed, Amelia reads Samuel a book she has never seen before about a monster. Unsettled after reading such a book, Amelia begins to find traces of the supernatural monster in her home. Initially refusing to believe in a spirit possessing her home, Amelia eventually realizes The Babadook has entered she and her son's lives and is refusing to leave. <br/><br/>""A psychological horror about a single mother who becomes possessed by a monster that wills her to kill her 6-year old son."" That's how The Babadook was described on its own Kickstarter page, that's not what was delivered to the audience, however. I fail to see the psychological horror element of the film, and that is my favorite horror sub-genre. What was psychological was the fact that more than a horror film, The Babadook is a case study on how debilitating PTSD can be. Another struggle I have is that the Babadook is only in half the film. I prefer a director shows rather than tells, so it's not a problem on its own that we rarely see the monster in this film, as long as we are given the atmosphere of the monster. The problem is, instead of a monster's presence being established all we really get is a series of uncomfortable situations that could easily have been the doing of Amelia's out of control child. The Babadook more clearly exists as a family drama showing the deeply engrained problems between a mother and her son. The relationship between Amelia and Samuel is toxic, abusive, and enabling. The two share almost no mutual respect for each other, as they are each entrenched in their own life position to actively participate in the lives of each other. Amelia is run down, as single mothers often are, but to never accept or seek help for her son's defiance is digging her own overwhelmed grave. Despite being heralded as a unique take on horror, there seems to exist little evidence of such. The look of The Babadook appears to be the love child of Nosferatu and Freddy Krueger, so nothing new there. In fact, seeing the Babadook proves to be thoroughly underwhelming. Some horror standbys are utilized such as the fully-clothed bath, the flickering electricity, and the dog being able to ""sense"" the demonic presence in the air. The nursery rhyme score has also run its rounds in the horror genre. The atmosphere said to be created throughout the film appears to borrow from German expressionism, but the bleak colors aren't enough to caputre that style, nor do they add to the atmosphere of the film, they simply make the picture dull. With no character enjoying an arc to their story, without any standout performances, and devoid of any real scares from a largely absent ""monster"", I certainly hope this isn't what horror as a genre has devolved into."
"Mikel3","Null","5","12","24 October 2015"," A drastically over-rated film and definitely NOT for animal lovers (spoilers)
","(warning: spoilers) The movie had potential with the weird pop-up book idea and the strange kid, then went downhill steadily. It finally just became a pretty typical possession/haunted house movie with cheap thrills, shadows in the night and voices in the dark, is she going insane or is it real... and the payoff is a ridiculous ending. The police of course never believe the victims when then go for help. Also, the scene with the cute family dog being cruelly killed was totally unnecessary. Why is it so often when you see a pet dog or cat in one of these films they end up dead? It's so predictable and over done just to get a grim response from the viewer. Yeah, I admit it bothers me more seeing an animal get murdered than a human. Perhaps cause they're often more loving and often defenseless. I suspect I'm not alone in feeling that way. I wasted time on this over-rated piece of junk. Just goes to show you can't always trust the IMDb ratings. The ending was totally silly, mother and son both need some serious therapy staying there and keeping it as some sort of pet. I know many of you will disagree...still that's the way I feel. I'm hoping to warn others who might feel the same."
"Josh_Friesen","9","5","12","13 January 2015"," The Monster Within
","A deliciously strange combination of the Exorcist, Repulsion, and Dr.Seuss, Jenifer Kent's debut feature The Babadook is simultaneously true to the roots of horror and daringly original. Anchored by a brilliant performance by Essie Davis as a single mother attempting to raise a problem child without becoming a monster herself, The Babadook is possibly the best horror film to come out since Guillermo Del Toro's Pans Labyrinth. And yet, to say this is the best modern horror film in years feels odd, primarily because The Babadook has very little in common with the recent trends of jump scare found footage films (Paranormal Activity) or torture porn films (Saw). No doubt, fans of these more recent horror movements will be disappointed. Jenifer Kent's film is a better fit in the cannon of 70's classics that capitalize on the primal fears of parenthood (Rosemary's Baby, Don't Look Now, The Brood). Much like these masterpieces of horror, The Babadook is a film with depth, atmosphere, and ambiguity but most importantly it's terrifying."
"rigden33","10","5","12","25 December 2014"," No cheap scares. Generally scary and has a great story!
","I don't get the hate from all the reviewers. I felt that this was actually scary. It was great at building suspense, and there were no cheap jump scares. While the kid was a bit annoying at the beginning, it all made sense in the end. Everything made sense and made the movie that much better. <br/><br/>Spoiler below The monster was the representation of the part of the mom, inner demon, that hated her son because part of her thinks he's the reason the dad died. She was also abusing him before the beginning of the movie (hence all the various weapons the son had). She created the book, as you could see when you see the ink on her hands when she goes to the police station, to separate the part that hated him as a monster so the son could still love the mom. The ending was her coming to terms with her inner demon by visiting the basement where all the dad's stuff was instead of ignoring and suppressing it."
"SushiStoner103","9","5","12","22 December 2014"," The Horror Genre Has Just Been Resurrected
","The Babadook had psychologically traumatized me on several levels. The film sustained an eerie, disturbing atmosphere throughout the runtime leaving me on the edge of my seat that even provided ghastly after effects. This was all thanks to the beautifully directed metaphorical structure of the plot and Essie Davis's explosive performance, who portrayed an extremely convincing transformative character from innocent to psychotic. The film does not contain cheap jump scares that release the tension the film delivers, instead Mr. Babadook is not seen for this very reason, to leave the audience speculating. But this film is clearly not flawless it does have a few errors when it comes to the past events that occurred in the character's life that were a little obscure and questionable. And the unresolved sub plots especially the strange and vague ending that left me confused, but wanting for more. Other than that the film was handled perfectly and the horror genre was tackled tremendously. What an improvement on the recent horror films the Babadook makes those look like dog sh*t."
"jeffdrollins","9","5","12","19 December 2014"," A wonderful, wholly original horror film
","When we talk about the ""greatest"" horror films ever made, chances are titles like The Shining, Rosemary's Baby, Halloween, Carrie and The Exorcist are the first ones to be name checked – and for good reason. These films were all made by acclaimed directors interested in far more than just scaring audiences. Instead of barraging us with ""jump scares,"" a horror trend that just won't die, these movies took the fears and anxieties that we as humans are forced to face at one point or another and personified them. Fear of being a parent, fear of the responsibilities of growing up, fear of being punished by a higher power, etc. The ability to put a face on our worst nightmares is what hits a nerve with horror fans and gives these films their power. In that respect, Jenifer Kent's feature directorial debut The Babadook deserves to at least be considered among the aforementioned sacred cows of horror.<br/><br/>Amelia (played by Essie Davis) is a single mother to her six year old son Samuel (Noah Wiseman). Her husband was killed in a car wreck while driving her to the hospital to give birth to Samuel. Six years later she still hasn't dealt with the trauma of losing her husband, repressing her grief and by extension many of her other emotions. This has resulted in her not being the mother she wishes she could be or even living a life with any kind of joy or happiness present. Her son has taken to bouts of tantrums, lashing out violently at anyone who threatens the life he and his mother have come to know as ""normal,"" getting himself suspended from school and ultimately being an albatross to Amelia. What's more, he is prone to sleepless nights, fearful of monsters under the bed or in the closet. This leads us to one fateful evening when Samuel asks Amelia to read him a story before bed. The story, of course, comes courtesy of a mysterious book bearing the name of the film, The Babadook (with wonderfully creepy illustrations by Alexander Juhasz). Mr. Babadook threatens to show the reader ""what's inside"" and scare them to death. From this point on, the horror ramps up both inside the confines of their home and out in the real world but I'll leave that for you to experience.<br/><br/>Kent goes to great lengths to create the isolated world that our two main characters exist in. Even when they step outside, a feeling of claustrophobia is present. This is a world only inhabited by mother and son despite how many people may come and go in and out of their lives. This suffocating relationship can only lead to bad things happening and – SURPRISE! – they do, but what makes the horror of The Babadook stick is that these characters are fully realized and not just types.<br/><br/>Essie Davis is simply amazing in this role. She gives a demanding, emotional performance that asks her to shed many layers over the course of the film's 90 minutes and never hits a sour note. As a sleepless, desperate mother at her wit's end she excels, lashing out at her son and then immediately realizing and regretting her outburst and trying to absolve herself with ice cream. I defy you to find me a parent who hasn't had an identical altercation with their own child. You get the sense that she wants the best for Samuel but knows that she can't deliver, at least in her current station in life.<br/><br/>The other side of this coin is Noah Wiseman's turn as Samuel. He has been clearly coached to be our resident ""creepy kid"" but in this case his creepiness is part of his charm rather than a trait meant to illicit fear. Samuel is not the monster under the bed, he's the one who has to protect his family from that monster. Wiseman's wide eyes and shrill screams terrify us, sure, but we're scared for him. This isn't Omen 9: The Shithead – this is relatable horror, whether you're looking at it from Amelia's point of view or Samuel's. They're both helpless but they're both fighting, nonetheless, against forces aiming to destroy them both.<br/><br/>My only gripe with The Babadook is the look of the creature itself. Mr. Babadook appears to have been ripped right out of some generic J-horror ghost movie, specifically bringing to mind The Grudge – a comparison it pains me to make as I really loved this film and really hated The Grudge. Mr. Babadook moves with a quickness that brings to mind a cockroach scurrying away from light. This would be more effective had we not seen this kind of creature design over and over again for the past decade or so, but I digress. To dwell on the look of the monster is to miss the point of the film all together and deprive yourself of a truly terrifying and satisfying experience.<br/><br/>The Babadook is exciting because it not only understands great horror, it delivers on its knowledge of the genre without being meta (Scream, Cabin in the Woods). This is an original, confident horror film that will only get better with multiple viewings. On top of that, we now have to keep our eye on director Jennifer Kent, as she is surely going to be churning out some excellent work in the wake of the praise this film has been getting all year. The Babadook may very well be a launch pad for Kent and is absolutely a film that will be talked about when discussing great horror, at least when I'm participating in the conversation."
"TheMarwood","4","10","30","18 December 2014"," The film dies at the hour mark and gets sillier and sillier
","The Babadook is a well crafted film that manages to ratchet up some decent suspense, mystery and even some scares, until the thin narrative runs out of steam. The last half hour devolves into a cheap horror show that produces unintentional laughs, as the story disintegrates on screen. The Babadook just doesn't sustain as a feature length film. Essie Davis is excellent as the lead and she commits herself to this material and her fantastic performance keeps the film watchable. Child actor Noah Wiseman isn't as successful, as the boy can be competent in some scenes and so grating in others, you'll need the mute button handy. His performance could have been shaped slightly better and certainly less irritating through editing, but as cruel as it sounds, it's an annoying kid performance. Even with all of its shortcomings, The Babadook is a nice showcase of talent for a first time director and I look forward to her next project."

But there is no guessing game when the answer is in the TITLE.<br/><br/>The acting and directing are pretty good. And I understand that this is a low budget movie... but writing a good story is free.

","I gave this a 5-star rating. It was well done for the budget, and the lead actress is a real talent. However, parts of the story didn't make sense to me, such as the mother's tooth problem. Also, what was with the Babadook being kept in the basement eating worms? That made zero sense to me. I'm not sure why it has all the hype that it got. The best part of the movie was the book. That was very original and well done. I'm not sure why the babadook suddenly fell down at the end and retreated to the basement. Of course, I'm not a fan of possession movies anyway, and had I known there would be something like that in here, I wouldn't have watched it. I'm sure that I'm in the minority on IMDb when I say The Shining also did nothing for me. Anyway, take this review as you will."

","I have wanted to watch The Babadook for a long time and I wasn't disappointed. In fact I learnt something about parenting. Amelia who is grieving and sleep deprived battles through parenting Samuel alone. Samuel is highly imaginative and active, so at the best of times, he's very demanding of a very patient mother. At first it seems as if the Babadook might just be a figment of imagination from both. That is open for interpretation as what it actually is. One thing stood out for me was no matter how Amelia treated Sam, he tried to protect and continued to love her regardless. The scenes where he flinched in shock and terror when Amelia loses her temper were great learning curves for me. Essie Davis is amazing. She has so much talent and calibre, every scene is worth watching twice to capture her facial or body language. Noah Wiseman seem to have already years of acting experience. Skilled child actors are hard to find. The backdrop of Adelaide's cinematography was very well used. The directing style Kent has used is suitable but at times I felt she had borrowed from The Shining, Sixth Sense and Exorcist. Nevertheless, it is the plot that has kept me thinking about the Babadook and not many horror films these days will make you do that. It has proved yet again that a low budget movie does make crew and cast more creative, hard working and the whole venture is all about the story."

There's a monster after them, the adult refuses to believe while the kid continues to insist it is real. Finally the adult realizes the kid is right (ohmygod!) and goes to the cops. Cops laugh and do nothing. Again the adult refuses to believe. There is a mandatory urination scene where the camera zooms into the puddle, wow so unique. Also a mandatory masturbation scene because you know why not. Incredibly cliché i cannot even being to remember everything that made my eyes roll. It was painful to watch, not scary in the least.

","It is difficult to leave a review without giving an analysis of the movie altogether! With a lack of jump-scares, gore, and a view of the monster, modern audiences may not be scared. In fact, they may be downright bored with this film. However, first time director, Jennifer Kent, gives us a chilling, unsettling, sad, and thought- provoking film that will stick with you days after viewing it. No horror movie has gotten under my skin the way this one has in a long time and this absolutely in part to the astounding performances by Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman. The movie tells the tale of a mother and son suffering after the death of her husband leading to her state of depression.In addition to that, a mysterious book turns up at the house which summons the Babadook. What makes this movie so smart is that is disguises so much in the guise of a monster movie, which it truly isn't. The movie takes a serious look at the harmful effects of guilt, anger, and depression with a chilling score and unsettling cinematography. Perhaps this movie's greatest strength is that it is scarier upon a second viewing, as you are able to notice more and look deeper each time. This movie draws the viewer back and keeps you thinking long after the credits role. I highly recommend this movie to any fans of psychological horror. You will not be disappointed!"
"charlottedtomas","8","4","9","27 March 2015"," A New Take on the Boogeyman
","Everyone has their own breaking point, in which unaddressed stress and feelings can overwhelm and wreak havoc in an individual's daily life. The monster from The Babadook represents one's inner demons. The film's premise is that the demons cannot always be conquered because sometimes one has to acknowledge and learn how to live with them, in order to heal and continue living.<br/><br/>For seven years Amelia pushed away the grief, anger, and guilt for her dead husband, in order to be a good mother. However, her depression had always been active and this was represented from her unkempt appearance, unwillingness to start a relationship, the dusky blue color of her home and even of her bedsheets that envelope her at night. Although she tries to be an affectionate mother, Sam is a reminder of her husband's death because an accident happened on their way to the hospital, where Sam is supposed to get delivered. Sam resents his mother's grief and that his birthday was never celebrated on the exact day; therefore, he tries to reclaim her attention by engaging in verbal and physical aggression with obsessive-compulsive behavioral patterns.<br/><br/>In the second half, Sam has a better hold in reality after his visit to the doctor because his behaviors became rational and appropriate. At the same time, Amelia spirals down as her dark personal feelings began to manifest as the children's book boogeyman, Babadook, who told her that ""the more you ignore me, the stronger I get."" Sam helped his mother to face her demons by promising to protect her and helping her regain control by acknowledging the Babadook, as well as in dealing with daily frustrations, which was represented with the bowl of worms. Amelia's recovery was represented by her willingness to celebrate Sam's exact birthday, her black shoes, growing dark roses, and keeping her bowl of worms and the Babadook in her basement."
"michaelpcorey","7","4","9","27 March 2015"," The Babadook movie review
","I recently watched the film The Babadook and overall I would consider the movie a success. The film isn't breaking new ground in horror cinema but what it does, it does extremely well. The story is your typical haunted house while the child is the only one that sees the ghost. They add a little depth to the characters which is good. For me what set this apart in a good way from any of your generic haunted house movies that you would find at Redbox was the acting. <br/><br/>Essie Davis plays the widowed single mother raising a rambunctious and imaginative child. Much of this film you see her struggling with work and raising this disruptive child that puts a strain on her relationships. I could really feel how exhausted this mother was by Essie's acting. You feel her frustration, her fatigue, and exhaustion throughout the film and that really kept me engaged. Towards the end of the film her acting really sells the horror that is involved in this film.<br/><br/>Her son, played by Noah Wiseman, did a great job too. I have a pet peeve about bad child actors. I know there just kids but if a child in a movie sounds like there reading there lines or are saying things that I feel no 8 year old would ever say it throws me entirely out of the movie. Luckily in The Babadook there was none of this. Noah Wiseman was one of the best things about this movie. He seemed like a realistic ADHD kid mixed with a little MacGyver. The kid totally sold me on all his emotions and had me cracking up a few times. He reminded of an English version of Macaulay Culkin from Home Alone that has played way too much Call of Duty and just consumed a Red Bull. I loved this child actor and expect to see great things from him in the future. <br/><br/>Visually this film does a few things that I found really effective. There's a lot in this film about insomnia and I felt the director did a few visual tricks that really shows that struggle that the lack of sleep can have on the human body. He also did some good shots that show how glorious a good night's rest can feel. The film isn't your standard horror film where there is a handful of dead bodies at the end of the film. It's a relatively nonviolent film but relies on suspense to keep you engaged. Even though there is a lack of typical ""scares"" and ""kills"" that I see in most horror films I was still engaged throughout the film. <br/><br/>I found the designs of the ghost to be interesting but nothing ground breaking. The acting by the two leads are what really sold me on the terror rather than the actual ghost. The only really complaints I have with this film is the ending. I felt the actions by the characters were a little strange and unrealistic but it didn't ruin the movie for me by any means. <br/><br/>If you feel like watching a typical haunted house movie that is done extremely well with superb acting then I would highly recommend The Babadook."
"a_baron","7","4","9","16 February 2015"," The Babadook
","Amelia is a young widow; her husband, the father of her son, was killed in a car crash seven years ago, and if the boy is not mad he is slowly driving her nuts with his obsessing over the Babadook, a mysterious entity which is really only a character from a rather weird children's book. Or is it real? Certainly he seems to think so, and his obsession is so out of hand that he is as good as thrown out of school, and is causing his mother's friends to ostracise her. Well, if you are invited to a birthday party where you throw a young girl out of a tree house, what else can you expect?<br/><br/>As far as psychological thrillers go, this is not a bad offering; we've seen it all before of course, as with ""The Exorcist"", but this film - which is really more of a play with two leads and a side cast - has no real resolution, though it must surely have been a baptism of fire for 7 year old Noah Wiseman. Few roles he takes on later in his career are likely to be anywhere near as trying as this."

"JohnB_2016","10","3","6","8 September 2015"," True Horror at it's Best
","THIS MOVIE WAS AMAZING! The deep psychological horror of this movie defines the true meaning of terror. The fact that the husband dies in car wreck, and that Sam and Amelia are the only survivors, is scary enough. Amelia suffering of Oskar's death makes life hard to raise an annoying six year-old son, who is frequent in building homemade weapons and demanding attention. But it's the creature that ties this movie to its core. Mr. Babadook, a supernatural entity that haunts their quiet home, originates from a pop-up children's book Sam finds on his bookshelf. <br/><br/>The noises this creature makes gave me chills. I mean, who would want that whispered into their ears at night, only to get possessed by the creature and have it make you try to kill your son?<br/><br/>But what makes this movie great is the how Amelia's grief and the creature relate. Critics connect the creature's growing control of Amelia to her growing grief and stress from all pressure she gets about her husband. This leads many to think that it was Amelia that was the monster the whole time. That however, isn't the case. (Why have the book if it was the mother was the monster?) It wouldn't make sense."

","Australian director Jennifer Kent toys with atmosphere similar to the one in ""The Others"" while adding her own twist to it. Its ""us"" against the world, familiar things that turn into demonic and crippling fear coming from our own living spaces. Very simple in cast that counts only handful of characters, the movie focuses only on single mother and her little son who are slowly sliding down into danger that lurks somewhere from inside this house. Avoiding the simplicity that would result from simply pointing at one focus of demonic possession, Kent plays around with it, suggesting all kinds of explanations and ideas, cleverly keeping our attention all the way trough. What personally I found most interesting is the relationship between parent and the child used in Horror context, which was rarely if ever been so well used like here. Actors are absolutely brilliant, though in retrospective I am not so happy in using little Noah Wiseman for this kind of movie, because I wouldn't like my own child to be exposed to such disturbing things in such tender age. Call me over-sensitive but I am very protective towards what we are putting in kid's heads while they are still growing up and soaking everything in. We are dealing with all sorts of taboos here."

"TheRedDeath30","8","3","6","19 April 2015"," Not the Film I Thought I'd Get
","I had seen the trailer for the movie and heard the good reviews and admit that I had a preconceived notion of this movie. I was expecting something akin to a haunted house film, albeit with a creature that was promising to be something grim and terrifying based on those trailers. Part of me was skeptical because this genre of ""creepy thing in the shadows"" can be very hard to pull off.<br/><br/>How the movie succeeds in doing that so well is by not really trying to be that style of horror, at all. In fact, this movie has much more in common, in my mind, with a movie like THE SHINING than it does with whatever the latest SINISTER CONJURING hit might be. The horror in this movie may or may not exist in reality and it could possible all just be a symbol used to explore issues of grief and mental illness. It all leads up to a conclusion that has been the core of some debate but will surely do what any great film should, which is leave you asking some questions and considering some meaning from the film.<br/><br/>The horror in this movie stands out because it is used as the backdrop for what is, essentially, the exploration of a relationship between a woman, who has lost her husband, and her son who she sees as the living symbol of that loss. This pang of resentment is amplified even more by the just this side of obnoxious misbehavior of the young boy. The acting is what really stands out, though, as both are asked to be terrific to pull off this script and both do an admirable job. Essie Davis draws you in to liking her overwhelmed mother enough to empathize as she unravels, while Noah Wiseman equally plays a cute enough little kid that you can't help but cheer for him even as he grates your nerves. These two are the anchors of this movie and the major reasons for its' success.<br/><br/>The focus on this damaged relationship wouldn't be quite so interesting, however, without a firm backing in horror and this movie doesn't disappoint. The director does a great job of paying homage to many influences while staying in that old-school mentality of less is more. The monster is never really given in full reveal, but each moment where it does get a chance to shine is truly creepy and unnerving. The glimpses we do get of the monster give the viewer a primal fear, it's the stuff of nightmares, a combination of Dr Caligari, Jack the Ripper and the bad wolves from old black and white cartoons, namely a monster straight from our childhood nightmares.<br/><br/>Like any movie with this much hype it's going to have its' detractors. In the same way, any movie this hyped is going to be hard to truly appreciate. It can be hard to see it for the greatness that it is rather than the greatness it was supposed to be, but watch this movie with an open mind and a willingness to appreciate how much is really excellent about this film. It might just be one of the best movies of the past ten years."
"emmaelaineharvey","7","3","6","31 March 2015"," Don't Be Afraid of The Babadook - SPOILER
","There are many horror films that involve a possessed child and the tragic events they put their parents through. This plot has become quite typical in the history of horror films. From The Omen (1976), The Exorcist (1973), and The Sixth Sense (1999), The Babadook completely turned this plot around by possessing the parent along with the child. At first, the audience feels bad for the mother because she is dealing with a misbehaved, but adorable, son. While watching the scene with the birthday party, I felt deja vu like I have seen this movie before. It reminded me too much of The Sixth Sense where Haley Joel Osment attended his friends birthday party with his mother and he was stuck in the attic which made a scene in front of everyone. Naturally, the mother in The Sixth Sense and The Babadook stood up for her child when people would treat them as if they are freaks. The Babadook showed a strong relationship between the mother and son up until the mother also became taken over by the Babadook. I was pleasantly surprised with the way Jennifer Kent played with the plot. I was expecting the movie to be much more simple but the plot twist in the rising action of the film was very different, but in a good way. All in all, I give this film a 7/10. I love a horror film that separates itself from other predictable, cheesy horror films and The Babadook was a perfect example of that. To make this film perfect, I would prefer a scarier creature than the babadook. The scenes where the babadook appears did not scare me as much because we barely see what the babadook looks like."
"BoubaBonbon","8","3","6","8 March 2015"," This is a movie about humans, not monsters.
","The acting is simply fantastic. The movie solely evolves around the relationship between the mother and the son and they spend most of their time in the house. With other actors, it could have been a disaster. In that case, it was brilliant.<br/><br/>The descent into madness is illustrated in a poignant way. It is dark, sad and oppressing, primarily demonstrated through the dull colours, the succession of scenes where the characters sleep or talk about sleeping, the insertion of television footage and the amount of time they spend wandering in the living room in pyjamas. All supernatural elements put aside, it was a relevant and heart-breaking rendition of mourning, mental disease and depression. This is a movie about humans, not monsters.<br/><br/>The Babadook is a vibrant homage to early cinema (such as George Mélies) and, most specifically, the aesthetic of German expressionism. He is probably the best new villain to have hit the screens in a long time! You see just enough of him to have a good idea of what he looks like, but never enough to completely unfold the mystery.<br/><br/>The only downside, in my opinion, is the unnecessary use of possession movies tropes towards the end- convulsions, shaking furniture, etc. It all felt a little over the top, and even a desecration of its slow-paced, very original approach to the horror genre."

","**SPOILER ALERT** Along with Housebound I'd rank this as the major disappointment of 2014. For all the hype this film has received, The Babadook adds up to what would be an above average psychological drama on the Lifetime channel. In other words, this is not a horror film. Over-used tropes abound (they actually re-use a few within the film) and it makes me wonder if people who praise this flick have ever seen any other horror films, or, horror films are so bad now that anything that shows an inkling of originality is considered great. On the plus side, good acting, sound effects and a few creepy visual effects with the book."

I feel the director was inspired by the legendary The exorcist, but it not even get close. Without telling too much; it's a slow starter and gets the 'scary' moments around halfway in the movie, but it's never really scared.

One day she stumbles upon a book titled: ""Babadook"" and after reading it the so-named entity enters their lives.<br/><br/>I'm going to make one safe assumption here: this movie didn't have a big budget. No, scratch that, this movie relied on GoFundMe for their budget. Putting the story aside for a second, the special effects (if that's what you want to call them) were a throwback to the '80's. I'm talking fishing line, camera movement, and bad cut-aways. Allow me to give one example: there is a scene in which she gets into a car accident. She's driving, the camera shot starts getting wobbly, there are some sound effects and the next thing we see are two cars neatly joined for a fender bender.<br/><br/>As for the story: I still don't know what it was. Was the Babadook an apparition, a creature, a demon? I have no clue, and nor do I know its purpose. But then what can be expected from a movie called Babadook? Yes, the movie was as silly as it sounds. In fact, at one point I thought I was watching a scary version of ""Home Alone"" or ""Problem Child"". With the boy being a miscreant and the mother being a total train wreck it was hard to get behind the two main characters. I don't see what the hoopla was about this film it was a poor attempt at a scary movie."
"gmiranda322","10","6","16","2 December 2014"," Oppressive Memories and ""The Babadook""
","The Babadook (the debut feature written and directed by Jennifer Kent) is a great film. It uses an overarching metaphor and hyperbole to communicate the true horror: the devastating loss of a loved one, and the possibly more devastating state of having to cope with the event. The metaphor and hyperbole, together, identify a demonic/monstrous/evil and oppressive spirit (the Babadook) with the memory of losing a loved one; in this case, Amelia's husband.<br/><br/>To start, Amelia (Essie Davis) is distressed and irritable. This is easily understood. Her son, Samuel (Noah Wiseman), pesters, ""Mom!"" ""Mom!"" ""Look!"" ""Look!"" Even worse (literally), he's excessively fearful and paranoid of monsters. In the beginning, we see fast cuts of Amelia checking his closet and under his bed for these monsters in repetitive fashion, a useful technique for describing Amelia and the life she lives. Her energetic and impulsive son doesn't feel this way, where each day is a drag and there's nothing to live for. Instead, he's concerned with building clever weapons for monster killing--a Van Helsing of sorts.<br/><br/>The film utilizes familiar techniques such as objects popping in the empty spaces of the frame, whether in mirrors or in dark corners; sound effects, like booming door knocks and scratching; lighting and colors, i.e. darkly lit rooms and dark, paled and cold grays and blues. In this particular film, however, there is still tension in daylight. Event still, particularly with typical sound effects, I was impressed. The sound effects stand out intensely, especially when they are at their most obnoxious--pestering even--leaving a lot to the imagination and hoping to never see what one is imagining.<br/><br/>This film can compete with any dramatic film when it comes to bleakness of losing someone–and coping. The film truly explores the bounds of how oppressive, almost demonic, such an event can be. Because after all, such an event is truly devastating and horrific."

For a while I still held out hope that perhaps there was no monster at all, and maybe the screen writers had a card up their sleeve. A twist perhaps?

Add slow with disturbing and sad and it is really difficult to watch.<br/><br/>I like the concept of the Babadook but the execution of the monster didn't really work for me.

I like the entire story underneath a story but I think it went to far for that alternative story to ring true...movies where they are more subtle in regards to this are more enjoyable (Again IMO).<br/><br/>The six year old kid made some pretty impressive home made weapons and traps which reminded me of ""Home Alone"" (I know, strange comparison). He also understood the situation to a remarkable level. I can't see a six year old having the capability to be so resourceful and insightful but hey, we are possibly watching a movie about a children's book horror character coming to life so reality is out the window.<br/><br/>Also the ending didn't work for me either (Again IMO).

The child was amazing, it would have been an incredibly difficult role to play for such a young child.<br/><br/>Everyone else seems to be raving about it. It may have cult hit written all over it. maybe I missed something..."

","*sigh* What can i say... I am not a fan of the movie. <br/><br/>What ruins movies the most for me is when the protagonists actually annoy me. That is not the same as the protagonists being bad/evil or twisted or anything. I mean ... actually annoying.<br/><br/>The mother is an incompetent and emotional wreck, the son is annoying - bordering on mental illness (he does come across as mentally challenged but the issue is not addressed as it would be in ""real life""). Now i do not quite accuse the actors for it - but the story itself. <br/><br/>However - i do accuse the kid for bad acting - and shouting nearly every line he has with three exclamation marks. - Which becomes really really tiring. Meanwhile the mother gives a perfect example of ""how not to do parenting"".. . She is a textbook case of incompetence.<br/><br/>In a horror movie where one is meant to kind of hope for the protagonists to overcome and survive - well... the horror. - It is a really bad thing when the viewer hopes they die a horrible, painful and slow death. <br/><br/>Well - i am being too hard on them, i admit. I do generally dislike kids in movies - and they do have to work extra hard for me not to dislike them. This child is not a good actor - and/or did not get good enough directions. The mother and the supporting cast are alright - but quite one dimensional.<br/><br/>The main factor about this movie though ... : Is it scary?<br/><br/>Well - i think it might have been... but for me the annoyance with the protagonists well overweighed any sense of dread or suspense."

","I liked this one. I was at the first show and suddenly the director shows up!!! She is so cute! She talked before the movie about the actor and the story. And about her influences. Man, I wish she stayed after the movie or something. I just left so I am not sure. I have never been in the first show for any movie! <br/><br/>Anyway the movie is good. She mentioned about how she tried to give the movie a tinge of childlike style. That I do accept and personally I am not a fan of that. The fanciful monster, I am not such a fan of. Of course this movie is not like Mama or something with its over the top depictions or anything. It is still somewhat of an atmospheric piece. But it had elements of fantasy which I am not generally a fan of. <br/><br/>The actors are exceptional! That is one of the strong points. Most of the movie, the monster is mostly hidden, so again it depends solely on the actors. They have done a great job. <br/><br/>I liked the minimalist theme as well."
"NotAnotherMovieCritic","6","6","17","2 November 2014"," Babadook is...interesting
","First and foremost I wanna get this out there, this is pretty much a very annoying movie in a lot of ways. You have a child who is portraying ADHD perfectly and it's quite sad the mother doesn't try and get him help, so instead I like closing my ears through the first 45 minutes at least. Oh and nothing too creepy is happening, so it's getting very Baba-boring.<br/><br/>But then stuff does start to happen. It starts out with the Babadook's creepy knock, then a phone call...and that's all I'm giving you. The film takes a turn for the worse, which makes it become pretty damn good and scary.<br/><br/>I didn't jump, or get too scared, but it did have a creepy like feel to it. The ending scenes are bit European, but that's what gives it an almost realistic feel. The ending was a bit off, but other than that this is a pretty decent horror film."

"Randal_Graves17","6","7","21","24 November 2014"," Slow in parts but overall a fresh take on the 'boogie man' sub-genre...
","I have been wanting to see this film since I first saw the trailer back in August and consequently lost a good few nights sleep thinking about 'Mr Babadook' and those gangly arms of his. What I gathered from the preview was that a creepy boogie man (more than slightly reminiscent of a handful of CreepyPasta characters) from a child's book came to life and started haunting a mother and her son and that as a reaction to this, the mother went a little loopy. <br/><br/>I went into the film with these preconceptions but I am happy to say, I was wrong - for the most part.<br/><br/>The Babadook is more of a tale of loss rather than mental illness or urban legend, as the trailer might have you believe. It starts off a little slow, letting the characters unfold steadily so that you can really come to grips with what you're about to witness. I have to say, at the beginning I couldn't stop thinking 'wow, this kid needs to shut up' and I honestly thought it was his whiny little voice that was going to send his mum over the edge. But then the scary stuff started to happen, and I don't mean Mr Babadook...<br/><br/>As soon as Amelia's character is shunned by her friends/family, things take a grizzly turn and, although this may or may not have been the aim of the director, I found myself shocked and terrified not by the eerie Mr Babadook, but by Samuel's mother's awful behaviour towards her son. I won't ruin it for any of you who've yet to see the flick but some of the language and imagery used in the 'possession' scene are truly daunting and I felt myself wanting to scream at the kid 'just leave!' but that's the whole point of the story - sticking together to fight loss and the effects of grief is the only way to get rid of the metaphorical 'monster.'<br/><br/>The one true surprise to me, aside from the fact that we never really get a good look at Mr Babadook, who I came to like as the film went on, was that the movie didn't find its climax in the stereotypical 'mum realises she's mentally ill and gets help - poof! Monster is gone' way. Rather, the ending leaves you with an unusual feeling of intrigue as to Mr Babadook's true form (is he an animal? a man?) and, for me at least, a strange niggle that if Amelia lets the monster free in the future, things will go back to how they were before.<br/><br/>So, What did we learn? FEED THE MONSTER BUT DON'T LET IT TAKE OVER!"
"ElWormo","5","4","10","9 June 2015"," leave it on the shelf
","Babadook is never a 1-star movie so ignore anyone suggesting it is, but it certainly isn't anything like as accomplished or disturbing as I thought it would be from the amount of hype it's generated. Stylishly directed in places yes, but it has an overall feel of taking place inside some kind of atmosphere-less vacuum that never quite engages. Add to that a very uninspired script, overly melodramatic acting (especially from the mother), a kid who does well for a child actor but never really convinces, and a main plot device which is so clumsily handled it seems unintentionally funny in places, and you have a movie that comes across more like a stillborn show-piece than any kind of gripping, scary cinema. The trailer suggested a potential classic, but the result while not exactly a full blown disaster is nowhere near.<br/><br/>If you want a vastly more creepy movie carried by a young child in the lead role check out Bob Balaban's brilliantly eerie, surreal portrait of suburbia gone wrong 'Parents'."
"drownnnsoda","8","4","10","29 January 2015"," Trauma turns to terror
","""The Babadook"" centers on a widow whose son's increasing investment in fantasy begins to take over her life. His fantasy world is exacerbated and turns nightmarish after she reads him a bizarre storybook she found in his bedroom, about a mythical monster called ""the Babadook."" Initially dismissive of his claims of the monster's presence in their home, the entity becomes very real and very dangerous.<br/><br/>Although it is very much a horror film in more ways than one, ""The Babdook"" is, at its core, a meditation on grief. It takes a parable approach with the nightmarish fable as a method of delivery, but it is really a film about family trauma and how we deal with loss. <br/><br/>Jennifer Kent has extracted all of these private horrors and splayed them on screen for us to see in sublimated and yet explicit ways. The film is very much psychological and a bit of a slowburn until it finally lets loose in the last half hour. Tim Burton-esque special effects are both dreamlike and intimidating, but the real terror of the film is what's left to the imagination. The knocks at the door and the re-emergence of the book on the family's doorstep are minor examples of the subtle spookiness at play.<br/><br/>Essie Davis' performance is outstanding here, and her chemistry with on screen-son Noah Wiseman is spot-on. Since it's a film with a fairly small number of characters, it's detrimental that the main players here are able to convince, and do they ever. Truly incredible performances that we rarely see in horror films.<br/><br/>Overall, ""The Babadook"" is a dazzling patchwork of fantasy, horror, and family drama written as a fable but intended as a parable. The script is smart and the performances are even smarter, and the film is transfixing even when it's slow. Definitely one of the more original (and well-crafted) post-millennial horror offerings. 8/10."

","In the Babadook, Essie Davis plays Amelia, a woman who is widowed in a horrible car accident the night she was to have her first child. She was in the car with her husband in route to the hospital. Cut to seven years later and she is living alone with her son Samuel (Noah Wiseman) in a large, old, and unsettlingly scary house. Samuel, to put it mildly is a less than well behaved child. So much so that she is decides to pull him from school to find an alternative one that will be able to accommodate his wild temperament. One night when Amelia asks Samuel to pick out a bedtime story. He brings back a book she does not recognize entitled ""Mister Babadook"". The book is a terrifying pop-up book that tells of a monster, the Babadook that terrorized people. After reading both Samuel and Amelia begin to notice that they are not alone in the house. This is the first full length film for director Jennifer Kent. And may I say, what an amazing freshman effort. This film reminded me a lot of the feel of the Conjuring (2013) and the Shining (1980). I cannot remember a film in recent years that kept me on edge for as long as the Babadook. It is a hair raising, terror thrill ride from 5 minutes in to 5 minutes before it ends. Essie Davis's performance is spectacular. Essie's is a transformative performance that feels a lot like Jack Nicholson in the Shining. Your bear witness to her decent into dark madness. This film not only gives you the jolting scares you come to expect from a horror film, it gives you an amazingly haunting performances that linger. Noah Wiseman as Samuel is phenomenal. He transforms from a bratty unruly child you want to hate, into innocent and sympathetic. He feels like a cross between Danny from the Shining and Robbie from Poltergeist (1982). The overall subtext to this film is indictment of the modern family society. Specifically the struggle of the single mother and male centric society that has her raising one. It offers an answer I'd rather not go into for fear of spoiling the ending. The ending is probably the weakest part of this otherwise very strong film. This is the best horror film of 2014. It is a must for horror fans, especially if you like a little depth and psychology over gore. ""Ba, Ba, Dook, Dook, Dook"" will be etched into the darkest part of your nightmares for nights to come. <br/><br/>If you enjoyed this review, pleas check out my blog at yourturntopick.com"
"ahegde3149","8","4","10","15 January 2015"," Innovative and smart which would entail you to watch it again but you would hesitate as it's dauntingly creepy
","The Babadook is 2014's best horror film without any doubt. In recent years we got really good films like The Conjuring and Oculus in the worn-out genre of horror. The Babadook sits on top of both. But take a note that this not your typical horror movie filled with jump-scares alongside sudden loud noises to scare you. You need to watch the movie closely and try to understand what is the idea underlying the creepy monster called 'The Babadook'. <br/><br/>The film opens with a dream sequence of a woman Amelia (Essie Davis). We learn that the dream was of the car accident in which her husband died 7 years ago. She was in labor and her husband was taking her to the hospital when the whole incident happened. Ever since, Amelia has raised her son Samuel (Noah Wiseman) alone. Amelia who is still plagued with the depression and hassles of daily life rarely sleeps. Adding to it, Samuel stars displaying erratic behavior of being scared of an imaginary monster making Amelia comfort him every night by reading storybooks. Things get worse when one night they go through a strange book named 'The Babadook' which describes a weirdly-scary monster with same name. It scares the hell out of Samuel and seems to have a bad effect on Amelia too. Samuel starts talking to others about The Babadook making people think weird of him. Amelia and son start getting more isolated from the society and feel scary things at night. We may have seen the mom and child against the ghost many times but the story here is intelligent and very well scripted. The ending was a bewildering, making you rethink whether you caught hold of the things perfectly.<br/><br/>The story builds up slowly whether you like it or not, but it is the essence of a good suspenseful horror. It nicely imprints characters of Amelia and Samuel in our minds and their mother-son relationship. Since her husband died on the same day Samuel was born, deep within her she feels her son was responsible for all the troubles they are going through even if on the top she lovingly takes care of him. At the same time the son loves her a lot more and has the usually ""dont worry mom, I am there to protect you"" feeling. But he also soon starts to understand what lies buried deep within his mom's feelings. Even if The Babadook is portrayed as a horror element, it has a metaphorical view point of grief and despair in our life which soon starts to take our bright hopeful side. Actually, I feel the movie was made to metaphorically relate to our daily lives. Still, it doesn't degenerate the horror aspect of the film. The gradual yet perilous consumption of the lives of Amelia and Samuel by the relentless scares of The Babadook will remain with you even after a long time of viewing. The atmosphere generated and setting of the house, with fine cinematography is sad and chilling which was very much necessary. Plus, the soundtrack had the same required tone and blended in smoothly with the scary scenes with crisp editing. Acting wise both Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman do a splendid job, it is rare to see such good acting in horror films.<br/><br/>The Babadook will stay in your minds many hours after you finish watching the film, may it be in form of the monster from the creepy book or a monster hiding under plain sight in our daily lives. I really liked the way it is quoted ""You can't get rid of The Babadook"" signifying that bad things will always be there in our lives but it is in our hands to conceal it. Many aspects in the film can have more than a single interpretation, leading to good amount of discussion about it with others who liked it. There is a lot of ambiguity in many places where I feel a bit more plausible expansion would have been better. In the end, I was really impressed by the film and also believe there are still many small things that I didn't catch which would have added more to the story on first viewing. I will watch it again soon, but right now am too creeped by the weird tone of the film. If you liked mind-bending movies like Enemy, Oculus of 2013 or have taste in psychological horrors like Black Swan or even if you are a horror fan wanting to see something interesting I recommend not to miss this one.<br/><br/>RATING: [4/5]"
"jake-law123","8","4","10","28 December 2014"," The most thrilling and appreciative horror film I've seen in a long time.
","Even though this may not be the scariest horror film, I can honestly say it's the best, and the most appreciative one to boot, going for well thought out and promising scares rather than your typical BOO! jump scares like the typical horror film you see made today.<br/><br/>Amelia is a widowed orderly who stresses day in and day out in taking care of her distraught and outcast son, getting rarely any sleep every night over the death of her husband.<br/><br/>Right away the film jumps into the plot. We immediately learn of the tragedy in the family without any forced exposition, and we passively learn of the son's disillusioned state. At first you feel for the mother and what she goes through for the son, but the film quickly changes moods in the blink of an eye, but keeps a steady pace on the tone.<br/><br/>It has a chilling atmosphere the whole time, making you feel like it's another David Fincher film.<br/><br/>Essie Davis as Amelia is amazing, especially for a horror film. The film makes you feel different feelings for her throughout, though her performance makes her likable and unlikable in all the right parts. The son impressed me to no end. He's the right amount of creepiness, but in the end he also has the most amount of humanity to him.<br/><br/>What I really love is how self aware the characters are. When they suspect something they play it safe and smart. No clichés whatsoever. No going into an abandoned cabin in the middle of nowhere or investigating a strange noise outside BS, this film is completely original and smart from beginning to end.<br/><br/>The Babadook himself appears when Amelia reads her son a bedtime story based on him. She finds the book disturbing and gets rid of it, until it starts to stalk her from the book, which where the psychological thrill ride falls into place.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film if you're looking for something fresh in the horror genre. It's a film with actual scares which is enough for me. I'm hoping this film inspires other movies to be made to actually try to not treat people like 6 year old girls and focus on the psychological part of it."

","I was trying to decide whether to watch this movie or Jessabelle, so I got on here and read a few reviews of each film. What really helped me with The Babadook was a review in which someone stated that it was not your typical ""make you jump"" horror movie. It definitely is not. It was definitely creepy. They did not need to resort to making you flinch to get your attention. This is the type of movie that will get into your head just a tad. It is a bit like The Shining. I like the fact that the actors are not your typical model-esque characters. They are everyday looking people. Australia and the UK are good about that though. It held my attention the entire time. It is very psychological as well as supernatural. All you need to do is go into this film with the right mindset. That can make all the difference."

","I first saw the trailer for The Babadook around October time last year and I was instantly attracted to this movie.. The trailer suggested a spooky and retro theme which late horror film lack in a way, being all about scares and what not. I had high expectations of this movie, and in a way I left feeling somewhat disappointed. <br/><br/>The acting is on point, and if the Oscars paid attention to any film beyond the drama category, we'd definitely have two contenders right here. However, this is a horror film and with horror films come scares, which this movie really lacks! The first half is slow, perhaps to gain a connection with the two central characters, and it isn't until around the middle where we see occurrences begin to unravel It does build up and the last quarter feels like we could be promised a look at the 'babadook' or at least some action, which we have little of, but ultimately the ending is VERY bizarre. To those wanting to see a film for lots of scares and tension, this isn't your movie. But, if you want to watch something with a lot more depth and emotion on a psychological level, you should settle for this."

It was really good)<br/><br/>But when you take the short film and stretch it into 90 minutes, Its like drinking watered down cola.<br/><br/>There were a couple of creepy moments, but they passed far too quickly. And there were so many things that could have made it a better show. Why not give the mom an alcohol or drug addiction? Give the guy from work who was flirting with her a bigger role.

","A very scary Australian horror film about a mysterious figure named Mister Babadook. The film is the directorial debut of Australian writer and actress Jennifer Kent. I always appreciate the fact that the director is a woman, since there are so few female directors in the movie industry.<br/><br/>There are some very good films by other female directors, namely Pet Cemetery(Mary Lambert) and Ravenous(Antonia Bird), American Psycho(Mary Harron), The Piano(Jane Campion), Boys Don't Cry(Kimberly Peirce), Big(My favorite Penny Marshall film starring Tom Hanks), Blue Steel (Kathryn Bigelow), Look Who's Talking(Amy Heckerling), Children of a Lesser God (Rhanda Haines). I am feel extremely privileged to have seen some of these films in my teenage years. <br/><br/>Back to the film: it is about a young mother who has been recently widowed. She has a hyperactive son who does not sleep at all during the night and so she has not slept well for a long time. One night, Sam asks his mother to read from a mysterious pop-up storybook he found on his shelf. The story, titled ""Mister Babadook"", is about a supernatural creature that, once someone is made aware of its existence, torments that person indefinitely. Amelia is disturbed by the book's contents, while a traumatized Sam becomes convinced that the Babadook is stalking them in their home.<br/><br/>Soon Amelia also starts to feel the presence of something malevolent lurking in the house, trying to make itself known.<br/><br/>The film shows Amelia(Essie Davis) as a woman who is starved from sexual relations due to the death of her husband in an accident. There is a scene in the film which shows her relieving herself with a vibrating dildo under blanket. Added to this is the frustrating job of earning a living and taking care of her son all by herself.<br/><br/>The main thing that makes this film work is pop-up book about Mister Babadook which is one of the most gruesome I have ever seen. The terrifying rhymes in the book, pertaining what Mister Babadook will do, adds to the horror. The sound effects and special effects are spot on and extremely satisfying.<br/><br/>There is just one problem to this film, and it can be excused since it is Jennifer Kent's first film - the ending to the film is very poorly executed. Make no mistake - this film is going to be a cult film in the days to come and maybe sequels to this film be made.<br/><br/>I have watched a similar film like this one: Boogeyman a 2005 horror film which has 2 sequels. <br/><br/>Jennifer Kent, I wish you all the best for your future projects. And may you continue making horror films for fans like me."

You don't have to have all the effects if the story's good, and you can create terror just as much from something unseen as you can from the visual, but this is way off the mark. <br/><br/>It goes from one stupid scenario to the next, with a dour palette inside a house that is seemingly from the mid-eighties. If this is set in that timeline, it's not made clear, although in the ensemble's clothing and the protagonist's car it would seem that way. Nobody has a mobile phone, but the telephones seem modern.<br/><br/>The cast is far too limited when the main characters are this weak, and I didn't find myself rooting for either the flaky mother or the annoying child. <br/><br/>Aside from those points, this is meant to be a horror film, and there wasn't a second of it that was enough to make the hairs on my arms stand up.

"LegendsofHorror","9","3","7","13 May 2015"," Movie Review: The Babadook (2014)
","In this day and age of torture porn and senseless sex, blood and violence, many of the newer generation are so numbed out and not used to the intensity of true psychological horror. The thing that makes psychological horror films so great is the slow burn. Slow burns consist of a few things, atmosphere, a great story, and always a epic twist at the end. Those three things alone will trump over any blood and guts film. <br/><br/>The mind itself is far more terrifying than in your face visceral carnage.<br/><br/>Last year it was OCULUS (which can be read here: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2388715/reviews-285). <br/><br/>This year...The Babadook is THAT film. <br/><br/>The Babadook is the directorial debut of actress turned director, Jen Kent. The film itself is based on a short film entitled: ""Monster"" which won rave reviews in the short film festival circuit. This film has lots of mixed reviews which I believe stems from the lack of knowledge of older films and imagination to boot. The Babadook is a anagram of a bad book, and interesting enough a Serbian word babaroga which means boogeyman. <br/><br/>The film starts out with Amelia (played by Aussie actress Essie Davis) involved in a car crash which took the life of her husband. The film then cuts to 7 years later where we are introduced to her son 7 year old Samuel (played with perfection by Noah Wiseman). Samuel has a bit of behavioral problems. These problems are both in school as well as in his social and family life. His mother's health and mental stability hasn't been the same since the accident, which causes a huge gap between him and his mum. <br/><br/>The 30 minute mark is when we finally are introduced to MISTER BABADOOK. The 45 minute is when things start to get uncomfortable. The hour mark is when it gets intense, scary, and really exercises your intellect. <br/><br/>The ending itself, is quite open to interpretation. <br/><br/>The actual entity known as Mister Babadook, takes play from the silent black & white films. The film was originally intended to be filmed in B&W, but the crew found perfect colour palettes which accommodated their needs for the setting and mood of the film. <br/><br/>The first half of the film allows you to relate and feel for both Amelia and Samuel. In a way, the film is about love. It doesn't shy away from that vibe, even when things start to take a turn for the worst. The film itself has a lot of in your face situations that mothers and people who have suffered a devastating loss can relate to. <br/><br/>The film has a slow burn style. It also has Polanski as well as German expressionism overtones throughout. The film seems to be set in a reality styled setting but with just enough darkness and mood to make it surreal almost.<br/><br/>The young actor who plays Samuel really makes the show. This 6 year old is utterly amazing!! The pop up book itself is another actor in the film that truly makes your skin crawl. The book really sets the mood for what's to come. Aussie actress Essie Davis' performance rivals Shelley Duvall's in The Shining.<br/><br/>This is a film that demands multiple viewings....do yourself a favor and let MISTER BABADOOK DOOK DOOK in your lives."
"Kingkitsch","4","3","7","30 April 2015"," This is a retread of the 1961 ""The Innocents"".
","Yes, there was tremendous acclaim for ""The Babadook"", built on the trailer that appeared long before the feature was available. Unfortunately, the resulting film failed to live up to it's hype, disappointing horror fans who were expecting something new that eschewed horny teenagers, jump scares, slashers who cannot be killed,or zombies. For this viewer, the disappointment set in early since it didn't take long for the realization that ""Babadook"" was a very, very thinly veiled retread of Jack Clayton's masterful 1961 psychological ghost epic ""The Innocents"". <br/><br/>Director Jennifer Kent herself has admitted to viewing and considering other, better films before making ""Babadook"". ""The Innocents"" is one of those films. Her decision to take the plot of ""Innocents"" (itself based on Henry James' genre groundbreaking novel ""The Turn of the Screw"") and transpose characters and situations across a very sleepy 93 minute running time is frankly, abysmal. Anyone familiar with James' novel or Clayton's movie will suddenly realize about 45 minutes into this re imagined sleeper that Kent was lazy, evidently supposing that no one over a certain age would remember the original source material. <br/><br/>In contrast: two women, both single and alone suffering emotional issues. Both are trapped in a large residence with no way out. Both women are sexually repressed and have had their fantasies interrupted by a boy whose motivations may...or not...be driven by supernatural forces.<br/><br/>The boy, who is adult beyond his years, is tasked with dealing with a woman who may...or not be...insane.<br/><br/>The titular creature, one ""Babadook"", is a pale version of sexually driven Peter Quint from ""Innocents"". No one believes the boy sees the haunting, and the female lead eventually succumbs to the nasty whats-it hanging around in the shadows.<br/><br/>""Babadook/Innocents"" is the same film, plagiarized by an again, lazy director who evidently thought no one would notice. Her comeuppance occurs mid-film in a sequence that shows the hysterical woman watching horror movies on TV. The woman sees a short clip from the masterful Mario Bava trilogy from 1963, ""Black Sabbath'. The featured clip is from that movie's most unsettling episode ""A Drop of Water"", in which a woman who has transgressed against the dead results in her undoing, featuring the nastiest floating corpse ever seen in color by Deluxe. A very bad move by director Kent, since anyone who's ever seen Bava's film cannot shake the vision of the corpse for the rest of the ""Babadook"".<br/><br/>Reinvention, or re-imaging source material has plagued horror movies for years now. The idea that no one will notice the sleight of hand that puts a dim version of a better offering on the screen is not only fatuous, but demeaning to the audience. Jennifer Kent may not have retread the ground tilled by both James and Clayton, but she's walked that park enough times to attempt fooling those who don't buy another revisionist, or re-imagined, or rebooted telling of a story that's been around for decades.<br/><br/>A massive disappointment from Down Under, which couldn't deliver on the promise (or hysteria) provided by the Internet."
"evanston_dad","8","3","7","19 April 2015"," A Movie About the Greatest Horror of All
","If you can get over your initial disappointment that ""The Babadook"" is not the scarefest it was built up to be, you might just find yourself enjoying a well-made and even groundbreaking -- in its own modest way -- psychological thriller.<br/><br/>And don't get me wrong: ""The Babadook"" is scary, it's just not scary in the visceral horror movie kind of way. It's scary because it's about mental illness, and anyone who's dealt with illnesses of the mind in real life knows that they are far more horrifying than any monsters or serial killers horror movies can conjure. It's impossible to watch ""The Babadook"" and not experience it as a kind of gender-reversed version of ""The Shining."" But it has enough originality to stand on its own apart from Kubrick's classic. And it's that gender reversal that makes ""The Babadook"" so horrifying and so unlike any other horror movie I can think of. How often are mothers the monsters, and how much scarier does it get from a child's point of view than to find your chief enemy being the one person who you take for granted will protect you at all costs.<br/><br/>Indeed, ""The Babadook"" is almost too effective at times. I'm particularly bothered by films about children in peril, and especially films that dwell on the fear of a child. ""The Babadook"" is tough to watch at times for this reason, and it came close to crossing the border that separates for me a film that's disturbing in an enjoyable way and one that's not. <br/><br/>I loved the ending of this film, and the suggestion that an emotion like grief is not something to be eradicated but rather something that needs to be attended to and nurtured for the rest of a person's life. You can keep it at bay and not let it dominate you, but the only way to do that is to acknowledge that it's there every once in a while.<br/><br/>Grade: A-"
"jackmeat","7","3","7","21 March 2015"," An exceptionally made flick on a showstring budget
","An exceptionally well made flick on a showstring budget. Everything in this movie does its job. The story is basically a yarn on ""the boogeyman"" tale, but this goes much further, and more personal. I must point out that this is a thinking persons horror movie that uses camera work, slight music, acting (that forgotten art) and story to scare you. No gore needed to frighten you around the corners of the house. I suppose I should just simply state the plot: A single mother and her slightly off son live in a suburb of Australia (I think Adelaide is a suburb, I am new to this Continent). The son believes there is a dark force haunting them known as the ""Babadook"" which happens to be a quite disturbing children's book they have in their house. Well of course the mother dismisses this as nonsense. Well, we know from other movies what happens when evil spirits aren't believed in...The plot centers around the mother (played wonderfully by Essie Davis) and her spiral into madness. The book almost describes out the twists she will take on her journey. Every element of this movie is paid such detail, that it borders ""genius"". Keep in mind this movie was a kickstarter funded film, made on a 30,000 dollar budget. After watching, all I can say is it screams ""Get Jennifer Kent (writer/director) a budget and let's see what she can do"" Definitely something that any drama/horror fan should be checking out. 7,2/10. Only negative I could find is the strange ending, and of course, I am not saying what that is. Enjoy."

","Let me start off by saying that the viewer must not start watching this expecting a full-on horror film. If that's what you're after, you'll probably be disappointed. It's a slow burning story with a lot of character development, very few jumpy moments, and a really bizarre ending. <br/><br/>The lead actress is spectacular. I started off feeling so awful for her to have to cope with so much, and she portrayed all her emotions so well. The lad is also very good, he was so annoying, and there were times when I wished he'd just shut up and let the poor mother sleep. <br/><br/>When the Babadook started to make itself known, I found the sounds that came with it so disturbing and creepy, I was cringing. The best horrors don't need fancy CG or an epic soundtrack, all it needs is atmosphere, and this film has plenty of that. It's dark, sinister, and downright depressing. <br/><br/>I must admit, I was quite confused by the ending, but after I read a few explanations, it all fit into place. I'll definitely watch this again, its a great toe-curler."
"lizzie418","7","3","7","23 January 2015"," A strange, yet unique film
","To begin, this film is very good at creating a dark atmosphere. It's purpose is quite lost because it confuses you within the first 30 minutes of the film. You're only filled in on so little, almost as if the director expects you to piece in the story itself. You see that the mother is a widow with a very destructive son, she's lost in this world to where she loses herself. Or as the movie calls it, ""The Babadook"" this is where the ""unique"" adaptation comes in... The Babadook is not necessarily a monster, but actually the monster inside of the mother. She can't keep it in, because it will eventually come out as The Babadook says. Later, she ends up breaking mentally. She attempts to kill her son, but is later stopped once she comes to her senses. A ending portrays that she ""feeds"" her inner self to calm down from having another breakdown as she did earlier in the film. This film does create many jump scare scenes, a great deal of artwork, and superb acting. But the film loses you due to the ""confusing"" plot. This movie will require an re-watch if you are wanting to fully understand it. The film is short, and cuts right to the chase. If you want a movie that will keep you up and wanting more, watch this film. For the viewers that need more horror, pass this one on, as it is not a horror film but more of a thriller. I rate a 7/10 for this film, it's okay but not preferable."
"oagawin","Null","3","7","22 January 2015"," We Create Our Own Monsters
","The film develops slowly, while quietly pursuing a rising action. Kent delivers a film that resists the run-of-the-mill horror pace by moving her plot to a staggering rhythm. Despite this, it holds the audience on its grip. It builds on its characters instead of banking on cheap horror thrills and CGI-crap. Its monster, on the other hand, doesn't need a justifiable cause to defend its terrifying presence. It doesn't come with a backstory. The central characters' history is already enough to juice the plot. Unlike Sadako and Kobayashi (or Lotus Feet for that matter), whose backstories stretch to almost epic proportions, the Babadook is just how it is: it's just there, and the characters will just have live with it or fight it. And although it doesn't show itself much, its horror still lingers like an ellipsis.<br/><br/>THE BABADOOK presents a nightmare both real and unreal. Its creature doesn't just jumps on beds and opens doors, it also symbolizes the dark alleys of consciousness. It has a character who is doomed with a remembrance of a tragic memory, and letting go of such past could also be a terrifying process in itself. In one way or another, we create our own monsters. Through careful direction, it is a movie that delicately shows a truth about who we are and how we embrace our pains. And that despite the victories, there still would be lingering, disturbing denouements.<br/><br/>More on http://jellicleblog.com"

"pjr235","7","3","7","19 November 2014"," The movie was pretty good.
","There was one aspect of the movie that stands above the rest and that was the sound. The way they used noises, tones and other such sounds was quite masterful. The movie to me didn't have to be too scary as the video coupled with the incredible audio made it a true gem. There is a huge mistake that most horror movies cover up with cheap make-up and over-produced fx. It takes skill and a good idea of creepy sounds to stimulate the most fear and in that respect, The Babadook, to me, was an incredible experience. It didn't depend on cheap jump-scares and it really knew what it was going for. I mean it didn't have me pis'n my pants, but it sure got me to hold my breath quite a few times as the interesting dreamy camera effects got my attention and the sounds grabbed a hold of my fear of the dark.<br/><br/>I think that every single horror movie maker should see this and pay very close attention on how to capitalize on the audiences fear using sound and not always just visual scares and Hollywood soundtracks. That's not to say that the movie was the best or that there wasn't more they could do, but the way they put the sounds together with the way they shot it deserves mention and imho a little praise. Because this is how you do creepy. Bravo.<br/><br/>Oh and I used headphones, best way to watch any movie, but with this one, it is a must in my book.<br/><br/>Now on to the actual movie/story review. I'm not sure how I myself would quicken the pace, but I feel like they could have done less day-to-day and more things going wrong. I nearly stopped about 45mins in because still nothing was happening and 'the boy' was just pissing me off. The building blocks were important to the over-all story but it felt like they were a bit short on ideas as to what to do with the first half of the movie.<br/><br/>All that being said, and for the incredible (what I felt like it was) experience, I think it was totally worth it. And I would recommend it if you've seen all the latest horrors and need something new. I don't think it should be skipped, but no need to take hostages in order to secure your own copy. Catch it when you can, but don't miss it.<br/><br/>'Yes' this if it was helpful or if you agree."

If you're looking for gore/jump scares this movie isn't for you. This is a psychological thriller/horror/character study.<br/><br/>I knew right from the beginning where the mother was coming from. She's tired, she's a single parent having to deal with the endless patience it takes to deal with a child who has behavioral issues. She resents her son and loves him at the same time. He makes her a social outcast because of his problems. She's lonely and misses her husband who died in a car accident while driving her to the hospital to give birth to their son.<br/><br/>What I took from this movie was that everything is figurative. The babadook is her anger, frustration and fears. She doesn't want those feelings to take her over. With the babadook becoming real to her and to her son who sees the changes in her, she can keep those feelings in check. Some people did not understand the movie and I get why. Everyone is to take what they want from it. But to me, her feeding the babadook in the basement is her way of ""feeding the beast"", i.e her fears and rage. It's a way to keep it all under control.<br/><br/>I think the ending is brilliant and it sums up everything that happens throughout the movie. It's a well thought out, unique movie.

","Yeah, there are already 481 reviews for this movie at the present time, so why bother writing one? I don't know, really. Maybe because my expectations got staked so high by the hype surrounding it. What is certain, is that the movie has gathered a solid fan base which, alas, doesn't prove its quality. It's the story of a single mother and her exuberant boy who get stalked by a demon from a children's book. How the demon is connected to the boy's deceased dad remains unclear, or at least I couldn't make odds or ends of it but the mysterious connection is kept alive like some loose end of an unfinished plot idea and in the end, it's left to the viewer to decide what to make of it. Apart from those loose ends, the movie in itself isn't really bad. It's actually quite well presented. It's biggest crime is just that it's a bland mixture of a hundred and one other horror flicks of that type. I found myself watching the movie until the end, only hoping for some great turnaround to happen, where it would reveal to me that it had just pretended to be generic. But unfortunately, this didn't happen and the movie kept unfolding its boring clichÃ©s one after one. That's real horror of this movie. I understand that many people who like to eat the same old dish over and over again may like this movie.

The monster or babadook is the illness, the mothers disconnection with her son who she clearly blames for her husbands death comes from her depression and her increasing cruel outbursts when she sinks deeper and deeper into mental illness - however, the mothers haggared weak sleep deprived portrayal was so over the top I kind of wished her son would shoot her in the head with his catapult and put an end to my misery of having to watch her. For this film to work I really wanted to invest in the mum and go on the journey with her - instead it was all I could do not to throw something at my TV or turn the movie off. <br/><br/>The son, I thought did a fantastic job as did the old lady next door. <br/><br/>I'm not sure about the babadook thing, I mean - really 3 knocks. <br/><br/>All up I think the idea was good but ditch the babadook guy, who incidentally looks like a cross between the crow and slash from guns and roses and make the mum a normal, hard working, believable mum not a zombie that looks like she escaped from the walking dead!"
"jadepietro","8","4","11","9 December 2014"," Things That Go Bump in the Night
","This film is recommended.<br/><br/>Mister Babadook is the bogeyman, that thing that goes bump in the night and ruins a child's sleep, the waking nightmare that disturbs young children and adults alike. In this case, he is found in a picture-book owned by Samuel (Noah Wiseman), a problem child if there ever was one. His mother, Amelia (Essie Davis) is at her wit's end, raising a child alone and still grieving over the death of her husband seven years ago. Both cannot get a good night's sleep. Amelia is lonely and angst-ridden. Sam is obsessed with this demon coming into their home and their dreams. But is the Babadook real or imaginary? In either case, both mother and child are acting far from normal.<br/><br/>The Babadook is a tense psychological horror film. It focuses on primal fear and rarely deviates from its course. Director Jennifer Kent also wrote the intriguing screenplay and she spends the first half of the film establishing the relationship between parent and child well before the first entrance of the title character. One begins to wonder when the horror will start. But start it does, and it never looks back.<br/><br/>While Kent's screenplay toys with the audience and build suspense at a slow pace, her direction is more focused and in total control. She implies the horror, never resorting to cheap scares, and in doing so, creates a haunting portrait of a family coming undone. Her approach is very theatrical and effective, using light and shadows to create the tension. She tries to keep the action in a logical sequence, even if she relies a bit too heavily on disconcerting montage effects. There is plenty of eerie foreboding imagery, foremost from the surreal pop-up book itself, with wonderful illustrations by Alexander Juhasz. The rooms in the house, ell photographed by Radek Ladczuk, have a claustrophobic atmosphere, with everything and everyone just slightly off kilter. (For example, why would a loving mother read her child scary bedtime stories if he has these nightly issues?) <br/><br/>The demanding key roles are so well played by the actors involved. Little Mr. Wiseman can be endearing or irritating as Samuel and the young actor shows a perfect range of emotions as this hellion. Australian actress Essie Davis is remarkable as Samuel's mother. Her character is physically and emotionally battered, almost damaged and beyond repair. Ms. Davis shows off the frustration, vulnerability, and terror to full advantage. This performance deserves to be seen and lauded.<br/><br/>As with all horror films, the set-up and payoff is important. The film poses three distinct reasons for the horror that seems to be occurring:<br/><br/>1. Sam may be a demon child with violent tendencies. 2. Mother is clinically depressed and on the verge of a breakdown. 3. The Babadook may actually be a supernatural being focused on harming the family.<br/><br/>By the film's end, only one of these possibilities is ruled out, leaving the moviegoer again faced with ambiguity. The film's multiple endings never really confirm the mysterious happenings in the household or the reasons behind them. So the pay-off is a tad less satisfying. But The Babadook remains a complex and fascinating horror thriller, one that lingers long after the film ends. Sleep well.

","The Babadook was released back in 2014, and I haven't caught up with it until now. There was a fair amount of positive vibe about it. However I have to say after seeing The Babadook for the first time, I was a little disappointed because I didn't think it was scary. It doesnt compare well to stuff like The (original) Shining, and other iconic horror films of the past that are capable of standing on their own and therefore can never be replicated. Frankly I guess, The Haunting, The Innocents, even The Sixth Sense can never be replaced. Part of the problem seems to be an anxiety of influence on the part of current practioners. They seem unable to create for themselves a style that pays homage, but at the same time makes a new and vibrant contribution to the genre.
I realise that The Babadook is really more a psychological thriller than straight horror. This has to be a fact, because nobody mentions ghosts, or paranormal activity being responsible for the events portrayed, when it seems obvious to the viewer that this is indeed what's going on. We receive a massive build-up, but the story peeters out due to lack of character development, or any explanation for these strange events occurring. The actors subsequently are left to get out there and do a lot of acting to push the story along, when there isnt much of story to begin with.
I also have to admit to an aversion towards films like this who are too coy to actually show the monster for anything longer than a couple of seconds. This may have worked for a horror genius like Val Lewton, but as far as I'm concerned, not many others. Even Jaws to me, was at a disadvantage because it took so long to get a decent glimpse of the shark. But I digress.
Just to mention a few good things, the young boy who plays Essie Davis' son is either adorably vulnerable or obnoxious, but he is wonderfully expressive in a difficult role. The interior of the house has a fascination about it that's very moody and sinister, and makes the claustrophobic nature of the events quietly unsettling. However the back story isn't explained very well nor the reason for finding the book, the reason for the haunting or the magical entrance of the dead husband at the end, which I found more bewildering than what was happening onscreen.
I guess I've been spoilt by the great titles, and directors who created modern horror. No matter what has come after I get into a tizz and can't wait to defend them against the New guard. But as you get older it's more difficult to rationalise your disappointments in life so I will give this a score based on the idea that at least they made an attempt."

","This film was one of the first that I checked out when I got into listening to podcasts. I started to make a list of the films I had missed as for the longest time; I was bad about seeing new horror films. Updating this review is really giving me fond memories because of this actually. The synopsis is a widowed mother, plagued by the violent death of her husband, battles with her son's fear of a monster lurking in the house, but soon discovers a sinister presence all around her.<br/><br/>We start by filling in the back-story through a nightmare. Amelia (Essie Davis) was in a car accident with her husband, Oskar (Benjamin Winspear) while she was pregnant. The husband was killed and Samuel (Noah Wiseman) was born that day. He wakes up her from this nightmare telling her that he had one of his own. She goes into his room to check for a monster, reads him a story and Samuel ends up sleeping in bed with her. We see that keeps her from getting sleep herself.<br/><br/>Amelia works a nurse in a retirement home. She is struggling with being tired. One of her co-workers is Robbie (Daniel Henshall) and he shows interest in her. Amelia is informed that her son's school is calling her. Samuel makes weapons and is into magic. He brought a make-shift gun that shoots darts to school. They want to separate the boy, who already feels alienated. Amelia won't have this and pulls him out of school.<br/><br/>That night, she allows him to pick out the book she will read him to go to bed. The one he chooses is one she hasn't seen before called The Bababook. It is a pop-up book with pull slides in it. The book though is quite scary and it ends up upsetting Samuel, which becomes another sleepless night for Amelia.<br/><br/>Amelia's sister is played by Claire (Hayley McElhinney). The two of them go to a park with their kids and we start to get that Claire and her daughter don't really care for Samuel. He is quite needy, loud and unruly. Claire does allow the boy to come over during the day since he isn't in school. Amelia tells him not to speak of the Bababook and that he isn't real.<br/><br/>Amelia goes to work and is having a rough day. She is caught being rude to the residents by another nurse. Robbie tells her that he will cover for her to go home. She decides to go and have a relaxing day to herself. When she checks her phone though, she has ten missed calls from her sister. Amelia goes to her house to find her son by himself in the yard. He was talking to something and it freaked Claire out.<br/><br/>She continually tries to convince Samuel that the Bababook is not real and that it is something in his head. He has a seizure while they are driving home and he is taken to the doctor. Amelia begs the doctor to give her something for him to sleep. He is reluctant, but does write her a script.<br/><br/>She starts to see things herself though. The book she had hid on top of her bureau and somehow Samuel got it back. She then threw it away, ripping all the pages out of it. There is knocking at the door and she finds the book on her doorstep. The pages are taped back together and there is more to the story this time. There are images of the mother killing their dog, son and herself. She starts to see images of the creature from the book on television as well as thinking she sees it in person.<br/><br/>Now I really wanted to see this film when it first came out and missed the chance. As I said earlier, I heard from horror podcasts that I listen to as well that this film was good, so I was intrigued. I do agree with them, this is really good. The story of this was interesting to me. I like the idea of this book that is about the creature, but it doesn't give really much background. It is creepier seeing the images and it being geared toward children. I love that Amelia doesn't think it is real, but she isn't sleeping. She slowly descends into madness and it makes you start to wonder, is the creature real or has she lost it. The concept of the Bababook getting inside of her helps to make it ambiguous as well.<br/><br/>There is much deeper themes here as well that I really took to heart after a second viewing. Amelia is told by Claire that she wants to talk more to her sister, even though it really doesn't feel that way. Amelia has closed herself off when Oskar passed away. She never truly dealt with that grief, which is why she won't celebrate Samuel's birthday on the actual day since it's the anniversary of the death as well. The lack of sleep and exhaustion add to the building frustration and change we see in her character. It is also overwhelming to deal with what she has and raise the child that you share with the person you lost.<br/><br/>To the pacing of the film, I think it is well done. We get the establishment that Amelia is struggling from the beginning. I like the transition that we see her lying in bed and then it will get bright fast, signifying that she isn't sleeping and it doesn't feel like restful sleep. The longer this goes, the more we see the aspects above growing within her. When she starts seeing the images of The Babadook, it really made me feel uneasy as well. After this second viewing, I really liked the ending and the implications of what has transpired.<br/><br/>I will say that for the acting, it was good. Davis does a great job. I feel horrible for her and know that when you aren't sleeping how irritable and how hard it would be to function. The longer it goes on, the worse she got and it is quite believable. Wiseman was extremely annoying and got on my nerves. I almost wanted his character to get murdered by how bad he was, but his acting was good to get that reaction out of me. He was supposed to play the character this way and he did an excellent job of it. The rest of the cast do round out the film for what was needed as well.<br/><br/>Next I want to talk about the creature in this film. I think he looks great. We don't get to see him a lot, it is only glimpses and I love that. It makes it that much scarier. I did find it interesting as well that he was modeled after Lon Chaney from London After Midnight. There aren't a lot of effects really in the film, but the ones that are done look good so I have no issues there. The editing of this film is really good as well. They incorporated a lot of cartoons and edited the creature into things on television. Some of these were really creepy to me and I liked it. The film was also shot very well in my opinion.<br/><br/>The score didn't stand out to me overall, but there were some scenes that it did and it really helped the mood of the scene. I do have to commend the film; the use of the creature saying its name was quite creepy. They also seemed to incorporate bug sounds as well as a monster's howl that I think ties back in with things that are seen earlier. This did help to enhance the film.<br/><br/>Now with that said, I would recommend this film. The story and concept of the film are great and quite socially relevant. The acting is very good. The editing of the film was well done. The creature looked really good and the score doesn't always stand out, but when it does, it makes the scenes that much creepier. There will be some people who don't care for this, especially with the implications at the end. You still should give it a watch, even if you aren't a fan of the genre. I would say that this is a very good film overall and definitely worth a viewing."

","I am not very familiar with the actress, who plays the mother in this movie. It is a good film of course, but I did not find it that terrifying, although maybe I should have. I probably have just seen too many scary movies. Thing is, Essie David is utterly TERRIFYING in this! She starts off a tad unhinged, but is crazier as each scene goes on! It's insane and I did not expect this. Maybe this is an unfair comparison, but this film was WAAYYY better than Hereditary was, and I did not like that movie very much as is, but Essie David's performance blows Toni Collette's out of the water, and that is saying a lot, because Collette's performance was pretty spot on, in a movie I did not even like... Essie's performance when the Babadook possessed her was FLAWLESS!!! Her facial expressions and her entire performance was animal-istic! I do not think we get to see this sort of thing that often! Also, nobody physically portrayed the Babadook in this movie... This entity was just a matter of phenomenal camera work, special effects, sound effects, some props, editing, and the performances of David and her young child actor co-star. This film has nothing to do with cults or anything like that. This is simply an evil entity in the disguise of a fairy tale from a pop-up kids book."

She was feeding the Babadook in the basement?

","Surely, Samuel is a child with special needs. But the school does not understand inclusive education.

Babadook, can't you find somebody else to haunt? :)<br/><br/>For me, the first half of the movie is great. The problem lies in the second half. I would have liked to see a dark ending. It would have been wonderful to have Babadook-possessed mum kill Samuel and then herself, and let the demon's book pass on to another family. The dark prophecy in the book of Babadook would be fulfilled. Instead, the mother and son defeated the monster, and a happy ending is what we get. This happy ending is just not as interesting.<br/><br/>Perhaps, the filmmaker wanted to make a politically correct horror movie, to draw attention to the socially disadvantaged families? But as a horror movie, it needs to be dark and depressing. It should have taken a darker route.<br/><br/>Not as good as I thought it would be. But not bad, either. The acting, the atmosphere... everything was well done. I only expected to see a dark horror movie like Sinister.<br/><br/>So far, Sinister remains the best horror movie in English.

"davideo-2","9","2","4","1 November 2015"," Impressive, low budget Aussie offering that restores your faith in horror
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Morning *** Friday Night ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>Amelia (Essie Davis) was widowed when her husband was driving her to hospital to give birth to their son Samuel (Noah Wiseman.) Since then, she has been struggling to raise Samuel alone, while he has been displaying some wild behaviour. Things take a sinister turn, however, when they discover a creepy looking book entitled The Babadook, and Samuel begins seeing an imaginary monster that drives him completely out of control. As Amelia is confronted with spooky happenings of her own, she finds herself pushed over the edge, on the verge of losing her own sanity.<br/><br/>Being Halloween week, it's been the perfect opportunity for me to get round to watching this well received, off the wayside horror offering that seems to have hailed from Australia. Marking Jennifer Kent's feature length directing debut, after a string of TV work and short films, this takes the familiar horror device of placing a child in the centre of the story and adds in more distinctive themes of unresolved grief and emotional dependency, and works them wonderfully, with only a fraction of the budget of your modern day, sanitised American horror film.<br/><br/>It lays its cards on the table very early on, taking a slow, lingering opening that generates its terror from a haunting use of atmosphere and silence. The set up created from the mother-and-son relationship generates an interesting dynamic all of its own, working in a way where you're never sure how it's going to work in relation to the unfolding story. Without any great special effects or CGI, Kent has crafted something that truly works and restores your faith in modern horror.<br/><br/>By the end, it's lost its original angle a little, and it's hard not to notice shades of The Shining and Poltergeist that have crept in to the script, but none of that detracts from what has gone before, a splendid offering that generally works and restores your faith in horror. ****"

","I knew next to nothing about this movie when I sat down to watch it, only knowing that it had received some serious raves from critics and audiences alike. After watching it, I do agree (for the most part) that the movie deserves the praise it has received. The horror sequences, the meat of the movie, are pretty spooky. Interestingly, however, a lot of the horror isn't your typical kind. What's often distressing is seeing Essie Davis' character slowly losing a grip on what would be considered a comfortable life. She loses sleep, her employment is threatened, and the child welfare authorities are called in, among other distressing happenings to this character. These parts of the movie are pretty well done as well as the straight horror parts of the movie, and combined make the movie an effectively uncomfortable watch at times.<br/><br/>Some viewers may be disappointed that the Babadook's sudden entrance, various acts, and ultimate intent are not really explained. But that did not matter much to me - sometimes a horror that is unexplained can come across more frightening. If there is a real fault to be found in the movie, it would be that it feels a little long and drawn out at times. If it had been cut by ten to fifteen minutes, I think it would have run more smoothly. But if you are in a patient mood, the movie does have enough jolts and spooky situations to make it worth a look."
"YT_RealJoshTv","7","2","4","22 April 2015"," Don't Expect Epic Horror
","I had very high hopes for this movie and was slightly let down only because i expected a legendary horror film. The story is more about the mom and son than than babadook itself. This film had very good scares and unsettling scenes of the highest caliber, good acting and a good soundtrack. It was made with a low amount of money but you rarely notice it, the babadook is very scary itself but the way things play out it doesn't seem scary at all after the film was over. I watched with my wife and neither of us were afraid or left unsettled like some of the reviewers have posted. It's sad that they didn't capitalize on his scariness because his appearances were some of the most unsettling scenes i've seen in any movie. If the director held it's suspense and climaxed with more of the unsettling bits this movie would be truly terrifying and would have set a new standard for leaving viewers uneasy and terrorized. Still worth watching for the suspenseful moments in my opinion though."
"ericrnolan","8","2","4","21 April 2015"," ""The Babdook"" (2014) was a decent horror movie — maybe not quite as phenomenal as all the hype suggests, but still quite good.
","I'd give it an 8 out of 10.<br/><br/>The acting was just great all around, the directing was good, and the movie benefits from a spooky, atmospheric buildup. The tone- setting developments with the children's book were creative, spooky and perfect. The illustrator for that book deserves a lot of credit for making this film effective.<br/><br/>I did think the pacing was a bit slow, and the ultimate reveal of The Babadook itself was unimpressive. I immediately thought the entity looked like a cross between Edward Scissorhands and Danny Devito's The Penguin. It's ugly and annoying; I might rather punch it in the face than run from it — especially after it traumatized that poor, misunderstood kid. (I feel the same way about clowns; I will never understand the common phobia.)<br/><br/>This film might also borrow a page or two from other horror outings. I know I've seen that playground bit before. And the first appearance of the entity closely parallels ""The X- Files"" episode ""Folie a Deux."" This monster-of-the-week episode is a classic, one of the show's best. ""The Babadook's"" visual and even sound effects during the ceiling scene seemed almost identical to me.<br/><br/>Side note: does anyone else in the film or audience realize that this child is incredibly advanced if he is able to construct these weapons? The character is six years old — the best that I could do at age nine when I played vikings with the kid next door was a broomstick and a garbage can lid as a shield. I actually made a working crossbow when I was 11 or so, but it certainly didn't work like this kid's. If Australia (where the film takes place) has an equivalent to DARPA, this kid needs to work there right after engineering school.<br/><br/>https://ericrobertnolan.wordpress.com/"

","The Babadook garnered a very positive buzz right from the get go. In this modern age of jump scare filled, PG-13 ""horror"" aimed at teens and seemingly endless remakes, reboots, & re-imaginings of genre classics, is this little low budget film something many hardcore horror fans can truly appreciate and enjoy?<br/><br/>The Babadook tells the story of Amelia, a single mother struggling to get by with her young son. Her husband was killed on the way to the hospital the day her son, Samuel, was born and as his 7th birthday approaches she struggles with the loss. It doesn't help that her son has been behaving in a slightly alarming way, making weapons as a way to cope with imaginary monsters and freely telling people about his father's death. One night before bed they find a strange children's book entitled The Babadook. The story quickly turns very disturbing, leading Amelia to dispose of it. But Samuel soon begins to lash out even more, claiming to see the Babadook stalking them. As the sleepless nights begin to accumulate for both of them, Amelia begins to see strange things in the shadows. As the hallucinations gradually start to wear on her sanity, Samuel tries desperately to convince her that the Babadook is real and trying to get them.<br/><br/>I won't say any more about the plot because you really should see it for yourself. While this sounds like a fairy basic boogeyman type story, the level of tension built throughout is staggering. Psychological horror can be difficult to pull off properly and even if done well it can affect everyone differently. What this movie does so effectively is build the situation and gradually ratchet up the tension with little things here and there. As the movie wears on and Amelia becomes more sleep deprived, you are left to wonder if what she is seeing are hallucinations, dreams, or something truly real. But eventually you start to realize that it doesn't matter, as she is being destroyed by them.<br/><br/>If I have any reservation about the movie, it's Samuel. Through the first 30 minutes of the movie, he is insufferable, particularly right after they read the book. I understand that this was done both to show the grind on Amelia and also contrast to his much more rational behavior later in the film. The kid does a decent job in terms of acting but I can also understand the character being too much for some people to sit through. If you can make it through the character being so awful early on, it gets much better.<br/><br/>The character of Amelia is very well acted. The poor woman is in a bad way. Her husband died taking her to the hospital to have their son and now she is stuck trying to get by on her own. There are a few times in the movie where it's implied (or even outright said) that she would have preferred the opposite had happened. I thought this was a very humanizing thing to do with the character. She really takes a beating through the movie and you can just see her slowly being ground down. <br/><br/>The Babadook itself is never really clearly shown on screen and I LOVE that. There are plenty of small glimpses in the shadows but it never stands in plain sight for all to see. This is perfect as it allows your imagination to fill in the blanks. Sometimes the thing we can't see is the most terrifying.<br/><br/>This really is a great little horror movie. It aims to scare your mind rather than relying on jump scares with loud noises or buckets of blood. I'm not saying that everyone will love this movie but any good horror fan should definitely seek this one out. If nothing else, it is a refreshing break from most of the ""horror"" we get these days."

","After a few failed horror movies with their predictable plots and clichés, ""The Babadook"", managed to overcome some titles and surprise me. For the first film directed by Jennifer Kent, this was a great job. The film brings us the story of Amelia (Essie Davis) who lost her husband in a car accident, and his son Samuel (Noah Wiseman) a restless boy and feed the fears of having a monster in your room. Throughout the film, we realize that even after six years since the death of her husband, Amelia has not yet overcome the loss, and follow there, your worn routine with your child and a dog (Bugsy). But everything seems to change when she read to her son Samuel, a book which is called ""Mr. Babadook, a book that presents a friendly creature and then a frightening figure. Until then appears another cliché story of monsters in a book that come to life after being read, but that turns out to be something other than we imagined. The film has an engaging and captivating plot, the relationship between mother and child is intense. The performance of Noah Wiseman as Samuel is amazing, not to mention Essie Davis, a tired and character stuck in his past. Then things start to change course in the life of Amelia, leaving the film even more intriguing and frightening. ""The Babadook"" was done in a bold way, the film did not need to force situations to cause fear and be scary, the film really hooks you gradually.<br/><br/>Contains spoiler The beginning of the film was something highlighted, showing the car accident that killed her husband of Amelia. But it was done in a different way and with effect. And the outcome shows that no more than a dream of Amelia, the feeling when we are asleep and suddenly we are awakened by something. Many may have found a weak and forced film, with a final meaningless. That's because they did not understand the metaphor of the film that ""Babadook"" is the process to which Amelia passes in the film. And the book illustration is amazing, every detail was very well done.<br/><br/>""The Babadook"" is the kind of movie you have to pay attention to every detail of the film to be understood.

","The Babadook is a terrific debut feature for writer/director Jennifer Kent. On a limited budget, she has produced a work of genuine originality, whilst operating ostensibly in the horror genre. Crucial to the success of the film is lead actress Essie Davis, who gives a fantastic performance as, lonely, grieving widow Amelia, whose own depressed state, is only exacerbated by the obnoxious and anti-social behaviour of her extremely needy 6 year - old son, Samuel.<br/><br/>Much of the film is shot in Amelia's and Samuel's house, but the movie never feels in the least bit stagey. It was interesting reading Kent's comments that she originally envisaged deliberately fostering a 1950's set look, even considering filming in black and white to highlight the anachronistic feel. I'm personally glad she changed her mind over that concept and I think the skilful work of Polish cinematographer Radek Ladczuk, put the final seal on adopting any retro-look. The camera swings, tracks and zooms in and out of the Babadook's adopted residence, snake-like in it's character-revealing intent. The sound editing too is first-class. It always enhances the bleak, moody atmosphere and suspense quota, without inserting overpowering effects aiming for cheap jump shocks.<br/><br/>The Babadook is not flawless by any means. For whatever reason, Samuel is just established from the outset, as a complete brat. Thereafter, it becomes rather difficult for even the most compassionate of viewers to feel much sympathy for him. There's very much a repetition factor happening as well. We already are witness to the fact that he drives his mother towards exhaustion and exasperation by getting her up every night and eventually climbing into her bed. So there's not much happens that's different after the supposedly terror - inducing Mister Babadook book is discovered and read.<br/><br/>On a less significant level, Australian homes virtually never have the North American - like basement that is seen in the movie, crucial though it is to the plot. And I tend to agree with quite a few other reviewers that the conclusion appears to have escaped Kent somewhat. In the context of the rest of the film, there just seemed to be a sudden injection of unneeded special effects and Samuel's role in the way things panned out, seemed to me, to be rather ludicrous, considering his age and earlier behaviour.<br/><br/>But too reiterate, The Babadook is a very good initial outing for Jennifer Kent and I look forward to seeing her second production The Nightingale, about which, I've also heard really good things. Meanwhile appreciate The Babadook for what it really is. A clever, multi-layered story about how incredibly difficult being a parent to a troubled child can be. And it's all dressed up as a ""horror movie"". Who would have thought?"

"robertschmillen","7","0","0","10 April 2019"," A Brief Look at The Babadook
","The lights flicker, bugs begin to crawl, shadows envelop the scene, the Babadook has arrived. Jennifer Kent's The Babadook (2014) is not your quotidian psychological thriller. Beneath the superficial paranormal threat, Kent artfully implements multiple double entendres to be unearthed by the viewer. While doing so, Kent tenaciously utilizes extreme but simple cinematographic elements to induce fear in her audience. Analogous to Tobe Hooper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), this film frequently employs earsplitting sounds, disquieting dissonance and a woman's bloodcurdling screams to keep the viewer on edge.
Before being exposed to the Babadook, Kent constructs the platform for her narrative by using precise cinematography to delineate the hardships and emotions of the protagonist, Amelia (Essie Davis). From this structure, the audience is informed of the contemporary grief, stress and frustrations constantly surrounding her. Through such relatable downbeat emotions, Kent presents a character worthy of our sympathy. Moving forward, The Babadook departs from traditional transcendent psychological thrillers by translating Amelia's sentiments into the supernatural-being known as the Babadook. In other words, Amelia's underlying emotions are organized into one paranormal being, thus granting greater significance than the trite demonic antagonist capriciously haunting the principal characters of a film as seen in Oren Peli's Paranormal Activity (2007). Moreover, the initial presentation of Mister Babadook is arguably one of the greatest conventions the film has to offer. As Amelia sits down to read the seemingly innocent children's book, Kent employs an amalgam of close-up pans and cuts along with a shrill insect-like buzzing to hyperbolize the disturbing contents of the wicked red book, ""Mister Babadook"". Thus, leaving the viewer rid with anticipation and fear of the imminent occult threat.
Jennifer Kent's ability to sophistically develop the film to the latter electrifying zenith is subjectively unparalleled. The slow introduction to the tall, rigid figure dressed in a jet-black trench coat and top hat is both enticing and suspenseful, continuously leaving the audience hungry for more. By creating an indirect relationship between Amelia and the demonic aggressor, the viewer is immersed in a complex allegorical narrative rather than a rudimentary hedonistic thriller. Furthermore, the negative emotions that construct the relationship are emotions that many individuals have grappled with in life, resulting in an elaborate alignment between the viewer and the subliminal essence of the film. In retrospect, Jennifer Kent's The Babadook does not disappoint as it proves to be a captivating psychological thriller rich with concealed narratives awaiting subsequent analysis."

","Clearly, people who are giving this movie a 1-star review have no idea what makes a horror movie good.<br/><br/>At first sight, when you start watching this movie your first question will be:""Are these actors that bad or they are literally becoming some psychotic characters?"". And yes, as you watch the movie you will figure it out how the actors and their characters are the same person. In the last couple of years the majority of actors featured in horror movies had their acting extremely mediocre, like all they wanted to do is simply say their lines and then go home. But is not the case in ""The Babadook"". When I first saw Samuel (Noah Wiseman) I really believed his acting was bad, but after a couple of scenes I realized how good his acting was as you truly believe there is something wrong with this boy or that he is simply mad.<br/><br/>True, the special effects aren't the best (some of them are quite pathetic if you ask me) however these are not stopping the movie from being a good one. There is a constant tense and fear in this movie, intensified by the soundtrack and common noises (doors opening, floor cracking and so on), but these sounds are the right ones at the right time.<br/><br/>When it comes to storyline, you can say it's a pretty original idea (as for me, I think I never heard of the word ""Babadook""). There are a few moments in the story where you will find the mother's and boy's dialogues as being annoying, due to Samuel's hysterical screams, but this is an important part of his character.<br/><br/>Overall, I think ""The Babadook"" is an interesting and good movie and it reminds you of the classic horror movies of the '90s."

That'll do it love.<br/><br/>Although she does grow some balls at Ruby's birthday party when the rich WAGs are moaning about not having time to go to the gym. <br/><br/>Although I loathe Samuel, even I wouldn't hold pushing Ruby out of the tree house against him.

I hate the idea of just being the same as 'the norm' so naturally rally round the unpopular one or whipping boy of a group (such as the emo chick in The Breakfast Club or Trash in Return of the Living Dead).

","The Babadook is a unique and ambitious debut film from Australian director Jennifer Kent. This film offers a chilling look into the life of a widowed mother, Amelia (Essie Davis), as she battles with the loss of her husband years prior, and copes with the difficulty that comes with singularly caring for her son, Samuel (Noah Wiseman). The Babadook has continued to gain traction over the past five years as more and more people discover the horrific bedtime story it presents, revealing one of the absolute best horror films of the 21st century that can be found right on Netflix. <br/><br/>As the viewer, we don't know whether Samuel is lying about seeing the monster he claims is real, and we aren't even sure if what Amelia is seeing is authentic, either. The concept of sleep deprivation plays a major part in the movie and messes with the minds of its characters as well as its audience, since sleep deprivation causes scary side effects like hallucinations and cognitive impairment. While in the end it is left unknown as to what the monster truly is, the finale is executed in a disturbing, uncomfortable way.<br/><br/>What truly makes The Babadook so effective is that its plot appears to be rooted in reality, being based on actual psychological problems rather than just the supernatural. While many horror films rely on genre tropes and excessive amounts of gore and nudity, Kent offers her audience a psychological, noteworthy story that goes against cliches for a genuinely possessed woman monster, complex characters and an ultimately profound message."
"musicpanda","9","0","0","26 March 2018"," The Babadook: An Allegory for Depression and PPD
","**Spoilers**<br/><br/>The Babadook is a darkly beautiful film that deals with the very difficult subject of depression and I'd argue post-partum depression. I think it's closer to post-partum for two reasons. Firstly, the film opens on the car accident in which Amelia loses her husband. This is a reoccurring motif in the film. She has a dream or memory of the accident over and over, creating an idea that it tethers her to her depression, but what makes this post-partum centered specifically is that Samuel repeatedly mentions how his father died on the day he was born, thus tethering his life to his mother's loss. Secondly, Amelia seems distanced from Sam. She treats him, even in the beginning, and steadily worse throughout the film, as a reminder of pain. This film is a dark reflection of the painful path of post-partum depression and how women with post-partum depression may feel drawn to kill themselves or their children. 
The most striking think about this film, however, is it's used of lighting, specifically in the house and how that correlates to depression as well. The house where Amelia and Sam live is almost always very, very dark. However, it always seems that there is a lot of light coming in through the windows. Upon first watch, it is easy to think that it's just a mistake in lighting, however, it creates a metaphor for the way depression feels. As though the light is right there, if only we could see and reach it."

","The Babadook film is one of a revisionist genre stage, where Jennifer Kent creates a new vision film with the different and unique concepts she introduces in the film. We see horror film concepts such as the possessed women, a final girl, and the abjection of the body. Kent introduces us to a small family consisting of a widowed mother (Essie Davis) and her son, Samuel (Noah Wiseman), where a demented monster from a children's book called Babadook intrudes their home. <br/><br/>Watching this film we can create a connection between the mother and the babadook. the babadook takes ahold of the mother and we see her hallucinations and lack of sleep, which adds on to her state of psychosis and even an attempt to kill her son. The babadook in the film helps address the underlying issue, of the taboo of struggling mothers who attempt to kill their children because they are mentally ill. Kent does a great way to show this because we see what the mother's perspective and what she is enduring, as well as the outside world's perspective. This is what makes the film so great because of its allegory and the way Kent projects it.<br/><br/>The design of the film is creative as well due to the way the producer portrays the presence of the babadook. At certain points of the film we can see the shadow or silhouette of the babadook coming off the mother. We see the abjection of the human body when the mother throws up black liquid to show her body rejecting the babadook. Overall creates a new image for horror films."

","*SPOILER ALERT * The Babadook, directed by Jennifer Kent is an Australian film about a distraught and lonely widowed mother and her son who happen to open up a disturbing story book that comes to life and let the main character into their lives. The widow's inner fears materialize when the Babadook enters her life. The Babadook becomes a metaphor for her deep sadness and frustration that is apparent in the blue and grey tonality of the house they live in that is extremely claustrophobic. Throughout the entire film, symmetry and parallels are drawn physically and psychologically that link the Babadook to the widow's internal struggles. The message is clear and the implications are severe. If the widow does not tend to her inner demons, she herself will become one. Meanwhile, her inner demon comes out every once in a while threatening the one she loves most in her life- her son. She knows she must do something quick before it is too late. The more you push him out the harder it is to get him to leave. She must confront the Babadook before she too, becomes a demon."
"fashionista-84381","7","0","0","23 March 2018"," Mini Review on The Babadook
","Unlike many other films, The Babadook is a very clever and most interesting film. The Babadook was written and directed by Jennifer Kent, and she delivers nightmares that are specifically meant to haunt the adult minds. This film is refreshing because of Kent's decision to focus on the mother instead of the son. Yes, in the beginning, we focus on Samuels' well being and get to know him, but then we really start to get to know Amelia and watch her lose slowly her mind or being taken over by The Babadook. <br/><br/>Thanks to Kent's great team working on the film, created the right level of eerie in this film. Which is represent with the cold, gloomy color palette of the film that added to the understanding of Amelia's depression. And also a standing ovation to who designed the layout of the house! Just the right amount of furniture yet not too crowded, great lighting, and small rooms to give it an almost claustrophobic feeling that keeps the evil in and us feeling trapped inside.<br/><br/>In many horror films, many of the ""monsters' represent an allegory, for example, Romero's zombies are often allegories for mindless consumerism and consumption. I believe the allegory of The Babadook is what happens when emotions, particularly grief, have not been dealt with. Since Amelia dealt with so much trauma in her life, she is in denial and has yet to recover from the death of her husband and birth of Samuel."

","This movie builds up tension after tension but in reality not much really happens. Yet it is quite exciting how you slowly see Amelia drift into insanity. And who can really blame her? Living with this 6 year old kid leaves you no choice but to go nuts! This film leaves one of the best examples why not to have children at all. Period! Or is the Babadook real after all??? <br/><br/>Herein lies the main problem. As soon as the Babadook is displayed you can't help but find it looking extremely cheap. Almost comedic. As the movie begins to build up to the climax it is an amazing thrill ride and even though I assume the creature was never meant to be in the fokus, at least the design of the Babadook could have been way better. Either that or not displaying it at all, to keep the mystery intact. In this case the movie would not turn into a weird monster flick but keep the viewer engaged with the insanity topic. <br/><br/>I have to admit, I liked this movie a lot better after having it seen a second time, but to endure this horrible child and his tantrums once more was surely not easy. Thanks to that you may not feel the urge to rewatch this movie over and over again and that is a bit sad, for the idea itself worked out so great and The Babadook is one of the better Horror movies of 2014."

","I will use the succinct last paragraph of another reviewer who summed it up perfectly:<br/><br/>But still, there is one thing I felt was handled wrongly. Throughout most of the film, there are hints thrown, abundantly, that the Babadook isn't real. The phantom cockroach infestation, when the neighbour's name is Roach. Or the casual mention that Amelia used to write, ""kids' stuff"", which is a huge wink that she is the one who wrote Babadook, and probably then stitched it together after tearing it up. This all ends up being a distraction, smoke and mirrors, when we are clearly told the monster is real. And it feels rather cheap. Personally, I feel that the story should have followed that narrative and simply deliver a mother who hallucinates, goes insane and murders her son. It wouldn't be a twist or anything, it's been done. A lot. But the end result would be much scarier. Though perhaps too morose and likely not crowd-friendly, but ending up with some sort of cellar-bound incarnate horror pet felt out of character."

","Making a good genre film sometimes just seems so easy. And horror is among the easiest, I mean, what's there to it? You just need a simple premise, a creepy visual style, a creepy antagonist, a few good scares (and you would be surprised by how few), maybe even a couple of call-backs to cult films (for the movie nerd crowd), and there you have it. But somewhere along the way, it's like people got lost and started thinking that horror is merely about invoking a series of physical responses to loud noises and hacksaw editing. So we can thank our stars that director Jennifer Kent delivered in 2014, pretty much out of nowhere, a movie that stays true to the basic tenants of good horror movie-making and in the process actually manages to tell a story that resonates. Even if it will make you paranoid about pop-up books. <br/><br/>Seven years after a tragic car accident that killed her husband and left her a single parent, Amelia (Essie Davies)is still in a painful state of mourning. Her life is split between her stupefying daily job as a nurse in a retirement home, and her parental responsibilities as a mother to her spirited and hyper-active son, the prospective magician Sam (Noah Wiseman). The events of the car crash still exert a strain on the relationship between Amelia and Sam, as Amelia becomes increasingly disassociated and Sam becomes enclosed in his own world. At the time a palpable wedge gets driven between the two, a curious book called The Babadook appears in Sam's bookshelf. This herald of horror will lead the two down a path replete with madness and dread.<br/><br/>On a very basic level, you can call Babadook a poltergeist movie. It mostly takes place in a singular environment as Amelia and Sam live in a rickety two-story Victorian house with a top-floor bedroom, a kitchen and TV room as well as a creepy basement – all classic horror staples. Said location begins to exert an influence over the tenants, to gut-wrenching results. But in contrast, the exact nature of the beast haunting the pair is a little more complex than just a wandering malicious spirit. Bereavement has had its toll on Amelia's soul and sanity, and grim things happen inside her mind. The loss of a loved one triggers a self-defending state of denial, one which leaves her blind to the rest of the world. While Sam has something of an escape in his over-active imagination, this gives rise to animosity in Amelia and they are forced to deal with the terrifying events that have left them broken. On the visual department, Babadook is stylishly shot with a fetching and creepy colour palette. The set design recalls horror movies of yore with its haunted home setting, and the static camera-work keeps thing anchored with minimal movement and with the help of tasteful and smart editing. One would be justified in fearing an overabundance of jump-scares in a movie like this, but thankfully that is not the case. Understated is the name of the game when it comes to the scares in this movie. Every scare has a decent level of build-up that escalates to a strong shock that never feels cheap or hair-brained. This isn't one of those movies that throws something at your face and pats itself on the back for making you flinch, and instead works on percolating the frights slowly, allowing you to really sink in the atmosphere. <br/><br/>To show Amelia's ever decreasing sanity, interesting and always surprising techniques and set-pieces are contrasted with more mundane, but equally disturbing images. Stop motion freaks lounge around unsettlingly, half-seen monstrosities lurk at the edge of your eyesight as darkness sits forebodingly in the corner of every room. But the single scariest scene in the movie is without any effects, the scene where Sam has a seizure will haunt you the longest. And it is this combination of fanciful and factual that gives the movie a style and a tone of its own. Essie Davis provides a powerhouse performance, at once powerful at the other pained. While the screenplay does provide a hint of cheese, Davis' acting chops keep everything grounded and legitimately believable. This prevents the movie from feeling too breezy, and even when things get ridiculous you are still sold on the character's plight. As a child actor, Noah Wiseman also gives a good performance. He will both melt your heart and strain your nerves at the same time, without every draining the role of pathos and empathy. <br/><br/>Horror flicks have a love-hate relationship with women. After watching enough spooky pictures it's genuinely hard to not think how the bedrock of the genre is made of the suffering of women. Think of all the scream queens, the last woman standing alive, the titillating ladies that get brutally murdered for no reason, the poor girls that get possessed, and it feels like the list goes on. Sure, there are a number of exceptional female characters; Ellen Ripley and Rosemary Woodhouse are layered and dynamic characters for sure, but even then they are usually products of male writers and directors.<br/><br/>So it's genuinely intriguing that director Jennifer Kent chose the horror genre to tell this story. And her command of the genre actually allows her to express a series of ideas that never ring false, that are genuinely heartfelt and even dig just a little bit deeper than most horror movies even aspire to."

","I had no idea what the meaning of the title is, apparently it is the Polish word for boogeyman, it is the name of a monster featured in this very well rated scary movie from Australia. Basically Amelia Vanek (The Matrix's Essie Davis) is a widow, her husband Oskar (Benjamin Winspear) was killed in a car accident whilst driving her to hospital during her labour, she has brought up her six-year-old son Samuel (Noah Wiseman) alone. One night, Sam chooses a bedtime story for his mother to read, he chooses a pop-up book Amelia has never seen before, titled Mister Babadook, as she begins to read, it is full of scary images, describing a tall pale-faced humanoid in a top hat with pointed fingers who torments its victims. Amelia is disturbed by the book, Sam displays increasingly erratic behaviour, suffers insomnia, and has a preoccupation with this fictional monster from the book, believing it is real, Amelia has many sleepless nights trying to comfort her son. Soon strange events occur, doors opening and closing by themselves, strange sounds are heard, and Amelia finds broken glass shards in her food, she attributes all of this Sam, but he blames the Bababdook, she rips up and disposes of the book. At Amelia's birthday party, Sam's cousin Ruby (Chloe Hurn) bullies him for not having a father, in anger he pushes her out of a tree, her nose is broken in two places. Amelia's sister Claire admits she cannot bear Sam, Amelia takes great offence of this, Sam has another vision of the Bababdook on a drive home, and suffers a febrile seizure, after a successful plea, a paediatrician gives Amelia sedatives. The following morning, Amelia finds the Mister Babadook book restored on the front door step, it contains new words about the creature becoming stronger if she continues to deny its existence, it also includes new pop-ups of her killing their dog Bugsy, then killing Sam, and herself. The terrified Amelia burns the book and goes to the police to report this threat and disturbing phone calls received, but she has no proof of stalking, she leaves when she sees the Babadook's suit hanging behind the front desk. Amelia starts to become more isolated and shut-in, being more impatient, and shouting at Samuel for ""disobeying"" her, and continuing to mention the Babadook. One night, Amelia has a vision of Oskar, but this turns into the Bababdook stalking her, until it takes over her and finally possesses her, breaking Bugsy's neck, and trying to attack Sam, but he manages to lure her into the basement, and knocks her out. Amelia wakes in the basement tied up, she tries to strangle Sam who is sitting nearby, but he lovingly caresses her face, causing Amelia to throw up an inky black substance, seemingly expelling the Bababdook. Sam reminds Amelia that ""you can't get rid of the Babadook"", then an invisible force drags Sam into Amelia's bedroom, she saves him, but the Babadook forces her to re-watch a vision of her husband's death. After this moment of utter despair, Amelia furiously confronts the Babadook, she is able to make the beast retreat into the basement, where she locks the door behind it. Some time passes, Amelia and Samuel have recovered from the ordeal, Amelia is caring and attentive to her son, they gather earthworms together for her to take to the basement, it is for the Babadook to eat, the beast tries to attack, but she calms it, it takes the earthworms to the corner, Amelia returns to the garden to celebrate Sam's birthday. Also starring Hayley McElhinney as Claire, Daniel Henshall as Robbie, Barbara West as Mrs. Roach, Carmel Johnson as Teacher and Tim Purcell as the Babadook. Davis gives a monumental performance as the single care worker mother mentally tortured by an uncontrollable force, young Wiseman is relatively good as the disturbed child as well, it is a very simple ""monster in the closet"" story, with the paternal figure questioning what's real and what's not, with small special effects, clever use of sound, visual scares and a feel of creepiness throughout, this is definitely a gripping and intense psychological horror. Very good!"

","Back in the days when I was a kid (I'm from 1979), I wasn't able to watch horror movies of the ghostly genre. Anything with a haunting atmosphere and sudden appearances of white, dead faces or the sound of creepy kids singing used to scare me to tiny scattered bits. I blame it on my late grandma who was once watching Don't Look Now, totally unaware I WAS IN THAT ROOM playing with a Barbie doll (not sure how old I was but must have been about 5 - thanks grandma, I couldn't sleep for months). I also see the influence of my late supernaturally oriented neighbor-best friend. She brought the best stories and the finest chills. She was my personal ghost story teller and she was the star in most of them. Maybe ghosts had become too real for me to tell myself ' it is just a movie'.<br/><br/>But now... I find myself craving eerie movies, especially when alone in my house. WHY? Is my friend helping me from beyond the grave? Am I getting over my childhood fears? Do I need to ride this wave and finally enjoy it? The answer is Yes. And I want to see how much I have grown as a human being. So I watched stuff like the Conjuring series and Insidious 1-3 evenings on end. I'm not scared by chopped limbs and gushing blood and films that are too much about violence just don't interest me. I really need to test myself with ghosts and haunting spirits. Any tips are welcome.<br/><br/>The Babadook was recommended by a friend and I read good reviews. Not really a ghost story I know that, but haunting enough I could see from the trailer. I placed it on the list for 'watching together' just like the Conjuring (didn't listen to myself though). The first time I turned it on I had had a very emotional day and my senses where pretty open. I couldn't get beyond the first 10 minutes. Somehow the vibe and scenes really got to me. I mean that kid! And what is the mom going through? So sad...<br/><br/>The second time we got to finish the whole movie and both of us were left impressed. For a person like me there are good scares yet they are placed in a different context compared to other movies. The Babadook grows on you from the inside out, maybe that's so good about it. (And I literally mean the monster, not just the movie in general).<br/><br/>The mom and son are so well portrayed by the actors and the relationships they have with others (the ones we get to see) are truly supportive to the story. The Babadook is serious - at least that's how I felt - and it gives a look into life with serious depression while dealing with the effects.<br/><br/>It's gloomy and grey, with notes of a sinister fairy tale. Worth the watch."

","I couldn't wait to see this film! Everyone was telling me it was a unique horror film that was full of clever jump scares and had a great concept and original lore to back it up. And, in many ways this was true. The Babadook does contain plenty of those themes, but... like many contemporary horror films it was undone by two recurring themes that hinder it's potential.<br/><br/>The first isn't so important if you can back it up okay in the story. It's this idea that the ghost is too powerful to be messed with, you can't beat it, it will always flank you no matter what you do. This can be annoying sometimes, the more powerful the entity the less believable it becomes and the less serious you take it. This can be solved however, IF you have a decent explanation on how to overcome such evil in the plot... enter problematic theme number 2 (SPOILERS).<br/><br/>Mr Babadook, what's his undoing? Answer 'telling it to go away'... yeah that's literally what happens. The mother suddenly realises that she loves her son so much that she can tell it where to go... really? Given that decent lore backed up the story, should there not be some more for how to combat it? Maybe portrayed in well thought out cinematographic practice?... No? Too bad.<br/><br/>This is a good film , don't get me wrong. It's just hampered by its' predictable unimaginative ending. Aside from that you have a well directed horror film that is bound to give you the shivers to some degree.

"s-wesner1","Null","0","0","24 June 2016"," The Babadook...What's Next?
","My Babadook Movie Review: By Suphie Wesner<br/><br/>Babadook, well, what can I say? It is an interesting movie, no doubt. It has fairy-tale-like elements, as it is all based on a children's book gone sour. Really, it (the actual Babadook creature) looks a lot like a masked robber who has just finished robbing a bank. The old clichéd elements of ""combine storybook idyll, serenity, and child-like tranquility"" and ""utter horror, gore, and vileness"" work here to create a spine-tingling horror film. It is chilling from beginning to end: the themes of forbidden knowledge/fruit (from the actual action of the woman reading a children's book that is obviously inappropriate to her seven-year-old son's impressionable imagination) to the actual act of crossing the borderline of reality to the imperceptible really makes for a killer (pardon the pun) horror film that knocks the teeth out of many modern-day competitors. It is really scary, really engrossing, and really intriguing from the get-go; you quickly learn to care about the characters and how they are going to fare in the end, with this horrible monster on the loose.<br/><br/>It is scary in itself, how, an innocent children's book, gets mocked, and in a sense, because this children's book gets mocked, it serves to mock the entire genre of scary children's books by saying that they are not just children's book but they can serve a larger function, representing true evil that lies underneath the world's exterior. <br/><br/>The only parts to me that were reprehensible were the utterly predictable scenes where the crazed woman, possessed by the Babadook, kills the sweet white pooch, snapping its head back. I knew knew knew that that was going to happen. Other than that, it serves as a cheery element of mercy that the boy himself and that the woman herself (whom the second Babadook book predicted would kill herself, with a knife) do not get ""killed off"" by the Babadook, becoming not easy prey of the ghoulish robber and adulterer of souls, instead surviving, and with an eerie twist of capitulating to the Babadook by feeding him, who now lives in the basement, worms...<br/><br/>Come to think of it, for animal-rights lovers, it would have been nice if the woman had killed herself, for killing her beloved dog, Samuel, who committed no sin except for noticing her odd behavior, but that wasn't in the cards for this film. <br/><br/>I think that the scariest parts of the film were the times when the Babadook character actually showed up on her doorstep, wreaking havoc by his entrance into her holy household, with dire predictions of the bloodshed, vile sins, and unspeakable crimes that would ensue, due to the Babadook's wrath. Whence the Babadook's motives for his torment stem, are hard to come by, the movie does not explain them; he is just a torturer, an evil spirit. We know that the book just appeared on the boy's shelf one day, that is all we are told. <br/><br/>All in all, it is a great film, with some really terrific terror plots, that do not fail to build up a slow-broiling suspense that slowly terrorizes but sucks you in because the overall story-line is built up so interestingly, you really care about the characters and what is fated to happen to them. <br/><br/>This is because from the beginning we are shown the two characters Amelia and Sam, who are drawn closer together, necessarily, by a chain of horrible events which led to her husband's, and his father's, death (he died in a car accident on his way to deliver Amelia to the hospital, when she was pregnant with Sam). They really defend each other and stick up for each other; it is really a vision of true love."

","The Babadook isn't a bad film, but it isn't the great film that I expected to see.

Which couldn't come soon enough; the story drags through the first 45 minutes of the film at such a slow pace that you become annoyed just by sitting though it.<br/><br/>The Last 45 minutes were barely a saving grace as the flow of the story picked up, but the entire film lacked a climatic scene that was interesting. <br/><br/>The Babadook is visually nice and doesn't use a lot of the Hollywood bloated techniques which I can certainly give it high praise, and the story telling which was done fantastically receives high praise. <br/><br/>But in this case, no matter how good it looked, how awesome the director was, the story itself just lacked enough interesting material for it to be a feature length film."

The acting performance is pretty good (especially the Mom) but the storyline is at best déjà vu or cliché, not the least bit chilling anyway. Tis is definitely not a horror film.

I don't think it should be bashed either, but the current ratings & high number of positive comments certainly don't reflect the reality. I had the same feeling about The Cabin In The Woods, which also had 7+ ratings by 15k users at some point, but whose plot was so messy it didn't make any sense. I wonder what's up with IMDb ratings these days.

An hour and a half of cheap scares and effects mixed with a whining, psychopath six year old who you wish got put down faster than a one legged horse. The only real scare here is that there are parents like this who let their kids grow up into real murdering monsters."

","Are you tired of horror movies just relying on jump scares? And I mean relying on them entirely without building a story or something other to create tension and suspense of course. Because we do have jump scares in this one too. But it builds on character and story and therefor is (imho) more effective.<br/><br/>Having said that, it tries to create a new ""legend"". It is build around a short movie (which I haven't seen, so I can't comment on that), but the movie surely does work on its own too. The acting is good and the directing is good too. Another female director to step up to the plate and deliver, which may be the reason it doesn't rely only on effects. Whatever the case, it works ..."
"Sergeant_Tibbs","6","5","16","8 December 2014"," A ferocious performance at its centre, but still nothing special.
","I've never been one for horror. I enjoyed last year's The Conjuring and the tongue-in- cheekness of 2012's The Cabin In The Woods, but they're still throwaway entertainment to me. The Babadook seems to have been building a lot of prestige for what it is. Perhaps that's because it's an independent film operating on a better level than what Hollywood calls horror these days. While I appreciate that the film is an allegory for grief, stress, and the demons of a widowed mother dealing with a difficult child, it definitely shows that more effort has gone into its conception, but it suffers from being very silly sometimes. The problem is that the film is inexplicably rushed. It may have a grungy atmosphere, but it lacks tension from such quick edits. It builds relentlessly without a satisfying payoff. That said, Essie Davis gives a terrific lead performance. I'm not quite sure about her angry outbursts, but the rest is striking and poignant work. The Babadook is a decent horror film thanks to its lead, but already overcelebrated. <br/><br/>6/10"

"zetes","7","4","12","18 January 2015"," Might be one of the best horror films of recent years, except they felt the need to tell you up front exactly what was going to happen and what the central metaphor is
","A solid horror movie which was, for me, a little disappointing. I kept hearing it was the best horror flick in a long while, and I just can't agree. The set-up feels a little cliché, first off. The biggest flaw is that the central metaphor (and pretty much the whole plot) is laid out in such a hamfisted way, I was just watching it play out exactly the way they said it was going to. The monster, the Babadook, is a shadowy entity that's haunting a single mother and her poorly behaved six year-old son. Early in the film, the child finds a strange storybook and has his mother read it as a bedtime story - it's this book that tells us the whole story up front (more its second appearance a little while later than right away). As unsurprising as it, it's still fairly successful. There are plenty of nice chills to be had. Essie Davis, who plays the mother, is absolutely fantastic, actually giving one of the best performances of the year. The son, Noah Wiseman, well, let's just say you're going to want to strangle him from the outset. That's exactly the reaction Jennifer Kent wanted, and thus his casting is beyond perfect."
"punky_fish247","7","4","12","6 December 2014"," Different, but good?
","I so badly wanted to love this film when I saw the trailer because I'm sick and tired of the stereotypical 'jump-scare' formula that so, so many horror films rely on these days, and the trailer promised something different. Although I felt that this film broke away successfully, it isn't without faults. Where it so thankfully steers clear of jump scare cliché's, it fails to avoid many others such as 'unusual boy that nobody understands', 'wimpy, flaky woman who snaps' and the overused 'insects to signify mental breakdown'. It's a little exhausting to see these repeated. A stereotype that the film uses successfully, however, (possibly the best use of this I've seen in cinema so far) is the children's-story element. The Babadook book itself has easily the most terrifying illustrations I've seen, and it works so, so well to create unease. The illustrations are perfect, and I wish the drawings were used more frequently to express fear, because once they were turned into CG creations the horror was gone. ...What a surprise. Have we not learnt from this yet?<br/><br/>'Monsters' are always best left to the imagination- and that's where the movie failed, I feel, by showing the Babadook as an entity. To remain a figment of the viewers imagination with nothing to fuel your conjuring's but the drawings in the book, I know the movie would've been a lot more terrifying. But once we see the Babadook, a huge slice of the terror is gone.<br/><br/>Aside from that; the cinematography was beautiful; the palette of heavy blue was effective and the camera angles made the mundane day-to-day activities much more bearable. The child actor held his own; none of the acting felt forced or ridiculous, even if the constant 'mummy! mummy!' got a little frustrating (we get it, it builds tension, but i'm clawing at my ears here). Overall, not as scary as I'd hoped, but it took horror into a much more positive direction. It was a great insight into the issues of single-parenthood and the necessity of support. How problems such as heartache don't just 'go away', they stay with you, buried deep down (in the basement, as it were), but can be controlled with love and help and understanding. <br/><br/>The film wasn't a shallow horror story, it voices deeper meaning and insight- which you don't see much of nowadays.<br/><br/>(On a side note- where did that kid even GET that dove? Seriously. What.)"
"the-grand-design","7","4","12","2 November 2014"," A beautifully composed and mood setting Film... Until the last 15 minutes.
","Please note that this review contains a LOT of spoilers. Do not read ahead if you have not yet seen the movie.<br/><br/>I just watched this film with some friends and have to say, I was really excited to see it. I'm not usually a huge horror film fan, but I work in the Film industry so can appreciate other elements of the flick. The composition and mood to ""The Babadook"" was incredible. The use of shadows and all the typical horror elements was flawless, the cinematography amazingly done.<br/><br/>However, with that in mind, I am only giving this movie a 7/10 for the sole reason that the ending was so much worse than it could have been. I didn't severely dislike the way it ended, but there was SO much potential for a much more interesting, still psychologically related ending. I wanted it to be deeper, more mind-twisting.<br/><br/>The near final scene where she brings the bowl into the basement is what killed it for me. They spent nearly the entire movie making this creature, this Babadook, into a psychological, almost split personality, not physical thing, and had the mother's character beautifully represent it when she loses it at the end... and then with that final bowl scene made it suddenly into a ""thing that lives in the basement"". I understand it can be perceived, and perhaps was intended to, that the Babadook is still a part of her, that you ""Can't get rid of him""... but that scene made it seem something completely different than just another part of her. It made it seem like a physical monster, which was what this film was trying to avoid I think. I found it very cheesy.<br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed the film, but felt a little underwhelmed watching the last 10-15 minutes seeing that as the end."
"kaspergordon","10","14","63","19 November 2014"," A Flawless Masterpiece - Perfection in Motion
","The Babadook is probably the most impressive directorial debut I have seen (well if you only account the ones released where I actually was old enough to experience its release that is), and the best horror/thriller I have seen since The Shining - its direction, editing and acting was basically flawless. I really haven't been this impressed by a movie in years.<br/><br/>I have seen some users complain that the movie didn't really feel much like an actual supernatural horror movie, which unfortunately is a really shallow perspective to judge a movie from - and no this isn't your typical ""there's an evil presence after us""-movie like Sinister or Insidious (to name some of the better examples) - this is something far better - this is a masterpiece in every sense of the word.<br/><br/>The camera-work, symbolism, colors, atmosphere, sound and artwork is beyond words. Essie Davis performance as Amelia is ALMOST on pair with Sigourney Weaver in Copycat and Ellen Burstyn in Requim for a Dream. While Noah Wisemans role as Samual without a doubt is the best child-performance ever - probably only matched by Sean Nelson in Fresh, though Nelson was a little bit older in that role/movie, so it's almost unfair to compare them. And these aren't just random facts I'm laying out, but deeply qualified and analyzed opinions, since I'm a genius. And a genius knows genius when he sees it.<br/><br/>I don't really know anything about the director Jennifer Kent, but if she can keep this level of perfectionism in future movies, I'm almost tempted to say that she could become the new Kubrick - I know these are big words, but no director has left me this impressed for years, and when you take into consideration that this is her debut movie, I almost can't imagine where her talent potentially can go - and this is coming from a huge and proud male-chauvinist sexist.."

"bob_meg","10","3","8","17 November 2015"," Blowing down the house
","There is very little more horrific than real life, and Jennifer Kent's first feature, The Babadook, proves it.<br/><br/>Amelia (Essie Davis, in a tour-de-force performance) would have a hard time of it even without seven-year-old Samuel (Noah Wiseman) to constantly keep from trouble. And Sam's not exactly some mischievous little scamp --- he plays with dart guns at school, assaults other kids, and throws around firecrackers like confetti. He makes the titular terror from ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" look like a total pussy.<br/><br/>And Amelia's not exactly mother-of-the-year. You can practically see the monster within her many times in the early part of the film, gnashing to escape the prison her deceased husband's confined her to, after he died in a car crash while taking Amelia to the hospital to deliver Sam. This is a risky, potent set-up that Kent could have only realized solo (with her Kickstarter and other funding, of course). Both mom and son are so pitifully unlikable (and realistic) that no big studio would come near this concept.<br/><br/>Yet Kent makes it work constantly, due to the strength she imbues in every frame --- from the acting, to the at times beautiful chiaroscuro lighting, to the creepy sound mix, ominous visuals (which are just puppets, but damn good ones), and camera tricks that would make Hitchcock and Welles look twice. it really is a fantastically made film for any budget.<br/><br/>But it's the emotional tension that Davis and Wiseman bring in truckloads that keeps you riveted, more than any cardboard bogeyman. The Babadook contains some really disturbing sequences, not the least of which is brought to life by superb graphics designer Alex Juhasz's ghoulish ""children's book"" that features mom strangling son to death just before slashing her own throat. Yes, it's that strong and that effective, at times recalling Friedkin's The Exorcist in it's shock value.<br/><br/>As many other reviewers have noted, The Babadook is much more richly dimensioned than a cheapo monster movie. It's got enough allegory and symbolism to keep a Sociology class busy for a semester. It'll more than keep you hypnotized for ninety odd minutes."
"Quinoa1984","10","3","8","8 August 2015"," a terrifying movie about being a parent, or a child, or both
","William Friedkin, in his glowing adulation of the film, said that ""there's Psycho, Dialbolique, and now The Babadook"" (may not be an exact quote, but close enough). I would've thrown in as most directly The Shining. While the house isn't a big part of what makes the creature the Babadook come out - not that the gray walls and drab appearance don't help to add to the atmosphere - the way that the parent-child relationship breaks down into murderous madness does. Perhaps it's like if one takes seriously the whole ""Book-As-Demon-Maker"" from the Evil Dead movies as well: you open it up, read it, and things start to materialize in the most horrifying ways possible. But this isn't some people in a cabin in the woods - this is a widowed, single mother and her child, with the kid already a little eccentric (he's cute at being a magician, not so much wielding a small cross-bow, which me makes himself), and this book just amplifies everything wrong in their lives. Will their bond and promise to protect each other hold? <br/><br/>The book arrives seemingly by some stranger, right on the doorstep for Amelia (Elise Davis) and her son Sam (Noah Wiseman). She reads to her son, as all good mothers do, but when she reads this book it terrifies him before she can finish it, with graphic images of mayhem and violence and the macabre. She tears it up, but it comes back to her all taped together and with *new* pages, detailing in practically prophetic terms what she will do to her dog, her son and herself. She burns it, and seems like the smart thing (except what to show the skeptical police force?) so she tries to cope and get on with her days. But things get frayed with her sister and her friends, and Amelia starts to... see things. Or have very vivid nightmares. It first starts with her son - the usual trope we see of the kid seeing things are the parent not believing him - and then it goes to her. Oh man, does it ever! <br/><br/>The Babadook's triumph is in creating images and scenes and set-pieces where Amelia's frame of mind goes downhill, maybe not too fast but certainly fast enough with a six year old boy in the house. The boy is a fascinating character in how perception of him changes as the movie goes on; at first, he's almost kind of annoying, though not any more than your average 6-year old full of energy and vigor and whatnot, but he's also one of those distant and alone kids (no father, seemingly no friends, a disconnect with his cousin, and, as it's pointed out in almost darkly comic terms, a very quick response to adults with no filter). What's great is to see how he not so much changes but fulfills certain alluded-to set ups early in the movie that one thinks is just little things for the character to do. It's all the more disturbing because of his age; any older, and it would almost take on the qualities of a coming-of-age film for what he has to put up with with his mother.<br/><br/>And Amelia... this character is really the main one, though it's arguable the mother and son are on equal footing as leads. The director Jennifer Kent really gets the audience into her frame of mind: vulnerable, broken in some way, healed up over time but the wounds could be ripped open, and it stems back to the loss of her husband (Sam's father of course), and in the way it leaves her by herself all the more when her son is off at her sister's or at school. There's a scene were we just watch her going about her day, walking around some stores, sitting in a car and happening to see another couple making out. Even a moment where she is sexually 'alone' emphasizes her state of mind, to a degree. All through this early part Davis makes Amelia real and strong and forceful along with those other qualities in the writing. So that by the time this book really rears its ugly head, she's in a position to try and fight it, but how can anyone fight the BABA-DOOK-DOOK-DOOK? <br/><br/>The imagery Kent creates is staggering. She starts with TV - why are there old silent movies on the TV, would they be on, hey, why carp - and then unfolds it into seeing things in a neighbor's house, then on the walls, the ceilings, in her nightmares with her dead husband. Though it would seem the Babadook is a real demon/entity in this world, it's a constant question, especially in the second and third acts, if this woman is really losing her mind and what she sees is just magnified, wretched manifestations of everything turned upside down and blackened. For myself, after seeing horror films for so many years it takes a lot to get me scared. This one has the goods: it gets you invested in the characters, their relationship, and then gets to work making the mind throw up on itself with a bogeyman that is most terrifying for what it can unleash in the psychological sense.<br/><br/>The Babadook may not quite be the new Psycho as Friedkin puts it - the ending is a little too ambiguous, perhaps, though not in any way bad, one just has to sit on it for a long time - but is it really good and worth watching and stop what you're doing and look it up on Netflix? Yes."
"dvallet-20927","10","3","8","25 May 2015"," One of the best horror movies I've seen in recent memory.
","First of all don't expect this to be a monster movie, The Babadook is more of a psychological/supernatural thriller that forces on the dark nature of grief and depression. <br/><br/>The movie stars Essie Davis who gives an Oscar worthy performance in this movie as our main character; a single/widowed mother who lives with her obnoxious son played by Noah Wiseman who has weapons that would be handy in Home Alone. <br/><br/>This movie captured the perfect atmosphere of a good horror movie, major props to director Jennifer Kent for her directorial debut, she is someone who clearly knows how to setup a surreal scary environment, something the classics and some other good horror films in the past couple years nailed with perfection.<br/><br/>The plot evolves around Amelia Vannick (Davis) who is coping with grief while putting up with her son Samuel (Wiseman) and after she reads him a graphic book called ""Mister Babadook"" a story about a dark creature that lurks in the darkness, and soon after reading it strange things start to happen, like the story is becoming more and more real and begins to torment the family to the point Amelia goes insane and possibly possessed and tries to kill her son.<br/><br/>This is one of the scariest I've ever seen, when I first saw this movie I was terrified. I saw it for the first time on DVD, and I even watched in a dark basement, and after that I closed all open doors because this movie was really scary. There are a few tiny things I that I have to nitpick. For example: The kid is very annoying, however to the film's credit, he's supposed to be and that helps us sympathize with Amelia and it makes her a sympathetic character who is dealing with grief, depression, and ultimately stress and frustration. Another thing is that there are a couple scenes that were kind of short and it was felt a little jumbled, but that's just me nitpicking. <br/><br/>However the little afore mentioned problems don't really bother me that much, as I said the kid was supposed to be annoying. This movie also reminds me of ""The Shining"", one of my favorite horror films of all time. There's basic stuff like the horror sub genre, and the atmosphere of the movie. There are also a few moments too, for example: the mother yelling at her son when she gets fed up with him, and in the climax when she's crazy, Samuel says something, Amelia mocks him and talks about bashing his brains in, great stuff, I love it! If you hadn't seen this movie, I'd highly recommend you see it, but as I said don't expect to be a ""creature feature"" because it's not. I give this film two thumbs way up!"
"ArchonCinemaReviews","7","3","8","26 December 2014"," Slow cryptic eerie thriller, smarter than most
","Australian cinema takes what could be a very cheesy premise and spins it into a psychological thriller with The Babadook.<br/><br/>The film The Babadook is about a widowed mother Amelia, grappling with her husband's sudden and violent death and trying to raise her son Samuel.<br/><br/>Samuel is trying child with severe behavioral issues and is a difficult child for a mother to love, especially given the circumstances. As Amelia tries desperately to manage Samuel she must also battle his fear of a monster known as the babadook which she swiftly realizes may be more than a figment of her son's imagination.<br/><br/>Essie Davis is truly believable as the depressed Amelia coping terribly as a mother. Samuel is a terror and gives other horror kids in film a run for their money (I'm looking at you Damien). Given the annoying child Noah Wiseman portrays in the role Samuel, you can almost forgive her for her exhaustion. Samuel as a character might be one of the most taxing children ever featured in a horror movie. After ten minutes of him on the screen I prayed that Amelia would toss him out the car, or hit him over the head with one of his contraptions, which I believe was Kent's intention.<br/><br/>Jennifer Kent's horror film is multi-layered and complex, playing into the psychological toll of being a mother under dire circumstances. Her film is perfectly balanced between The Babadook as film about a sinister being haunting a family and as a psychological thriller. Kent's story is well crafted and slow, relying on true horror complemented by eerie music and cryptic acting rather than cheap and lazy jump scares.<br/><br/>The method in which Kent displays a dark force lurking in the shadows is much slower and denser and is less literally eventful than other films of this subject matter. It actually may be dense to a fault with most of the understated plot clues going over audiences' heads after just one watch. The Babadook is subtly frightening and could be too nuanced for average horror film lovers but should be a hit with the intellectual crowd.<br/><br/>Check out our WEBSITE for more reviews of all the recent releases, in full."
"scottshak_111","8","3","8","22 December 2014"," A gorgeous metaphor! Avant Garde at its best!
","If you have seen The Babadook recently and not scratching your head, you have only seen the superficial. What surrounds beautifully the obvious horror is actually far more intricate. It is really worth applauding the effort Jennifer Kent put in to hold something so profound, so gorgeously wrapped under the aegis of psychotic horror. <br/><br/>Essie Davis dons Amelia's character so marvellously that it makes you feel the pain inside her eyes. You could read the grief in her character almost instantly.<br/><br/>MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!<br/><br/>The opening scene carries an accident portrayal beautifully shown with the protagonist rotating inside something we could assume as a car, who is then disturbed by a constant yammering of her six year old son Samuel. It is a peaceful dream of the mishap which Amelia wishes to see unperturbed, however gets objected by her son. There is chaos knocking at her door in the form of her son, who was born the day her husband died. <br/><br/>We spend a lot of time story building where we understand how Amelia's life has succumbed to grief owing to the misfortune of her husband's death. She is entangled in misery. For some reason she hates her son, probably because he reminded her of the accident that took her husband's life, this again mentioned eventually when she admits that she wanted him dead instead of her husband. The hatred again nicely shown in two instances in the beginning itself when Samuel tries to cling on her and she moves to the edge of the bed, and when he hugs her and she asks him not to do it again.<br/><br/>The direction is extremely subtle. Bits like the way the night would turn into the day, the moment Amelia slipped into her blankets, manifested how fast time flew by and that her life lacked proper sleep which was iced further by the irritating waking call from her son. She was annoyed by her son beyond limit and ends up overcoming by her dark side, The Babadook, which is nothing but a subtle metaphor to her dark image. There are subtle references that hone the aforementioned analogy to perfection like there is a scene where Amelia finds a piece of glass in her food. Samuel says it was The Babadook who did it. She checks his bowl but doesn't find any. The glass is a subtle reflection of the car accident where glasses were shattered and how she still clung on. Another scene where Mrs. Roach shows up at her door with reassuring eyes compels Amelia to have a change of heart is also a reflection on how advices and social talks tend to be helpful for grieving people.<br/><br/>We find horror in the form of a made-up story by Amelia's kid which she starts living. The rogue part in her constantly overpowers her and she ends up hurting what good was left in her life. However, eventually she overcomes her fears and says NO to her past, (The Babadook here) and starts loving her son. He celebrates her son's first birthday thus paving way for happiness and love there after. The movie ends up in contrast with the beginning: a smile on her face and love in her eyes.<br/><br/>Only for people who are willing to watch quality cinema which isn't Mainstream!"

The Babadook manifests itself as a shadow but then runs away to the basement as Amelia doesn't run from it. Things then seem to go back to normal. Amelia and Sam prepares Sam's seventh birthday party, which was never celebrated due to it's the same day as Sam's father's death who died in an accident taking Amelia to hospital on her delivery day. Amelia collects worms and maggots and bring them to feed something in the basement.<br/><br/>For a horror, the story nicely puts a balance in the mix between the horror, drama and thriller aspects. Basing the ghost/monster character on a children's book is also a nice step in serving a fresh take on the horror scene. It also serves nicely in blending in with the family drama aspect where there is the dilemma situation of whether to believe the kid's statements or not. There's also the question of whether to escalate the means in educating the child or not.<br/><br/>Not locking the Babadook to a certain narrower definition definitely increases the mystery of the ghost character and distances the movie from it's basic premise of children's imagined fear. In a way, one can view this movie as the horror opposite of the children friendly animation Monsters, Inc (2001) which starts from the same basic premise.<br/><br/>Being a drama-horror-thriller, this movie doesn't focus the scares on the all-so-common sudden shocks or also known as jump-scares. Instead the movie forces the viewers to build up anticipation by abundantly presenting depictions of dark rooms and thrilling sound effects. Unfortunately, the other common horror ingredients like lights going on and off, possessions, shrieks and hallucinations all piles up as the movie nears its ending. At that time the horror can retain its scary element only by keeping the Babadook a mystery to the viewers, even after the main characters confront it.<br/><br/>The acting is surprisingly good in overall. Honestly I was expecting kind of lower acting quality due to there are only Australian talents less known to me. But Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman can really grab the fact that the story only focus at both of their characters and played their roles convincingly. They can give real enough expressions covering the dramatic sides, the thriller anticipations and the horror scares.<br/><br/>For me The Babadook well deserves a 7 out of 10 score. A recommendation is a yes for me due to it being a fresh new take on the horror scene, with less jump-scares but the similar weight of being scary."

","I think this trailer is outstanding I never get spooked, but for people that spook easy, this trailer leads to a movie that might not be suitable for you. The beginning looked a tad corny. However, after less 20 seconds, I was hooked to the end. The overall 'look' (or tone) of the film has a well balanced color that automatically puts you in the mood for each upcoming minute. The audience that is looking for a bloody meltdown might be disappointed. I am not suggesting that it won't have some blood, but I think this director has shown a different way of being afraid without making you physically sick to your stomach. I hope the setting stays looking aged.. and not showing all the fancy new stuff of a more modern household"

","Brief thoughts. Not meant to be a proper review or analysis......<br/><br/>Despite properly congealing its lead character's psychological state with the supernatural, The Babadook is short on imagination and shortchanges when it comes to scares. The film's dramatic arc is obvious and routine, its emotion is bland, and the metaphor does not amount to anything more interesting than an overtly sentimental 'stare your fears right in the face' sentiment. It takes a hour and a half to get to a point that says or does very little, and rarely gets the tension or suspense going strong. This is even evident in the horror aspect of its climax in which the effectiveness is zapped because it takes the corniness of the traps from Home Alone and mixes it with the real-or-imagined psychological angle that is now feeling tired. The cross cutting between the two here doesn't feel natural.<br/><br/>With that said, it ends on 'somewhat' of a happy note which goes against the grain of modern bleak horror endings, so it's somewhat refreshing, although I would argue the whole point of horror films is to be scary, or disturbing, or make one uncomfortable.. and that is usually best accomplished with a downbeat end note. The Babadook most shows why Roman Polanski in his famous psychological horror trilogy (Repulsion, The Tenant, and Rosemary's Baby) understood how to create suspense, tension, and scares properly while having a flowing narrative and dramatic arc, all of which it sadly lacks.<br/><br/>The Babadook reminded me most of Darren Aronofsky's Black Swan (2010), another Polanski-inspired film that doesn't understand what makes the sub-genre work. Hell, I would even say the often maligned Intruders (2011) is better than this film. It was never overt about its crazy vs. non crazy angle in the film, had a great sense of Guillermo del Toro-like style and dazzling montages, as well as a well-rendered metaphor about fear and loss. Even if its meaning may have been similar with The Babadook, it didn't have to spoon feed it, and used its metaphor to reveal things about its narrative and character.<br/><br/>So, The Babadook is not scary or suspenseful enough to work as a horror film, and seems too obvious and thin in its narrative arc to work as a drama. It may work as a psychological portrait, yet lacks a good punch. While I didn't hate it, it didn't move me on either spectrum. Rating 5.0 / 10 or a C.<br/><br/>PS. More of the actor Daniel Henshall would have been welcome, too. He gave one of the scariest performances I have seen in my life in the Australian true crime-movie, The Snowtown Murders (2011)."
"jackstupidjack","5","4","13","4 January 2015"," The Kid ruins it
","Does the kid really have to be so abysmally, gratingly, brattingly Over the top? I felt like wringing his neck in the first 3 minutes and actually wanted the monster to get him out of the film. I found myself spinning through scenes with him in it after ten minutes. Dreadful direction failed to create any sympathy, empathy, warmth or positive feeling between viewers and the protagonists. A great premise for a decent film ruined by dreadful cast, plastic performances and poor direction. Even the attempts to create atmosphere fall sadly flatter than a pancake and dialogue which comes over like it was penned by a 6 year old. Could have been a decent film if handled by a better pro. it's not often I call for US remakes but I'd like to see a James Wan or a major studio have a pop at this mess using proper actors and not drama school rejects. All in all a dismal effort which never leaves the feeling of a film school reject having a stab at a horror flick for larks."

What the heck happened, budget cuts? The movie gets you sympathetic to the family I agree to that, but it should have been from a horror perspective too no? The endeavor was good it really got me going, but the climax like what was that all about. I would not want to see this flick in the cinema. That's for sure. Slow and pretty long intro.

The idea that a character in a book can be ""real"" (here, ""haunting"" you in real life) is as old as narrative itself. I will say that it was kind of neat how the ""haunting"" shifted from the boy onto the mother. But overall I found the collection of horror-suspense tropes to be rather cliché, borrowing from Insidious, Amityville Horror, even The Shining, and many other classics of the genre.<br/><br/>I also found the resolution to be rather arbitrary and unexplained.

","The Babadook was hands down one of the best modern horror films that i have ever seen and is also one of the scariest films i have ever experienced. This film is pure evidence that you can still make a horror film without the usual jump scare tactic being used by almost every other film in the horror genre today. The combination of its sound and camera techniques make this film so creepy and unsettling that it really gets you engaged in what is going on. The overall plot of the film felt so fresh that i was amazed that it was something i haven't really seen in a horror movie. Rather than giving you an outright idea of the villain it has you guessing, is it real or is it not, it is the mystery that helps keep you engaged. <br/><br/>The incredible film-making and storytelling is accompanied by the absolutely incredible performance by Essie Davis as the mother. Her portrayal of this character is what made this film so engaging and also very frightening, and if this film had gotten a much wider release with more followers we could have even seen her getting a nomination for best actress, but regardless of the award she has really shown the capability of her acting. The only downside i experienced was the ending, i felt that if the movie ended 10 minutes earlier it world have been much better, it was almost too anti-climactic and a way of giving the audience almost a definitive finale.

Do not read ahead if you have not yet seen the movie.<br/><br/>I just watched this film with some friends and have to say, I was really excited to see it. I'm not usually a huge horror film fan, but I work in the Film industry so can appreciate other elements of the flick. The composition and mood to ""The Babadook"" was incredible. The use of shadows and all the typical horror elements was flawless, the cinematography amazingly done.<br/><br/>However, with that in mind, I am only giving this movie a 7/10 for the sole reason that the ending was so much worse than it could have been. I didn't severely dislike the way it ended, but there was SO much potential for a much more interesting, still psychologically related ending. I wanted it to be deeper, more mind-twisting.<br/><br/>The near final scene where she brings the bowl into the basement is what killed it for me. They spent nearly the entire movie making this creature, this Babadook, into a psychological, almost split personality, not physical thing, and had the mother's character beautifully represent it when she loses it at the end... and then with that final bowl scene made it suddenly into a ""thing that lives in the basement"". I understand it can be perceived, and perhaps was intended to, that the Babadook is still a part of her, that you ""Can't get rid of him""... but that scene made it seem something completely different than just another part of her. It made it seem like a physical monster, which was what this film was trying to avoid I think. I found it very cheesy.<br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed the film, but felt a little underwhelmed watching the last 10-15 minutes seeing that as the end."

","The Babadook is a good horror film. The directing is brilliantly uncanny and unsettling, the music and sound editing work great, the acting is mostly excellent.<br/><br/>The film's build-up is very engaging, although it does include very obvious foreshadowing. Overall, it has a very sad and depressing feel to it. A mother is hugely traumatized by the manner her son was born, and, for about half the movie. the son seems to be indirectly traumatized by the mental state of his mother. The myth of the ""babadook"" is really just a tool through which we can see the gradual degradation of a broken, depressed mind. It does not really exist, we are merely looking at the world through the eyes of a person who gave up on life long ago, as is pretty clear from the symbolic contrast which lies heavy in specific scenes.<br/><br/>This impression is the one i got until the movie started to take the boogeyman figure too seriously. That's also what was making the movie great. At the finale, however, it decides to discard any originality and greatness by becoming a below average horror flick, an embarrassing exorcist wannabe. The babadook is ultimately real, so the film aims to find a place amidst the hundreds of devil/demon/poltergeist stories we hear only too often. Nothing fresh, nothing new, nothing interesting.<br/><br/>The ending and overall conclusion to the mystery is extremely disappointing, as if someone purposefully tried to destroy the film's quality. That doesn't take away from the great directing and acting though, so the film ends up being just above average."

Its stated that the mom is a children's author, she wrote the babadook, she fixed up the babadook, the babadook is her, she is the babadook, the babadook, is a literal and metaphorical figure of the way she copes with her husbands death, and her loneliness, isolation, and depression, which is why at the end only she can control it.

","I'd heard of The Babadook a few months back and was fairly eager to watch it after a friend had said it wasn't quite what you'd expect from an average horror film. With the horror genre seemingly beginning to dwindle into simple moneymakers, The Babadook offered something different. Instead of creating a supernatural antagonist that has a craving for blood and destruction , the film teaches the audience that the real horrors can lay within oneself.<br/><br/>The film isn't your typical horror flick with cheap jump scares galore, it was an hour and a half build up of tension, slowly exposing the deterioration of the mother's mind. For a horror film the cinematography is just stunning. The use of time lapse in the sleep sequences and the stop motion for the - almost animated - monster scares were far more harrowing than any James Wan flick in recent years.<br/><br/>Essie Davis' performance was also another highlight as she conveys a slowly maddening mind with a convincing portrayal of grief and insanity. Also the young Noah Wiseman - as irritating his character was - performs with succinct realism and doesn't add too much 'Hollywood child star' to his performance.<br/><br/>But sadly, this film didn't sustain its brilliance as far as narrative. With just twenty minutes to go, the film had done a 180 and brought in a stereotypical climax with a seemingly rushed solution. The ending was unsatisfying and the metaphors behind the whole film were quite unoriginal, turning the film into what was a terrifying horror set in a real world with real family problems to a fantastical world where the mother can obviously get away with murdering the dog and trying to strangle her son and where everything is solved and equilibrium is restored in a matter of a night.<br/><br/>Overall, a great film for the first hour and ten minutes but the conclusion slacks, making this sorely disappointing as it is such a unique narrative with great directing and acting, using suspense instead of outrageous horror and containing it within a domestic setting. This film still deserves an 8/10, I can forgive the last 20 minutes for the sake of the rest of the brilliant film."
"BA_Harrison","6","7","31","1 December 2014"," What is The Babadook? You decide.
","A supernatural horror story about a malevolent book character who enters reality to persecute a single mother and her emotionally troubled son, or a psychological drama that charts the behavioural issues of a fatherless child and the consequent mental breakdown of his stressed out mother? Eerie Aussie movie The Babadook is open to interpretation, refusing to give any concrete solutions to the many questions raised, making it both an intriguing experience and a rather frustrating one at the same time.<br/><br/>Given the evidence, I'm convinced that The Babadook, the dark creature that invades the home of Amelia (Essie Davis) and Samuel (Noah Wiseman) after they read a mysterious children's pop-up book, must be a figment of the imagination, a monster of the mind that stems from a case of severe depression, repressed guilt and sheer exhaustion; for the most part, the film certainly works best when seen this way (the alternative being too silly to comprehend), but as the film enters its final act, this viewpoint still raises issues for which I fail to find satisfactory answers, particularly in the effects laden final act that sees Samuel thrown about the house by an invisible force and Amelia suddenly reverting from raving lunatic back to caring mother after confronting the monster (after which she keeps it in the basement and feeds it worms?!?!).<br/><br/>Thankfully, despite the whole ambiguous 'is it real or is she barking mad' approach being a well-worn horror cliché (The Shining, anyone?) and not working quite as well as it might, writer/director Jennifer Kent conducts proceedings with such an assured hand that the film still proves an entertaining watch, conjuring up some excellent macabre imagery and a chilling atmosphere of foreboding, helped immensely by a convincing lead performance from Davis as the extremely fraught Amelia and a passable turn by youngster Wiseman as her thoroughly irritating son (by the end of the film, I wanted to feed him to The Babadook as well!)."

","Australian films are a rare find. Even rarer are Australian horror films. And even rarer are Aussie films that are exceptional. Of the Aussie films that I have seen that would rank on my list, the only one I can think of is Wolf Creek. So when I watched Babadook, I was expecting something good, or at least, would give some form of chill experience.<br/><br/>Babadook starts off with Amelia (Essie Davis) reading a bedtime story to her son, Samuel (Noah Wiseman). However, this is no ordinary bedtime story, but a creepy version of ""What's Under The Bed"".<br/><br/>This film is disturbing on many levels.<br/><br/>First, Amelia reading a scary bedtime story to her child was the first thing I picked up on. I can only surmise that she really likes to scare the crap out of her son to the point where he is seeing real monsters, or she just didn't give a rats ass about him. Amelia is the type of woman who will not win the ""mother of the year award"", in fact, her parenting skills are very lacking in every department.<br/><br/>Second thing I noticed was that she lived in a large 2 story Victorian-era home. Now, either she was renting the home, or she was paying a mortgage. Regardless of which, it is doubtful that she could afford renting/paying off such a home, considering the realistic home prices in Australia, and being a worker in an aged care facility, it is highly doubtful her salary would cover the basic mortgage costs.<br/><br/>Third thing: The Babadook. The Babadook makes appearances here and there, and even calls her once or twice. One scene in particular is when Amelia answers the phone and we get to hear this creature say in a ""creepy"" tone ""Ba Ba Dook""<br/><br/>Fourth thing: (Spoilers): At the end, when this demon/ghost/creature/whatever couldn't have her son, it flees into her basement to live out the rest of it's existence, with Amelia feeding it a strict diet of worms Yeah Okay..<br/><br/>This film may be scary for some, and others will say that is was brilliant, but to be honest, this film failed to raise any scare factor for me to the point where if this ""monster"" was real, it wouldn't scare me outta a daydream.<br/><br/>The SPX were passable, but the Babadook gave me the impression that it was a mix of some of the characters that Johnny Depp has played over the years (Edward Scissorhands/Willy Wonka).<br/><br/>I did find that the acting was mediocre, with the exception of Noah Wiseman, who was very exceptional in his debut role. I will say here that Noah has a brilliant future ahead of him if he follows his acting career.<br/><br/>The writing and directing by Jennifer Kent was good, but sadly the film did not live up to the hype and expectations.<br/><br/>My Rating: 5 out of 10 (5 being for Noah)"

The kid was annoying and I guess he was meant to be but overdid it in the first 30 minutes but thankfully settled in and overall did a great job. Essie Davis was amazing and went from being helpless and out of her wits to borderline psychotic and handled the shift really well. The set design, music and the cinematography all combined to create a sense of foreboding and dread very effectively. A tight, taut thriller that goes BOOM in the last 30 minutes but then unfortunately I think is let down by the last 5 minutes to come to the weird ending. While I am OK with the ending being ambiguous, it seemed like the film-makers were going for the usual clichéd happy ending which given the events transpired before seemed almost too easy for Essie Davis character. I'm not sure what the whole toothache and her pulling her tooth out in the climax signified either? <br/><br/>Overall, an effective thriller with some amazing use of sound design to create a chilling atmosphere with some great acting by the two leads but let down by a weak ending that just didn't quite know where it wanted to go.

","Although interesting to look at, The Babadook is an appalling mess of a horror film, with irritating characters, a lack of genuine suspense, and a style that's more likely to evoke mild bemusement than sincere dread and terror.<br/><br/>The premise is a familiar one. Young Samuel (Noah Wiseman) is seemingly haunted by a spirit that no one else can see, and of course no one else believes said spirit exists, least of all his mother Amelia (Essie Davis), who's struggling with the sudden, violent death of her husband and sees Samuel's ""ghost"" as Samuel's way of dealing with his own grief.<br/><br/>Things kick into a higher gear when Samuel finds a book called The Babadook on his bookshelf. No kids' book this, The Babadook is about an out-to-get-you entity, complete with terrifying artwork and menacing words. It's so scary that Amelia can't stomach reading it all to Samuel. This ain't no ordinary book. The Babadook will come a-calling, first to the child in disguise and then to the kid's mother; then it'll just do it's haunting thing. The better to drive you insane, my dear.<br/><br/>Samuel begins to act out. I got the impression that he'd been having behavioral issues (likely stemming from his dad's death), but once the book arrives, those issues increase infinitely in intensity. He misbehaves in school, at the park, and at his cousin's party; at the latter, he pushes his obnoxious, teasing cousin out of a treehouse, which enrages his aunt. So much for family and understanding, right? Eventually, Amelia is able to secure some medication for Samuel to keep him calm, but soon the spectre of the Babadook is in her head, too.<br/><br/>A few points. First, even in recent memory there have been plenty of nobody-believes-I'm-being-haunted plots. Even with the children's book as a hook, this story is well worn indeed. But what really counts against it is that the kid is so over-the-top horrible from the beginning of the movie that it's nigh impossible to feel any real sympathy for him - until and unless the plot says it must be so. Samuel is, to put it bluntly, a real jerk. He's mean to everyone and disobeys his mom constantly.<br/><br/>Sure, we can explain this away by pointing to the dad's death (he died in an accident on the way to the hospital when Samuel was born) - but since he never knew his dad, it feels like the logic is twisting to suit a screenwriter's desperate needs. Samuel is so obnoxious that he spends about the first twenty minutes screaming ""MOM"" at the top of his lungs. I'm sure you parents out there can relate to how wonderfully appealing this sound is. It's so nice to be wanted.<br/><br/>When Amelia herself inevitably becomes haunted by the Babadook as well, things get progressively worse. She's angry! She's normal! She's loving! She's cruel! She's seeing things! She's experiencing reality! It's a whirlwind of lazy, lazy writing. And, true to the trope, no one believes Amelia's claims that Something is happening - not the school, which clearly doesn't care about Samuel's well being; not her sister, who doesn't stop to consider that Amelia may truly need her help; not the Child Services people, who drop in unannounced and have no idea why this person is cleaning the kitchen because of a hole in the wall that doesn't exist. No one cares. Maybe that's because everyone involved saw the first part of the film, in which neither mother nor son comes off as particularly sympathetic.<br/><br/>I got the impression that this movie merely needed a better director (than Jennifer Kent), writer (Kent), and actors (Davis and especially Wiseman). That's not asking too much, right? In the right hands, The Babadook would have been a stylish, Gothic psychological drama, but instead it's a run-of-the-mill plot sunk by aimless direction and a real lack of panache. There are just too many ludicrous scenes in this film to stomach. William Friedkin, of all people, claims that he's never seen a more terrifying film than this one; we can thus infer that Mr. Friedkin has never seen his own horror classic, The Exorcist."

","Babadook is the debut feature length horror film from Lars Von Trier disciple; Jennifer Kent. The film is also the adaption of an earlier Kent short called Monster.<br/><br/>In this film we are shown the lives of Sam, a mentally troubled child, and Amelia; a windowed orderly on edge from the constant disturbances of her son and the death of her husband. Horror in the film stems from the breakdown of reality between Sam's nightmares and the stress Amelia suffers looking after Sam. Vehicle for action in the film is the appearance of a red book titled The Babadook, a sinister Gothic style book that depicts the demon hanging over their lives. And the plot progresses with Sam and Amelia trying to escape this demon. <br/><br/>The script is obviously in three acts, and there are pacing issue as a result. Characters change abruptly, and the usual ""tension- release-tension"" method for psychological horrors is over-used. Scares in this film are mainly jump scares; and this style can make the more frightening elements of the film lose gravitas. Also considering the film is designed to have a particular Gothic feel, with oppressive elements such as dark clothing and dreary sets, this oppressiveness of Sam and Amelia's lives bleeds into every aspect of the film, once again distracting from the actual horror.<br/><br/>My main quibble with this film is how derivative it seems, and in my opinion, Kent directly lifts certain themes and scenes from Von Trier himself. Antichrist would be so similar in direction, set and tone that the overlap shows that Kent possibly worships Von Trier and has no other real influences. Another major problem with this film is it lacks any subtlety or subtext, and it can be quite disengaging when things are expressed so literally.<br/><br/>There are some merits to this film; a strong second act and realistic performances from the two main actors. But to me this film just feels like a lost opportunity, Kent had plenty of good ideas but I was just disappointed by Babadook, it felt like a movie where the director was too engaged and couldn't see the glaring flaws."
"aharmas","9","3","10","21 December 2014"," Real Madness?
","This is a study on guilty, regret, and fear. A mother must live with the pain of losing a dear member of the family and the possible hate for another. At first, it all appears to be about a very troubled and troublesome child. He embodies everything that we fear our children can become, unstoppable brats who live to cause trouble of every possible kind. This boy doesn't fit anywhere, disliked by just about everyone who he runs into.<br/><br/>Then one day a book shows up, and the focus changes. This supernatural and creepy picture book launches an attack on both mother and son. It is all now about protecting each other. From the beginning Essie Davis has done a superb job portraying the stressed mother, and as madness begins to take over, she decays into a crazy woman who might just do about anything she can to stop the impending threat. Unfortunately, madness seems to be winning, and all of her fears are now projected onto her son. This doesn't seem to be heading into any direction but absolute disaster.<br/><br/>Ms. Kent gets about everything right. First, we see the pressures brought upon family member by the accident and growing up unable to deal with the loss. Truly, everyone is affected, and the boy is the target because he did after, all, survived that traumatic event. Every shadow is dangerous, every noise a sign that something or someone lurks in the shadows. Is the book real? Has it been imagined? Who created it? The mother is most interesting character because she is after a caregiver who can't or won't do a good job both with her professional care or her own son. Then, she reveals in a key scene that she used to be a writer; therefore, we suspect she can be behind the creation of that book because she has plenty of imagination and the forces that trigger that imagination come from real pain and fears.<br/><br/>It is a dark trip all the way to the end, and this has to be one of the strangest, most powerful explorations of guilt and terror in the movies. It makes the mother in ""Carrie"" almost benign. This one lashes out physically and verbally and is torn by forces she can't understand or stop.<br/><br/>""The Babbadook"" is a powerful work because it feels real, based on real forces, and it shows unexplainable moments like the best works of horrors do, but it wouldn't work without a great performance, and that is Ms. Essie Davis, an actress who is capable of giving us whatever is needed to understand what the character feels, needs, or most importantly, in this case, fears."
"CinemaClown","Null","3","10","27 November 2014"," If It's In A Word Or It's In A Book, You Can't Get Rid Of The Babadook
","An Australian chiller that gets most things right than wrong in a time when almost every other example of its genre is filled with clichés & cheap thrills, The Babadook arrives as a handsomely crafted horror film that presents a welcome absence of jump scares & relies on a chilling sense of dread brought upon by its moody atmosphere to deliver the frights.<br/><br/>The Babadook tells the story of a single mother who is still grieving the loss of her husband despite many years having been passed since the tragic incident & is on the verge of falling apart due to her child's behavioural problems & continuous fear of a monster lurking in the house. But very soon, she comes to realize that the monster part may not be all made-up.<br/><br/>Written & directed by Jennifer Kent, it was the film's glowing reviews that made me check it out in the first place but it didn't turn out to be scary at all. But unlike most horror films of today, this one touches on some deeper human emotions with a plot that's soaked in symbolism & themes. Cinematography makes really good use of lighting, contrasts & shadows, editing is a mixed bag while music has a mostly muted but effective presence.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Essie Davis stars in the role of the single mother & her work here is really good as one can make out that her character is going through a lot right from the opening moments. Noah Wiseman plays the annoying kid who ultimately manages to get on everyone's nerves as the story progresses which pretty much explains her mother's dilemma since anyone will go absolutely crazy with a child like that.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, despite getting to see such amazing word-of-mouth reception for this film from most people here as well as critics, The Babadook turns out to be an underwhelming cinematic experience for me even though I do admire its effort to try something different with the genre & its take on grief plus creepy ambiance is excellently carried out. Maybe I expected too much but Jennifer Kent's feature film debut is nonetheless a well-crafted chiller worthy of a shot."

Other than the fact it took at least 50mins for anything to properly happen, there is no point to the movie. <br/><br/>We recently watched the conjuring and we were to scared to leave the room after it. I would NOT recommend anyone wastes the 90mins of their life on Babadook. In fact people should probably be paid to watch this.

","Direction/Writing:<br/><br/>Jennifer Kent does a good job directing ""The Babadook"". The cinematography and direction is very well done and creates an eerie atmosphere. Her writing is below par and seeing that there were no other writers doesn't surprise me. The writing tends to be generic, unoriginal and corny. However it comes from a good place and I believe with some more development and maybe an assistant writer her films could be as well written as intended. A huge problem I had with this film was the sound. There was no eerie/ambient soundtrack or mix, but at the same time it wasn't dead silence which at times can create the same desired effect. <br/><br/>Acting: <br/><br/>I wasn't a huge fan of the acting. Very rarely does a child actor evoke a strong response from me and this was not one of those times. Essie Davis' job was on the weak side as well but was probably my favorite performance of hers to this date. Not much to say, it was rather bland with a few peaks near the end.<br/><br/>Final Thoughts: <br/><br/>I was never scared by this film at any point despite the well crafted atmosphere, this was possibly due to the very obvious foreshadowing if it can even be considered that. Some interesting symbolism throughout but none reaching too deep. The book was fantastic, I loved every scene including the book and I think it saved the film. I also greatly enjoyed the last 10 or so minutes but they do not make up for the rest of the film. I would recommend this film but set your expectations low."

"timbow-45055","4","3","11","19 April 2015"," Unintentionally hilarious film that's not in the least horrific - unless you're 10!
","Either I'm so desensitized to horror flicks that they don't bother me anymore, or this low budget film from my Aussie homeland was really really lame. Not helping the matter is the villain's unfortunate and childish-sounding catchphrase (which I won't reveal here) which cracked me up the first time I heard it - it's akin to trying to sell an adult on a monster's capacity for horror by having it to go round muttering ""boogie boogie boogie""! Also, the child in the piece was so off the charts annoyingly brattish that my wife and I were eventually rooting for the Babadook to strangle the little bastard and put an end to the misery - ours and the mother's. We were even joking that he in actual fact WAS the monster in the film and that when the Babadook eventually turned up he'd flee the house in abject terror.<br/><br/>The film also really dragged on from about half-way, to the point where we were both actually waiting impatiently for all the mayhem to really get going.<br/><br/>Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that I'm Australian and am therefore much more familiar with both the film industry in Australia, as well as the nuances of Australian culture. Either way it just meant that I didn't really view the film as the kind of high art horror flick that others seem to have bestowed up on it. But then, most Aussies tend to feel that way about how our films often get received abroad, as if the 'foreign' aspect gives them some kind of mysterious cache that seems almost laughable to us. I've seen films that were more or less ignored or justifiably panned in Australia received with open arms in the USA and elsewhere by people who couldn't 'get' how lame the films were through Australian eyes. Look at the Mad Max films - they were throwaway and poorly written apocalyptic schlock churned out on minuscule budgets, yet have gained an overseas reputation since then that's entirely undeserved.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT One other thing that makes the film even more laughable is the manner in which one has to suspend disbelief at the manner in which the boy goes from being an utter and uncontrollable little monster through the first half of the film to the quiet and loving voice of reason and calm as his mother gradually starts losing it through the latter part. As child psychology goes, it 'don't play'! Also, my wife and I would have bet the house on the fact that old lady next door was going to get cut up by the mother towards the end, so we were bitterly disappointed to find that she didn't end up mincemeat on the front steps or in the foyer.<br/><br/>Lastly, there actually was a murder after the film, when I grabbed my wife and started strangling her, screaming 'Babadook dook dook' at her (seriously, you don't think that's a hilarious delivery from a supposedly horrific figure? It's up there with Peter Boyle's Frankenstein monster dancing to 'Putting on the Ritz') for getting me to watch this silly film on the premise that it was supposed to be one of the 'scariest' films in recent memory! PS to William Friedkin - what have you been smoking?"
"stevenvanveldhuizen","5","3","11","3 January 2015"," The ending ruined the otherwise interesting movie.
","This movie was doing pretty much fine until about ten, fifteen, minutes before credits. The story about an annoying child and a stressed out single mom, whom had encountered a boogeyman, had so far succeeded in making me feel pretty uncomfortable. Both mother and child played their role well, and the only criticism I had on their performance was that they maybe played their parts a little to well. I wanted to shun them just as much as their friends in the movie did, and I felt like warning the old neighbor-lady to stay away from them. The ending however (and I'm shocked the other two reviews I skimmed didn't mention it's horror) killed everything that had been building up and left me with my mouth open: The single mom ,touched by her child, puked out a black puddle and so ended the boogeyman possession. But of course, because you can't so easy get rid of Mr. Babadook, there had to be a final showoff. The monster that had been haunting mother and child the whole movie, and had even been able to drive mum crazy enough to kill the family-pet, wasn't giving up without a fight. There was in the end however no fight. She just told the monster he was nothing and was trespassing, and this for some reason send it to the basement. One or two scenes later it had just became something of a pet, that they fed worms to. And no reason was given whatsoever. There was no explanation on why it was defeated, or what it was even. The monster was in the end, just like the movie, a question mark and a letdown."
"gardoma","5","3","11","31 December 2014"," Well done, but vastly overrated
","This movie was a let down. The movie's reputation is overblown and widely undeserved. It pleases to a certain intellectual breed of moviegoers who would appreciate the cerebral plot and the undertones. And it certainly has atmosphere and interesting visuals. However, the Babadook is very, very, very thin on content. It is, basically, an extended metaphor for accepting one's own inner demons that crawl beyond the surface of socially accepted rules and moral practices. But this simple premise is too thin to be stretched to a full movie, and, once you can see through it, the result quickly becomes boring and pretentious. As a genre movie, it does not contain enough thrills to really be interesting. As an art movie, it just does not have the necessary depth. So, the movie can only live in the middle ground, essentially pleasing the crowd that does not typically enjoy neither horrors nor more sophisticated movies. Some visuals are stunning (like the recurrent images of the main character floating), but they seem designed mainly to remind the viewer of how much smart and sophisticated this movie is supposed to be. The most disturbing aspects of the movie? The fact that I actually paid 6.99 to watch it on DirecTV."
"phatdan","8","3","11","8 December 2014"," Fantasy Horror vs Disturbing Subject Matter
","'The Babadook' appears at first to be just another slice of horror for those who enjoy the genre. Indeed, not only horror, but, as was 'The Shining', a disturbing psychological study of a mentally ill mind. And, as such it works well. But, the average horror buff isn't going to be satisfied here. It is obvious that there was no intention for 'The Babadook' to do so. One can draw an easy conclusion of why the writer-director Jennifer Kent would labor at such elaborately abstract images to exact such a story. Perhaps to allow us to come face-to- face with evil without the graphics - thankfully - although there are some images that are very disquieting. In today's world of high school shootings, decapitations, and massive carnage, American society doesn't like dealing with its own dysfunction. We let politicians do it. We seldom seek counseling from those that might give us insight. Even when our youth are gunned down in our own neighborhoods do we refuse to negotiate even halfhearted contemplation about the potential evil that exists in the human psyche."
"MidnightMax","7","3","11","6 December 2014"," A nice try but no cigar...
","""The Babadook""- This Australian Horror film concerning a single mother and her little boy being terrorized by a sinister presence oozes with atmospheric creepiness but the dramatic content is a bit too familiar and presented in a harrowing/suffocating manner. The narrative is derivative to a fault, filled with tired horror film clichés that desensitize a seasoned viewer in rapid fashion; ""afflicted"" person pulling their own tooth out for no good reason, every secondary character's flippant dismissal of the central character's plight, a mysterious crack in the wall oozing insects, deeply troubled child, cute but doomed pet, etc.,- it goes on and on and on. The majority of this is decidedly unpleasant (as opposed to entertaining) material. Perhaps my biggest issue with the film is the shrieking, ridiculously over-the-top ""performance"" of young Noah Wiseman- the child is an insufferable little heathen and does wonders for working against the film. ""Troubled"" here equates to ""extremely annoying to the point of wanting to strangle the little bastard"".<br/><br/>There's artistic merit and legitimate atmosphere on display, though to harp on how this film is ""smart"" or novel in some way is completely ridiculous. Yes, ""The Babadook"" is far better than most of what's currently being dumped on Horror movie fans, but in a cinematic year that's included such truly awful horror genre films as ""Ouija"", ""Annabelle"" and ""Deliver Us From Evil"", that's not saying much at all. ""The Babadook"" is a nice try from Writer/Director Jennifer Kent, though I find myself more looking forward to what she's doing next as opposed to fondly reminiscing over what I had just got finished watching. Ultimately I don't care if I see it again, though I can't call it a bad film- the throwback feel (there's very little CGI to speak of) is commendable, Essie Davis (the Mother) is very good and it's filmed exceptionally well.<br/><br/>""The Babadook"" is essentially an analogy for mental illness- think a lesser-budgeted, pale imitation of Kubrick's ""The Shining"" mixed in with shades of ""The Machinist"" and ""Session 9"" (all films I believe are vastly superior). One of the more wildly overpraised and overrated films in recent memory, it looks like I'm going to get through 2014 without truly appreciating a single Horror film released during the year... 7.0 out of 10"

","I think it certainly deserves 8 points but it is good in building tension and has very good scary elements. It has many good ideas but not elaborated enough. So if you are a horror fan and if you haven't watched this film I suggest you to watch it certainly.<br/><br/>*Edit* Since it is certainly announced that there won't be a sequel, I cannot do anything but to downgrade my rating to 6 as it stands quite incomplete and nothing much more than a jump-scare film.<br/><br/>***Spoilers below*** <br/><br/>I did have second thoughts about giving it 8 points. It certainly does it job to scare but so does the scream or blair witch when you watch it for the first time. Unfortunately at some places, it only depends on noise, sudden volume ups, screams and yells to scare you though.<br/><br/>I think what people are fascinated about this story is that it makes you think that the woman has psychological problems. Perhaps she has but in the end you are presented with a real monster feeding on worms. That gives the story a very unusual taste. A taste that is good only if it was accompanied by some more explanation. Besides this point, there are also many other elements that are not explained in the story. First of all, the death of father. Did he die in an accident that his head got cut off? Did he die just after talking about the weather? Are those just the imagination of the mother? So the story does not elaborate on the accident enough. It also does not make sense that father died while taking mother to hospital. It is normally the mother that dies during the birth not the father. There is something quite unusual there. How did she reach the hospital then? Was that a car accident or train? What happened during the accident? The film also leaves it unclear whether the bugs are just the psychological hallucinations of a traumatized mother or the way our supernatural being, Babadook, messes with his victims. These are all left unanswered.<br/><br/>A good horror film is the one that scares intelligently. As a standalone film, Babadook feels more like an unplanned story written hastily without connecting dots. Moreover, it gives you the feeling that there is something really intelligent going on in the background, that will be explained in a sequel.<br/><br/>To sum up, Babadook is a very good yet incomplete horror film. It is probably the first film of a saga as there is so much left to be answered and without these answers it is not much different then an average horror film. Yet, it is simply a big disappointment if there is no sequels. The accident of father is a serious aspect that needs to be explained more detailed. Yet what is even more important is the babadook himself. His character is not elaborated deep enough and there is so much potential to exploit in there. Hopefully, we all will enjoy this treasure in its sequels in following years...<br/><br/>Unfortunately it is announced that there won't be any sequels. It is good to leave some stuff to imagination, I like that. But this film leaves too much for imagination as it is."

","While the acting was stellar, the story line was flat and the script facile. My daughter and I watched it together, expecting some good scares but it failed to deliver even one for either of us. Descent was scary. The Exorcist was scary. Witch was brilliant and scary. Babadook was not in their league. For one thing, it was predictable throughout. There were too few characters to provide much external or secondary plot. The one possible injection of a romantic interest for the female protagonist was ignored and it was uncertain as to why the potential suitor was even brought into the script. He might have given the lead character a bit more depth and opened more avenues for a spiritual showdown so to speak. The closet and under-the-bed thing was same old, same old, except when the Babadook seems to have attacked them while the mother and child were under the covers, at which point the ghoul does nothing more than say his own name, as if that goofy incantation would shiver our timbers. Instead, it laughably sounded much like a drunken old man pretending he was Topo Gigio. Baba's two physical appearances in the movie are both shining examples of the poor production values in evidence in this movie. In one scene, Baba appears, suddenly, looking like a Hallowe'en mock up of Edward Scissorhands gliding along by his collar on a dry cleaner's pulley along the ceiling, clickety-clack sounds and all, and in the other we only see a bit of a jerkily opening wing in a dark end of the bedroom, which means what? Baba is a dark angel? That his wings suck and don't open well? The ending is ridiculous and a total rip off from Sean of the Dead, except in SOTD, it was funny and a little sentimental. In this movie, it just seemed like the writer ran out of ideas and opted to ask his eight year old for some guidance, and she or he came up with ""mud pies"". For me, the movie was not scary, was poorly written and scored a 2 out of 10 based solely on the great acting chops shown by the lead and the young boy.

She struggles to discipline her 'out of control' 6 year-old, Samuel (Noah Wiseman), a son she finds impossible to love. Samuel's dreams are plagued by a monster he believes is coming to kill them both. When a disturbing storybook called 'The Babadook' turns up at their house, Samuel is convinced that the Babadook is the creature he's been dreaming about. His hallucinations spiral out of control, he becomes more unpredictable and violent. Amelia, genuinely frightened by her son's behavior, is forced to medicate him. But when Amelia begins to see glimpses of a sinister presence all around her, it slowly dawns on her that the thing Samuel has been warning her about may be real.<br/><br/>As much as it provides some genuine mystery and jolting scares, the movie also serves as an insight into depression and the depths of hell our personal demons can plunge us to. Though the screenplay takes longer than necessary to build and at times even appears dull, the Director manages to hold our interest till the ball really starts to roll, and then our wait is delightfully rewarded with some spine-chilling thrills and chills galore, without ever subjecting viewers to cheap, horror clichés. The performances from the two leads also hold the film together and they lend immense volume to the narrative turns over to the more intense portions.<br/><br/>""The Babadook"" is one of those films where you realize that the wait was really worth it once you enter the final third act. In fact, the last 20 minutes or so of the film showcases some of the best supernatural, bone-chilling elements assemble on screen. The twist at the end is also something you'll never see coming. If only the movie picked up sooner, or if Director, Kent, exercised as astute a control over the first half of the film as she displays in the second, ""The Babadook"" would have easily found its way into the pantheon of horror classics. Nevertheless, it's more than a decent way to spend a night seeking a genuinely spooky tale shrouded in mystery and some spine-chilling thrills."

","Alright. Movie time today with my friends, the guy that chose the movie was a typical horror genre fan, so i was prepared to watch another wannabe horror movie of the 21 century.To my surprise it came up to be a great comedy movie!<br/><br/>You can't help but laugh every time the mother was enraged or when the bambamboom appeared in a scene. <br/><br/>I mean this movie has a pretty high rating for a horror type and i was expecting to watch some scary moments but the fact that this movie is rated above 5 is scarier than the movie itself. I even thought that i was watching a different movie because by the time it ended there was nothing to justify that high rating. The plot was absolutely terrible to the point that you think why the heck this movie was allowed to be made.<br/><br/>I ain't gonna suggest you to not watch this. In fact i'm gonna suggest you to watch this, just to learn, what's the definition of a bad movie."

","WARNING CONTAINS ""SPOILERS"" So much premise leading up to this film, so I was highly anticipating at least some kind of scare factor. This film has been labelled a horror but I would much rather it be changed and put under the romcom section, basically this film is about a woman and a child (can't remember their names) who get ""terrorised"" by this badabook ting which looks like an extra from a KISS gig. The beginning is slow, the middle is laughable and the ending is just confusing, I won't ruin it for everyone but my highlights are a kid gets pushed out a tree, the mother gets stabbed in the knee, the woman next door drinks tea, the badabook is allowed to flee, summing up this film to an intolerable degree"

","My husband and I had high hopes for ""The Babadook."" It seemed like a good horror movie without the Hollywood bloat. It didn't have the typical all good-looking, young cast. This made the movie much more relatable and enjoyable. In order to not give away any spoilers, let's just say we were not impressed with the sudden CGI that came out of nowhere and ruined our image of the Babadook. Sometimes the unseen is better left unseen. Definitely in this case. The sounds were scary enough! Also, we're not fans of movies that leave their endings open for interpretation. We want to see their story; not make up one. Or maybe I just didn't get it!<br/><br/>On a better note, the main character was a great actress. And although we felt nothing but annoyance for the boy throughout the beginning-- which I assume was the director's intention--he grew on us.<br/><br/>This would have been a great horror movie--almost up there with ""Sinister""--if they hadn't ruined it with unnecessary computer imagery. Then it just became laughable. I could even maybe accept the ending this time around if I wasn't already so turned off by the CGI."
"bobsprit","5","4","17","6 December 2014"," Weak story derails spooky effort
","I don't know how people grade a movie like this with 8 or 9 stars...or even 7. It's a fairly interesting and well acted film, but the screenplay is an utter mess. Never once do we understand what the Babadook is, what it wants and the storyline essentially morphs into each setup with little originality. Using elements of everything from Exorcist to Signs, The Babadook just never finds a story it can tell with any hint of coherence. Instead, it floats along on scene after scene of admittedly unsettling moments, but never seems to know for a moments what it's all about. Ultimately The Babadook cannot come close to delivering on what is promised in the book read by the mother and this unrealized groundwork makes for a grade C effort. Whether it's Ghost, Ghostbusters or the Evil dead, a good story needs to have a direction that is both clear and dynamic. The Babadook has neither."

","Review:
'The Babadook' is an Australian psychological-horror film written and directed by Jennifer Kent. It is based on the 2005 short film 'Monster', also written and directed by Kent. This movie re-invests the horror genre! Not only is this movie a creepy monster movie, but it's also about grievance and depression when you look into it deeper. The way it's portrayed in this movie, by the end you're left wondering whether the Babadook was even real or just a manifestation created by the resentment Amelia had for her son over the years.
The film follows Amelia (Essie Davis) and her son Samuel (Noah Wiseman). Samuel is an outspoken boy, who does what he wants without thinking of consequences. As Samuel's behavior worsens, they two become more isolated from family and friends, and things get strange in their home, when what appears to be a children's story book titled Mr. Babadook shows up. When Amelia reads the book to Samuel as a bedtime story, she quickly realizes it's not an innocent children book at all.
The acting in this movie is breathtaking and real. It stars Essie Davis as Amelia, a widowed mother still in despair over the death of her husband on the day her son was born. Her son, - played by Noah Wiseman - is a difficult six-year old boy named Samuel. He is very outspoken, prone to violent outbursts and likes to train to hunt monsters only he can see with homemade weapons.
I love the fact that Jennifer Kent knows that a great horror movie doesn't need to rely on cheap jump scares. To me, unique twists and bold choices will always be better than the cookie cutter horror clichés we have nowadays. This movie is truly terrifying and raw to its core, as well as being highly entertaining.
Overall, this movie is an excellent genre-defying horror movie, and I highly recommend it to any horror fan! 'The Babadook' gets my stamp of approval!
5/5"

"pere-25366","8","1","2","27 October 2017"," A frustrating second half dampens the effect of a spectacularly tense and promising beginning
","For the first hour or so, The Babadook unfolds as a spectacular film. The story is set out for us of a widowed mother named Amelia who has struggled to cope in life following the death of her husband. What's complicated the recovery process is being the mother to Samuel, a six-year old with serious social and behavioural issues. One day, Sam finds a seemingly children-targeted book in his shelf called Mister Babadook, which she can read to make him fall asleep. But the imagery of the book is disturbing, so much so that it begins to haunt (""Dook! Dook! Dook"") Amelia and Sam <br/><br/>It's as soon as from the opening scene that we get a sense of the surrealistic elements the film will present us with. And everything right from the beginning credits click - the sinister atmosphere is developed, slowly and unnervingly. Amelia is exhausted but sharp, emotionally damaged but poised and self-assured. Sam is unstable, impulsive and riotous. Both struggle in a world post the death of Oskar (Amelia's wife / Sam's dad) and even their closest loved ones struggle to have Amelia and Sam a part of their lives. <br/><br/>What makes this film spectacular in the first half is its gradual development and subsequent change of both its tone and characters demeanour. Without spoiling any of the plot, how the characters interact and behave in the beginning slowly transforms and this subtle shift is pulled off masterfully. Their is a loss in humanity that doesn't come off as contrived or forced. And with only a mere 90 minute run-time, it is done incredibly efficiently, something with which many longer horror films struggle. This is thanks to the incredible cinematography, direction and acting. <br/><br/>This film is strongest when it suggests and doesn't show. Its buildups far exceed their payoffs - the incredibly subtle camera-work and construction of suspense is stuff Hitchcock and Kubrick would be proud of. In fact, in terms of a film creating a sheer tense atmosphere, The Babadook is among the best I've ever seen to do so. It is unfortunate that a strong first half is derailed by an unquestionably inferior second half, with a puzzling ending that will probably leave you frustrated. Nevertheless though, this remains one of the best horror films of the 2010s and certainly one of the best Australian horror films in recent memory."
"dreenphlanger","6","1","2","16 April 2017"," Interesting, but nothing new
","You don't need violence and gore to make a horror movie. And Babadook is a fine example.<br/><br/>Even though the idea itself is nothing new, I found this movie interesting. Mostly because of the actors who did a really amazing job and greatly contributed to the overall impression of a dark and bleak atmosphere, with their frustration and agony very well depicted. It is a psychological horror story, but only mildly frightening.<br/><br/>A few objections are due to the very slow pace of the movie, and due to the fact that some quite important story-related things are left unexplained.<br/><br/>Thus, if you exclusively like shocking, bloody, violent jump horrors, then know that this movie isn't for you."
"xfaaf","7","1","2","16 September 2015"," Impressed and confused
","I don't normally entertain watching horrors as they all tend to follow the same formula. This was chosen by a friend and I must say I was quite impressed and also left feeling rather confused. I won't say what I mean but I'm sure if you give this movie the chance it deserves then I'm sure you'll know.<br/><br/>Some elements of this movie that I really enjoyed, like the lack of music to build up the tension. The silence plays on viewers perfectly.<br/><br/>No big names to make this movie work well, just a well directed movie! Overall I would recommend this movie to people after something a little different, even if only so you experience what I felt by the end of it!"
"Bunuel1976","7","4","18","3 November 2014"," THE BABADOOK (Jennifer Kent, 2014) ***
","Although I was vaguely aware of the film under review being ""the new phenomenon"" in horror movies, it had slipped my mind to try and score a copy for my month-long Halloween marathon which I have just gone through. In fact, it was the recommendation of a local film-buff friend of mine which jogged my memory and made me spring for it sooner rather than later. As usual, in hindsight, the end result fell just short of all the hype that had preceded it – but, having said that, it is still the best horror film I have watched since James Wan's surprise box-office smash, THE CONJURING (2013). Being a contemporary low-budget Australian production, it is small wonder than none of its cast and crew ring a bell but, as it turns out, as had previously been the case with legendary genre stalwarts like George Lucas and John Carpenter, writer/director Kent's breakout film turns out to be an expansion of a previous work, in this case the award-winning short MONSTER (2005; which, incidentally, is generously available to view in its entirety on ""You Tube"")!<br/><br/>The simple storyline revolves around a widowed care-worker and her disturbed young son being menaced by the eponymous villain of a children's book. The film is anchored by two exceptional lead performances from Essie Davis (as the beleaguered mother) and Noah Wiseman (as her volatile kid), sensitive and subtle handling and a creepily effective sound design. Surprisingly enough, the titular villain (played by Tim Purcell mostly in silhouette) barely features in it – which makes its belated and sparse apparitions all the more electrifying. Unfortunately, the director still felt the need to cater (ever so slightly) for the ""torture porn"" crowd and gore-hounds in the audience by, at one point, showing the possessed mother plucking out a tooth from her own mouth (for no apparent reason!) – thus virtually stifling the effect of the preceding scene (one of the best in the film) where she breaks the neck of her fluffy dog during a late-night TV screening of the original Italian-language version of Mario Bava's BLACK SABBATH (1963)! – as well as exorcising herself of the offending spirit (which, inexplicably, she later keeps chained in the basement!) following a bout of bloody vomiting!!<br/><br/>Like most horror films of recent vintage (particularly the good ones), as it was unfolding in front of me, I was reminded of several earlier genre efforts to which the film-makers could well be paying tribute or referencing, the most prominent of which here being Roman Polanski's REPULSION (1965; in its harrowing depiction of the psychological unraveling of its sex-starved female protagonist), William Friedkin's THE EXORCIST (1973; in the medical examination and possession sequences), Mario Bava's own swan-song SHOCK (1977; in the fractured mother-son relationship played out in a house haunted by the malevolent presence of their late husband-father) and the Tobe Hooper/Steven Spielberg blockbuster POLTERGEIST (1982; in the climactic aerial abduction attempt by the spirit on the boy – who had been constantly coming up with elaborate weapons to combat it). The trump card of this particular film, it seems to me, is the fact that all the supernatural horror on display emanates from an obscure literary figure that finds itself in the house out of nowhere, puts itself back together after the mother tears the inventively illustrated book up and even rewrites itself anew in a more personalized and intimidating manner as a consequence of this very defiance!"

"BennyBamLegacy","4","2","7","8 May 2015"," Babadook dook don't do
","I had heard some good things about this and after watching ""It Follows"" recently I admit I temporarily was restored in thinking maybe a new wave in the genre was sweeping over the immersive slasher takeover of recent years in horror films. However, despite high hopes and really wishing this moving was at least up to par, I realized after a short time that it was really just a recycled version of every other movie with little explained and even less sense made. <br/><br/>SPOILERS BELOW*** The movie opens with an odd sequence involving an accident and a floating lady which most certainly feels like a quick and easy way to either foreshadow or get cheap on character development(never a good way to start a movie, set it up first...). As the movie trails beyond that opening you learn that she is a withdrawn mother after a tragic accident with a child who seems to have serious behavioral issues at school and even around his own cousins. The acting is not bad, but the plot is filled with holes as a book is introduced from nowhere in their home, and the mother reads it to her son despite there being obvious connections to his behavior(she reads it out loud to him which then terrifies him even further). <br/><br/>Slowly she begins to realize the book is why her son has acted strange and makes attempts to find out about it and then get rid of it as actions escalate. Eventually it gets to a point where her own family thinks they are both crazy and don't want to help them. She begins to get more aggressive until the sequences of dreams and dealing with her son turn into her not having an aggressive nature and treating him as if she is possessed and want to harm him. <br/><br/>Eventually she is fully possessed and her son makes good on a promise that they will protect each other and ties her up in the basement. He gets a little too close and she tries to kill him, but she internally fights the Babadook with the love for her child which then causes her to throw up the black vomit that apparently is what has possessed her and then makes an epic last stand which apparently causes the Babadook to fear hurting them as she claims it is trepassing. The movie ends with them reclaiming their lives in normalcy and feeding worms to the Babadook which is now living among them in the basement for some reason unbeknown to the viewer. <br/><br/>Starts odd, ends odd. Just an overall odd attempt and generally not scary at all."
"AudioFileZ","4","2","7","16 April 2015"," At Least It Wasn't More ""Found Footage"", Still Misses More Than Connects
","Australians have a way with stark stories and visuals and this is such a film. However the usual magic of the whole rising above the humbleness ain't here. Should I have known by the name? Maybe in some culture somewhere the so-called ""Babadook"" commands respect or something, I thought it sounded pretty dumb and in no way hip or cute...or scary. As you can guess I'm a bit at odds with this movie. In some ways I think it could have been a lot better, but it stumbles on it's own dogged determination to build a world of misery for Amelia (I think that's the mother character's name). From the start there isn't a thing that seems pleasant or right, maybe save an elderly lady that babysits the son sometimes. The viewer simply can't invest in the mother or the son and we're not given anything other than the crazy black vapor of the Baba-whatever. The boy is so irritating he's either the most vile child actor of recent memory or he's actually got issues? Either way one quickly feels nothing for the kid, or the mother for that matter. Let 'em lie in their dingy beds in their dark home without any friends save for the ""dookie man"". I can't even remember how it ends I was so divested of the entirety of it. Move along, nothing to see here...how this is getting good reviews alludes me."
"jfgibson73","8","2","7","9 January 2015"," Fun To Interpret
","This was a movie that I thought about quite a bit after having watched it. As an allegory, it seemed evident fairly early on what was causing the problems for this family. Amelia is a widower struggling to raise her 7 year old son, Sam, when a supernatural presence begins to torment them. We are shown that Amelia has clearly not dealt with the loss of her husband and that along with the grief, Sam's behavior is beginning to wear on her. We can see her slowly losing control and her mental health deteriorating, and so it is an easy leap to make that the paranormal happenings are related to her mindset. My interpretation differs slightly from what I have read in many other discussion of the movie. I think the Babadook is not an actual creature, but something representing the emotional baggage Amelia carries in her subconscious. Throughout the movie, I kept expecting her to deal with these buried emotions in a healthy way and remove the threat completely. I was looking forward to this moment and see how the filmmaker would choose to represent it. What actually happens it kind of confusing as far as what it seems to say about how the director feels we deal with our issues. The actual moment when Amelia defeats the Babadook consists of her telling it that it is nothing, it doesn't belong in her house, and then screaming. The aftermath is that she seems to have control of the creature, which I think is meant to suggest she is dealing with her pain but that it still remains somewhere within her. There are ways that people can deal with and release buried emotions and pain, and I felt that not demonstrating this in a clearer way was a lost opportunity. Some other thoughts: this is a movie layered with symbolism, and there was clearly a lot of thought put into everything said and shown. That said, I don't think everything works or represents what it is meant to represent clearly, but it was thought provoking nonetheless. Also, the performances are striking. The young boy does some things that I don't think a child actor has ever done before, and it was incredible what they got out of him. Essie Davis has such a wrenching performance that it's hard to watch at times--she really goes through the ringer. Finally, I don't know that I would have appreciated this movie as much when I was younger. I think it is more effective for people who have started to become aware how our experiences affect us over time and how our subconscious actually works. I'm glad I saw this, even if I disagree with what it says about the inner workings of our minds."
"tatianadirashvili15","8","2","7","30 December 2014"," Not what I expected.
","Wow... This film is definitely a ""wow"". Many what the hell moments, plenty of creepy scenes and the musical accompaniment is ""nice"", if I can say so. At the beginning of the film, i could not really understand all the things that were happening around in this movie and you don't have to understand it all from the first minutes, it all comes to you slowly and by the end, you can feel the release, facilitation, however a bit of confusion as well of what was the film actually about. It is not a standard horror movie, it's very different from random ones and definitely a very good one with great performances. This movie is about great sadness and how it can swallow your life slowly and painfully if you don't stand up to it and if you do not learn how to treat it. It is also about understanding your closest person, loveliest one. Overall, this one is a very good one! Highly recommend. (don't see it on your own, it is really creepy)."
"SwayingAngel","4","3","13","21 July 2015"," Completely overrated
","I love horror Movies and I'm generally a complete scaredy cat. So when I found this one and kept hearing great things about it it was a given to Watch it. Sadly though I was thoroughly disappointed. It had great potential and the build up was fantastic but it had zero follow through. There were a lot of things that could have been done better and been explained to greater extent,for example where the book came from and how exactly it came to be. It did have a few good moments there that had me pulling my feet up from the floor but not nearly enough for it to be worth spending time on it. The ending was a complete disappointment and rather confusing since it just fell flat. Needles to say, me and my friends were not impressed at all. Don't waste your time on this one, it just goes to show you can't exactly trust a Movies rating on IMDb."
"dtaber-2","2","3","13","21 February 2015"," Thank God its only 93 minutes
","The movie seems vastly overrated to me. The first 60 minutes is a tedious story about an annoying 6 year old brat and his mother who seems to be in a dire need of Xanax. Then the movie gets plain lame. It was just tiresome to watch it. The characters were dull and uninteresting, not a single one appealed to me (dough I have to admit, that the 6-year old kid was played quite well). There is some animal cruelty in the movie, and I don't mean cruelty to bugs here. <br/><br/>Also, the ending makes very little sense (at least for me). I forced myself to watch the last 45 minutes of the movie just to see the ending, some sort of explanation, or perhaps something surprising, something witty at the end. Not surprisingly, the ending is as uninteresting and dull, as the rest of the movie. <br/><br/>Seriously, don't watch it. <br/><br/>And if You start watching it, and feel disinterested - don't force Yourself to stay to the end. It is definitely not worth it, and answers no questions."
"Theo Robertson","7","4","21","12 December 2014"," Efficient But The Short Film Was Much Better
","I saw Jennifer Kent's short film MONSTER a couple of hours ago and if there one thing more shocking than the scare tactics in that film it's how easy it is to find online the feature length film MONSTER inspired . If nothing else it means that a film that would have remained unknown and obscure as been given a much wider audience . The question is if it's worth seeing ? <br/><br/>The answer is probably yes but with rather strict reservations . If you're looking for an expanded version of MONSTER unfortunately you might be left a little disappointed . Where as in that short the monster was the focus of the story here it's little more than a plot device and its great strength was scare tactics which it carried off brilliantly . Here however it's the mother / young son dynamic that is important and the horrors are of a more psychological nature . Despite being written and directed by Jennifer Kent THE BABADOOK doesn't share a lot with MONSTER <br/><br/>The flaw with THE BABADOOK is that there's not a lot of narrative drive . We get hints that something is not right in Amelia's household but nothing really happens until well in to the second half of the movie . Before then the story revolves around the mother Amelia and her son Samuel . Essie Davis as Amelia is good in her role but the character is rather unlikable and unsympathetic , and you get the feeling the producers are trying a bit too hard to get a few mainstream award nods for Davis . Unfortunately Noah Wiseman as Samuel is simply dreadful and one of those irritating kids you hope something nasty happens to <br/><br/>In summary THE BABADOOK is efficient as a psychological horror film . It relies on suspense and mystery rather than violence and gore but if you've seen MONSTER then all the things you loved about that short are conspicuous by their absence so this version isn't really a version of the short but still manages to get a generous 7/10"

","***Spoilers warning*** For start, it's an overall good horror, but the pace is slow. As a high rated movie from critics I expect this Babadook to be scary from the start, but it's not. We have to wait for more than 10 minutes for the Babadook to be introduced. This problematic kid are also annoying, heck, most of the script isn't really appropriate for the kids, there is this one scene that they mock each others parent condition and it ended up Samuel push his cousin and hurt her. Not to mention Samuel is yelling in almost every scene (what an annoying child). The story itself is great, it's about a single parent who lost her husband and for somewhat reason blame her child for it, but she also love her child, which make it a little bit complicated. One of the disappointment is the ending. I kinda hope that the Babadook is something that manifested from her own hate for the child and Samuel make it worse for her. But the ending suggest it's not, instead she conquered it and the Babadook escape to the basement and hide there (stupid). And even after that she fed the Babadook with a bowl of worms??? What a crappy ending.."

"bigbenjr48","2","2","8","9 May 2015"," A Good Drama, But A Bad Horror
","I understand that people have different tastes in movies, I have seen this difference in the horror genre more so than any other. But I've gotta say, The Babadook has got to be the worst piece of crap that I have seen in years.<br/><br/>It seems to be the type of film that only horror-snobs could love....and endure.<br/><br/>Since I'm working more and posting less on here, I have seen very few reviews of this movie that seem to be positive. And a scant few negative. I have also seen posters who are sick and tired of even hearing about the movie. This is why I had to see for myself what the fuss was all about.<br/><br/>This movie did not scare, frighten or chill me one single bit. And isn't that the basic reason for a horror film? Isn't that (ultimately) what a frigging' horror movie is suppose to do?<br/><br/>I will never accept psychosomatic, post-traumatic, paranoid-schizophrenic, delusional, post-menopausal disorders as horror movies unless someone is actually killed/slashed as a result. And the only death in this film was the much talked-about (but unseen) death of papa-do-little in a car accident.<br/><br/>And I wanted to kill that kid. If he were my kid I'd be facing first degree murder charges that gets reduced by reason of insanity. I saw more than half-a-dozen reasons that would warrant me ramming my foot in this kids ass. And for that reason, this kid has my props for being a very gifted actor. And the mother was in denial of this little bastard, despite being fully aware of (and also witnessing) many of his destructive actions. Also, she was sexually repressed, post-menopausal and depressed. Watching her as she frantically masturbated turned me on so much that I wanted to jump through the flat-screen TV and give her the beaver-banging that she so desperately craved (and wasn't there an awkward moment when that kid made some sort of sexual advance on her?).<br/><br/>When she finally tried to kill the little bastard, I cheered. ""Get that little S.O.B!."" I shouted.<br/><br/>This movie was well made, but stupid.<br/><br/>The mother reads a fairytale book about The Babadook. Soon after, the kid starts seeing (and is terrified by) this monster that his mother cannot see. The mother puts him on sleeping-tranquilizers. The tranquilizers work and the kid stops seeing The Babadook. Now the mother only sees The Babadook and the kid doesn't. The kid knows what his mother is seeing (even though he can no longer see) and tries to help.<br/><br/>The Babadook is actually the Father/Husband. They both are simultaneously mourning and swapping delusions. They both wish him back, and have both manifested him in a fk'ed up way. The manifestation of him as evil (I suppose) represents how not letting go is tearing them both apart (booooooring!).<br/><br/>Who cares if my Sigmund Freud psychology is wrong, the movie still sucked as a horror. Had she taken the same drug prescribed for her son then she may have also been cured of her hallucinations as he apparently was. This speaks a lot for prescription drugs (perhaps this film was a subliminal product-placement for pharmaceuticals).<br/><br/>This movie wasn't a horror, it was a movie about coping with the loss of a loved-one.<br/><br/>As a horror, I give it a 2/10, because a horror it ain't.<br/><br/>As a drama, it deserves an 8/10, because, in all fairness, it was good for that category.<br/><br/>But I will never call nor accept this as a true, straight horror film."

","Going in to this I thought I was going to be scared out of my seat, as a result I was left disappointed, don't make this mistake. This is a psychological thriller.<br/><br/>This movie is very obvious in its intent and themes. 20 minutes in and you'll know how this movie goes. There is a mother who is clearly depressed, sleep deprived, and most importantly unable to get over the lost of her husband. This ultimately brings her son into a poor nurturing environment where he struggles to grow up.<br/><br/>Clearly the mother is the creator of the monster. There are many evidences for this such as the paper like monster or the fact that she is a writer. This is great and I prefer this to an actual monster, however I have problems with the way this is done. The son is obviously affected by the monster. This leads us to believe that it is all real. We are also shown the babadook throughout the movie then at the end are left ""seeing"" an invisible monster. I understand that this represents her keeping her troubles ""in the basement"", but I don't see how this is a good way of doing it at all. It doesn't do a good job of wrapping up the movie and just adds to the mess. <br/><br/>The movie is done mostly well. I dislike the fact that it seems to be trying to work as a demon and inner demon story. This is why it is a 6 instead of a 7.5. <br/><br/>And if their neighbor loved them so much where was she when all that screaming was going on?"

If 90% of viewers don't see it, or they do not find it entertaining or valuable when they do - then what's the point? I don't need a scarf wearer named Basil to blurt out the word ""metaphor"" as if that automatically morphs a bad movie into a good one. In order for a movie like this to be worthwhile, it must be good both above AND below the surface. Unfortunately, this is neither. Instead it tricks the viewer into watching a movie about something they never intended to see.<br/><br/>This movie is exactly what it is and nothing more. Don't let anyone shame you or call your intelligence into question if you found it, like I did, both annoying and silly. Don't argue! Just smile, hand them a clove cigarette, and call it a day."

","The movie built very little suspense to me. I was getting a little annoyed by the kid who was playing as Sam, or maybe it's the fact that I don't like kids in general. Anyway, it's another one of those movies where a little kid somehow sees a dark entity, no one else knows what the kid is talking about, and the kid starts to behave strangely. The main kid, Sam, read a book about some monster called Babadook and he thought it was real. The movie was not original and the script seemed very simple. You don't even get to see what the Babadook looks like exactly. It's another one of those horror movies where they don't want to show the audience what the monster actually looks like because the film makers thought it would make the movie more scary. It was just stupid.<br/><br/>The movie never explains to the audience where exactly the Babadook came from, why it does what it does, and how the Babadook came to life. <br/><br/>Close to the end of the film, the mother of Sam, Amelia, begins to act strangely also and starts to believe in the Babadook. I know, very original, right? Not to mention, the Babadook made some very generic monster sounds that we have all heard many times before. The Babadook creature tried to attack Amelia and Sam but Amelia decided to scream at the Babadook and shouted ""IF YOU TOUCH MY SON, I WILL FVCKING KILL YOU!"" The Babadook ran away and hid in the basement.<br/><br/>At the end of the film, Amelia was gathering worms in her backyard for the Babadook to eat in her basement and we still don't get to see what the Babadook looks like. After that, Amelia went back outside and was all happy to be with her son Sam. Umm, quick question, how did Amelia know the Babadook would eat worms? <br/><br/>Wtf? This movie was just boring. I did not care for any of these characters. The scariest thing about this movie is the fact that this movie currently has 98% on Rotten Tomatoes."

And you sit there and you are like: ""Did I just waste one and a half hours of my life?""<br/><br/>Yes, yes you did.<br/><br/>Because that's just it. It's all build-up, with no climax. When the credits finally roll, you sit there unsatisfied...as nothing made you jump.<br/><br/>On a technical level, visuals and audio suck. Picture quality is like 2000. There is hardly any soundtrack, which would have possibly helped terrify the audience. And there is no cinematography whatsoever.

Everybody, including her own sister, hates them, rightly so.<br/><br/>Please note that the WORKING CROSSBOW never gets disposed of by the mother but is inexplicably left in the hands of the child.<br/><br/>Weird stuff starts happening almost immediately, killing any building of suspense.<br/><br/>Character development is quite superficial. What she is doing in her life is merely hinted at, as is her relationship with the old woman. Only thing we know is that the dad died in a car crash. How this is functional to the story, I have no idea.<br/><br/>Also why is the babadook book in that specific house? What are its origins? Why is it haunting this family? How exactly do they defeat him? What were is intentions and why? The movie does not bother to elaborate over ANY of this crucial points. <br/><br/>And some OLD tricks are so predictable.

Dear lord, that kid needs a good beating. After the first few minutes you will dream about the mother bashing the kid's face in but she never delivers. It's like having guests with a demented kid. The kid's rolling on the floor and making annoying sounds, but instead of them doing something about it or at least pretending like nothing is going on, they are in the constant state of confusion - that is the entire movie.<br/><br/>If you don't want your body developing an ulcer for 1.5 hours, stay clear off this one.<br/><br/>3 stars only because the kid's book was spooky."

It just looked so different from the rivaling horror movies of 2014. And I especially wanted to see the monster up close. Overall, I was pretty disappointed. I'll still be fair though:<br/><br/>THE GOOD: The cinematography & art direction was brilliant. All the colors of the house really built up the feeling of depression that the mother is going through. The sound design was very effective. Also Essie Davis is a decent actor. <br/><br/>THE BAD: That kid is sooo F***king annoying! At first I thought he was kind of cute and maybe everyone was just misunderstanding him...but eventually, I could not bare to hear or even look at him. Holy crap! Way worse than Jake Lloyd. Waaayy worse. Also in one scene they used claymation to render the Babadook, which was so bizarre and looked amateur at best. And the ending was just stupid: really? Your gonna feed it worms forever?

","What I really liked in this film was the sense of it, the creature, the fear and everything being more than what it seems: that it is all a metaphor for dealing with grief, sadness and despair. Aside from that, the ""babadook"" itself and the scary way he is shown to the viewer through a children's book really gave me the creeps, which is always a good thing.<br/><br/>What I didn't like about this movie was the horrible acting of the little boy in my opinion. In comparison to his mother he seemed way too ""non-scared"" for me to come across as truly terrified, even though you would expect this from a child like him that is going through the stuff he goes through. This, combined with the cheap feel that the audio- and visual effects had about them (I even heard some stock screams, no kidding) kinda screwed the creepy feeling of the movie for me sometimes.<br/><br/>Another thing I really, really was disappointed about was the ending. I'm not gonna post any spoilers but those of you that already have seen the movie know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>All in all this movie certainly wasn't bad, and most of its' problems were a direct result of the limited funds that were available.

This movie wanted to present mother's grief after that horrible accident and the distancing between her and her son, but in the end it only manages to confuse people inducing random action, hard to watch and stupid moments and i felt like the acting was really off.

","I saw the film exactly one week ago today and not a moment has gone by when I don't ache. It finds me in the shower; it haunts me in bed; it has filled my mind and clings to my thoughts, and it won't let up. I try to lie to myself, to find some solace by saying that it's just a movie, but I know better. The Babadook is alive, and he represents so many aching people, so many untold stories. There is no contrivance, no manufactured importance; there are no tricks. The Babadook tells, with painful honesty and frankness, the story of a gay monster's life and nothing more. Whether you are gay or straight, it doesn't hit close to home: it hits you. The Babadook has a place we all most desperately yearn to go. It's where we can be free. It feels funny to say that The Babadook is my favorite film of all time, because I think it almost an injustice to call it a film at all, or to critique its incredible technical sophistication. Somehow The Babadook transcends that. I could hear a thousand speeches celebrating diversity or read a hundred love stories and not be absolutely broken in just two hours as I was after this film. I've never felt waves of nausea come over me as I did sitting in that theater, my face contorted as I watched truth and honesty spill from the screen and onto moviegoers who had no idea what they were in for. I am usually the first to point out bias, so I know my words might be mistaken for favoritism or blind loyalty. They should not. This movie will change your existence. I find so many things in my life trivial now in the wake of this film---for me, watching it was truly like having a near-death experience. And am I better for it? Yes. Broken and undone, but better. For once in my life, I feel hope, and I've seen the Babadook through all his trials and hardships, accomplishing acceptance."

","This is a very special ghost story, the main reason for that is because the ghost or whatever you want to call the Babadook is there for a reason.<br/><br/>It's not just a haunted house where someone was killed before or something like that. The entity manifests itself for a reason that becomes clear while watching it. And even when it becomes clear why it's there it still is very mysterious and the real nature of it is unclear. It remains that way even when the film is done. Afterwards you'll be thinking about it and it keeps you hungry for an explanation.<br/><br/>I really like that, this is one of those horror flicks that proves that horror is a very intriguing genre when done right. It has more to offer than just cheap jump scares, scary images or gore. It has depth and a real story.<br/><br/>A must see for everyone, not just the horror fans."

","Here is a film that has received a lot of positive buzz this past year. Receiving especially high acclaim from The Exorcist directed himself William Friedkin. So, being the horror nut that I am, I knew I had to give it a chance. I'm glad I did.<br/><br/>A depressed and troubled widow, Amelia, has raised her six-year-old son Samuel alone. It's extremely difficult for her because the kid is beyond troublesome. Constantly yelling, threats of violence and an obsession with weapons has driven her to her boiling point. One day a children's book appears on his bookshelf. She reads it to him...big mistake. The grotesque pop-up book details murder and mayhem for the young child at the hands of The Babadook. Throwing the book away doesn't help, because he has already been unleashed. <br/><br/>The first thing I noticed, besides how annoying this kid was, was the art direction of the house. How incredibly blue and grey everything was. It was striking how drab the interior was and how it matched her depression. Kent, the director, has cited Polanski and Lynch as influences. This film feels like an odd mix between Eraserhead and Rosemary's Baby. So those inspirations shine through here and it makes for a well done horror film. <br/><br/>Very few horror film rely on real genuine scares, they instead opt for the cheap jump scares that heavily rely on sound rather than sight. The Babadook doesn't really go that route. Thank heavens. It slowly builds the tension and releases the horror at the right moments. We see glimpses of 'him', like Bruce in Jaws, which amps up the fear.<br/><br/>I can understand people being put off of the film due to the kid. He does ruin the picture at times. I get that he is suppose to annoy, irritate and make the viewer want to inflict pain onto the poor lad, much like the mother feels, but there is a breaking point. He does a good enough job, but I totally understand where people are coming from in their dislike for the film because of his performance. The mother does a good job here as well. We feel tired like here throughout the beginning of the picture. Kent manages to switch the fear here. We fear for the mother, then we fear for the kid. It was an interesting move between characters. <br/><br/>With real scares, The Babadook is this years The Conjuring. Enjoy yourself....ba...ba.....DOOOOOOOK."

Phenomenal performances by Essie Davis as a widowed mother, and Noah Wiseman, as her idiosyncratic son, are what makes this film tick. Radek Ladczak's eerily beautiful cinematography, and heart pounding sound effects add to the creepiness of this little gem.<br/><br/>When a strange children's book shows up mysteriously on a bedroom bookshelf, the horror begins! In someways, the Mr. Babadook pop-up book , is scarier than the film itself. With each reading, the book becomes more and more disturbing to the boy's mother.This film will both sadden and shock you to the core!!! I highly recommend it to all movie lovers, for while it is a taut little horror film, it is also an astounding study of human grief. Don't miss it!!!!!"
"zacharylab0525","10","1","3","8 November 2015"," The Babadook
","The Babadook is an Australian film directed by Jennifer Kent. This is her breakout film and she is a phenomenal director who is hopefully going places. The film stars Essie Davis as she gives a truly Oscar-worthy performance as a mother of a boy who is scared very easily, and whose obsession slowly turns into madness. <br/><br/>This movie is about a young boy whose mom, suffering after the death of her husband, finds a book on the shelf called ""The Babadook"" and decides to read it to her son. The boy gets scared of the book, and soon begins to be obsessed with the idea of the Babadook being a real thing. It starts to effect the people around him, too, including his mother. That is as much as I can tell you, because this is a spoiler-free review.<br/><br/>The Babadook is not only the best horror film I have seen in 2014, it may be one of the scariest horror films of all time. Don't believe me; just ask some of the biggest names in horror. Stephen King says ""Deeply disturbing and highly recommended."" And William Freidkin (director of The Exorcist) says ""I've never seen a more terrifying film than The Babadook. It will scare the hell out of you as it did to me."" The film has immaculate acting, directing, writing, and cinematography. The Babadook is a fantastic movie, and I highly recommend it to any fan of the horror genre."

","The Babadook. I read about it, that probably will be a ""cult film"" in a few years I decided to see it. And for me is a complete horror film that discovers dark aspects of the mind, dreams and imagination. Using a lot of details of the characters of the horror silent era of the movies history, gives form to the Babadook. Interesting mix to reflect the different aspects of the fear of the characters and a way to justified an complete drama to explain the pain of the mother and the trouble to confront a lost and give a direction to her love to her son. Even is a mother-child relation, we attend to a very powerful, original and simple way to discover new ways to get inside to a reality where everything is possible and without the (ab)use of especial effects get in to the chaos of the mind that search the answer. Pure cinema magic and a very good taste and knowledge about the use of cinema elements of the horror genre. Pure magic and love to the horror cinema."

","Any movie that shows unwarranted harm to an animal automatically loses a number of points in my book. (I would have probably given the movie a 5/10 due to the incessantly annoying nature of the child, Samuel. I like kids but I couldn't help hating him, far before the Babadook ever entered the picture.) But, portraying the vicious murder of a defenseless dog was disgusting. It had already been depicted in the book - there was no need to have it play out in the movie, especially so graphically. The death of the dog wasn't necessary, but they especially didn't need to SHOW this scene. It could have been implied to even greater scare-factor. Shame on the filmmakers, and shame on viewers who use the defense ""it's only a movie."" That is never an excuse. <br/><br/>2/10 due to annoyances and animal cruelty"

","I tried. I really did with this movie. But it just wasn't scary. While you feel sorry for the mother, you almost want to take a switch from the nearest tree and wear her sons little behind out. The fact that the little boy was so disrespectful took my attention away from the movie, not to mention how sloooow the movie was. I was waiting, very patiently might I add, for this mysterious character from the book to show his bloody face. After awhile, I used my own damned imagination.<br/><br/>I'm used to a certain level of terror and The Babadook never left the basement level. Reading all of these great reviews leads me to the conclusion that most of y'all have never seen a genuine horror movie. My four year old would probably laugh at this movie and ask why anything would come out of a book. Did I mention that she is four? Just saying. It sucked. This is a good movie for the weak at heart and newcomers to the horror genre. I'm a freakin expert!! This movie made me yawn. Meh."
"LoveIsTheVaccine","7","2","10","11 December 2014"," Brilliant story that can't decide its genre
","Let me start by saying that THE BABADOOK is very difficult to talk about without spoiling. Because of the way the plot works and builds itself, every piece of the puzzle can be used as the key to solving the whole thing, depending on how you approach it. And yet, I found myself disappointed at the end. I turned to my friend Sara and we both asked each other ""was that it?"", expecting something more to happen. It is not by any stretch of the imagination a bad film; the story is certainly well-done and gripping, and the character development flawless, but it did leave a lot to be desired despite the stunning performances of Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman as mother and son.<br/><br/>In the film, widow Amelia is haunted by the loss of her husband while she tries to raise her uncontrollable son Samuel. One day, Samuel discovers a book titled ""Mister Babadook"" on his shelf, and requests she read it to him. The book tells the story of an entity known as ""The Babadook,"" and this entity begins to haunt the two, who must fight for their survival.<br/><br/>The main issue I have with the film is that it can't decide whether it is a family drama or a horror film. There are some definite horror moments towards the end of the film, but the atmosphere of the whole thing, from the muted color scheme to the close-up facial shots, feels more like a deep, complex family drama. Now, while this is valid considering the way the film plays out, it nullifies the horror aspects of the film.<br/><br/>This could have been saved if The Babadook himself had been a better monster. He had the potential to be: creepy dark outfit, fascinating-if-uncertain origin, apparent omnipotence- but as soon as he appears on the screen he loses all his power. His initial appearance in the film is laughable and it, unfortunately, sets the tone for the rest of the film. And then he just keeps appearing and his appearance loses impact although it barely had any to begin with. This is a problem that has become rather common in modern horror; it seems filmmakers don't know when and how to show their creatures. In the Hammer Horror/Universal years gone by, the appearance of the central baddie early in the film worked to the film's advantage, but nowadays we live in a realm of psychological horror, where the unseen is scarier than the visible. Considering the ultimate conclusion of the story and effect The Babadook had on the characters who encountered him, Kent would have done well to keep this in mind. There is a short section through The Babadook's point of view that is absolutely brilliant; I would have loved to have seen more of that. Honestly he could have not physically manifested in the film at all and that would have been perfectly fine. Also he sounded like a velociraptor. When you see the movie you will understand what I mean.<br/><br/>I am also about to crucify myself by saying this: the film lacked jumpscares. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not talking about the modern trope of entire horror films being nothing but jumpscares. I think that's silly. But at the same time, one or two jumpscares in a horror film can work to its advantage: it creates that expectation and tension that psychological horror needs to thrive. Essentially, it brings viewers to the edges of their seats. If you look at INSIDIOUS or THE CONJURING you will know what I mean.<br/><br/>But it wasn't all bad; it's one of those movies where if it doesn't register right away what is going on, the IMDb boards are a goldmine. I would up reading all of the other viewers' theories on the film while I was on the bus home, and everything clicked. But it shouldn't have taken me a bunch of reading to figure it out; I'm not saying Kent needed to spoon feed us, but a little less vagueness would have been nice. The story that's been crafted IS brilliant, though, once you get it.<br/><br/>Overall, THE BABADOOK is a film I'd like to see again now that I've read more about it. While I enjoyed it for what it was, I don't think it has quite the impact implied by all of the film's buzz. If it did, I doubt the entire row in front of us would have been laughing during what was supposed to be the film's most frightening moments."
"MartinHafer","9","2","11","14 May 2015"," Miss Fisher, what has happened to you?!
","Essie Davis is rather famous in her native Australia for starring in a wonderful television show ""Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries"". In the show, Davis is very glamorous--with he lovely black hair and perfect makeup and clothes. So imagine my surprise when I saw Davis starring in ""The Babadook""--with her natural strawberry blonde hair and absolutely no makeup whatsoever. In fact, instead of being a timeless beauty like she is in ""Miss Fisher"", Davis looks haggard and old in this film--perfect for the character but also a bit daring and very brave considering her sexy image as Miss Fisher.<br/><br/>In ""The Babadook"", Davis plays a harried and overwhelmed mother. Her husband was killed on the way to the hospital when she was going into labor and for the last six years, she's refused to deal with this loss. Additionally, her child is a holy terror--one that would drain even Mary Poppins! These serious problems combined with clinical depression and a lack of sleep make for an interesting combination. Soon, a frightful character from a sick children's book, ""The Babadook"", begins terrifying and tormenting her. Soon the audience begins to wonder just how real any of this is and just how close to losing her sanity this poor woman is.<br/><br/>This film is a very, very different sort of horror film. It lacks the usual cheap thrills and frights...and I appreciate that. Instead it shows the darkest recesses of the human mind and is enthralling. Much of it is due to Davis' amazing performance (she makes the film) and bizarre plot. This is much more of a thinking person's horror film-- one you won't soon forget."

"Coventry","7","1","4","16 January 2019"," The Ba-Ba-Ba, the Dook-Dook-Dook, that's all we need to scare you with!
","You always need to be wary and skeptical of new horror movies that are coming out and instantly receive unanimously praising reviews from the press and international festival juries. Journalist have quota, festivals need positive publicity, and in the end, you are left behind feeling disappointed and ripped off. I also can't help thinking that our quality norms and standards for horror movies have severely lowered over the past decade. In recent years I've seen numerous horror movies that are world-widely labeled as original, genuinely terrifying and atmospheric, like ""The Conjuring"", ""Don't Breathe"", ""The Witch"", ""It"", ""A Quiet Place"" or ""Get Out"". Don't get me wrong, ALL of these are more than adequate, clever and recommendable horror/thriller films, but NONE of them are the mind-blowing and astoundingly petrifying masterpieces that their ratings or reviews suggest.<br/><br/>Does this statement also apply to ""The Babadook""? Yes and no, I'd say. ""The Babadook"" is definitely a different and less conventional type of supernatural horror story. Writer/director Jennifer Kent clearly didn't feel obliged or pressured to make a traditional and mainstream blockbuster, and even downright refuses the use of typical genre cliches like false scares, polished and attractive lead characters or textbook villains/monsters. The ultimate proof of her devoted intentions, I think, is the fact that she keeps ownership of the film's legal rights just to prevent that someone will ever make a sequel. How exceptional is that in the horror industry? What Jennifer Kent did bring to the screen with ""The Babadook"" is a very personal, tangible and harrowing family drama that utmost benefices from its slow-pacing, foreboding atmosphere, bleak filming style and majestic performances (Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman). As to be expected from a psychological horror tale of this allure, it's a film with many layers; ambiguous and open for various interpretations.<br/><br/>Is the Babadook real or a fragment of the two emotionally troubled protagonists' imaginations? To be quite honest, I don't know. I'm not necessarily seeking out intellectual or thought-provoking cinema. I already have a lot of thinking to do for my job and I try to contemplate more deeply about raising my children, but I don't feel the desire to over-analyze every scary movie that I watch. I do tend to concur with the fellow reviewers who see ""The Babadook"" as an allegory on unprocessed traumas, everlasting guilt, difficult childhood years and the lack of strong role models. What matters is that Jennifer Kent masterfully brings the titular monster to life in a subtle yet unsettling fashion, and that both Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman empower its frightening existence through their stellar performances. Especially Davis is astounding, and I caught myself thinking stuff like: ""Get some sleep, you poor woman"") several times. ""The Babadook"" perhaps isn't the masterpiece that certain reviews claim it to be, but it's a truly impressive film and a must-see for genre fanatics. Jennifer Kent is familiar with the genuine masterpieces of horror, by the way, because her film contains footage of Mario Bava's ""Black Sabbath/I Tre Volti Della Paura""."

","The Babadook is yet another ""watch for the bed/closet/basement monster"" horror movie. But hey! Some of us can't get enough of those now can we? <br/><br/>So this one is about a troubled son and his single mom who's still coping with her husband's murder, 7 years on; when they receive an unwelcome guest announced by a dubious children's book. The mom, Emila (Essie Davis) is the traditional horror movie main character. A blonde middle-aged elderly nurse while her courageous son, Samuel (Noah Wiseman) is arguably the focal point of the story and his performance was captivating. Noah Wiseman seems like a name to retain.<br/><br/>The Babadook has little to differentiate itself within the genre. Aside from its cast's remarkable performance, and the clever way of introducing the monster. Although apparently it was heeded to add ""something"" to this movie, which shows in the quit uncommon ending. Yet I personally didn't dig that as an answer to the ever plaguing, genre-defying, question: ""how will we deal with the monster"". Technically, I would say it made good use of lightning, the setting is quit restrained but still complements the plot. It happens mainly in their house which one of the secondary characters dutifully characterizes as ""depressing"". The soundtrack features mainly classical music, conveying expectation/intrigue through repetitive 2nd minor chords; nothing outstanding in this department.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this movie can offer quit a jolt at times, and can guarantee a disturbing evening if not a sleepless night. It has a minimum age limit of 16, which seems appropriate.

","An alternative take on the perennial children's fable, the acclaimed indie-horror from the outback is a deliciously tensive polysemic anecdote with a soul. After 95 minutes with Mr Babadook you'll need the courage to sleep. A rarity in the pluralist postmodern pulp of contemporary arts, the Babadook is not the usual shlock, remake or valorisation of a genre so stuck in the mud it could be quicksand. Obsessional cost-cutting within Western societies have saturated the market - docu-horrors , found-footage spin-offs and awakened cult classics are regularly born (and reborn) as commodities for capital. Opposing as invigoratingly fresh, intelligent and intimate, 'The Babadook' is a daring feature with something to say rather than just something to sell. Gone are the predictable musical accompaniments urging you to crap yourself in your seat. So too the expensive special effects in making the perfect villain for abjection. In comes an ontological score destroying the seams of illusion, stop-motion animation creating the imperfect monster and truly awkward scares. All of this with a purpose, this is a film that knows its audience, a knowledge affirmed by subtle integral nods towards pioneers of the genre. <br/><br/>Jennifer Kent's skin crawling directorial debut converts myth into matter in creating a boogeyman figure that operates in a reversal to orthodoxy. Kent's fairytale monster, rather than asserting parental obedience, is the construct of an adults repressed emotion and negativity. Cultivated by real emotional stress - guilt, grief, denial, loss - the peripherals of the ostensible bugaboo laying in wait under the bed or in the closet craving child candy are forgotten. Mr Babadook prefers the taste of reality.<br/><br/>Cast with minimal quantity, maximum quality, the isolated two-bit Ozzie outfit of mother and child pour passion into their curious and compelling roles. Essie Davis's masterful and macabre representation of a psychologically deteriorating widower from austere to Linda Blair is so strong it drags the spectator into the depths of despair with her.<br/><br/>A metaphorical fermentation of regression, a supernatural manifestation of a loss, a subconscious delve into insanity. There is no right or wrong answer, so to speak, yet there is an encouraging voluntary acquiescence to decipher the text. Without an obligatory preferred meaning to an open-ended narrative, the film is tailored to the individual spectator and not the proletariat of its audience. Everyone has their own demons. Everyone has their own Babadook."

With the stunning acting of Essie Davis who plays the lead role as Amelia a widow and mother of her unstable son Samuel, played by Noah Wiseman, that work as a nurse for the elderly; their acting together makes the whole plot and situation believable from beginning to end.<br/><br/>Besides an outstanding acting something I most remark is the music. The way the compositor, Jed Kurzel, managed to take the typical nursery rhymes singing of kids and creepy music boxes melodies and use them, along with multiple other elements, in such a suitable and eerie way for this movie blew me away. A great example is when - *Spoiler*- in the middle of the night she hears a loud ""bang"" sound in her son room and runs to see what is happening, so in the whole mix of fear and desperation Amelia is feeling by the fact the she can't find her son, Jed Kurzel, pulls out an incredibly intense composition that muffles any background noises creating a scene of true terror and mystery. -*Spoiler End*-<br/><br/>Something I loved too was the overall aesthetic of the entire movie, the greyish houses, how the lighting played an excellent factor when the monster appeared, how all of this elements made it have a strong presence in comparison of his surroundings.<br/><br/>To talk about the monster, -*Spoiler*- I enjoyed it had a classic and effortless look, because it goes back to the old and early horror with the typical man shaped figure, which is entirely black, wearing a long coat and hat, is hard to get scared by that in modern days.

The Babadook is a perfect psychological horror. It takes the slow burn of The Shining and mixes it with a monster movie. It builds tension, and never breaks it with stupid jump-scares. This movies won't make anyone jump out of their seat, but rather dig their nails into the arm rests. I understand that this isn't a movie for everyone. This movie is for fans who are annoyed with how bad modern horror movies are, and that includes me. Some will see this film as an unscary piece of garbage because it lacks everything found in a modern horror film. It lacks cliché characters, cliché story, jump-scares of any description, and even a proper ending. This movie leaves the audience with a sense of dread form beginning to end, something I haven't experienced from a horror movie since the 80's.

What Jen Kent did with her script is not just a ""monster"" film, which it is, nor a horror flick, which it is, neither a psychological thriller, which it also is... so, to call this script a ""genre"" thing is out of question. She created a film with a deep rooting in human's ordinary life. Such as in being a mum (in this case, Amelia, played by Essie Davis... wow!)<br/><br/>Mothers can be loving, but they're all subjected to being mothers. And this film goes deep into that reality. More so, it goes where few films would willingly dare to go, and that's when a normal and caring mum simply snaps. Then, there's a very peppery ingredient added to the mix: this particular mum is struggling with the loss of her husband almost seven years ago, and simply can't get to terms with it. She grieves and is in pain and can't put her past away.<br/><br/>Her son is a sun, but a difficult and bright one. And he's not ""normal"". I mean, not by the standards of ""normal"" society usually adopts. This child believes and ""knows"" a particular monster lurks and actually lives in his cupboard. And he ""thinks""... and knows.<br/><br/>Said son, Sam (played unbelievably well by six year-old Noah Wiseman) wants to protect his mum from the monster. She knows it from a weird book (a beautiful character in the film) that recurrently tells her he's well and alive and he wants the boy.<br/><br/>This film is a roller-coaster of emotions pretty well beyond any ""horror"" film I can remember after ""The Shining"". <br/><br/>Little budget, but great creative team. Superb design and sets. Masterful direction and cinematography that defines a new standard, too, for a film like this.<br/><br/>Some people would like to measure this film with some recent very good (the recent very good) films like The Conjuring. Well, no. This one is a masterpiece of story-telling and a film that resonates constantly with every day struggles in life. This is not science fiction, nor horror. I suggest to put it in a category of its own.<br/><br/>I wouldn't hesitate to pit this film against some works from Bergman or Lynch. Absolutely outstanding."

","First off, the bad stuff. The story is fairly predictable, so much so that at the worst of it I found myself just waiting for what was going to happen next to be over with so that maybe the film could move in a new direction. Harsh words, I know, but I have watched hundreds of horror movies, and well, that was my experience with it. <br/><br/>Now, the good stuff. One of the best made horror *films* ever. Seriously. Dialogue, acting, cinematography, sound, visuals, everything is excellent. Visually splendid. Effects are flawless. But the sound, wow. One of the best mixed films I've ever seen. This is a low budget horror movie made at the quality of a high drama film, which is astonishing in itself. <br/><br/>If you are interested in watching a superbly well done horror *film*, I can't imagine you not liking the Babadook. There is no need to care about the genre, this should appeal to anyone who appreciates meticulous filmmaking. I can't wait to see what the writer/director does next. If you are in the mood for a fast paced fun horror movie while you eat snacks, skip this movie for now. Watch it when you are in the right mood. It is too fine a film too enjoy without proper attention, and it would be a shame to waste such a rare breed, an actual horror film."

","The Babadook is not like Godzilla, Dracula, or some other movie monster a child fears is hiding in their closet. Those beasts, by comparison, were real, in their outlandish zones anyway. In contrast, The Babadook is a manifestation of grief, tormenting the lives of Amelia (Essie Davis) and her son, Samuel (Noah Wiseman). His presence is there — strikingly evil and intellectually sadistic — but his existence is never as certain as we might like it to be, similar to how the ghosts in The Innocents could have easily been a twisted hallucination stemming from Deborah Kerr's psyche.<br/><br/>Lately, the best of horror seems to be found in independent cinema (You're Next, It Follows), The Babadook acting as its arguable peak. It is not a self-aware slasher nor is it a crafty supernatural farce; it is, instead, a highly original work of psychological terror. The directorial debut for Jennifer Kent, the film is, by turns, visually stunning (nearly everything is shaded with the metallic artistry of a IKEA designed prison cell) and genuinely chilling, though not in the ways you might expect. The real monster here is not The Babadook himself but the feelings of mourning, sadness, and agony, pressing on and on until they reach an explosive breaking point.<br/><br/>These emotions have been lingering over Amelia and Samuel for nearly a decade. Seven years earlier, Amelia's husband was killed in a car accident, an accident that took place only moments before Samuel was born. Ever since, Amelia sees her son as a burden, a reminder of the horrific doom she faced that fateful night. She loves him as much as any mother in her situation could, but it's no easy task, considering how precocious Samuel has become over the years.<br/><br/>Precocious, however, is too kind a word to describe his temperament. He seems only able to speak within the constraint of an ear-curdling shriek; he can hardly sleep through the night, believing he is tormented by monsters (building harmful weapons to try to avoid them); and, to Amelia's increasing horror, he is turning into an extremely violent child, eventually getting kicked out of school. She wishes he were normal, or, better yet, well-behaved. <br/><br/>Things take a turn for the ghastly when a mysterious storybook pops up in Samuel's room one night. Titled Mister Babadook, it is filled with disturbing images and a storyline certainly not meant for young children; the book promises that, once Mister Babadook makes his way into your home, he will never leave, will never stop terrorizing you. Amelia finds it troubling, but not as much as Samuel. If he wasn't already the child from hell, one might send him straight to a local asylum. His behavior becomes more bizarre than ever. He is convinced that The Babadook is residing in the house, talking to blank spaces in his spare time; he starts having hysterical outbursts, at one point breaking his cousin's nose at her birthday party. Gradually, though, his actions are eclipsed by his mother, who is showing signs of monstrosity similar to the apparently fictional creature.<br/><br/>The Babadook is not an easy horror movie. Gone are the jump-scares, the ghostly clangs that come from nowhere. Its most stunning aspect is its ability to hold a spectral atmosphere throughout its running time; even before the titular villain appears, despair looms like laughter in a '90s sitcom. If it weren't a horror movie, it would be a sinister study of trauma and its aftershocks.<br/><br/>Not to suggest that the film isn't already a sinister study of trauma. The allusions to grief are hardly subtle; The Babadook itself reminded me of a childhood story in which a big, green monster suddenly appeared and grew bigger every time a little boy told a lie. As Amelia tries to move on with her life, The Babadook gets stronger and more oppressive, reminding her time and time again that the memory of her husband's tragic death will never really go away, and that's a scary thing for someone wants to live a normal, happy life. I questioned the true existence of The Babadook several times; only Amelia and Samuel seem to be able to see it, the rest of the world oblivious to its destruction. Maybe that's because Amelia and Samuel are the only people in the world that truly understand the loud bereavement that has hung over their life since the accident. The list could go on, but it's impressive how Kent, a first- timer, is able to link fantastical horror and real-life terror with such fluidity. Grief and the existence of The Babadook go hand in hand, but which is more frightening?<br/><br/>Much should be said for Davis's fearless performance, which calls for as much silent torment as verbal outburst. So vivid is her characterization that we find ourselves intertwined with her pain, through her limits as a parent and a person afflicted by an invisible, metaphorical monster and a very real one. And Wiseman, as Samuel, gives one of the most disturbing performances I've seen come from a child. He isn't the usual creepy horror movie tyke that likes to spit out threatening lines with the calm of a angel; his screeching anguish truly makes us question his sanity, unlike any young actor ahead of him.<br/><br/>Where most have found The Babadook to be the scariest film in, well, forever, I was not frightened by it; I was fascinated, hypnotized by Kent's presentation and the potent performances that come with it. I do have inhibitions about how successful the film is as both a family drama and a horror — they connect but are never fully realized as individual ideas — but that shouldn't stop you. This is the kind of horror audiences have been waiting for; like Poltergeist or The Blair Witch Project, the thrills are not transparent but affecting. <br/><br/>Read more reviews at petersonreviews.com"

","A friend of mine recommended ""The Babadook"" when I asked him ""What is the last movie that scared you?""<br/><br/>And I have to tell you, this one scared me also (not easy to do.) There are some typical elements to the story - creepy sounds in the house - a little boy seeing something horrible that the Mom cannot see, etc. BUT this one is so much more. <br/><br/>One of the things I liked most about ""Breaking Bad"" was seeing Walter White's slide into depravity - this one starts strong with an interesting, but very disruptive, crazy kid and ends up as a portrayal of a Mom sliding into madness and desperation.<br/><br/>The make up on lead actress, Essie Davis (the Mom) was terrific - when she finally goes to the police and asks for help, she looks and sounds like someone just escaped from an asylum. Now, many Moms of young boys will identify with this - as her son (and the Babadook) are literally driving her insane. The boy, Noah Wiseman, is brilliant - it is amazing how a boy so young can play a role so convincingly. During the film he turns from antagonist (driving Mom nuts) to victim (of Mom and the Babadook.)<br/><br/>FInally, this is a treatise on books NOT to read at night to your children. Interestingly, I had a discussion just today with my 8 year old granddaughter about movies she should not be seeing. Clearly Mister Babadook is not a book to be read to children. With a big nod to ""Nosferatu"" and ""Dr. Caligari"", the Babadook creature is cartoonish, but terrifying.<br/><br/>And at the end there is a ""Shaun of the Dead"" type twist. <br/><br/>There are about 5 or 6 scenes which chilled my spine - and one particular kitchen scene. I hope you watch it - one of the better ones in recent years. DonB"

","I really liked the movie. I really did. It scared me and had me looking away from the screen a lot, which is great. I love it when horror movies can do that to me. Essie Davis gives an awesome performance that really made me feel for her character. The relationship between her and her son at the end was actually really touching. Every scene with either the book or The Babadook were really sweet and I really liked the ending (except for one part, which was kind of stupid). Yet, I didn't love this movie. To me, it felt like the movie had all these amazing things in it, but they weren't really put together in the best possible way. Not to say it failed miserably at it, I just felt like it could have been a bit better in that regard. You might not even notice this, as I have a sneaking suspicion that this is a problem only I have, but who knows. As I mentioned previously, I like the ending, except for one thing in it. *Spoiler warning* At the end, Essie Davis defeats The Babadook, I guess you could say, and it runs off to the basement and stays there. Fine, whatever. But then we get a scene of Essie Davis going to the basement with a bowl of worms to feed it, which was really weird to me. I mean I get it. She wants to keep it contained, but it makes me laugh to think that this evil creature that freaked me out so much can be subdued with a bowl of worms. I don't know, it's that that big of an issue. It was just kind of silly. In the end, the movie scared me, which is the main thing I need from a horror movie.Combine that with all the other good things, and you've got something worth watching."
"bowmanblue","6","1","4","5 April 2015"," Functional little horror
","'Babadook' has come in for some 'high praise' from a lot of the people who have seen it. I'm not sure that I'd go as far as to praise it highly here, but it's not that bad. I think that the reason it's been so well received is because it is slightly better than the average horror movie. Let's face it... just because there are load of horror films around right now, that doesn't mean that most of them are totally forgettable.<br/><br/>The 'Babadook' is vaguely better than the average modern horror film. It's dark and moody, yet at the same never really reveals the 'time period' it's supposed to be set in – people dress and speak like they're from the nineteen forties then use a mobile phone (couldn't spot an iphone though).<br/><br/>It's about a single mother and her son. The youngster clearly suffers from various 'behavioural problems' – many of which stem from his father's untimely demise on the day of his birth. He's expelled from school and his mother does her best to raise him. Only there's a bad book (or anagram of 'Babadook' if you noticed?) in their house that seems to bring on an equally bad presence in the house.<br/><br/>And the 'bad presence' is pretty eerie and nicely done. That's another plus point. Then you also have the child actor. Now, ninety per cent of kids in films deserve to be eaten by monsters and, despite this young boy spending much of the early part of the film screaming, he just about does enough to stop you from completely hating him.<br/><br/>There's nothing new here. It could almost be 'The Ring' under another name. If you don't watch much horror, you may enjoy it more as you probably won't have seen as much like it before. However, if – like me – you've seen a hundred and one different spooks tormenting a hundred and one different families, then there's a certain amount of de ja vu going on here. It's not bad. I didn't resent sitting through it. I just can't promise not to forget it totally in a few months time."
"my_anywhere","6","1","4","5 April 2015"," Highly Disappointed
","Hype is a dangerous thing, especially in this day and age where your access to hype is as far reaching as you choose to make it. It also doesn't help when you get blind adoration from critiques seeking artistic integrity by lauding anything art-house or indie.<br/><br/>I don't mean to completely dismiss ""Babadook."" Rare is the contemporary horror movie that seeks to do more than make a few things go bump in the night, and this film is rife with symbolism and metaphor. Amelia is a struggling single mother coping with a difficult 6-year-old (Sam) and the postpartum depression that has plagued her ever since her husband died while driving her to the hospital to birth their son. Her struggle is tragic and heartrending. And during the first act, the movie does well with getting us to feel the immense stress that comes with her every day life.<br/><br/>But a good idea does not a good film make. The editing is incredibly poor, cutting out unnecessary bits of conversations and jumping clumsily through scenes that require a different pacing all together to be effective. The director is a huge fan of having a dramatic scene cut abruptly (music and all) right when it's becoming emotionally involving for the audience, and shifting tone completely. ""It's just mimicking her fragile broken state"" you may cry, to which I would answer yes, maybe, but you can only use that effect so many times before it's just shoddy film-making.<br/><br/>And finally, ""Babadook"" is completely devoid of scares. Any scene that might be on the verge of making your hairs stand on end is painfully corrupted by the monster's laughable noises or cheesy special effects. In fact, on more than one occasion, the film even fell victim to one of horror's most terrifying enemies: the unintentional laugh.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. I love horror. Even bad, campy horror. But the pedestal this movie was put on really set me up for a dour disappointment. I guess I'm not someone who's easily impressed by something just because it didn't come out of Hollywood."
"DrDarkness","7","1","4","29 March 2015"," Babadook haunts you long after watching this
","We all have monsters, maybe they're not physical, but they can be memories, dreams or just packed up feelings. And while they haven't got real bodies, they can be more scary than anything we know.<br/><br/>The Babadook is a story about mother and her troubled child. The father passed away in a car accident on the same day when their son was born and after that the mother, Amelia, tries to raise Robbie as well as she can. It isn't easy, especially when Robbie is convinced that monsters can be real. On one evening, while searching for a bedtime story from the shelf, Robbie finds a peculiar red book called ""The Babadook"". When Amelia opens that book, she doesn't know that she just opened a door for something else.<br/><br/>The Babadook was refreshingly interesting and well made. It has some good scares, but luckily the movie doesn't sink to basic Hollywood tricks - which are nowadays almost a cliché. Instead the movie gathers focus to the mother, her son and their attempts to survive, even when the enemy is not always clear. There will be lots of doubt, lots of ""aha"" moments and the watcher is slowly sucked in with the story.<br/><br/>Beware - this movie will not only haunt you. After watching this you will realize that Babadook is always with you."
"marcowagner-18010","9","1","4","15 March 2015"," Not a horror movie. But an exceptional movie.
","The low user-rating is from my POV very regrettable and ridiculous. But it might be best explained by the misconception that this was a horror movie. It has horror elements, it uses the voice of horror to tell its story, but it decidedly is not a horror movie, but a family drama. And in that it absolutely excels with its unique way to tell this story. And it is a more unsettling movie than any horror movie I have ever seen.<br/><br/>But if you are watching this because you want to see a horror movie than I can understand why you would be disappointed.

","There are times during the viewing of ""The Babadook"" that I feel too overwhelmed with the tragedy of a widowed mother and her little son. One feels the realism and gets suffocated. My sympathy runs back and forth between the mother and the son. Before I know it, I feel for the two characters very deeply. After the film's director Jennifer Kent has that feeling registered and established in my mind, I am ready to follow her to any length. The Babadook thus seems real, scary, and very, very disturbing. Anytime it acts up, we feel. This is a great accomplishment of this first-time feature film director. She makes a drama-horror film to work so well. I am not so sure if her being a woman has a lot to do with this deep sentiment of a mother-son relationship, especially the one with a deceased husband as well as a woman's sexual needs. My guess is that it does. Another contribution is the respect Jennifer Kent has for the audience at large. She does not try to over-explain anything. She really wants you in there with her, as opposed to pushing us into a spook house and laughing her heart out at our reactions. Drawing from ""The Babadook"", I conclude that a horror film that works must make us deeply care for the characters, so the subsequent fate of theirs will always be construed as our business. This fact may be true to an art piece in any form, but for a film such as this type, mandatory."

The ones that creep under your skin: it, the shining, el orfanato, the blair witch project...<br/><br/>This movie is a number three. It's not as good as any of the movies mentioned above... but it does bring something new to the genre. The movie doesn't hang on creepy sounds, shock moments and gore. Actually the movie is quiet theatrical. It builds up suspense in this dreamy feel. Mostly created by the editing and cinematography, which are both brilliant.<br/><br/>The cast is pretty good. Many people mentioned they hated the boy (his character, not the actor), as I did to. But it's absolutely necessary for the story, so bare with it. Though it has to be said: his acting skills do collapse near the end.<br/><br/>Though overall it's a good horror movie. And a good 'step in horror'. If you want to see some horror with your scaredy-cat friends... This is the one!<br/><br/>There's more stuff to tell but I don't want to use any spoilers so I leave it.

I think the best example of this is years ago with the Blair Witch Project, love it or hate it, it had the ability to get your heart going just by the crew saying 'oh we'll have to camp another night'. After watching The Babadook trailer I was excited to watch it on it's Halloween release date here in Australia. I did feel that it was a well made movie and the acting is very impressive, it just didn't deliver for me on the horror side. If it was labelled a drama or a thriller I would have rated it 9 or 10, however for a horror I just don't think it had the scare factor to really put you on edge."

","The moral of the metaphor is to contain your mental demons and feed them worms!
Why can't films have a proper ending?
The first 20% is a big worry due to the annoyance level of the son.
The next 50% is too slow as we find the point.
The next 20% is alright when the mother is 'posessed'.
The last 10% spirals into the merely stupid, culminating in an ending that is a joke.
If the demon or whatever it is had made her fulfill her destiny and ended bleakly it would have been worthwhile, but no the end has to be happy.
The fact that the mother resents the son and is irriatated by him as anyone should be, means we have all this other stuff about a book etc... that is supposed to be manifested in reality which creates what we actually see.
It was presented too literal to be actually metaphorical.
So in a literal sense the demon is a joke who can be shouted down and contained, in a metaphorical one you just get on with it as it's your child and you put up with it.
But this is supposed to be a film that thrills/scares and so the whole thing is a cop out at the conclusion.
It treats the viwer as a child and says 'you must not kill your annoying child' and 'contain your demons'. But this is supposed to be something that pushes beyond and says 'what if?'
She should have strangled him when she had him by the thoat, being staisfied the demon leaves and she realises what she has done and cuts her throat. Credits.
No need to kill the dog, as it didn't whine and shriek like the boy. So to run through it again, yes kill the boy as you she had all the reasons to, no kill the dog as she had no reason....

"jethrotroll-30807","5","1","5","13 June 2015"," Strange and Somber, this movie will at least make you think, if nothing else
","This movie caught my attention based on it's reviews. Not every review was great, but there were a lot of really favorable ones so, being a fan of the genre, I thought I'd give it a shot. I was a little disappointed.<br/><br/>Let me start off by saying I didn't hate it. The movie does make you think, and does leave a lot up to the viewer to form his own interpretation. For that, it gets it's due. But, for me the movie kinda dragged on, it generally really wasn't that scary, it seemed to contradict itself at times and the climax was very anticlimactic to me. That's why I gave it just 5 stars.<br/><br/>The movie really centers around a widowed mother, Amelia, and her son, Samuel. Amelia is living a pretty menial life, who is still grieving the loss of her husband due to a car accident. You could probably describe her as even being depressed. Her son, however, is a bundle of uncontrolled, mischievous energy who cant seem to stay out of trouble. This fuels her isolation even further as most others cant stand to be around her son. Frankly, I wouldn't want to be around him either, as I couldn't stand him at first. And this made you feel for Amelia, and what she's dealing with and giving up to raise this child alone. The movie does have a very somber and sad tone to it.<br/><br/>Anyways, the boy picks this book for Amelia to read to him one night called ""The Babadook"". It's an eerie, pop-up picture book that depicts a character similar to Jack the Ripper looking in on a child at night. This scares Samuel, and then things start to get weird.<br/><br/>The interesting thing about this movie is that you soon realize Samuel has a better understanding of what's going on than his mother does, as she seems to really start losing it. And why she's losing it is really up to the viewer's interpretation, like is she really going insane or is there an entity in their house affecting them. I think it's a little of both, and her ability to handle this 'entity' correlates to her ability to pull out her long battle with depression.<br/><br/>As she becomes more withdrawn and odd, you suddenly really start feeling for Samuel, as he's bearing the brunt of her anger. I mean, she's pretty mean to him, and a fight erupts at one point. This is probably the most chilling part of the movie, and it may even be somewhat shocking to some viewers, as Amelia appears ready to kill Samuel, and Samuel is in pure survival mode, but does not want to hurt his mother. He's trying to help her and live at the same time. Again, it's pretty chilling to watch, and you really start to see Samuel differently at this point, that there's more to this kid than just being a whiny brat. Eventually, Amelia realizes she must confront her sickness/entity to save her own life and Samuel's.<br/><br/>'The Babadook' is more psycho-thriller than horror, as it's really not that scary, but it does have it's chilling moments and really makes you think. I can see how some viewers really liked it, but I was left somewhat disappointed. At times I thought I was watching a poorly done parody sketch, and I wasn't always that engaged in the movie or it's characters. The ending was too long as well, like they didn't seem to know how to end it. I'm kinda in the middle on this one, neither hated it nor loved it. The sadness and the oddity of this movie will turn some viewers off. But if you like to think and like ambiguous movies that's open to interpretation, then 'The Babadook' may be right up your alley."

It's also a more subtle horror than what we're used to seeing these days, and isn't one of those typical jump/scare/slasher films, so if you're expecting that you may be disappointed here.<br/><br/>Like I said, the horror is subtle...it's not in your face, it's not gory, it doesn't race at you, and, again, this will not be to everyone's taste.<br/><br/>The film's pretty slow paced for the most part, but if you can get into the story then it won't seem that slow because it draws you in and keeps your interest. It also unfolds nicely as it goes along, and it's not a film that has step-by-step instructions on what is going on which could be another reason why some people don't like it. There's obviously nothing wrong with that, but for me personally it's just refreshing see a film come along that breaks for the norm of having everything laid out in front of me.<br/><br/>The Babadook isn't one dimensional with it's horror either, as it's not just about a mother & son who are haunted by a ""boogeyman"" (who's actually creepy in the scenes it's shown and heard in). The horror comes in different forms...the son trying to cope without a dad, struggling with being bullied, and who's convinced a monster's in the house; the mother struggling to cope with being a single parent, and suffering from depression. They are struggling with their own demons so to speak, so the horror comes from different angles.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty good for the most part, and Noah Wiseman, who plays Sam, does a great job of making you feel sorry for him one minute to wanting to slap him because of his behaviour the next. His inventions are pretty cool as well.<br/><br/>Overall, while there are better psychological horrors out there than The Babadook, it doesn't mean that it's a bad film. It's well directed, well written, and well played out. Definitely worth a watch."
"nitzanhavoc","7","1","5","18 January 2015"," Drama-Horror hybrid at its finest, for what it's worth. Or: How acting and mood make a good film great.
","The first word that came to mind when I tried to think how I would eventually review and rate this film was ""different"". The Babadook is absolutely different. I wouldn't say unique, or one of a kind, but it definitely has its own uniqueness which makes it unlike other films, and a lot better than most. Now, let me try and verbally describe the sensations brought upon by watching this.<br/><br/>First of all, the the plot is successful in being intriguing and fascinating regardless to having a pretty ordinary story. A mother and her small neurotic child face a supernatural being. We've seen it in the Hollywood adaptation of The Ring, ans in many other films whose names I am simply unable to recall at the moment. And, the inter-character dynamics and the slow downward spiral into insanity and despair make the suspense strong enough to overcome the overall mood and ambiance.<br/><br/>Second, as I've just mentioned, the mood and ambiance. The characters, the acting, the cinematography and the story create an almost unbearable sensation of discomfort, awkwardness and uneasiness. One could almost taste the stress, strain and frustration gone through by the mother, as well the fear and despair of the child. In a way, watching The Babadook is like going through a mental breakdown. More Drama than Horror, yet excellently executed and serves the overall sensation very well.<br/><br/>The acting is in all ways superb. The lead roles by Essie Davis (Amelia) and Noah Wiseman (her son Samuel) are absolutely marvelous, and the supporting cast isn't any less amazing. One could understand the main plot and the relationships and dynamics between the characters simply by watching the actors and actresses do their job. As a viewer who is always impressed by young characters, Wiseman's acting was in my opinion the best, but altogether the acting is way more realistic, authentic and disbelief suspending than the usual Hollywood acting in Horror films.<br/><br/>As for the supernatural part, we don't really see the Babadook, but we definitely feel its presence and its relentless grip on the main characters. The effects are just right, not too flamboyant yet not lacking, And of course, the book... Dear Lord, that book is probably responsible to 50% of the Horror motive of this film, if not more. The film also uses some jump scares emphasized by the eerie aggressive soundtrack, but these only serve to support the overall sensation of haunting and fear, not to solely create them.<br/><br/>There were some parts of the film I didn't like, of course. As a six year old boy, Wiseman's character is way too capable if you ask me, not to mention way to courageous... That is not how I would expect a 6 year old to deal with a supernatural evil terrorizing him and his mother, and how he'd been able to create his ""toy"" weapons is beyond me... Also, the ending wasn't only anticlimactic but a flat disappointment. I'm not only referring to the lack of plot twists, but to the complete lack of logic and accordance with the plot. That film deserved a better ending.<br/><br/>All in all, I can't say this film was ""fun"" to watch. The uneasy awkward feeling it gives throughout most of it is not enjoyable. Then again, it isn't meant to be. While most Horror films dealing with supernatural evils and the haunting of characters aim mainly for fear, the Babadook uses the plot tools usually utilized by different sub-genres like the ones dealing with torture, hunts, murderers and such others. It is still, in my opinion, a great film achieving precisely the goals set out by it. I don't think I'll be watching it again, but I would definitely recommend it to Horror fans looking for something new, innovative and refreshing in a genre that usually fails in breaking the boundaries of old."
"OrsonLannister","5","1","5","8 January 2015"," Themes and Drama Fall Flat Without Terror, Surprises, or Likable Characters
","Australian ""horror"" drama The Babadook is a peculiar beast, and seems to have already created high levels of controversy between those who hail it as a masterpiece of horror storytelling and those who are less forgiving of the movie's purported flaws. Helmed by director Jennifer Kent after a Kickstarter campaign to fund its creation, Babadook has garnered critical acclaim worldwide since its debut. The story follows widowed mother Amelia (Essie Davis) as she struggles to raise her, for lack of a better term, ""difficult"" child, Samuel (Noah Wiseman). However, a creepy children's book featuring a monster called the Babadook brings trouble as Samuel becomes obsessed with the idea of the monster's threatening existence. Despite her level-headedness and early dismissal of the monster, Amelia slowly descends into darkness as the monster begins to overcome her life, too.<br/><br/>If nothing else, The Bababook is fascinating. The script (and Kent's keen eye for direction) keeps the audience glued to the screen for the movie's duration, as new clues and strange imagery build a sense of dread and premonition. Essie Davis gives an enveloping performance as a woman consumed by loneliness, frustration, and fear as her character becomes increasingly frazzled and less convinced of her own sanity. Noah Wiseman passes as a decent enough child actor, even though his facial expressions rarely change to match his lines or tone of voice. Finally, the movie's themes and aspirations reach beyond the typical ""haunted house"" formula, and the movie's intended statement reaches far deeper than most horror films attempt to go. Within this theme, the movie occasionally hits moments of emotional sincerity, as Amelia's situation strikes home for many.<br/><br/>But The Babadook just doesn't work. The movie was certainly mis- marketed as a scare-your-pants-off horror flick, but that's truly the least of the movie's problems. First, despite what William Friedkin would have you believe, The Babadook isn't scary. I don't mean that in an immature ""there weren't enough jump scares"" sort of way. I mean, it's the type of movie that you can watch alone with the lights off and not have any trouble going to sleep immediately afterwards. The movie maintains a steady sense of dread, but the dread never culminates into anything resembling horror. Without going into deep detail to avoid spoilers, the movie lacks a scary punch for many reasons, one of which is a character disconnect that I'll address later. *Mild spoilers follow in this paragraph!* Additionally, the monster isn't even remotely convincing (partially due to its tie-in with the theme). The movie's budget limits the actual Babadook to a monster that is almost goofy, with claymation- esque movement and scarecrow features. The monster never inflicts physical harm, and the audience never gets the sense that he actually can.<br/><br/>Despite its lack of scares, The Babadook may have worked with its brooding atmosphere if the plot itself held surprises to grip the audience in a way horror usually does not. Unfortunately, Kent avoids surprising the audience in favor of fully embracing her theme. While the theme is somewhat emotionally resonant, it's not even a tiny bit creative. The average moviegoer can guess the monster's thematic purpose within the first minute of discovering Amelia's situation, and every plot point along the way strengthens this guessed purpose. The theme overpowers all of the movie's other elements from the opening frame onwards, leaving many viewers an hour into the movie saying, ""I get it. No, really, I get it. Move on"". The audience's invested interest is wasted along with the movie's potential because Kent ditches narrative surprises and chooses to rely and hammer on a frequently uninteresting theme into the minds of viewers. Repeatedly. <br/><br/>Even without scares and with narrative simplicity, The Babadook still had a chance to succeed as a dark and brooding drama. Kent squanders this potential too, however, by writing both the leads in the most bizarrely unlikable fashion imaginable. Obviously, not every film needs to have lovable or even relatable characters, but dramas built upon emotional resonance certainly need such characters to some degree as anchors for audience involvement. The first half of the film is framed from the mother's state of mind and, therefore, viewers are meant to become increasingly frustrated and annoyed with Samuel's behavior, if not straight-up hateful towards him. Although frequently loving towards his mother, clearly protective, and obviously damaged by his father's absence, Samuel truly earns the audience's distaste. It's hard to like a 6-year-old problem-child who frequently disobeys, mouths off, fails to interact with other characters properly, and CONSTANTLY yells for his mother. The mother may bear with her son's behavior as a loving parental figure should, but the audience has very little motivation to do the same. *Spoilers ahead!* But even more problematically, the second half adopts Amelia as the villain and a source of terror as she embraces the monster of her anguish. This leaves the audience without anyone to truly fear for, as Amelia acts increasingly irrational and violent. The most fear we feel relates to our concern for the puppy and the old lady who knocks at the door. The conflict is disturbing, but not surprising or frightening, and we just can't come to care deeply about the child in danger or the mother who continues to put him there.<br/><br/>Finally, the last 20 minutes display a dip in screen writing as the final confrontation crosses the line into the ridiculous, both visually and plot-wise. The ending concerning the monster is bizarre, and the resolution between the characters is unconvincing at best (*spoiler* we're supposed to buy that Amelia and Samuel suddenly understand each other completely and are the best of friends following that finale? Really?). But even by then, it's too late. The Babadook has sunk under the weight of its flaws and is confined to the dungeons of both failed drama and failed horror."

","Although it was creepy and sad, it could have been an awesome movie. If only they would say where the monster came from and why. Also how they got rid of it. You don't just, ""throw up"" an evil creature, then keep it as a pet in your basement. The story line moved the viewer along rather slowly but at a steady pace. I did get goosebumps at a couple points in the film but I would have liked more boo! factor. The scary parts were incomplete and rushed. I felt like there was very little build up and then it was over in a minute. Kinda felt like I was with my ex husband. I watch a lot of movies because it is the dark season here in Alaska. I look forward to well written and directed films. This one was on it's way. It just fell slightly short.Not quite a ""B"" movie status because the acting, directing and story was really good.Just the beginning, end and a little more BOO's in the middle. Dallas"

","We found this film totally unrealistic and it simply made the woman, suffering from the loss of her husband, look like a nutcase that just hid inside her house and went crazy.

It is so stereotypical of the weak woman that it made me sick and annoyed."
"ivorybow","2","1","6","6 June 2018"," Absolutely NOT for kids! Disgusting
","I so wanted to like it! Since is wasn't rated I made the bad mistake of thinking it would be okay for young teens. WRONG! First off, the mother is a confusing trainwreck who is in year 7 of widowhood but seriously unable to move on, Hence her child is warped. She hasn't got the sense or will to get her child help, nor do any other of the adults in his life, so you watch the madness grow. What the monster is, and where it came from and why, you never really know...some sort of madness coming from mom? But the deal breaker is this. I watched it with my 14 year old granddaughter and her 12 year old boy cousin. Imagine my horror when we see mom in bed writhing around with what at first seems to be a nightmare but then you realize she is masturbating!!! And her son walks in on her! By the time I got to the remote to turn it off, it was too late and I had 2 very embarrassed kids and one grandma feeling totally awkward. No one said a word, just red faces. There was no reason, absolutely no reason for that scene to be there. It had zero to do with the plot and served no purpose. I am seeing this a lot...movies made knowing kids will be in the audience and then snippets of outrageously inappropriate scenes with no warning. What is going on Hollywood? Do you have some creepy agenda with visually assaulting our kids? Do not show this movie to children."
"oyason","10","1","6","6 May 2015"," It's quieter today.
","THE BABADOOK isn't for everyone, but it's a special film, one that in its own quiet way seeks to address certain realities via tropes of the horror film. Jennifer Kent is an ambitious director who tips her hat to some of the greats in the genre, Mamoulian, Melies, Bava, Whale, Kubrick. THE BABADOOK is a bold foray into psychological horror, repressed intimacy of women,single parenting, social isolation, child abuse, in a neat little package that she probably managed to crank out for under a million dollars. The movie lags in one moment where the script falls into the trap of explaining something the viewer has had time to figure out. But that doesn't drive the momentum of the piece, which leaves the viewer lots of room to draw their own conclusions as to which reality the characters actually are functioning within. The close of the story is open ended, but not in the over-used ""something's gonna go on jumping out the bushes and getting you"" standard that has been beaten to death in the ghost story/horror film this last ten years. Again, I think this is a special movie, and I'm looking forward to seeing what Jennifer Kent does next. She is a breath of fresh air compared to many of the so-called film makers who dominate the western film industry, and particularly the horror film. THE BABADOOK is a rare treat, filled with fine pointed grace and craft."
"rehmankhilji","3","1","6","8 February 2015"," Horrible
","Another movie which i made to watch by high ratings at IMDb. Guess for this one people were made to rate high. For a start it wasn't scary at all. Like you watch a horror movie not for a laugh but some real shivers, however this movie is not giving one at any level. Further, its a poor budget movie. Horrible lines, boring, just two three characters in the entire movie and with a horrible ending. This movie is keeping the audience confuse as to what happening is real or just in the mind of characters. If you are a horror movie fan and watch the same for some real thrills then this is the one for you dust bin and not something to watch. Nonetheless its a high rates movie at IMDb for the reasons not know. Complete waste of money time and a weekend."
"susana-c-fernandes","5","1","6","1 February 2015"," a supernatural drama
","The Babadook tells the story of a mother and son coping with the death of the father, who suddenly become aware of an evil presence in their house. The premise was good, and after reading that William Friedkin, The Exorcist's director, had considered it ""the scariest movie"" he'd ever seen, I thought I was in for a true horror gem. But not really.<br/><br/>I'd describe The Babadook, not as a horror movie, but as a metaphorical supernatural drama. If you watch the movie with this in mind, you will enjoy it, for sure. The acting is excellent - both main characters do a magnificent job and the little boy is very creepy. The story is original and makes you want to know who is this Babadook guy and why is he doing what he does. And, keeping the drama genre in mind, the ending has an interesting message that is worth watching. I'd say watch it, just remember it's not exactly horror.<br/><br/>*****SPOILERS FROM HERE ON (and why I say horror fans will be disappointed)******<br/><br/>Now, when you introduce a character like Babadook and end the movie without any explanation on its origin whatsoever, you're bound to get some negative reactions. My initial thoughts were ""that's it?"". No background, no messed up story to compensate for the lack of a good look at the monster, no dirty little secret haunting that family, no plot twist, nothing.<br/><br/>From the drama genre perspective, the ending for me was a metaphor for how you must deal with your personal demons. The little boy tells his mother that they will never get rid of the Babadook, as she will never get over the death of her husband. Instead, they must keep the monster locked away, but nurture it, to keep him quiet and allow them to move on with their lives. So, Babadook was basically a metaphor for loss, grief and coping with the death of a loved one.<br/><br/>This is actually very interesting and if I hadn't seen the movie hoping to get scared I would have had a satisfactory experience. A marketing error that has cost the movie a lot of terrible reviews."
"xmoongoddess7","5","1","6","28 January 2015"," Don't Believe the Hype *NO SPOILER VERSION*
","If you're a person who likes supernatural horror films with a lot of jumps scares, this is not for you. The pacing is slow, there is little actual horror and though you barely see the monster, it doesn't even have the ""you can't see me so that makes me scarier"" edge going for it either. If anything, the only thing you will feel at the end of this movie is not fear, but pity for the mother. The biggest reason why I watched this movie was because the director of ""The Excorcist"" said it was ""the scariest movie"" he's ever seen, so I already knew I wouldn't be scared because his movie didn't scare me, (even though I saw it when I was younger) but I still was interested and wanted to give this movie a chance. The other reason why I watched it is because literally half the people I've asked say it's either scary or awful/boring, which got me more interested, but I'm going to have to slightly agree with the second group. It's not an awful movie, but since it's been hyped up as a ""terrifying horror film"", it fails, which makes it boring. If it had only been advertised as a psychological thriller then I think it would've done much better. If you want more detail, check the review I wrote that contains spoilers."
"Hellmant","9","1","6","9 January 2015"," I don't think it quite lives up to all of it's hype.
","'THE BABADOOK': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Australian indie horror flick about a single mother, still trying to cope with the tragic death of her husband, who also has to now deal with their son's troublesome behavior and fear of monsters. When the mother reads her son a mysterious children's pop-up-book, about a demon called 'Mr. Babadook', it appears there could be a real monster haunting them as well. It was written and directed by first-time feature filmmaker Jennifer Kent and it's based on her 2005 short film 'MONSTER'. The film stars Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman, as the distraught mother and her troubled son. It was made on a budget of just $2 million and is one of the best reviewed movies of 2014 (97% positive on Rotten Tomatoes)! I enjoyed it quite a bit but I don't think it quite lives up to all of it's hype.<br/><br/>Amelia (Davis) is a single mother who still has nightmares about the death of her husband, who died in a horrific car crash; on the way to giving birth to their son, Samuel (Wiseman). Samuel has recently been lashing out a lot at school and has an unhealthy fear of monsters, which he makes weapons to fight. Due to Samuel's behavior, Amelia has to take him out of school and homeschool him. To make matters even worse she reads him a scary children's book, that Samuel finds on his shelf one day, called 'Mr. Babadook'. Samuel becomes convinced that the supernatural creature, from the book, is really haunting them. After a series of disturbing incidents, Amelia starts to believe it as well.<br/><br/>I'm a huge fan of scary movies, monster flicks and most horror films in general. This is a really well made psychological thriller, that has a pretty cool looking creepy critter in it too, but it isn't really that scary in my opinion (a few scenes are though). That doesn't mean it's not a good movie, it just isn't what I was expecting. I also think the critics' overwhelming praise for the film built up my expectations for it too much. It is nicely directed and acted, especially for it's small budget; Davis is fantastic in it and I look forward to seeing plenty more movies from Kent too. I just wouldn't call it a great monster flick or classic horror movie. It's a good character study, with a pretty insightful message about the struggles of single parenting (a lot of people are calling it a 'feminist horror film' too, which is pretty cool). I still highly recommend it but I think viewers should know what type of movie it is, before seeing it, in order to best enjoy it.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/N3ywdecCULw"

","Never thought this one would get a theatrical release locally. Having said that, the only cinema in one of the places I stay at playing this one disappointed me by canceling the showing (and not intimating us long distance commuters since we don't matter) the first time I tried watching it. <br/><br/>Undeterred, I tried catching another one at a different city where I am staying for work, and this time the screening went off without a hitch, albeit in a small size cinema. <br/><br/>First off, the color palette used in the final product was quite evocative of another good attempt in this genre - The Conjuring. Muted colors mostly, and though I am NOt a fan of things being done for effect, the quality of the movie-making on this one was so high that I (kinda) ignored that reference.<br/><br/>Also, lest I forget while waxing eloquent on all the +s in this one, the artwork inherent in this, while also being used as an inventive narration technique, is very evocative of the superb work done on 'Coraline'. And that IS a compliment, and not meant to criticize. <br/><br/>Also, to me, this was also evocative of one of the best entries in this genre, the Hollywood remake of 'Dark Water' (know by the same name as well), in which Jennifer Connelly led one of the best mom-daughter casts in a movie that was nothing short of perfect.<br/><br/>Now, to the best parts: - Performance all round, but esp. the leads, Essie Davis and Noah Wisemen knock it outta the park. Each performance complements the other, as do their characters, and there are so many difficult portions that are completely embraced by both, that it is easy to see why this one is gaining accolades throughout. Both are Oscar-worthy turns, and I do hope someone (anyone) takes that into account come awards season. - The technical aspects, esp. the soundtrack, and the cinematography, almost are the supporting characters in this, as they ought to be on any genre entry worth the expense. In spite of the fact that this genre has been done to death (pun most deffo intended), having those 'jump' scares that still have the potential to make one, ehrm, 'jump', is nothing short of an achievement. That it does so creatively even, while foreshadowing said moments, is truly spectacular. That they are tied together by some truly subtle yet omnipresent editing makes the attention to detail all the more praiseworthy, and yes, award-worthy too. - I have referenced 'Dark Water', and that is the only element that could qualify as a spoiler going into this one, though in spite of that, this is still very much its own movie, and I still did not see the ending coming. Beautiful, perhaps one of the best endings I've had the pleasure of watching unfold in a long time yet.<br/><br/>However, it's not all perfect, and some portions in the movie do not hold up to the scrutiny that I subjected the plot to, based on how it decides to wind up, and that's a pity, along with the fact that a key horror element would almost make one laugh out loud at the movie (and it did that at multiple points when it reared it's kinda ugly head, taking the ones who were seriously engrossed completely out of the flick), instead of with the movie, and that was kinda unexpected (and disappointing) in an otherwise perfect effort.<br/><br/>All in all - a great time at the movies. Go watch it at the nearest multiplex before the mainstream juggernauts gobble up that slot."

","When the Australian horror film ""The Babadook"" was released here in the U.S. in November 2014, 10 months after its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival, it was moderately successful at the box office and received almost universal praise from the critics. Somehow, I managed to miss the film back then (I happen to miss most new releases, actually, in my quest to see as many great classic/old films on the big screen as possible at NYC's several revival houses), but have wanted to see it ever since, especially inasmuch as the film holds an almost unprecedented 98% approval rating on the Rotten Tomatoes website! A recent showing on one of the Showtime stations has finally enabled me to catch up with this truly frightening picture, however; one that has grown into something of a cult item and cause celebre since its release six years ago. I knew absolutely nothing about the film when I sat down to watch it the other night, had no idea what a ""babadook"" was, and felt a bit concerned about possibly not being able to follow those Aussie accents (a stumbling block for me in the past), but you know what? I found myself quite loving this marvelously scary and emotionally moving picture, and can now understand what all the fuss has been about. (And those accents, as it turned out, were not a problem here, either!)<br/><br/>As many others have already discovered, the film introduces us to a lonely widow named Amelia Vanek (remarkably well played by Tasmanian actress Essie Davis), a worker in a nursing home who lives with her 6-year-old son Sam (Noah Wiseman) in a suburb of Adelaide, in South Australia. We learn that on the day Sam was born, Amelia's husband, Oskar (Ben Winspear), had been killed in a car crash while driving her to the hospital. Can you imagine? Now, as Sam's 7th birthday/the anniversary of her husband's death approaches, Amelia finds herself once again trying to subsume the pain. She has pushed away the grief and refused to deal with her loss over the years, we sense, and this state of denial will lead to horrific events as the film proceeds. Sam, we also see, is a child who lives in perpetual fear of monsters, even going so far as to cleverly construct weapons (such as dart throwers and rock catapults) against them. So it is perhaps not the wisest idea for Amelia to be constantly reading him horrific bedtime stories. On this one night, she reads to him from a particularly disturbing pop-up book called ""Mister Babadook""; a pop-up book that has popped up in the house from out of nowhere. The Babadook monster in this book is a singularly gruesome creature, a top-hatted figure with talons (supposedly based on the Lon Chaney character in 1927's lost film ""London After Midnight"") who will come to your house, after making itself known by thumps and knocks, make your life miserable, and eat your insides out! Shortly thereafter, Sam's mania about the creature reaches a fever pitch, to the point where Amelia finds it necessary to sedate him. She tears the pop-up book to shreds and throws it away, only to find it reassembled and sitting on her doorstep one morning! Strange knockings and thumpings are heard in the house, she finds glass in her food, a roach infestation is discovered in her kitchen, and, in perhaps the film's most chilling scene, the Babadook itself is seen at night, hovering on her bedroom ceiling. After many sleepless nights, Amelia begins to crack, and her personality begins to alter, as the audience wonders whether or not she is just irritable and exhausted, or if perhaps she is beginning to undergo a personality change; a possible possession. It is only when she begins to verbally and then physically threaten her son that the viewer understands that she has indeed been taken over by the Babadook, and that Sam's suspicions about the entity have been correct all along....<br/><br/>""The Babadook"" was the first full-length film by Australian director Jennifer Kent, based on her own short film of 2005, simply entitled ""Monster"" (this short film accompanies the longer film in its DVD incarnation, I've heard, and I would love to take a look at it one day), and most viewers, I have a feeling, will find it remarkable that Kent both wrote and directed the 2014 film, so very accomplished an effort is this debut. Kent's script is a wonder, and her direction is very self-assured and stylish. Her film can be seen and understood on several levels, a fact that has apparently been the subject of lively debate during these past six years. On a surface and simpler level, we can see the Babadook as merely a monster that possesses Amelia and causes her to threaten her child. But on a deeper and more plausible level, the Babadook can be understood as the manifestation of Amelia's repressed grief; of all the unresolved feelings that she has refused to deal with over the years. Not for nothing does the Babadook take the form of her deceased husband Oskar at one point; not for nothing is the monster ultimately shown to be impossible to slay, but only amenable to confinement. So yes, the film is much more than just another mindless monster movie. Kent has lots to say here about the mother/child relationship, about grief and its aftermath, and about how we move on in life after a tragedy. ""I want to create a myth in a domestic setting,"" Kent was quoted as saying after the film's release, a statement that one can read as one wishes, regarding the Babadook's being an actual monster or merely a manifestation of Amelia's grief. Fortunately, the film works extremely well on either level.<br/><br/>And Kent is abetted here by a raft of very fine performances, particularly from her two leads. Little Noah Wiseman is very fine and affecting as the disturbed child Sam, and Essie Davis is just amazing as Amelia, giving an Oscar-caliber bit of thesping here in a portrayal that demands much of her. She makes us feel Amelia's grief and loneliness just by the expressions on her face when she sees a happy couple necking in a car, or when she sits in her living room watching television by herself. Her Amelia is a beautiful woman, with a kind of Michelle Pfeiffer quality, but one who is beginning to look decidedly frayed by the cares and woes of her existence. Davis is equally compelling, however, when she starts to become possessed by the Babadook, and her foul-mouthed, threatening and ultimately murderous tantrums are really something to behold. It is a tremendous performance, truly, that runs the gamut of emotion, and Davis is fully invested in it.<br/><br/>""The Babadook"" is a film with any number of startling moments that will leave the viewer slack jawed and chilled. Besides the aforementioned one, with the title creature hovering on the bedroom ceiling, we have the one in which Amelia yanks out one of her own teeth that had been paining her (a scene reminiscent of the one in 2006's ""Bug,"" which I had recently watched); the scene in which Amelia loses control of her car, after it has been infested with cockroaches; the one in which she vomits black bile in a copious flood; the one with Oskar's return; and really, the entire final half hour of the film, with Amelia and her son playing a cat-and-mouse game with each other throughout the house. And in a film with so much in the way of shocks and chills, how appropriate is it that Amelia, at one point, is shown to be watching, on her TV, one of the scariest scenes of all time, the one with the hideous hag in Mario Bava's ""Black Sabbath"" (1963)? William Friedkin, the director of the film that many consider to be the ne plus ultra of horror, 1973's ""The Exorcist,"" has since gone on to declare, regarding ""The Babadook,"" ""I've never seen a more terrifying film,"" and that should tell you something right there. But of all the shocks and scares in the film, none can compare with the sight of Amelia, who we have seen to be a loving and caring mother, as she begins to transform into a hate-filled and homicidal creature, as the Babadook, the essence of her concentrated and undealt-with emotions, begins to overwhelm her. Could anything be more frightening than the sight of a once-loving parent changing into...something else? Fortunately for all concerned, Amelia is able to, uh, work through her issues, and confine the Babadook to a place where it can be controlled.<br/><br/>Kent's film closes on a sweet and hopeful note, leaving the viewer trusting that the Vaneks will go on to enjoy a happy life, and that perhaps Amelia will find herself a boyfriend with her kindly coworker Robbie (Daniel Henshall). The film is surely left wide open enough for a possible sequel, which apparently the author's fans have been clamoring for all these years, to Kent's adamant refusal. And you know what? Perhaps it's just as well to leave things as they are, with the Babadook safely tucked away where it can do no harm...."

"quaseprovisorio","8","0","1","11 June 2020"," a great movie about grief and moving on, and about how we accept ourselves. forget the bad reviews, the film is great, just not your ""normal"" horror flick. i can relate to it.
","Now, i would love to make this review without spoilers. but...well what is the babadook? the babadook represents moving on. it represents our demons and how we manage them. before the babadook Amelia was in denial with her life: she couldn't accept what she was now. her son. her dead husband. the people around her. she thought she was coping well but she wasn't<br/><br/>the babadook is about how we cope with our inner demons. how we deal with them and confront them. Amelia tried to hide them since her son was born. she was never able to deal wih the fact that her life couldn't be the same anymore. that her son needed specific attention. that her husband was not there. the babadook was her way to cope with all of her inner pain. that's why he is now in the basement. that's why Samuel is finally having a birthday party: she was able to fight with her inner demons, to (literally)spit them out - and by doing so, she solved her emotional luggage. it's still there because pain never goes away, but now it's controlled. the babadook was her way to realize she never moved on. was her way to finally start moving forward.<br/><br/>so many things we might not talk about in our life. not only someone we love that is dead, but some incident we feel ashamed or sad, bullying, one of our failures... and we don't talk about it. then it slowly becomes a huge thing because we were never capable to deal with it. the babadook is that: is our inner pain that we keep kinda sleeping but in the right moments it comes to attack us. this was her process to overcome these conflicts. being set around the time of the accident is very accurate because it's the time where she remembers everything the most. and she feels the most pain.<br/><br/>the movie doesn't want to explain everything, even though everything it's in the movie. but if you're used to see ""horror"" as some jumpscares with all the plot explained is normal you won't enjoy this that much. like in aster or eggers movies horror here is just the way to communicate what this is about: if it was a drama about a grieving mom that can't deal with her own life and ""peculiar"" son it wouldn't be as interesting. by having an horror twist into it you can make those demons real. and make the public scared, because there is some scary stuff here.<br/><br/>so a technically great film with cool interpretations and a very accurate and deep metaphor. i liked this very much and i can relate very hard to it: if he was alive it would have been the 67th birthday of my father, on june 11 - i finished watching this already after midnight but for me it's still june 11. somehow it makes me feel it's not a coincidence. one thing i'm certain: everyone will have babadook moments in their lives. sometimes pain is inevitable. sometimes it will hurt. and it won't be about how we fight it. it woulbe about how we will accept it.<br/><br/>it's well shot, and the sound effects are awesome. i liked both of the main actors and also the characters. the kid is annoying sometimes but he is human. the mom falls into the verge of madness but at the end of the day her son, her family is able to save her from herself."

Being someone who has lost someone close to me, I felt deeply moved by this movie. I have never felt so connected to a film before. The actors did a phenomenal job, and Kent did a truly incredible job portraying the monster grief can become if not dealt with properly."
"lvanderwindt","9","0","1","2 May 2020"," really gets in your head..
","This movie got me so messed up. First i want to give full credits to the actors, like all the actors were really good. The storyline is so interesting. the more you pay attention the more you begin to see that the mom is the babadook, like the time were she was in the bathtub with her clothes on, when she stood up i got chills because she looked exactly like him. At first i was really annoys by Samuel. But in the end I was really rooting for him actually, he tried to help his mom the best he could and i respect that... My interpretation is that the mom is still 'grieving' about her husband, she sees him sometimes in the babadook. She is scared of herself, she doesn't want to forget him but she also knows she has to move on for a healthy environment for her kid to grow up in. I really liked how in the beginning of the movie we were already informed that Sam likes to make 'toy weapons' Later in the movie this was actually really handy plus it all made sense because we were constantly reminded with it. The only thing that isn't physically possible is for Sam to grab his unconscious mom and tie her up. I don't even think I could do that. For how great this movie is i expected a lot from the ending. I hate it when they add another to another to another problem. Like he's dead, but not yet, but now he is, or not. Like end it jeez. Dynamics in the end were so bad... in the rest of the movie they were fine so i don't know what went wrong there. So conclusion: Storyline, really good. Actors, just wow. Music, Actually so interesting and ominous. Ending, kinda meh. I would definitely watch this movie again!"
"pteodori","9","0","1","2 May 2020"," A superior horror movie!
","The Babadook (2014) (spoilers)<br/><br/>This is a superior horror movie. It's extremely intense and very well-made. The actors in it are outstanding. Great acting can suck you into a movie like nothing else about the production can. You watch Amelia, the mother, played by Essie Davis, with a growing mix of fascination, apprehension and terror as she slowly descends into madness. It's like something out of Edgar Allan Poe, arguably the best horror writer of all. The best horror is the kind that reminds of our fallen and vulnerable condition living in a world ruled by the devil, something Poe (and the makers of this movie) was very good at. Also, great horror makes you care about the person or persons who are being subjected to it. And you care about Amelia deeply. You care because you understand that she's vulnerable and helpless and therefore susceptible to the power of the devil who comes to her here in the form of the Babadook, a demonic character in a children's book.<br/><br/>You care about Amelia and you care about her son Samuel. In fact, he ends up melting your heart. Samuel is played by Noah Wiseman who is every bit as talented as Haley Joel Osment (he of ""The Sixth Sense"" fame) was. At first Samuel is annoying. He is disobedient and hard-headed and extremely needy. But once the demon, the Babadook, invades their home, Samuel, frail and small though he is, is the only one who can help free the home from the evil attacker.
The Babadook is a tale about demon-possession and about a love that understands deep things and knows no limits. Children are like that in the way they love. Samuel is like that:<br/><br/>Samuel: I know you don't love me. The Babadook won't let you. But I love you, mom, and I always will.<br/><br/>One of the sad things about Amelia's and Samuel's predicament is that they are utterly alone in their misery. Their friends have deserted them, leaving them to face their formidable foe on their own. When Amelia goes to the police station to tell the police about the Babadook and what he has been doing, the officers look at her like she's a crazy person. No one can help her and her son.<br/><br/>This movie reminded me of other movies. In ""The Sixth Sense"", the little boy, Cole, is the only one who can see dead people. In ""The Babadook"", at first, Samuel is the only one who knows that the demon is real. The movie is also like ""The Shining"", but instead of the father and husband, Jack Torrance, losing his mind, it's the mother. And, finally, the images and pictures in the children's book brought to mind the movie ""Coraline""."
"ebloomberg","2","0","2","6 April 2020"," Not all that!
","I just saw this today on Comcast, since I have a free premium week, and it wasn't as good as say, The Omen. Even the latter is just okay because of the better acting by Lee Remick and Gregory Peck.<br/><br/>This story deals with mental illness, which is supposed to manifest in the minds of both mother and irritating boy of maybe 5 years? The mother seems possessed by The Babadook, and maybe she is the personification of the title character, but most of the time she or her little brat are just screaming and no one cares about any of them. What if the actual Babadook would have actually come to life and caused real terror to this 2 person household or maybe their entire neighborhood! That would require quite the imagination of the writer and director to make it unbearable.<br/><br/>It's difficult to make a really good horror film in general. The Bair Witch Project was rather dull until the last 15 minutes, which saved the film. You need to have something truly disturbing, even just one scene, to captivate people.<br/><br/>Alien did it with the one shock scene and a true sense of dread. The same could be said for Salems Lot. Rosemary's Baby was disturbing for when she asks: ""What did you do to his eyes?"" in the last scene. At least you have to have something which people will remember for a long time."

Jennifer Kent has done a remarkable film to bring this to life. The acting is spot on perfection. I wish there were more horrors with this type of emotional intelligence. One can compare it to the same calibre films done by Ari Aster (Midsommer, Hereditary), as where his films focuses on the impact of grief. The Babadook focuses on the lonely aftermath.

The rest of the film which relies on horror, or as i would say to fear us is not right up there. It's horror comes from basic things such as a horror book named Babadook,Strange voices and the household atmosphere, to the most part to begin with it succeeds but then it becomes repetitive when things are just folding to make us fear not really fear us. This is horror at its most basic level, as i said earlier its only savage is Essie Davis rest of the film is average. The only good thing i will say about it is It's not awful.

","The Babadook (dook dook...) is an exploration of the long-term effects of grief and loss and how, if they aren't dealt with properly, those feelings can consume you.<br/><br/>The film has a general feeling of hopelessness and gloom, along with an eerie and off-putting sense of dreamlike surrealism achieved through some really cool editing and film-making choices. The presentation and general tone of this film is where it really shines, the whole film feels like a descent into madness as we see the characters of the film become more distressed, sleep deprived and down-right insane as the film progresses.<br/><br/>Where the film falls down is in its horror and its script. God in heaven is the Babadook itself goofy. To steal a line from Adam from YMS ""A hipster in a top hat"" standing in the corner isn't frightening, it's hilarious. Not to mention the unbelievably long list of terrible horror movie cliches this movie falls into which just manage to make the story of the film more bland and predictable.

I liked the beautiful art within art in the form of that excellent book that just keeps coming back.<br/><br/>But although rather chilling and engaging with two horrifically convincing performances as mother and son not seeing eye to eye there is so much wrong with this.

This immediately makes the thing something corporeal and kills the mood almost irreparably. Various other shooting tricks that should have been left in the '20s also make the picture more funny than scary.

","The Babadook is essentially one of those ""artsy"" horror films, to the point where you'd almost call it a Dramatic Thriller. This movie does not use obnoxious music or jump scares to get you, it's more methodical and about 70% of it is Drama. The rest is pretty scary.<br/><br/>Plot- It's about a grieving widow taking care of her dysfunctional son, who begins to talk about this imaginary friend called The Babadook. The boy later tell his mom that he found him in a book of the same name, which the mother doesn't recall ever owning. About halfway through, the tension built really starts to settle in, and there are very memorable scary moments. The ending was intense, but the resolution will leave you asking ""How is that even realistic?"" or ""Why did that solve the problem?"" <br/><br/>Writing- This movie is written very well in a sense that you feel the way the main character does. There aren't too many calm scenes that you'll walk away with, but all of it is realistic aside maybe some people constantly bringing up the dead husband to the widow. <br/><br/>Acting/Characters- The acting was great, the movie is in an anxious kind of realm so it can be hard to really make every actor stand out. The Babadook itself was scary as hell although you just barely see it's silhouette.<br/><br/>Quality- The film is shot perfectly I'd say, one of the cinematography jobs in a recent Horror film. The way they maintain the same consistency of shot length is so smart in terms of actually scaring you, since you never know when something is building up to that moment. The mood is well executed through visuals, some scattered music, and convincing actors. <br/><br/>Overall I downgraded this from 10 because the ending is a big ""shrug"" moment, and it's almost too boring- almost. But the scary parts, as well as the build up to those parts make the film worth watching. A good movie to watch if you want a tame Horror film."

","A single mother has a tough time caring after a really troubled child who's like 6 or 7 by herself because the husband died the day he was born. That's surely enough to mess a little kid up and the kid was pretty screwed up in the first half. The mom some reason reads a really scary book to him which makes it harder and harder for both of them to sleep. Weird things happen and the pair think something is out to get them. I'm not sure if it is or if it's sleep deprivation and drugs along with that book that create a scary feeling for the pair. I'm not sure if I liked the ending which could have made it good for me but overall I just wasn't that entertained.

","Warning spoilers ahead!!Me and my best friend decided to watch this movie since it's friday the 13th and we wanted to watch a thriller. We enjoyed it for the most part, although some scenes were pretty disturbing and gross. The one problem i have with this movie is that the ending is absolutely awful (in my opinion). It ends with the babadook still alive and living in the basement. I thought that they would get rid of it and be done with the babadook once and for all, but that wasn't the case. I recommend this movie if you are looking for something creepy, but just warning everyone that the ending isn't too cheerful considering they never actually get rid of the babadook."

","The main claim about this movie for a lot of people is that it is ""not the usual horror movie"" and ""doesn't rely on jump scares or cheap tricks."" Now for the most part, I guess it doesn't fully, but it still holds its fair share of jump scares. When the film tries to rely on just sheer tension and fear, it fails most of the time. Seriously, I think what kills it for me the most is any time a child is on screen. The child actors are GOD AWFUL. Especially the son. He is the worst. I hate and you will too. Guaranteed.

","I had heard various people talk about this film and what I usually heard was that people really enjoyed it or really hated it. I fall in the middle as I thought this horror film had an interesting premise and it had me hooked wondering where the heck it was going with the bizarre plot; however, it ended up having a rather bizarre, in a bad way, ending. I have mentioned this in several other reviews that I have written about horror films that I have seen, and that is so many have something very promising as far as plot and atmosphere only to fail to fully deliver on said premise. Usually it is a twist or something that ends up messing with the ending or in this case the fact the ending made absolutely no sense!<br/><br/>The story has a mother who lost her husband when they were trying to get to the hospital so that she could give birth to her child. The child is a young boy when the film starts and just about the most horrid acting child one could imagine. The mother is being completely overwhelmed by everything around her as the boy constantly lashes out at things and he gets taken out of school and she is trying to work too. She is sleep deprived and just really looks like she needs a vacation. One night, the boy wants her to read a book called, The Babadook. She reads the book and the boy becomes terrified that this thing is real. Soon strange things begin to happen making the woman question her sanity, but she soon learns that the Babadook may be real!<br/><br/>The story was interesting, but the ending was just so strange. I was expecting mother or son to end up being the Babadook, but turns out the thing was real. Only, that makes no sense as you expect some backstory on the thing if it is real. Why did it choose the mother and son? What sort of creature was it? Why was the mom feeding it worms at the end? Seriously, that ending made no sense, I usually like it when there is a supernatural force, but in this one, I almost think it would have been better had the son ended up being the thing as he was portrayed to be quite the monster throughout the movie!<br/><br/>So, the film had some interesting elements, but it did not fully deliver. A lot of wasted potential as there is just not enough explanation going on within. I had thought from what everyone was saying that the Babadook did not even make an appearance in this thing, but it was real and you had glimpses, but you never get to see its true form which is mentioned in the book to be truly terrifying, which is what led me to believe the son would turn out to be it as what would be more terrifying for a mother, but to learn her son is a monster. That would have been a much better end to this one. As it is, it is a horror film with a great build up, but disappointing payoff."

SPOILER ALERT:
It is fair to say that the Babadook will genuinely have you checking underneath your bed and in the shadows before you fall sleep. This film turns a children's bedtime story into a monster in the night. Prepare yourself for the psychological and thrilling nightmare that dives deep into the mind. Amelia is mentally drained from the tragic events that struck her family. Meanwhile, her son, Samuel is coping poorly with his father's passing. Amelia is unable to move on from her husband's death. With the burden of loss and stress, Amelia's mental and physical state is hindered, leaving her susceptible to the Babadook. The audience questions whether this Babadook is from Amelia's inability to move on from tragic events or whether it is her husband, Oskar taking over her control. This film illustrates that depression or grieving can damage your mental state and leave the mind open to any dark avenues. Director, Jennifer Kent uses the Babadook to symbolize the recurring feelings of hopelessness and losing someone close to you. The Babadook grows stronger the more that Amelia denies his existence, just as grief does until it is dealt with. Until sadness is confronted, it will keep coming back and eventually consume the mind, just as the Babadook did. The audience will take away from the film, that dealing with these emotions could be crucial for one's health instead of delaying the inevitable."

","What it lacked in plot substance, The Babadook made up for in technical skill and anthology of the monsters in our minds. Quite frankly, the plot itself was quite predictable - there are already a plethora of movies where the archaic mother creates an overbearing presence in the life of her son. This influence eventually turns into the demise of this child. On the other hand, this movie was able to recreate the archaic mother by making her more of a main character, rather than a character laying in the background. Seeing the progression of the mother destroying the life of her child seemed templated, and much too organized. The use of shots and lighting was the most redeeming quality of the movie, as this combination created this absent-presence of a creature in the house, as well as the monster itself. Close-ups and low-key lighting are the saving grace of this film. The anthological anecdote of psychological disorders was fantastic. The Babadook was able to show that these mental disabilities are not static. Through Amelia, played by Essie Davis, the audience saw this brewing of an internal conflict; starting with the death of her lover, then slowly progressing to the stress of a mundane job and a misfit son, this notion of depression, along with many other symptoms, was clear and done in respectably. Having both its ups and downs, The Babadook, though failing in certain aspects, found a way to barely climb out of the whole it dug itself."

","The Babadook
 SPOILER ALERT
 How far can the love between a mother and son go? In this film Amelia (Essie Davis) and Samuel (Noah Wiseman) must trust each other in order to banish this evil from their bodies. 
 The Babadook is a beautifully crafted film directed by Jennifer Kent, her use of a simple yet brilliant set makes the horror even more real. The film takes place mainly within the home of Amelia and Samuel making the horror more personal and more real. Their home reflects the grief that Amelia still feels for her husbands death. The gray scale of the walls as well as her locked basement containing her husbands belongings emphasizes her inability to move on. Kent's use of shadows and low-key lighting makes the audience anticipate what could be lurking in the shadows. This builds the suspense for the audience and feeds on everyones common fear of the dark.
 Kent cleverly uses the ""monster"" or the Babadook as an allegory for Amelia's grief for her deceased husband. The Babadook feeds off of Amelia's internal conflict of both loving and blaming her son. This becomes apparent when the Babadook takes over her body, she is no longer a loving mother, she verbalizes her blame to Samuel. Amelia now must overcome her new urge to harm Samuel. Amelia's love for Samuel and Samuel's love for his mother is what saves them both and strengthens their bond with one another."
"zacharyesherman","5","0","1","26 March 2018"," Artistically beautiful, but rather dull
","The Babadook is an interesting horror film, with an extremely low budget, only so much could be accomplished. Taking their budget into consideration, it is incredible what Jennifer Kent was able to manage. The sets were dark and grim and played off of Amelia's grief and depression. The use of dark colors and low lighting played off of what was going on in her mind, with something always lurking in the shadows. The use of this monster as a visual representation of the grief and depression taking over her mind is a beautiful allegory. Although this movie is artistically gorgeous, as a horror film, it doesn't quite do it for me. The concept is scary, yes, however the movie as a whole felt slow and not very suspenseful. I wasn't drawn in and found both of the characters to be rather annoying, preventing me from growing to like and care about them. I feel as though this is more of a thriller than a horror film, even though as a thriller it's not very thrilling either. The reason this film gets a five out of ten is from the directing and gorgeous sets and how they played with the story, even if the story seemed a bit lacking. Overall the film was average and what makes it so worthwhile is the mise-en-scene and sets, this is not a film I need to see again."

","The Babadook is a terrifyingly stunning film that treats its audience to the minimalistic mundanity of a single parent household while descending into the depths of despair and grief-stricken fear that only an unseen force can create. A film with such simplicity in its art direction and complexity within its story and angular shots leads us, the audience, to further understand how destructive, beautiful, and horrifying our own denial and repression of memories can be. Using our childlike sense of wonder and imagination through the use of a storybook, we see the unravel and torment of a tapped-out mother dealing with the uncontrolled problems of her past and, now, with her son. The music in this film gives a sense of eerieness as if we have heard the faint chime or the grumbling growl that crescendos as we get closer. The Babadook takes the audience and throws us into an emotional and mental meat grinder. We are enthralled by the disturbance of this family ordeal and will stop at nothing, as the characters do, to look for closure. And yet, even though we may not reach a full closure upon the film's ending, we are left with a hopeful and subtle conclusion that leaves a bittersweet fulfillment. Jennifer Kent, the writer, and director of this truly wonderful film truly deserves the accolades for this stunning display of hope."

","I'd heard good things about The Babadook, the directorial debut of Australian filmmaker Jennifer Kent. The sets, cinematography and acting are all top shelf, and the story is unconventional.<br/><br/>Six years after her husband is killed in an automobile accident, widow and mother Amelia (Essie Davis) is barely hanging on by a thread. She struggles to contain her young son Sam (Noah Wiseman), whose behavioral issues are creating conflicts at school at with family members. Sam has nightmares of the ""monster under the bed"" type, but when a disturbing children's book called ""The Babadook"" shows up unexpectedly, it seems as though the monsters may be real.<br/><br/>The Babadook is not a typical horror film. If you need to have the plot neatly wrapped up and all loose ends accounted for, you're going to be disappointed. <br/><br/>*Spoilers follow*<br/><br/>The Babadook is not a Hollywood monster or manifestation of evil spirits, it's a metaphor for Amelia's crushing grief. It's a version of the ""Enemy Within"", and is a manifestation of Amelia's grief over losing her husband, her anger at her son, and her guilt over those feelings. <br/><br/>As the book says, once the Babadook comes, you can't get rid of him, because denying him only makes him stronger. ""You start to change when I get in/The Babadook growing under your skin..."" <br/><br/>It's not a perfect film, and the pace can be a bit tedious, but it's still worth a look, or a second look if you're one of the many viewers who didn't really understand what the director was trying to communicate."

","This is the first review I have ever written, I usually don't write reviews but as a fan of horror and scary movies, I feel compelled to share my thoughts for the benefit of other scary movie lovers. I found the movie to be pretty slow and a lot of the scenes were repetitive. I also wasn't a huge fan of how little background music their was, it made it feel really bland. Some of the scary and creepy scenes weren't very satisfying either, not necessarily just because there weren't that many jump scares, but more because they just weren't as creepy as they could have easily been. The end of the movie also wasn't that satisfying, from what I understand the movie and plot are metaphors of some sort but I feel like that metaphor wasn't presented as clearly or deeply as it could have been, in fact I didn't really get it at first and even after reading some explanations of the ending I still felt like there were missing connections and overall it was just a weak execution. I would've also loved to have seen more of the babadook and learned more about its origin, appearance, powers, and objective. I think some of the characters weren't very well developed either and we didn't really get to know them. Basically, it was alright, nothing noteworthy."

","The Babadook can't be faulted for the acting, or directing, choppy editing and cinematography. Even the Babadook book itself is charming in a dark and quirky way. The plot and Babadook itself can be decoded after the film has finished as to whether it is a metaphorical or empirical force which is always an enjoyable post horror discussion. Undoubtedly a film about grief, depression and loneliness this film raises some interesting introspective points as well as questioning sanity itself. as it is better than many horror films out there I wanted to say it is OK viewing for most, I didn't find it remotely scary however but is satisfying in its slotting into the psychological horror genre with ease.<br/><br/>But.<br/><br/>Not entirely sure why all the adults hated Samuel without any understanding or care to understand his needs. Of all of the children I have known that have emotional/behavioral needs people go out of their way to understand them, most of all children. It seems cold and unrealistic that adults would openly detest him. I understand he hurt children but to loath a child for this who is clearly in need of help just appeared off to me. Don't entirely understand either why the Mum and child never really left the house. Who in their right mind if they were freaked out would repeatedly sleep in the same room and house night after night? Also, shouting at the Babadook made it retreat? I'll have to try that next time I have a creepy encounter. What is the Babadook and what does it want? I found myself asking that question throughout, what is the point of it if it is in fact real? I guess that's why people assume it is a manifestation of guilt/trauma/bereavement, she finally took control of her life and that manifestation drew away."

It builds up the tension and fear gradually and holds back until further on and keeps us guessing if the Babadook is real or imagined.<br/><br/>I'm afraid the movie lost me when I realised that the Babadook wasn't going to be ""real"". I felt misled by the makers. They extracted all the jumps, scares, and fear that a ""supernatural"" movie would be entitled to then cops out massively by making it all a metaphor for the mother getting over her grief, and anger towards her son. <br/><br/>OK, you might say that the fear and horror we went through before the reveal was justified because it made us feel as the mother might have felt but that didn't work with me personally. Just because it bravely deals with admittedly heavy issues does not excuse misleading us about the Babadook. <br/><br/>I don't discount the films usage of the Babadook. It could have hinted at or openly defined the Babadook as a metaphor or mental phantom, and scared us as much as it wanted. But keeping us guessing till the end was a disingenuous choice in my opinion and left me feeling cheated, let down, and disappointed when I really didn't want to.<br/><br/>I would have voted the movie 4 because of the massive let down.

"FJWWindsor","6","0","1","19 October 2017"," Journey into Madness
","I have been catching up on many of the horror films I've missed in the past few years, so I've seen a great many in a relatively short period of time. Judging The Babadook within this context, I was pleasantly surprised at the scare quality of this film.<br/><br/>The Babadook is the story of a woman's slow, inexorable descent into madness, driven by grief and loneliness (she's a widow), and the stress and anxiety of raising a child with mental and behavioral problems. The pacing is superb as we gradually witness her unhinging, subtle at first, and then outright powerful toward the end. So overwhelming is her challenge that help from various outside parties - a kindly neighbor, school guidance counselors, a co-worker - is not enough to counter her fall.<br/><br/>I also thought that creating a mythical horror character in a child's book was a refreshing idea as a plot device. (I couldn't help but view the special feature in the bonus section that highlighted the creation and creator of the book). This creates the Babadook as a metaphor for the doubts and fears of mother and child, and links the special bond the mother and son have, as well as the shared experience of having to go through these terrible travails together. Yet, eventually, the mother and son gain their strength and confidence together, enough so as to defeat those same fears in the end.<br/><br/>I also liked the execution of the film, though it will probably be viewed as average by many. Most scenes involving the actual Babadook take place in darkness and shadows, which is expected, I suppose. And is it just me, or did they amp up the sound when Babadook screamed/groaned/shrieked? Ordinarily, I'd find this irksome, but it really goosed up the tension for me, putting me more on edge in certain scenes. <br/><br/>All in all, there's enough uniqueness here to recommend The Babadook as a one time view, but you probably wouldn't count this as a classic that is a must-own."

","I really liked the premise of this film when I read the summary, but was ultimately disappointed when I was finished. Although there were a lot of spectacular moments where I felt my chest tightening, the amount of times an overused trope or predictable encounter occurred killed any scary vibe the movie had.<br/><br/>Things I liked:<br/><br/>-The use of the book (as well as the knocking) was a great way to introduce the idea of the Babadook without feeling like exposition was being dumped on you. When the book returned, it was one of the most frightening sequences in the movie!<br/><br/>-The use of music (and lack of music) really set the tone. Many times a film will unintentionally kill the immersion by playing thematically inappropriate music, or playing music when silence would really be more appropriate. This film did a great job of building tension all around.<br/><br/>-The set was fantastic. The layout, color scheme, and slight disrepair all created an amazing atmosphere. The thematically relevant television they watched was a nice touch.<br/><br/>Things I didn't like:<br/><br/>-In a lot of cases, the acting was a little over the top. Less is more in a horror film, and often times when trying to be scary, the extreme performance ended up seeming more humorous.<br/><br/>-The appearance of the Babadook itself could've been a lot scarier. I had really hoped that this movie would deviate away from the typical scare tactics of other movies, but I was unfortunately wrong. They used cheesy effects to make the creature move quickly, and again made it seem more comical than scary. The voice modulation was also cringey and immersion-breaking. Again, less is more, especially with a movie with a premise as good as this one.<br/><br/>-The use of graphic imagery to be scary was attempted in this film, which in my opinion is not very frightening. When done right it can be, but in this instance it felt forced rather than disturbing or scary. I will say that when violence was depicted in the pop-up book, it was done very well and was chilling, but when already foreshadowed, the actual thing seemed redundant.<br/><br/>-Unrealistically happy endings always bother me, and this one is no exception. The idea that a child was able to perform an exorcism just by loving his mother and touching her cheek was asking a lot of the audience, considering how powerful the creature was shown to be. I will say that the black bile was a nice and concise way of showing that he had left.<br/><br/>In conclusion, it's not terrible, and worth a watch if you don't have much to do, but don't expect to be scared very frequently, as the overuse of horror tropes kills the mood."

","Troubled by her sons' bizarre behavior, a single mother tired by his constant mentions of a strange monster coming after him turns out to be true when she soon encounters the vicious figure coming after him in the house and tries to save him before the creature can get to him.<br/><br/>This one ended up being an incredibly problematic effort. A lot of the films' issues come from the fact that there's nothing about the son worth celebrating about the son here. This is one of the most irritating, utterly insufferable brat that ever lived the way he's portrayed here with his screaming for attention, the need for household protection measures that are far more destructive than helpful and a general air of total disobedience that borders on psychological intervention the way he goes on throughout this one. His screaming and hysterical antics are plain grating, and the out- of-control nature of how he behaves around her and others such as the neighbors or the friends' birthday party just make it nearly impossible to feel anything less than utter disdain for him. However, since this behavior is supposed to demonstrate how terrifying the creature is that he's forced the child into that state instead all it does is hammer home how despicable the kid is and that really drains the film of any chance to generate scares or thrills of any kind for most of the overall running time. This manages to really delay any kind of horror scenes here as this just turns the film into a dull, exhaustive drama for most of the running time. The other big issue here is the complete and utter lack of information here about what the titular creature actually is as there's nothing given about the creature's' history, what it's actual purpose is or where the rules about it come from as the entire affair is kept completely in the dark and is a total mystery. This also offers up no connection as to where the book came from or how he became so obsessed with it considering the reaction he has to it the first time she reads it for him which shows he is clearly afraid of the book like it's the first time he's read it which makes no sense if he's heard the story before. These issues are what hold this one down considerably and don't really allow the positives much room to work with. Those positives consist solely of the action found in the final half where the creature is finally let loose and engages in some wild chases around the house which lets this one get quite dark and chilling with the way it all plays out. This gets the film moving along nicely and places a lot of emphasis on the breakneck encounters which makes for quite a rousing finish. Coupled with a creepy look to the main creature, these, though, are all that work for this one.<br/><br/>Rated R: Language, Violence and intense themes of children-in- jeopardy."

However the problem in the way of this brilliant idea is the monster itself is barely seen through out the movie, if there's a horror movie in need of monster appearances to keep audiences fully hooked its this one.<br/><br/>I will say Essie Davis is the strongest part of the film and gives a tremendous performance as a suffering mother just trying to scrape by who's constantly judged by her friends.<br/><br/>Overall, personally this is a one time watch this one, even if the pros do pushed the cons away a bit <br/><br/>6.3/10"

In stead of doing things well in a few scare tactics, it did poorly in many going for quantity instead of quality.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, i do give praise where it is warranted.

"stephenabell","3","0","3","23 February 2017"," Don't Believe The Hype
","This is one of those films where you shouldn't believe the hype. After all I'd heard and read about this movie I was really looking forward to it. However, while viewing I soon became aware this was not going to live up to its publicity... and it didn't... it fell woefully short.<br/><br/>Here you have a story of a single widowed mother and her peculiar son who are going through life in a stagnant haze. Her son, Samuel (played by Noah Wiseman) is an intelligent child who has a knack for constructing weapons, for which he is reprimanded at school. Samuel is a solitary child who finds it hard to make friends and keep them. He also has a temper that makes him violent, both physically and vocally, when he's confronted.<br/><br/>Samuels mother, Amelia (played by Essie Davis) works at a care home and dealing with the close to death cronies has its effect on her. She holds onto the memories of her seven-year dead husband, Oskar, in a proverbial death grip, even her own sister has given up on her. Amelia won't let Samuel have his birthday on the date of his birth as Oskar died driving her to the hospital.<br/><br/>Even before the Babadook rears its head, the family is troubled and broken. This should lead to well-rounded and deep characterisations. Instead of this, we get depressed and moody bad parenting from Amelia and shouty stomping belligerence from Samuel. This makes for two very unlikeable characters. If the viewer cannot sympathise, empathise, or in some little way, relate to the main characters then the story and film will not hold their attention... it failed to hold mine... and to be bluntly truthful, I was only watching in the hopes that the Babadook had its evil way with them... I was upset when it didn't.<br/><br/>These two characters are both worse than the snot filled blubbering idiot in The Blair Witch Project.<br/><br/>The there's the story, which in my eyes, tries to say and be too much. It's not sure if it's horror, there are elements of horror in here, though too little for me to put it in the genre. There's drama with all the elements of relationships in tribulation. The film would've been a lot better if some of these elements had been trimmed back and some removed altogether, and the director chose a direction in which to take the film.<br/><br/>So that's what's wrong with the film in my opinion.<br/><br/>So what was right?<br/><br/>The acting from Essie Davis was pretty good especially, later in the film, when her temperament instantly changes. This sent a chill up and down my spine. Noah Wiseman was brilliant in the son's role. I cannot fault the actors, the fault lies with story and direction, which falls on the head of Jennifer Kent who wrote and directed.<br/><br/>That said, apart from the direction of the characters and the story the film was well directed, and at times gave a few chills with prolonged shots of opened wardrobes and corners of rooms, where clothes were hung; the tension created was palpable. So we know that she can direct. Maybe she should've given the story synopsis, which was brilliant and well thought out, over to a writer! I say this as the ending of this movie is why I've placed this into a Dark Fantasy, that and the reason of the Babadook ending up being wimpy (sorry for the spoiler) - this was the biggest let-down of all... a horror movie that tells you there's really nothing to be scared of.<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend anybody watching this film; there's nothing to get out of it. By the end, I was disheartened."

","""You can't kill the bogeyman"" from Halloween became ""You can't get rid of the Babadook"". Babadook is basically Nosferatu with a hat, many horror films get played on the TV during the movie just like the original Halloween and so on. Has couple of good ideas though. It's better than a student film and has a standard quality to it however ending is just horrible and silly. I guess she wanted to jump into a sequel or turn it to a franchise which killed the whole film(unnecessary and rushed) Characters are not very likable in the beginning so it might loose you fast. It's not going to be very convincing. Very cliché and feels like a horror film collage. ""-Where did you find this book?-on the shelf"" ??Directing was better than writing.She surprisingly surpasses the difficulties of making the movie (production) but the script is just not concluded well it could have been left to the imagination of the audience. 4/10 at most for overall. lost lot of points in the writing which could have been avoided.

","OK where the movie became horrible for me was when she killed her dog. I mean really what on earth did that do for the plot? She could have easily gone insane and the dog escape to a neighbor's house to be cared for until she became lucid again but not they chose to kill the dog. I expect that kind of stuff in horror films tagged as gory but not as psychological at least for me. Or they could have easily left the dog out of the plot entirely.<br/><br/>The pacing of the movie felt off for me. It was just too slow for too long then sped up too fast to the point where I was just left confused. I don't really get why the monster went into the basement on its own volition??<br/><br/>Some of the effects were genuinely scary to me. She did do crazy quite well. The son was too whiny too annoying for too long. <br/><br/>Also it would have served the plot well to have added more of a back story into the monster.

Some of the devices, like the time-lapse of the mother's sleeping face to show the passage of time, were neat. There are some truly creepy moments as well, and the Babadook's voice was quite chilling.<br/><br/>However, after all the buildup the payoff was brutally disappointing. Mr. Babadook is played up to be a powerful, perhaps unstoppable demon (you can't get rid of the Babadook), but in the end he's satiated by a bowl of worms. He goes to elaborate lengths to torment and ultimately possess a mother with the goal of killing her son, when he could have just gone to the garden and scooped up a handful of dirt. Of course, he would have preferred to consume the son, but the mother yelled at him, so..<br/><br/>Overall, some nice elements but disappointing as a whole."

","The Babadook<br/><br/>This is what nightmares are made of. Not to mention that the movie plays on the fears of being a single mother. I can't relate but I totally see where this is coming from. Everyone is completely believable. No one feels out of place and no one under performs. If anything the acting is too on point that I felt bad for this fictional person.<br/><br/>Amelia, played by Essie Davis, isn't dolled up, she's just your average single mom who hasn't gotten over her husbands death. Because she and her son haven't grieved properly their relationship is a mess.<br/><br/>Samuel, played by Noah Wiseman, was excellent as a kid. Almost as if the director said be as annoying and loud as possible. I loved to hate how annoyingly real he was. The kid has a great arc which just goes to show you how well written the characters were.<br/><br/>Jennifer Kent shines as her writing impresses, but her direction and choices were nothing special. The acting and writing is what stands out. You can't expect anyone's first major film to be as polished in direction. Some of the effects are goofy almost silly, and then some of them are horrifying.<br/><br/>The ending was familiar, expected, and odd. Lots of homages to other horror movies which was either awesome if intentional or cheap if otherwise. There was this odd horror noise that sounds an awful lot like a dinosaur from Turok.

"corey-hughes","9","0","3","30 April 2016"," A truly spine-chilling, yet underrated, horror flick.
","The year was 2013. Zack Snyder takes to the stage in San Diego's Comic Con and announces what might just be the biggest movie idea in film history: the Dark Knight taking on the Man of Steel. 3 years pass, and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice finally hits the big screen, but was it all that it piped up to be? Meh.<br/><br/>Straight off the bat (no pun intended) I'd like to put out there that I'm a HUGE Batman fan, so when this movie was first announced, I somersaulted through my room in my white undies. I mean, Batman himself taking on Superman? Who wouldn't want to go and see that, right?! However, to say the movie was underwhelming would be an understatement.<br/><br/>Being the optimistic and positive person I am, let's talk about the things I really enjoyed first. Ben Affleck. The guy absolutely killed it as the Dark Knight we know and love, but did so in a way we haven't really seen yet. Affleck did an excellent job in portraying a troubled Bruce Wayne and in turn, an unhinged Batman, with Robin's death still fresh in his mind. And this really showed, I mean, Batman was a complete badass. My favourite scene from the movie came from the trailer, when he shoots up from the floor below and takes out a swarm of enemies very similar to the way the Arkham video-games would. You really got the sense that Affleck's Batman was ruthless in his attacks, something that Bale and Keaton failed to demonstrate, for me. Bruce Wayne in this movie was awesome, too. Snyder did well in showing how both Wayne and Bats were indeed the same person, with one being just as appealing as the other. This may be a bold statement, but Ben Affleck might just be my favourite on-screen Batman so far. Yeah, I said it. I also loved the way the movie teased the upcoming Justice League movie and other individual additions to the DC cinematic universe, with Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg also getting nods. Wonder Woman also made her first appearance, here, too; and her brief moments in the film were amazing to watch. Seeing her, Batman, and Superman together in one film was a sight to remember, one which I will never forget!<br/><br/>But, sadly, that's where the good things come to an end. The main problem I have is the overall pacing of the movie. The first half-or-so tailors around the political debate on whether Superman can be deemed ally or foe, with his actions becoming more and more controversial in the eyes of the general population. But then the film picks up a lot of pace very suddenly without any sense of progression or build-up. For a 151 minute film there really seemed to be very little planning or thought going into the film, with so much being crammed in. If they had cut down on some of the lesser-relevant footage you could have been left with a smoothly-paced narrative that would have been so much easier to watch. And when I'm talking about unnecessary footage, I'm talking about Lois Lane. Her continual need for saving and the cringe-worthy relationship that her and Clark Kent share was tedious to watch, and really dragged out the movie. If I'm going to see a 2 and a half hour movie, I don't want to feel that I'm there for that long. I want to be completely immersed and engaged throughout, but the pair left me looking at my watch whenever they were on screen.<br/><br/>When I saw that Batman v Superman had cast Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor, I had my immediate doubts. Unfortunately, these doubts were confirmed through both the trailers and the movie itself. His witty approach came across as nothing less of tacky and to be brutally honest – awfully annoying. What was worse, though, is that Eisenberg's Luthor lacked any complexity or character development, which raised questions about why he had a grudge against Batman and Superman in the first place. Henry Cavill's Superman was also responsible for the movie's downfall. Even if I looked past how easily Batman put up a fight against the Man of Steel, I couldn't ignore the complete lack of interest I had in his character, despite the fact that this was supposed to be a sequel to Man of Steel.<br/><br/>Batman v Superman was also unnecessarily stupid at times, too. One minute Batman and Superman want to kill each other, but as soon as they realise their mothers share the same name, they become besties. Uhwhat? The entire movie had built up this conflict between the two heroes, yet in a matter of minutes, it is put aside for sentimentality. Surely, for a 2 and a half hour film, there could have been more subtlety in the way they settle their differences. And also, did Batman, erm you know, kill people? I'm pretty sure he did<br/><br/>In a sense, I'm glad this was the first instalment of the upcoming DC cinematic universe. With my fingers crossed, I hope Snyder will learn from his mistakes early on and understand what worked and what didn't. But is Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice a bad movie? No, of course not. But was there room for improvement? Sure. There is still so much potential, here, and I remain confident that there's still much more to come for the DC universe."

","Amelia (Essie Davis) is a single mother trying to raise her six-year-old son Samuel (Noah Wiseman) alone after her husband was killed in an accident. The only problem is that Samuel is a nervous, skittish and impressionable little boy who's constantly testing the patience of Amelie and all his caretakers. And things continue to go downhill when a mysterious book appears in Samuel's room, telling about a creepy Mr. Babadook, who will come a-knocking, after which he will naturally devour your soul, feast upon your blood, all that good stuff.<br/><br/>Pretty much textbook as far monster horror movies go, but what gives The Babadook its strength is its way of telling its story and the things it chooses to focus upon. Because quite frankly Mr. Babadook is the least interesting thing in the film. The actual horror comes from the fraying relationship between the mother and the son, from the fact that they're both becoming so very scared of one another, and how you'll start to see their nerves building and building. It's a very poignant film about raising a child alone and being under so much pressure, stress and unreasonable expectations.<br/><br/>And that leads to the downside of the film. It is a monster horror film and when Mr. Babadook enters the picture, the film just isn't as interesting anymore. I enjoyed the first half, when it looked like Samuel had simple gone insane and was lashing out against his mother, far more than I enjoyed the second half, which was by no means bad as far as horror films go, but which just wasn't as innovative and unique as the first half.<br/><br/>Still, when the film works, it works amazingly well. Especially keeping in mind that this is director Jennifer Kent's debut film. Definitely worth a watch for all fans of psychological horror."

"Yuhao88","7","0","2","12 October 2015"," Worthwhile but frustrating
","I still don't quite know how to feel about ""The Babadook"". The trailer left me more excited than I've been for any horror film in years. However, I should know by now that horror trailers often misrepresent the movie. ""The Babadook"" has horror/thriller elements, but it's definitely not the monster movie you might expect. The closest comparison would be Aronofsky's ""Black Swan"" - both are slow, increasingly surreal portraits of a woman's descent into madness. However, by the end of ""The Babadook"" I was wondering if even that was the correct explanation. This movie left me with questions, and not in a good way.<br/><br/>The plot concerns a woman struggling to raise her troublesome son while doing her best to stifle her grief for his father. The fact that he died while driving her to the hospital to give birth plants the seeds of resentment that drive the plot. It's an uncomfortable subject matter, and one that provides the real ""horror"" of the story - that a mother could have such dark feelings towards her own child. We see her try to push them down and be the best mother she can, and over the course of the movie the effort starts to crack her.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this solid premise is muddled by the introduction of a very ambiguous monster - the titular Babadook. The evil (and reappearing) pop-up book that introduces the creature is fantastically creepy, however the payoff to all that foreboding is little more than a few cursory (and sometimes very cheap) scares. It all comes together in a mystifying muddle of an ending. From the moment the Babadook was introduced, I never doubted for a minute that it could simply be a product of the mother's fevered mind. However, the ending gives us frustratingly little closure. If it was all in her mind, it means she hallucinated half the movie. If it was real, we are never given confirmation. I began to wonder if the entire movie was simply meant to be taken metaphorically. Some viewers may be OK with this conclusion, I was not.<br/><br/>Of course, there is still a great deal to praise. Essie Davis' performance as the mother is genuinely incredible - award-worthy, even. Watching her start out so frazzled and quiet only to be (literally) roaring by the end was a real treat. The son, too, is surely one of the best child actors I've ever seen. The atmosphere throughout is off-kilter and consistently unnerving (again, quite ""Black Swan""-esque) with some particularly good sequences where we see the monster's face, again and again, in old TV programs and movies. Ultimately ""The Babadook"" is a film experience worth having, but one that left me a little unsatisfied."

Amelia ignores Samuel's warnings and, not to play Bada Spoiler, you pretty much can assume the rest. Kent did not really construct any spooky elements to the picture; and it was somewhat predictable.

","Review: This is another one of those horror films were the people should have just left the house! It's about a woman who lives with her troubled son who are finding it hard to deal with the loss of her husband, who died in a car accident while they were on the way to the hospital to have there son. The little boy has problems at school because of his weird behaviour and his mum works in an old people's home which doesn't give her much satisfaction. Every night she tries her utmost to get her son to sleep by reading him books and they come across a book called the Babadook which scares the little boy because he thinks that the creatures is real and that he is coming to kill them. After a while, the boys strange behaviour becomes violent and unpredictable so his mum starts to look into the mysterious book which has caused so many problems. She soon finds out that her sons behaviour is connected to the book and that all is not what it seems.The storyline wasn't that amazing but I did find the movie quite entertaining because I really didn't know were the plot was going. I found the little boy incredibly brave and at the age of 7, his weapon making was top notch. The airy feel to the movie, really worked with the storyline and the relationship between the little boy and his mum was sweet and loving, before she became possessed. I really felt for the mum who was suffering with depression and sleep deprivation and when you've got a monster in the house, it really doesn't help. Anyway, the mixture of horror and drama really worked but I didn't get the ending. Watchable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: It's always good when an independent movie comes together well at such a low budget. This film is based around a mother and sons relationship which is touching in parts and quite disturbing in others. Its the first major movie from writer/director Jennifer Kent who has only done a few shorts in her career. Essie Davis, who played the lead, has starred in movies like Australia, Matrix Revolutions and the Girl With a Pearl Earring but I really can't remember her in those films. She played her part extremely well in this film and she made this far fetched storyline seem real. The little boy, played by Noah Wiseman, was excellent and his annoying behaviour would have got on any parents nerves. Anyway, it's worth a watch, from many different angles and it could have easily done without the horror aspect because of the touching concept between the mother and son.<br/><br/>Budget: $2million Worldwide Gross: $5million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their drama/thriller/horrors about a mother and young son who are under attack from a evil force in there house.....The Babadook. 6/10"

This definitely would've been an 8 for me had it not been for the ending.<br/><br/>~Spoiler Below~<br/><br/>(Spoiler alert; they all but made the monster their pet- keeping it in their attic and feeding it on a seemingly regular basis.)<br/><br/>~End of Spoiler~<br/><br/>The end was sudden, irrational and altogether unsatisfying. This one factor managed to bring down the otherwise fantastic movie as I was left with only the ridiculous abruptness. I went from anxious to simply confused, and was definitely expecting something more creative or interesting. I'd even settle for a cliché if it meant avoiding the hasty resolution that seemed like it was written by a child running out of time in an examination hall.<br/><br/>I give it a six and a half, because the bulk of the film was so brilliant. But the ending is really expected to clinch it, and this one failed to."

","I've watched ""It Follows"" and heard that ""The Babadook"" would also be a good horror to film to watch. I thought it would be this decade's ""The Exorcist"" or a re-inventing of the horror genre, but it left me empty. For one, the little kid was very annoying and I didn't care much for him. I didn't feel much chemistry between him and his mother and the dead father thing didn't do much for the story. In terms of the horror, it was pretty good, but could've been a whole more scarier. Something like ""The Conjuring"" is what I had hoped this film would have been like. Maybe it was down to the lack of characters, but I don't know. I think ""It Follows"" was actually a better horror film, which is weird because by the trailer, this looked more frightening. I'd give this a 7/10 and It Follows an 8/10. But still, it's better than the new Poltergeist and a lot of new horror films."

","I can see why this movie is getting such great critical reviews. It is very well made all around - the acting, direction and writing are all excellent. My problem with the movie is that I just didn't enjoy watching it. Somehow the tone of it isn't right for me to have a fun experience; this movie has more of the tone of a dark drama than a horror movie. I think the writer/director was using the horror movie format as a vehicle for showing a woman's descent into madness caused by her past experience. In that sense the film is working on 2 levels. Her ultimate defeat of the creature and relegating of it to the basement seems to symbolize her keeping her inner demons under control. As I said I think the movie's writing is excellent. For me though I want a horror movie to scare me but in a thrill ride sort of way. This is a film I can appreciate on a technical level but not actually get a lot of enjoyment out of. You will find the movie dark and disturbing but if you are looking for an enjoyable horror movie experience I would look elsewhere."
"wishpishh","7","0","4","25 May 2015"," Slightly drab at times
","At its best, this movie is a well executed story about overcoming loss and trauma. It's also an interesting look at the difficulties of parenthood -- or at least how I imagine it might be at times, since I don't have any kids of my own. It's also a movie about alienation. As such, I think it works really well at times, even though those themes have been explored in many movies before.<br/><br/>As a horror movie, it's rather uneven and at times extremely by the book (see what I did there?). There aren't that many scares, it's more of a tension and uneasy feeling building throughout the movie -- and that comes a lot more from the feeling of anxiety and alienation that's felt through the mother-son relationship and their troubles than the actual horror elements of the movie. I found it a lot more disturbing to watch their family problems than the ghost/monster elements. Because the monster isn't really very well developed. It gets extremely little screen time, which can be very effective sometimes, but here you kind of forget about it for long stretches of time. After a while you kind of think ""oh, right, there's this monster in the movie too"". And that elephant trumpet sound effect that's supposed to sound like the monster screeching? Is that some kind of joke? I do like the scene where they first find and read the book, though. That was creepy. Other than that, this is standard ""haunted house/possession"" stuff.<br/><br/>Another thing I didn't like in the movie was the soundtrack, or rather lack thereof. Whenever there is music, it's absolutely standard horror movie stuff. But through a lot of the movie, it's absolutely quiet. There are movies where this works great, but here I really felt something missing and it got a bit depressing at times. Combined with a rather washed-out lighting throughout the whole movie, and its slow pace, it all felt rather drab and slow in some stretches, and not in an entirely good way."

The story begins to unravel as the son's, portrayed by Noah Wiseman, monster- sightings become more and more disturbing, especially once his mother starts seeing them. As the movie goes on, the plot gets weirder and more disturbing. The film mainly focuses on the mother, portrayed by Essie Davis, and her point of view.<br/><br/>The ending, however, almost leaves you hanging, and maybe even a little confused.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 7 because of it's uniqueness, but at the same time I felt it could have been scarier, and I wish you would learn more about the Babadook itself.

","I read some reviews about this movie and they made it sound like an amazing physiological horror. First, I must praise the movie on its interesting filming techniques such as how to pass time and the general lighting and colors used in the movie very much complimented the theme.<br/><br/>The setting was great. Also, the characters were pretty well acted and decent characters, but nothing too special. They made me feel empathetic at times, but failed to at other times.<br/><br/>The one thing I felt was lacking in this movie was real horror. This movie provided a certain creepiness during parts of the movie, but failed to consistently give. A psychological horror is supposed to keep you on the edge at all times and this failed to do so for me. I feel horror buffs will applaud its uniqueness, but certainly not the horror aspect. Jump scares are rarely present and generally well done. Certain amount of cheesiness in things just as the child is flying around seemed too unreal to be taken serious.<br/><br/>The movie has a great theme of overcoming especially the ending which leaves on a happy note. The mother and son finally overcome the loss of their husband/father in a mix of inspiring yet overly cliché. Horror buffs will like the uniqueness, yet be disappointed by the hits or misses in the horror aspect. Non-horror buffs will enjoy the creepy tone and the feel good ending of the movie."
"Hey_Sweden","6","0","4","2 May 2015"," The Babawhat?
","This decent if somewhat over praised modern psychological horror film stars Essie Davis as Amelia. Amelia is a single mother raising six year old Samuel (Noah Wiseman) by herself because the husband / father died while trying to transport Amelia to the hospital in the first place. Now Samuel is acting very strangely, insisting that he's interacting with the terrifying spectral beast of the title. His troubling (to say the least) behaviour leads her to start really losing her mind, which has already been in a fragile state ever since hubby's death.<br/><br/>This viewer found it a little too hard to care that much about these main characters, and the basic story is rather average. Yes, writer / director Jennifer Kent does deserve some credit, for choosing to go a mostly traditional route in terms of horror. She creates a mood, and an atmosphere, and some genre fans will be pleased to note that, for the most part, she eschews the use of excessive gore. She's also smart to keep her villain shadowy and vague and barely seen; while this approach might not appeal to some horror devotees, this viewer thinks that, often, the less he knows about the antagonist, the better. Lastly, Kent never allows special effects to overtake any drama, keeping them to a minimum.<br/><br/>The performance from leading lady Davis certainly reveals a deep sense of commitment. Granted, her histrionics come off as a little much, but she absolutely does not phone this performance in. She gives it her all. Little Wiseman is pretty impressive, and appealing through it all.<br/><br/>Overall, a good watch, not a great one.<br/><br/>Six out of 10."

","This is one of the most tense movies I've ever seen. No cheap scares in this one; just a perpetual dread that lasts about two hours and you'll love every minute of it. With that said, there were some odd choices in storytelling; a noticeable lacking of a certain raison d'etre that I could have used and the films resolution seemed oddly whimsical in juxtaposition to the feeling of the movie as a whole. I couldn't let that take anything away from the film though. All in all, a brilliant film that was phenomenally acted. Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman give visceral, honest performances that will leave you shivering on the floor and holding your knees, breathless. This one will stick with you long after you've turned off the lights and stare into that black-void behind your open closet door. Your sheets over your head won't protect you from this one."

","I am writing this review solely to objectively state that it does not deserve a 10 on any scale. I have seen outstanding reviews and while not a bad film entirely this is unjust. My rating is almost confined to the genre of horror because otherwise it really does not compare to other films id label a 6 so in comparison with similar films it hits a 6.<br/><br/>To keep it short I've seen many horror films involving paranormal activity/poltergeists etc. such as paranormal activity (1,2,3...) the conjuring, dark skies, it follows just naming first that come to mind. As the others do also, there are very few ideas that are original and not taken from older films such as the Poltergeist. The film is very very basic when it comes to the actual effects of the babadook; bed shaking, closet noises, doors opening, random faces etc. for that it is hard to take the film seriously more towards the end and the late quarter of the film spoils it.<br/><br/>However positively, this films does build a character better than a lot of others in this genre and the acting from the main lady and boy is better than most and enjoyable. The mental decline of the mum and the boy's disobedience is played well. OK film for its genre, people are getting very carried away when there are many, many like it."

The movie is more psychological than horror, although in some scenes you feel on edge and waiting for something to happen. The acting between the mother and son is outstanding, even though we know that the mother has got issues, the way the two characters let it affect their relationship is astonishing.

","The Babadook (2014) <br/><br/>** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Australian horror film about a mother (Essie Davis) living with her young son (Noah Wiseman) and both are still suffering from the violent death of her husband seven years earlier. The boys is haunted by an overactive imagination but things take a turn for the worse when a book called Mister Babadook shows up and soon a monster too.<br/><br/>THE BABADOOK has pretty much taken over the horror community with some calling it the scariest movie since THE EXORCIST. I'm curious, why does every new scary movie get the label ""scariest movie since THE EXORCIST?"" Why not THE SHINING or some more recent scary movie? Either way, sadly THE BABADOOK ended up being one of the most disappointing horror movies in recent memory for a number of reasons. The biggest is the fact that I really didn't find a single scene scary or intense. Obviously with a movie like this the quality level is going to depend on whether or not it scares you and sadly this one just didn't do the trick.<br/><br/>More on that in a bit but I actually thought the first forty-five minutes or so of the movie were good. This portion of the film is actually more of a family drama as we're really given a lot of character development as we see the mother struggling with the death of her husband but we also see her struggle being a single mother and having to deal with an unhealthy child. I thought this stuff was actually well-written and handled extremely well by director Jennifer Kent. I thought she also managed to really show the struggles of this movie and the relationship between the two really did seem 100% real and never forced or faked. Even the relationship with the family members and outsiders came across very believable. The performances by both Davis and Wiseman were extremely good with Davis really shining as the mother who slowly begins to lose her mind.<br/><br/>Obviously, on a technical level, the film is quite effective so the level of your entertainment will be on whether or not it scares you. While watching the movie I could see why some would find it disturbing or downright frightening but I thought there were just too many things here that had been done in previous, much better movies. These include elements of THE EXORCIST (mom dealing with ill child), THE SHINING (one sequence really ""borrows"" from the Kubrick) film and even Mario Bava's SHOCK. THE BABADOCK is a decent movie but considering I went in expecting scares, it's a major disappointment in the end."

The characters world is very small, they are trapped inside the walls of their dreary house but at the same time their existence is empty and lonely.<br/><br/>Then like in a million horror films before, in the last quarter of the film, as the tension reaches its zenith the director gets carried away and blows the whole show with a truly stupid finale.<br/><br/>Very eerie, no blood, violence or nudity."

Make no mistake, this film will push your horror buttons in unexpected ways and is for adults only. While watching I kept thinking of the hair-raising creepiness of ""The Orphanage"" and the pervasive dread of ""The Shining"", where much of the horror comes from fear of what characters driven to the edge of insanity will do to themselves and each other. It shocks with its stark portrayal of a single mother reaching the end of her rope coping with a troubled child and a constant stream of bad luck and spooky events. At many points I found myself almost loosing sympathy with the mother or the son only to regain it in the next scene. I look forward to enjoying other works by these actors and this director."

"daniellekgoga","Null","0","2","29 March 2015"," What I really think
","This movie is about a mother and her child trying to escape from an evil story book character. The mother is trying to cope with the loss of her husband as she tries to save her and her sons life. The film plays on the stereotypical ""monster in my closet"" that everybody believed in when they were a kid. That is why I think the movie is so great is because the beginning of the film is through the perspective and imagination of a little kid. The fact that they used a children's book in the film was, to me, what made it have a bigger ""creepiness"" feeling throughout the whole movie. The whole movie looks depressing. You can tell by the colors shown throughout. The inside of the house itself are shades of blues and grays which are ""cool colors"" which shows that somebody is going through something. The clothes that the kid wears are also shades of blues and grays, until the end of the movie. To me, the ending should have been different, but I won't give it away. I just feel like that should have ended the film in a different way. I would recommend seeing this movie. It was overall very good and easy to follow. The acting in this film is great, the mother did a really good job considering the fact that she had to act possessed for half the movie. The child was also great. Being that young and having to act like that, especially when it was about a children's book character, is pretty difficult. I think that the ""monster"" in the film represents an inner sorrow. Once she defeats the ""monster"", which I think is her husband, she is able to go back to a normal life and she shows her son that she loves unlike she did before."

The Babadook contained unsettling music as well as a tummy-turning feeling of feeling trapped and alone.

Though the idea was good, the plot left a lot to be desired. My mother, who is a 'real' horror fan (i.e, she enjoys lots of tension and jump scares) did not enjoy this movie at all, but I thought it was great! As I said, the idea behind the film, to display feelings of grief as a physical thing that people live with, was fantastic, and the monster itself - wow! I simply heard the noise it makes - that creepy, croaky, demonic sound - on the trailer, and knew I had to watch it, if only to give myself nightmares. And it didn't disappoint! The Babadook was ridiculously scary, though actual sightings of the monster were few and far between, and even then he mostly appeared in shadow. But it's common horror knowledge that things are scarier when left to the imagination, right? In conclusion, I think this film is worth a watch, but don't expect jump scares... just endless tension that won't end once the final credits have rolled!"

It was a scary film but nowhere as scary as the reviews indicated. That might have been different I guess if viewed at a Theater in wide screen and Dolby Digital. The film more than focusing on the evil Babadook focused on the mental breakdown of the mother in the film and her young son who was just as batty. All children seen monsters under the bed and in the closet in this case those monsters are really there or are they. I wish there were more of a background of The Babadook it seems like it is exist in just from one children's book . The son/ child in the film Samuel played by Noah Wiseman when not saying lines that he is pretty good at just screams and screams at his mother Amelia (Essie Davis) who looses it more and more at each scream.

Can't stand Jonathan Lipnicki's sentiment-cloying turn in Jerry Maguire (1996)? Ever wished Jonathan Ke Quan's Short Round had met his doom in the eponymous Temple of Doom (1984)? Well, prepare yourself for Noah Wiseman in The Babadook, the most eye-gougingly annoying little s**t ever to step in front of a camera. Only, he's meant to be, and Wiseman is astonishingly good as young Samuel, every parent's worst nightmare who sees a monster no- one else does.<br/><br/>His mother Amelia (Essie Davis), an orderly living with the memory of her lover's death on the day of Samuel's birth, is at her wit's end. Samuel's teachers have given up on him, her sister doesn't want her child anywhere near him, he fashions weapons meant for serious harm, and his behaviour is only getting more unpredictable. She pulls him out of school and takes some time off work to help deal with the problem. One day, Samuel gives his mother a pop-up he finds on his shelf - a terrifying, black and white tale of a monster named The Babadook, who enters your home and eventually your body, manipulating you and driving you mad.<br/><br/>Soon enough, strange things start to happen around the house, as the outside world becomes increasingly distant in Amelia's troubled mind. She finds glass in her food, doors open and close on their own, and social services are coming round looking suspicious. Samuel promises to protect his mother with his various traps and devices, but his erratic behaviour subsides, and Amelia starts to see the monster for herself. The Babadook is a manipulative, jet-black creature, crawling along walls and ceilings. But is the monster real or is it a result of Amelia's deteriorating mental state and increasing frustration with her child?<br/><br/>For a debut full feature, The Babadook is very impressive. Director Jennifer Kent directs with a natural flair and a definite knowledge of horror tropes. The film often resembles Roman Polanski's Repulsion (1965), with the house becoming a metaphor for Amelia's psychological prison, and there are plenty of scares that don't rely on a loud noise to make the audience jump out of their seat (or skin). However, it does outstay it's welcome, taking a steady course from psychological study to full-blown horror, even though the whole thing is much more interesting in the build-up. The CGI monster is also an ill-fitting distraction from the realism of the drama. But, Davis is very good and Wiseman is probably better, and there is still plenty here to suggest that this is a director to keep an eye on.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

I know, some will find this ending and events interesting and absorbing, but I like more when horror pictures doesn't play with you and goes straight – otherwise I can't fully accept the chills and whole scary mood.<br/><br/>Overall, this a very nicely made picture, with some genuine scars, bus sadly it didn't kick as much as it could have."
