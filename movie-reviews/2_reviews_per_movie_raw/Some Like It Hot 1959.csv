","Why a man would want to marry another man? asks Tony Curtis, Security! Jack Lemmon replays without missing a beat. Clearly he had put the question to himself before and had arrived to a perfectly sensible conclusion. Everything in this gem of a movie had been thought so cleverly and as it turned out so prophetically, that the world of our three characters, a world of prohibition and gang wars could be today and more than likely will be tomorrow. Billy Wilder analyzes human nature with an acid eye and a glorious panache for underlining our most endearing features. Our frailties. Marilyn Monroes is at her pick, the sadness in her eyes a startling metaphor in a comedy about wanting. Tony Curtis with an Eve Arden's pout is so beautiful, so charming, imitating Cary Grant and trying to be himself that, in my mind he'll be always be in a frock. And, of course, Jack Lemmon, throwing himself into the part, body and should. Only perfection can allow to end its course with a line like ""Nobody's perfect"""
"gbrumburgh","10","234","298","18 April 2001"," Billy Wilder's screwball masterpiece with Curtis, Lemmon and the immortal Marilyn handed the best comedy roles of their careers.
","Admittedly biased, ""Some Like It Hot"" can certainly stand on its own merit with or without my thunderous round of applause.  More than a decade ago, I had the privilege of performing both the Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon roles in ""Sugar,"" the musical adaptation of ""Some Like It Hot"" which originally starred Tony Roberts, Robert Morse and Elaine Joyce on Broadway in the 70s. Though it hardly compares to the film's original (how could it???), the musical nevertheless is still a big hit with live audiences.  I can't remember ever having a better time on stage than I did with ""Sugar,"" and it's all due to the irrepressible talents that instigated it all.<br/><br/>In the 1959 classic, Curtis and Lemmon play two ragtag musicians scraping to make ends meet in Prohibition-era Chicago during the dead of winter who accidentally eyewitness a major gangland rubout (aka the St. Valentine's Day Massacre).  Barely escaping with their lives (their instruments aren't quite as lucky), our panicky twosome is forced to take it on the lam.  Scared out of their shoes (sorry), the boys don heels and dresses after they connect with an all-girl orchestra tour headed for sunny Florida.  Killing two birds with one stone, they figure why not go south for the winter while dodging the mob?  Once they hit the coast, they'll ditch both the band and their humiliating outfits.  <br/><br/>Enter a major detour in the form of  luscious Marilyn Monroe as Sugar Kane, given one of the sexiest (yet innocent) entrances ever afforded a star. Snugly fit in flashy 'Jazz Age' threads, a blast from the locomotive's engine taunts her incredible hour-glass figure as she rushes to catch her train to Florida.  The boys, stopped dead in their high-heeled tracks by this gorgeous vision, decide maybe the gig might not be so bad after all. As the totally unreliable but engagingly free-spirited vocalist/ukelele player for the band, Sugar gets instantly chummy with the ""girls"" when they cover for her after getting caught with a flask of booze.  As things progress, complications naturally set in - playboy Curtis falls for Monroe but has his ""Josephine"" guise to contend with, while Lemmon's ""Daphne"" has to deal with the persistently amorous attentions of a handsy older millionaire.  <br/><br/>What results is an uproarious Marx Brothers-like farce with mistaken identities, burlesque-styled antics, and a madcap chase finale, all under the exact supervision of director Billy Wilder, who also co-wrote the script.  Lemmon and Curtis pull off the silly shenanigans with customary flair and are such a great team, you almost wish THEY ended up together! Curtis does a dead-on Cary Grant imitation while posing as a Shell Oil millionaire to impress Marilyn; Lemmon induces campy hilarity in his scenes with lecherous Joe E. Brown (who also gets to deliver the film's blue-ribbon closing line).  As for the immortal Monroe, she is at her zenith here as the bubbly, vacuous, zowie-looking flapper looking for love in all the wrong places.  Despite her gold-digging instincts, Monroe's Sugar is cozy, vulnerable and altogether loveable, getting a lot of mileage too out of her solo singing spots, which include the kinetic ""Running Wild,"" the torchy ""I'm Through With Love,"" and her classic ""boop-boop-a-doop"" signature song, ""I Wanna Be Loved by You.""<br/><br/>The film is dotted with fun, atmospheric characters.   Pat O'Brien and George Raft both get to spoof their Warner Bros. stereotypes as cop vs. gangster, Joan Shawlee shows off a bit of her stinger as the by-the-rules bandleader Sweet Sue, Mike Mazurki overplays delightfully the archetypal dim-bulbed henchman, and, if I'm not mistaken, I think that's young Billy Gray of ""Father Knows Best"" fame (the role is not listed in the credits) playing a snappy, pint-sized bellhop who comes on strong with the ""girls.""<br/><br/>For those headscratchers who can't figure out why the so-called ""mild"" humor of ""Some Like It Hot"" is considered such a classic today, I can only presume that they have been brought up on, or excessively numbed by, the graphic, mindless toilet humor of present-day ""comedies.""  There was a time when going for a laugh had subtlety and purity - it relied on wit, timing, inventiveness and suggestion - not shock or gross-out value.  It's the difference between Sid Caesar and Andrew ""Dice"" Clay; between Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon and Chris Farley and David Spade; between ""I Love Lucy"" and ""Married With Children""; between Lemmon's novel use of maracas in the hilarious ""engagement"" sequence, and Cameron Diaz's use of hair gel in a scene that ANYBODY could have made funny.  Jack Lemmon could do more with a pair of maracas than most actors today could do with a whole roomful of props.  While ""Some Like It Hot"" bristles with clever sexual innuendo, today's ""insult"" comedies are inundated with in-your-face sexual assault which, after awhile, gets quite tiresome -- lacking any kind of finesse and leaving absolutely nothing to the imagination.  I still have hope...<br/><br/>Having ultimate faith in my fellow film devotees, THAT is why ""Some Like It Hot"" will (and should be) considered one of THE screwball classics of all time, and why most of today's attempts will (and should be) yesterday's news."

","In 1929, in Chicago, the musicians and friends Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) flees from the night-club where they are playing during a police raid. Without any money, they seek a job position for saxophone and bass players in another band and they are invited to play in a concert for one night only in a distant town. Joe borrows the car of a former girlfriend to travel and when they arrive in the parking garage, they witness the ""Saint Valentine's Day Massacre"" led by the infamous mobster Spats Columbo (George Raft). The criminals discover Joe and Jerry hidden in a corner and when the killers are ready to execute them, they succeed to escape. Joe and Jerry disguise, dressing like women and they head to Florida by train with an all-girl band using the names of Josephine and Daphne. They get close to singer Sugar Kane Kowalczyk (Marilyn Monroe) and Joe falls in love with her but she believes he is a woman. Meanwhile the millionaire Osgood Fielding III (Joe E. Brown) harasses Daphne inviting her to visit his yacht. When Spats and his henchmen arrive in the same hotel where Joe and Jerry are lodged for a mafia convention, the two musicians feel that they are in a dangerous situation.<br/><br/>Yesterday Tony Curtis died and I decided to watch ""Some Like it Hot"" again. This film is another masterpiece of Billy Wilder and certainly one of the best comedies of the cinema history. Jack Lemmon is hilarious and responsible for some of the funniest moments especially when Osgood flirts with Daphne. Marilyn Monroe performs the perfect dumb blonde stereotype. Last time I had seen this movie was on 18 August 2000. My vote is ten.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Quanto Mais Quente Melhor"" (""The Hotter, the Better"")"

","Some people still say this is the greatest comedy ever made in Hollywood. Who am I to argue? Even after 45 years, it's still very funny and not the least bit dated. It is one of the true classics in the history of film.<br/><br/>I know one thing: Marilyn Monroe never looked hotter!<br/><br/>The film is a wonderful combination of comedy, action, suspense and romance with great old-time gangster scenes played out first in Chicago and then in Miami Beach. George Raft and Nehimiah Persoff are just great as gangsters.<br/><br/>The stars, though, are Monroe, Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis but you can also enjoy performances from famous known actors like Pat O'Brien and Joe E. Brown. <br/><br/>The action scenes are in the beginning and end. In the middle, the bulk of the film, is the main story featuring comedy and romance. Lemmon has the best lines in the film and his facial expressions alone evoke lots of laughter.<br/><br/>This film is so famous that there is no need going into detail, but for some younger person reading this, don't worry about this being an old-fashioned, boring black-and-white film your parents or grandparents liked but you would find boring. You'll have fun watching this, too, I guarantee it."

","Legendary comedy masterpiece from filmmaker Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond that Won Oscar and another 13 wins & 8 nominations . Immensely charming comedy set among Chicago and Miami , being starred by an all-star-cast . When two unemployed musicians witness a mob hit , the St Valentine massacre in Chicago carried out by mobster chief (George Raft) they flee the state in an all female band disguised as women and headed for Florida , but further complications set in. There appears a gorgeous singer , Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe) , who is object of pursuit by the musicians (Jack Lemmon , Tony Curtis) who cannot reveal their identity because are dressed as women in order to getaway from killer gangsters' retaliation . <br/><br/>Rightly enjoyable and fun-filled , milestone comedy which neatly combines humor , mirth , entertaining situations and amusement . This noisy comedy is intelligently and pleasingly written to gives us lots of fun , laughters and smiles . Mordantly funny , though by time of premiere was rated as bad taste and some discomfort ; however , is todays considered a real classic movie . Billy Wilder kept the studio Paramount happy , the picture consistently made money and was hit at box office . Flawless comedy with a trio of sensational protagonists , including an unforgettable Marilyn who parades sexily at her best and more relaxed and enticing than ever . The hit of the show is undoubtedly for the fetching Marilyn Monroe who gives one of the best screen acting and sings marvelous songs as ¨Running wild¨, ¨I'm through with love¨ and the immortal ¨I wanna be loved you¨. Magnificent performances from Jack Lemmon as angst-ridden musician dressed in drag and sensational Tony Curtis as a philander young , playing his Gary Gray Grant impression . Furthermore , a splendid secondary cast , a variety of notorious actors who make sympathetic interpretations such as Pat O'Brien , George Raft , Mike Mazurski , Nehemia Persoff and , of course, smitten Joe E Brown , including his now-classic closing line . <br/><br/>The motion picture was very well directed by Billy Wilder who includes several punchlines . Billy was one of the best directors of history . In 1939 started the partnership with Charles Bracket on such movies as ¨Ninotchka¨ , ¨Ball of fire¨ , making their film debut as such with ¨Major and the minor¨ . ¨Sunset Boulevard¨ was their last picture together before they split up . Later on , Billy collaborated with another excellent screenwriter IAL Diamond . Both of them won an Academy Award for ¨Stalag 17¨ dealing with a POW camp starred by William Holden . After that , they wrote/produced/directed such classics as ¨Ace in the hole¨ , the touching romantic comedy ¨Sabrina¨ , the Hickcoktian courtroom puzzle game ¨Witness for the prosecution¨ and two movies with the great star Marilyn Monroe , the warmth ¨Seven year itch¨ and this ¨Some like hot¨. All of them include screenplays that sizzle with wit . But their biggest success and highpoint resulted to be the sour and fun ¨¨The apartment¨. Subsequently in the 60s and 70s , the duo fell headlong into the pit , they realized nice though unsuccessful movies as ¨Buddy buddy¨ ,¨Fedora¨ , ¨Front page¨ and ¨Secret life of Sherlock Holmes¨, though the agreeable ¨Avanti¨ slowed the decline . The team had almost disappeared beneath a wave of bad reviews and failures . ¨Some like hot¨ rating : Above average , essential and indispensable watching ; extremely funny and riveting film and completely entertaining . It justly deserves its place among the best comedy ever made . One of the very funniest films of all time and to see and see again . It's the kind of movie where you know what's coming but , because the treatment , enjoy it all the same ."

","What Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis do in ""Some Like it Hot"" would be par for the course in modern movies  every other month, similar fish-out-of-water movies premiere with men posing as women (""Tootsie""), women posing as men (""The Associate""), black people posing as white people (""White Chicks""), and on and on. What makes ""Some Like it Hot"" different is two things: the strength of its comedy, and the presence of Marilyn Monroe, then at the height of stardom.<br/><br/>Lemmon and Curtis turn in admirable performances both as Joe and Jerry, and as Josephine and Daphne. Tony Curtis does Lemmon one better by creating a third identity, ""Junior"", in order to woo Sugar Kane (Monroe).<br/><br/>Tying the pair's story into the Chicago Valentine's Day Massacre, where a gang war spilled over into a parking garage, leaving a number of people lined up against the wall and shot, is a deft touch (though the serious tone of these gang sequences contrasts sharply with the bulk of the movie).<br/><br/>The movie does an excellent job building the far-fetched stakes of the movie ever-higher, from their finding refuge from vengeful gangs in a women's jazz band, to their showdown in the Florida hotel, to the eventual revealing of Curtis' and Lemmon's identities. The movie's surprisingly suggestive and risque content is at odds with the time frame of the movie, and even with the period of the movie's creation. The many smart double-entendres and plays on words are very well-written, and alternate between lowbrow and highbrow comedy,<br/><br/>The films only fault might be a couple of overlong musical numbers, performed either by the whole band or soloed by Sugar Kane. Though to be expected in a Marilyn Monroe film, these musical acts are literal ""show stoppers"" that bring the comedic momentum of the film to a screeching halt. However, it is easy to over look these minor defects in the movie as a whole, because by and large it is quite funny  no wonder it s considered a classic  and after all, ""nobody's perfect""."
"silva-w-pius","9","13","14","4 January 2014"," Marilyn Monroe. Enough said.
","""Movies should be like amusement parks"" filmmaker Billy Wilder once said ""People should go to them to have fun"". So If Some Like It Hot was an amusement park: it would Thorpe Park, mixed in with Legoland, added with a dash of Disney land. Some Like It Hot is the granddaddy of comedies, the Godfather of laughs and the Mike Tyson of punch lines. Heck! Watching this film is like getting into the ring with Muhammad Ali, as you're constantly hit with fast paced gags. Even when you're least expecting it you're hit with a punch line so funny it leaves your side aching, or a piece of slapstick comedy that leaves your eyes running. Even the fade out line has been regarded as the funniest and most famous in history. Once you hear it, you'll guarantee never ever, ever to forget it. Trust me, it's hilarious! <br/><br/>After playing witness to a routine gangland shooting, two penniless Chicago musicians, Joe and jerry decide it is the perfect opportunity, to remain safe and get paid a easy buck when they decide to take up residence in an all girl band heading to Florida, crossed-dressed as Josephine (Tony Curtis) and Daphne (Jack Lemmon). But with the only simple aim of getting paid and avoiding the mob, things soon get a little more tricky when a ditsy singer named Sugar (Marilyn Monroe) captures the heart of' Josephine' and a eccentric playboy millionaire falls for 'Daphne'.<br/><br/>Some Like It Hot is one of those rare occasions, where everyone involved is at the very peak of their powers. Billy Wilder's directing is subtle but instrumental in loading every scene with comedic material ready to pop out like a wound up jack in the box. The writing is excellent, it constantly moves at a furious pace. Imagine Usain bolt on roller blades with jet pack attached to his back, and still that's not even as fast as how the dialogue rips through every scene. People may say that the comedy is too high concept, but for me that's the very reason it's so damn funny , as well a begin genius, because it means that the jokes will stand the test of time and span all generations because it's so easy to understand. Anyway who likes having jokes explained to them? No one! <br/><br/>But you can't talk about Some Like It Hot, without mentioning Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon, who were absolutely perfect for their roles, each adding a feeling of assuredness to theirs, as well as bucket full's of originality with every facial expression as well as every line. Initially I was not convinced by Marilyn Monroe, as I felt she was slightly overrated, but in her role as Sugar, she brings a lot of composure to the role adding balance to the high energy of Tony and Jack, but still getting her laughs not through straight jokes but by simply being able to deliverer every air headed line with great delivery and timing. Whilst still being able to remain sweet, helpless and innocent, even as she plunges picks into a solid cube of ice with great fury, as she talks about her weakness for Saxophone players. <br/><br/>Some Like It Hot it like a magician of comedy, you never know what to expect next, as with every new scene you so excitedly anticipate what piece of comedic magic it will pull out of its sleeve. For me Some Like It Hot is the funniest comedy film I have ever seen, even though it is almost 55 years old, its comedy is still so accessible and funny too!"

","With Billy Wilder's steady direction, the great casting, and Wilder/Diamond's sparkling script Some Like It Hot has become one of the most enjoyed comedies of cinema history. The story itself is pure comedy gold; the unhappy jazz-musicians Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) are witness to the St. Valentine massacre in 1929 and flees from Chicago with an all-girl-band who's headed for Miami, dressed up as ""Josephine"" and ""Daphne"". Soon both are hooked on Sugar Kane (Marylin Monroe), the band's lead singer - but things gets more complicated when arrived in Miami, Daphne attracts a elderly playboy and the gangster of Chicago arrives at the Floria-hotel to have a mafia-meeting.<br/><br/>The work of the three participants in center is truly great; Marylin Monroe is at her most sexy and charming, Tony Curtis' brilliant control and Jack Lemmon is truly priceless at his peak. The movie paces fantastically throughout opening scenes of Chicago, onto the train-ride (features fantastically funny moments of brilliant comedy timing) and arriving at the hotel in Florida, and the situations that occurs with the band, with playboy Osgood Fielding III, Marylin Monroe and the mafia. And Billy Wilder shows his talent with keeping such a sparkling screenplay brilliantly paced and edited, never rushing itself - and Wilder sneaks in some fine moments of noir with the Chicago-gangsters brutality and cruelness. And the movie is a altogether different experience as a comedy than anything before it, the absurdity and quirkiness of Curtis and Lemmon in a transvestite-comedy is fantastically funny, and the final dialog between Osgood Fielding and Daphne/Jerry seemingly came out of the blue, and surprised me just as much today as it did back in 1959. Some Like It Hot is nothing less than a must-see in comedy, and cinema history."

","I was never one of those kids who watched Star Wars over 100 times (actually just once or twice) and find that even the moves I rate in my top twenty can only bear watching a couple of times a year. This is the exception.<br/><br/>Every time I watch this film, I notice something else that makes me laugh - I cannot think of a weak performance or a dodgy line.<br/><br/>I love the fact that George Raft gives the impression that he was not told that it was a comedy and plays the chief mobster completely straight. Contrasting this with the silliness of some of his underlings is priceless stuff, though rarely slapstick (homage to Cagney aside).<br/><br/>Ultimately it's the tight and witty script matched by an excellent cast that makes this film a pleasure for me."

Fleeing for their lives, they disguise themselves as female musicians in order to get to Florida and away from the mob. This is where the fun begins.<br/><br/>Renamed ""Daphne"" and ""Josephine"" they try their best to keep their secret. But when ""Josephine""(Curtis) meets sexy ukulele player Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe) you know he's going to blow his cover somehow. While Curtis tries to woo Monroe by pretending to be her dream man as she has told him, Lemmon is courted by Osgood Fielding (Joe E. Brown). Curtis adapts a Cary Grant accent and pretends to be frigid in the movie's funniest scenes. Lemmon seems to forget he's a boy and has so much fun with Fielding and adores the things he buys him. Between the cases of mistaken and pretend identities, the mobsters come to Florida for their Opera Lovers Meeting. It all winds up with a hilarious ending.<br/><br/>This movie is a gem from start to finish. Curtis, Monroe, and Brown are great in their parts. Monroe brings a funny and sexy vulnerability to Sugar and Curtis is great with his performance as ""Josephine"" and the stuffy millionaire who talks just like Cary Grant. Lemmon really steals the movie here. He invests Daphne with such enthusiasm that we can understand why he's falling for Osgood. He's having way too much fun and it's great to watch him.

","Some Like it Hot will have a Danish re-premiere on Marilyn Monroes 75th birthday June 1st 2001, and making the text for some advertising material in that connection I saw the movie again and liked it more than ever. Most comedies about men in womens' clothings have a vulgar humour. This is, of course, not the case for films like ""Tootsie"" and ""Some Like it Hot"" in which Billy Wilder using black and white instead of colours turns down the importance of the change of sex in many ways so that you can concentrate on the comedy which is extraordinarily well timed with a spiritual dialogue. The acting of Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis, and Marilyn Monroe, not to mention Joe E Brown, Pat O'Brien and George Raft is out of this world, and of course it is possible to make a mafia war comical. Some scenes almost remind you of a Marx Brothers' movie. Like when a small berth in a train sleeping car in a few seconds is overcrowded with beautiful girls mixing Manhattan-drinks in their hot-water bottle while Jack Lemmon is desperately trying to remind himself that -- just then -- he is a girl, and Marilyn Monroe in seconds (with her back towards the camera!) produces perfect small, square ice-cubes out of a huge ice block. The music is enchanting like the Marilyn Monroe-songs which are all so well known."

","A comedy about cross-dressing is a surprising choice of subject matter for Billy Wilder, who is best known for his film noir morality tales. But his knack for multi-layered dialogue and sardonic humor work just as well here as in his more serious films. The premise of ""Some Like it Hot"" is absurd, and if there were no genuine laughs then the behavior of Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon's characters might easily come across as obnoxious and offensive. But there are laughs, and they come so rapidly and so often at the expense of the lead characters that these pitfalls are averted.

Curtis and Monroe have great chemistry together, and Lemmon is superb as the comedy relief in the ""serious"" scenes with George Raft. Even these are something to laugh at, but the film is not to be taken seriously; just to be laughed at. It has been almost fifty years since it was released and people still laugh at it.

","What can you say about this movie that has not been said before?<br/><br/>
A genuine classic, the basics run as follows... Marilyn Monroe, Tony Curtis and the ever-fabulous Jack Lemmon...... the boys do drag, Marilyn sings occaisionally, looks edible in practically see-through dresses AND acts well to boot...<br/><br/>
Lemmon and Curtis play musicians accidentally caught up in the St Valentine's Day Massacre... they go on the run in the only band which will hire them - an all female band which means their only option is to drag up and bluff their way along - and meet up with marginally alcoholic and slightly unhinged Marilyn.. some chaos ensues as Curtis tries to woo her and Lemmon unwillingly finds a suitor for himself... <br/><br/>The film is surprisingly touching in places but is basically a lovely silly comedy. It regularly appears in lists proclaiming it to be one of the 100 best movies of all time and quite rightly so. Marilyn - despite suffereing a miscarriage during filming - is on superb form, Jack Lemmon looks almost attractive in drag and Tony Curtis actually avoids being too slimy and annoying. The drag scenes are wonderfully underplayed and the classy use of black and white photography throughout helps make both the drag and the period setting look plausible.<br/><br/>
Highlights include Tony Curtis's Cary Grant impression (for those of you uneducated in the fabulousness of Cary Grant check out Bringing Up Baby, also on this term), Jack Lemmon being romanced in great style - which leads to just about the best last line of a movie of all time - and Marilyn looking glorious of course.<br/><br/>If you've never seen this movie you really really should; if you already have then I am sure you need no persuasion to see it again!"

One film which always features though, and remains perhaps the funniest comedy of all time is Billy Wilder's ""Some Like It Hot"". With magical performances and some of the greatest comedy moments of all time, it remains as fresh today as it did upon it's release.<br/><br/>Joe and Jerry (Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon) are down and broke musicians in alcohol free Chicago. As the Mafia continue to fight between themselves, life goes on for our two heroes. That is until they witness a Gangland killing. Now on the run, they disguise themselves as women and hide in a female band troop. Relocated to Florida, the two spend their time keeping themselves hidden and talking to the beautiful, yet ""not too smart"" Sugar Cane (Marilyn Monroe).<br/><br/>Unlucky to have been released at the same time as the Epic ""Ben Hur"", it might be one of the biggest travesties in Oscar history that ""Some Like It Hot"" never received a Best Picture nomination. It did however receives nods for Wilder's direction and Lemmon's acting. Lemmon in particular is superb as Jerry/Daphne, the more emotional of the two men, who finds himself being chased by the dozy Osgood Fielding III (Joe E Brown). With some of the best lines in the film, Lemmon thrives, and on a personal note, he's only outperformed this performance with ""Avanti"" and ""The Odd Couple"", the first of which being another Wilder creation.<br/><br/>This film also has another treasure about it. In a time where Hollywood starlets are making a bit of a reappearance, it's amusing that one or two of them (most notably Scarlett Johansson) model their appearance on the biggest starlet of them all. Whilst noticeably more built up during this film (being pregnant at the time), Marilyn Monroe is beautiful from the first scene on the train station through to the end. Monroe simply oozes beauty and thrives in a role which she wasn't originally the choice for.<br/><br/>Perhaps the crucial thing about ""Some Like It Hot"" is just how good the script is. With lines which just smack of sexual referencing, it causes belly laughs throughout. It never resorts to the sort of lowbrow humour of most of our modern comedy, and it demonstrates how light hearted comedy should be done. It's perhaps the finest comedy film of all time, and it should be mandatory viewing for any film fan."
"hsm2310","8","7","8","2 October 2012"," Some Like It Hot - The Classical Comedy
","There is always a thing about Classics, even before you absorb the first frame; you are burdened with huge expectations. But, Some Like It Hot is one of those jet planes where you got to tight your seat belt and forget everything else to enjoy the joyride or you would fall off your seat.<br/><br/>I feel casting in a movie is one of the most under discussed elements of movie making amongst general public but it plays a very significant role in the success of a movie and SLIH is the prime example of it. Apart from Jack Lemmon, none of the protagonists were known for their superior acting skills and they would not have made the cut for a Billy Wilder piece. But, in retrospect, who other than Tony Curtis who had a boyish look and at the same time possessed sharp features could have played a saxophone playing woman charmer who could cross dress to be a part of a woman band. You can only get a flawless performance from a bad actor only if he/she is playing himself/herself and that is the exact reason why Marilyn Monroe wows you in every scene of Some Like It Hot. She is playing a dumb, vivacious and vulnerable damsel who can sing, doesn't mind sleeping with a charming guy whenever she gets a chance and then dips herself in a whiskey bottle when left all alone with herself. Jack Lemmon with a broad muscular jawline was surely the one who had a better chance of getting caught as someone not in the right clothes, but that is very small price to pay, as an actor of his caliber was indispensable to the cause of SLIH. He has an amazing sense of timing when it comes to humor; he is almost chaplinesque when it comes to expressions and the confidence with which he delivers his lines puts him right at the top of stack.<br/><br/>I am not sure when was the concept of black humor introduced in the world of cinema, but, SLIH has to be one of the better examples from the old times where black humor is integrated in the comedy. The black humor is there only to make its presence felt and nothing more. Other than that SLIH is a fun filled journey of Gerald (Lemmon) and Joseph (Curtis), two musicians on the run from dangerous Chicago gangsters who are after their lives. They find their safe house in an all-woman band that is off to Florida for a string of performances. This is where they meet the gorgeous Sugar (Marilyn) and try their luck on flattering her. It is all about how Joseph manages to get ahead in the race and Gerald like a true friend tags along without any explaining or pleading by Joseph. This is what makes SLIH sweet. The necessary salt is added to the movie by little moments like women having a party on train, Sugar hiding whiskey in her stocking, Fielding (Joe Brown) hitting on Dalphe (Gerald disguised as a woman) and further complications that set in because of these. What makes this classical comedy special is the fact that it makes you laugh at so many occasions without being slapstick or cheap or using the chaos technique. And when it doesn't make you laugh, it makes you smile. Most importantly, the movie stays with you.<br/><br/>The manner in which the movie begins, it suddenly makes you wonder - that's too much of real car chasing and shooting for a black and white movie of 40's and then you realize it's done in 1959 and the movie was intentionally produced in black and white. The first scene itself is a cracker and will create a cocktail of emotions, with words like liquor, crime, party, death, music all floating around at the same time. There are plenty of scenes where the camera pans out from one object to another capturing multiple things with different moods and complexion in the same scene and that is a technique which I guess wasn't used quite frequently back then. Make-up job of Curtis and Lemmon is too good for those times and it would have been so important for that to have been correctly done as that is absolutely central to the whole plot. Marilyn's costumes are way modern and she carries them effortlessly.<br/><br/>Some Like It Hot is without any doubt a classic but, probably in no other movie would have the last line played such an important role as in this. The finishing frames where Joe Brown utters the unexpected leave you pleasantly surprised and I am sure it would have had far better impact on the audience 50 years back."
"jem132","10","11","14","20 May 2006"," Gender-bending fun!..
","...But there's more to 'Some Like It Hot' than just it's cross-dressing element. This is a terrific comedy farce that may just well be the funniest film ever made (AFI certainly agrees with me, naming 'Some Like It Hot' as the No.1 comedy of all time in their list).<br/><br/>So many great gags and an unbelievably witty script filled with double entendres are just some of the reasons to watch this. Lemmon gives maybe his greatest comedy performance, in the deliciously over-the-top role of Jerry/Daphne. Lemmon's completely uninhibited performance in drag works well with Tony Curtis' more self-conscious Joe/Josephine. Today the modern viewer sees this film with many homosexual overtones, but the film-makers made a point to stress the pair's heterosexuality in this film. They are given a very good reason to be in drag- they are on the run from mob bosses after witnessing the St Valentine's Day massacre. Disguised as female musicians, they join an all-girls band and meet boozy singer Sugar (Monroe).<br/><br/>Without Monroe's performance (difficultly elicited from her), this film would not be half the classic it is today. Her presence illuminated every film she was in, and her dumb-blonde demeanor belied a great acting talent. Marilyn certainly is great here as the floozy Sugar Kane who is lonely and on the look for love.<br/><br/>Joe E. Brown has a lot of fun with his role as a rich millionaire who falls in love Lemmon's Daphne. He also gets the best line of the film. George Raft appears to be sending himself and his suspected gangster connections up in his role as Spats Colombo, the mob boss who wants Lemmon and Curtis fixed up.<br/><br/>Very sexy dialogue, costumes from Monroe (pretty much see-through!) and the gender-bending turns from the boys combine for great fun, but some forget how Wilder achieved the great atmosphere of this film. He made a conscious decision to shoot in black-and-white not only to lessen the impact of two males playing women, but for authenticity. This is set in 1929, and Wilder wanted the gritty feel of the Prohibition-era. One is reminded of Hawks' 'Scarface' in a number of scenes (this could also be due to the presence of Raft), and there are many gags referring to the historical period. Watch the mentions of Valentino, Pickford, Fairbanks and Wall Street and you'll see what I mean.<br/><br/>Loads and loads of FUN! 10/10."

","A Comedy that has it all, and lacks absolutely nothing. ""Nobody's perfect"" may be an inherent truism, but ""Some Like it Hot"" is a definite somebody in the universe of cinema, thus it IS perfect in every sense. Swing, sex and slapstick, (three words that immediately come to mind when trying to describe it) , are a mix so delicious, so fruitful in its possibilities that one cannot imagine a film which can live up to them, and yet this one does. Marilyn, her trademark, displeasingly infantile voice aside, is a bombshell of thermonuclear dimensions, whose powers of titillation will not expire so long as there are hormones and/or Viagra. The sexual content, for socio-historical reasons cannot be as explicit as we've come to expect, but there's still plenty of it, from Monroe's see-through outfit to the double entendre worthy of the Farelli Brothers (""What do I do if it's an emergency ? - Pull the emergency break!"" ), including overtly gay themes that have a cult following of their own. The Lemmon/Curtis duo operates with gleeful, unrestrained vitality that can only be likened to Chaplin in his heyday. Though not a Musical, the combustive energy of this movie is so stimulating it almost makes you get up and dance."

","The Great Famous as well as the Great Infamous occurrences in a nation's history are and always will be looked upon as subjects worthy of a film treatment. Whether an incident were to be filmed from a story and its screenplay form written directly for the screen or an adaptation of a Novel, a Short Story or a Stage Play, they are an important element of formulating our image of our World. Right or wrong, it is a fact of life and one that we must learn to live with.<br/><br/>A good example of just what we are driving at is the occurrences of October 26, 1881 in Tombstone, Arizona. Known as ""The Gunfight at O.K. Corral"", the incident is probably the best known single shoot-em-up incident in the History of the Old West. Countless references are made to it in our Western Movies, be they Major Motion Pictures or the ""B"" Picture Series of the Matinée & Bubble Gum Set.<br/><br/>Equally as familiar to the movie going public and probably the best known example of Urban Gangster violence of the 'Lawless Prohibition/Gangster Era, ""The St.Valentine's Day Massacre"" has been given Film treatment many times. It is featured in the Rod Steiger's Starring Title Role as AL CAPONE (Allied Artists, 1959).<br/><br/>Director Roger Corman gave us THE ST. VALENTINE'S DAY MASSACRE (Los Altos Productions / 20th Century-Fox, 1967); devoting the entire 100 minutes of screen time to the behind the scenes incidents leading up to it and to the Great Mass Murder.<br/><br/>With Ben Gazzara in the title role, we had CAPONE (Santa Fe Productions/ 20th Century-Fox, 1975), also which had the Massacre and its preparation and aftermath as central events in the story.<br/><br/>With the dramatic come the comedies, spoofs, comedians, the social commentators and the satirists. There surely would be a comedy that would at least make mention of the Massacre in passing.<br/><br/>And it happened. Producer/co-Writer/Director Billy Wilder gave us SOME LIKE IT HOT (Ashton Prod./Mirisch Corp.-United Artists, 1959). To a hilariously great script, Directot Wilder added plenty of Hollywood Star Power in Miss Marilyn Monroe, Mr. Tony Curtis and Mr. Jack Lemmon. In supporting position, we saw the likes of veteran, old pros like Joe E. Brown (as Millionaire Osgood Fielding III), George Raft (as 'Spats' Colombo), Pat O'Brien (as Detective Mulligan), Nehimiah Persoff (as Little Boneparte), Joan Shawlee (Sweet Sue), Billy Gray (Sig Pokikoff), George E. Stone (Toothpick Charley), Mike Mazurki (Spats' Henchman), Dave Barry (Beinstock), Harry Wilson (Spats Henchman), Beverly Wills (Delores), Barbara Drew (Nellie), Edward G. Robinson, Jr. (Johnny Paradise), Al Brenamen (Bell Hop), Pat Comiskey (Spats' Henchman), Tom Kennedy (Bouncer), Paul Frees (Funeral Director Mozerella & ""Josephine""-Voices), Joe Gray (Mobster at Banquet), Harold 'Tommy' Hart (Official #2), Ted Hook (Official #1), John Indisano (Waiter), Jack McClure (Spats Henchman), Helen Perry (Rosella) and Marian Collier (Clarinet Player, Olga) and Joan Fields, Mary Foley, Penny McGuiggin, Laura Mitchell, Colleen O'Sullivan (Band Members All).<br/><br/>OUR STORYIn a nutshell, its 1929, Prohibition is in full swing in a defiant Chicago. Two struggling and apparently over-sexed Musicians, Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) narrowly missed being arrested in a Police Raid on a Speak Easy run by big time Hoodlum, 'Spats' Columbo (George Raft). Obtaining a 'Gig' to play t the University of Illinois Dance in Champaign-Urbana, over 100 miles to the South of Chicago. Borrowing a Car from a Girlfriend of Joe's, they have the Bad Luck of being present at the Clark Street Garage when the mass killings take place.<br/><br/>In order to escape being snuffed-out for witnessing the deed, the two masquerade as Women and join up with A Band made up of all Lady Musicians and (Woo, woo, woo, woo!) Singer, Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe). The Band is heading out of the snowy, Chicago Winter for the ""safety"" of Sunny, Florida. That is ""safety"", until 'Spats' and his Boys, show up in the Sunshine State for the Convention of ""Friends of Italian Opera"", which is code for the Crime Syndicate! The fun continues.<br/><br/>The film is wild, fast paced and cleverly written. It has guaranteed laughs through-out. Mr. Wilder and Company, have constructed a sort of cross between the old James Cagney/Humphrey Bogart feature, THE ROARING TWENTIES (Warner Brothers, 1939) and a Mack Sennett Silent Keystone Comedy. They get us Laughing and keep it that way.<br/><br/>The filming used the City of Coronado in Suburban San Diego, as the location doubling for an unavailable State of Florida. Both the beautiful Coronado Beach and the 1920's styled Coronado Hotel were put to use to great effect.<br/><br/>And just one more thing before we signoff for now. Of all the veteran players appearing in the movie, it is the fine performance of Mr. Joe E. Brown which steals more than his share of the film. Joe E. Brown had his hey day in a series of comedies done I the 1930's and had been relegated to supporting riles since then. The role of eccentric Millionaire Osgood Fielding III, who finds himself attracted to 'Daphne', the Bull Fiddle Player (Jack Lemmon).<br/><br/>And it is Joe E. Brown who speaks the memorable last line of dialogue, which is, no, no! I won't tell! If you don't know, buy it or rent it; but see it! Don't wait another Day!"

","This is the first Marilyn Monroe movie that I have seen and I must say that I thought it was quite funny. Monroe, though, doesn't have the screen presence that most people seem to claim that she has. In fact, I wasn't really sure if it was her when she first appeared. Okay, this movie is more focused on Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis, and they actually have more presence than she does, but she does stand out.<br/><br/>Lemmon and Curtis play a couple of musicians, Joe and Jerry, who watch a gangland killing, and after escaping with their lives, they dress up as women, becoming Josephine and Daphne, and join a band going to Miami. On the way Joe falls in love with the singer, Sugar Kane, (Monroe) and Daphne ends up gaining the unwanted attention of a dizzy millionaire.<br/><br/>The comedy in this movie actually has a lot of sexual innuendos, and in my opinion, is far superior to that of Tootsie. In a way the plot is similar, and the problems that the characters in both movies encounter are also the same, but the difference is that I feel that the comedy in Some Like it Hot is executed much better than it was in Tootsie. In a way, Tootsie seemed to be a comedy with a message that became far too preachy, while Some Like it Hot is a farcical romp in which two men try to hide the fact that they are not women from a lot of other people."
"tomaslenero","9","3","3","18 November 2013"," One of the Best Comedies
","Some Like It Hot<br/><br/>Some Like It Hot is an excellent movie, which was made in 1959, and still today is one of the best comedies created. It is so good that the fact that it is made in black and white is completely forgotten. Billy Wilder directed the movie, and the cast included such stars as Marilyn Monroe, Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis. Also this movie won an Academy Award for the Best Costume Design, Black and White, the reason why it says black and white is because at the time movies could already be made with color, so the award were divided between color, and black and white.<br/><br/>The movie is set in 1927, and it is about two musicians who find themselves unemployed, and go searching for a job. Both found a job on girls band and this made it impossible for them to take it, so they got another job, and while getting into the car both men Joe (Tony Curtis), and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) were witnesses of a murder committed by the Chicago mafia. Being witness of this incident both Joe, and Jerry must leave and hide from the mafia, which is looking for them because of what they had witnessed before. Joe and Jerry decide to take the job of the girl's band and disguise themselves as girls, so that they could enter the band without any problems. From the point where both men enter the train with the rest of the girls the rest of the movie is an extremely comic journey.<br/><br/>The movie's main Characters were Joe, or Josephine, Jerry, or Daphne, and Sugar Kane. Joe and Josephine were both made by Tony Curtis and he fitted perfectly for both characters due to his personality, he was a very comic part of the movie and made an exceptional job. Jerry and Daphne were both acted by Jack Lemmon and he was also brilliant in the movie and fitted his role perfectly and in my opinion was more comic than Tony Curtis in the movie. Both Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon were vital in the creation of this movie; definitely the movie wouldn't have been the same without these two magnificent actors. Then, there was Sugar Kane which was interpreted by Hollywood star Marilyn Monroe, she was the perfect women for the role due to the fact that Sugar Kane was a very beautiful woman, the character of Sugar Kane represented in a way a very materialist and woman and with alcoholic problems.<br/><br/>In my opinion on of the best scenes of the movie is when Joe is dressed as a wealthy man and is with Sugar Kane at the yacht while Daphne is dancing with a rich man names Osgood who is in love with ""her"", and doesn't really know she is really a he. A scene, which I didn't like, was at the beginning when Joe and Jerry are looking for jobs, I found that part of the movie kind of slow and bored me for a little moment.<br/><br/>Some Like It Hot was a risky movie due to the fact that men were transforming themselves into women, and at the time to watch this was not very common. Curtis Hanson, a director, said: ""It's a film about sex from the title to the final line. It's not just about sex as in people having sex; it's also about sexual roles, and of course sexual identity."" The fact that both men dressed as women and all those problems came in was pretty funny and this movie was not only a romantic comedy because of the love between Joe and Sugar Kane, but it is also a screwball, and gangster movie. Screwball because of everything that happens throughout the movie, and gangster because of all the mafia issued shown in the film.<br/><br/>I believe that this movie would be good for any kind of audience because it is a great comedy and it will make anyone laugh and have a great time. I really enjoyed this movie and wouldn't doubt of watching it once more. <br/><br/>I would give this movie a 4.7/5<br/><br/>This review was written by a sophomore who enjoys watching movies and loves anything related to comedy. This move review was written for an film appreciation class."

","Some Like it Hot is a screwball comedy about two musicians somehow getting mixed up with a Chicago crime syndicate and their attempt to run away from them. They end up disguising themselves as girls in order to land a gig with an all girl band in Florida. Along the way, they meet an attractive, innocent girl, who has a tendency to fall for sax players, and attempt to charm her. Things get when complicated when the syndicate arrives in Florida for some other event and paths of the musicians and the gang cross again.<br/><br/>Tony Curtis as the ever-optimistic Joe and Jack Lemmon as the frank and jocular Jerry were both delightful in their portrayals. Their on-screen chemistry constitutes the heart of the movie as they land themselves in awkward situations and wriggle their way out with the help of some cunning and fortune. Marilyn Monroe as the dim and naive Sugar Kane Kowalczyk, is the central character around which the plot rotates. It is almost impossible not to fall for her as she is ever so attractive and yet so innocent in character. There are times when one forgets about the movie and is enchanted by her presence on screen, her singing at the band's performance and the scene on the yacht being two of them. Joe E Brown as Osgood, puts in a hearty performance as the love seeking rich oldie who would go to any lengths to win Daphne's heart. He provides the fitting end to the movie with the iconic ""Nobody's Perfect"". <br/><br/>The on screen camaraderie between Joe and Jerry, as they bicker along the way and yet never leave each other in times of trouble, is what makes this movie special. Joe as an esoteric millionaire who has a 'problem', Osgood has the doting lover infatuated with Daphne, and Daphne as the light hearted and carefree maiden who finds herself in perplexing situations , are three characters that give life to this brisk paced comedy. The most hilarious scene though has to be the post dates scene where Jerry's incredible contemplation of a love affair and future life with Osgood is discussed, leaving the audience in fits of laughter.<br/><br/>Overall, Billy Wilder's Some Like it Hot is a wonderful comedy that has all the ingredients for an all time classic."
"ferguson-6","8","3","3","12 October 2012"," Jell-O on Springs
","Greetings again from the darkness. Billy Wilder's classic was the latest in the comedy series sponsored by Dallas Film Society and Dallas Morning News. It is almost always ranked as one of the top comedy films of all-time, and often the best ever. While that's a bit higher than I would rank it, there is little doubt that it has earned its enduring place in cinematic history. To fully understand the impact of the film, it helps to remind yourself of the times ... it was filmed more than 50 years ago. What we might call tame today, was incredibly risqué and daring for the times.<br/><br/>What really stands out while watching the film is just what an incredible screen presence Marilyn Monroe possessed. It is quite challenging to take your eyes off her during any of her scenes. I am at a loss to come up with any other actor or actress who even comes close to this level of camera-cornering. Greta Garbo and Marlon Brando were great, but Marilyn is transcendent while on screen. Of course, the reports of her personal issues are legendary. Supposedly on this film, she was constantly 2-3 hours late, couldn't remember her lines and had to be coddled by all involved. Still, the final product is stunning and director Billy Wilder understood that no other actress could be substituted. Sadly, Marilyn only made two more films and was dead 3 years after this film was released.<br/><br/>As wonderful as Marilyn is, this is really the story of Joe and Jerry, or Josephine and Daphne, or even Junior. Those five characters are all played with crackling comedy timing by Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon. Lemmon, as Daphne, is especially terrific as he tango's the night away with Osgood Fielding III (played by Joe E Brown). Curtis is at his best when courting Marilyn's Sugar Kane while sporting his Cary Grant impersonation and driving the boat backwards.<br/><br/>There are so many classic comedy moments in this film, and though it is based on a 1935 French farce titled Fanfare d'Amour, Wilder and his co-writer and frequent collaborator I.A.L. Diamond made it their own by adding the gangster story line. Seeing notorious movie bad guy George Raft tied to the 1929 Chicago St Valentine's Day Massacre adds a dimension that many writers/directors would be unable to handle. Instead, Wilder adds his frenetic dialogue and mixes in some wild double-entendre's, a touch of Marx Brothers, and the sensuous singing of Marilyn to deliver a world class comedy.<br/><br/>The Florida scenes were filmed at the historical Hotel del Coronado in San Diego, which remains a very popular resort location even today. Marilyn sings ""I Wanna Be Loved By You"" and ""I'm Through With Love"" in such a way that her character's naivety adds a dimension that breaks the heart of Joe (Curtis) and mesmerizes the viewer. Billy Wilder is certainly one of the Hollywood giants and delivered such classics as Sunset Blvd, The Apartment, Irma laDouce, and Witness for the Prosecution. His excellence spans numerous film genres, and we admire his patience and proficiency in juggling the issues required to pull off Some Like it Hot ... and avoid the fuzzy end of the lollipop."

","I went to see this because of Marilyn Monroe. Of course I was not disappointed. She is not as dumb as she describes herself is.

Then, when they pose as women it was so amusing and pleasant! <br/><br/>Yet their performance would not have been so engaging if not for the witty lines and intriguing plot. There is literally not a dull moment throughout the whole movie. The plot develops very well and the pacing was just right. <br/><br/>Although the Osgood Fielding III character (Joe Brown) seems to be annoying in the beginning, he turns out to be instrumental in later part of the story and the heartily conversation in perfect tempo between him and Lemmon on the speed boat is so memorable.<br/><br/>Some Like it Hot is perfect in all sense: acting, script, direction, costume (Oh how Monroe's dresses keep me gazing), music. It is such a classic that we will probably never have anything like this for a long, long time."

Plenty of laughs involved. MM was a really good comedienne but most just remember her full figure (not quite the ideal by early C21st standards but terrific for the 1950s though surpassed by France's less voluptuous but more sexy BeBe and Grace Kelly's superb cool beauty).

But it uses Monroe in ways that greatly exceed her ability to use herself. I believe that the Monroe legend is because of Wilder's placing of her in a context that amplified her appeal. <br/><br/>Wilder had worked with her before. He selected and co-wrote the screenplay around her, adapting as he went.<br/><br/>The situation is set up to provide a context of shifting sexual identity so that she can anchor the thing with us concluding that yes, this is sex. This is what it means to be a desirable woman.<br/><br/>And its not just the obvious things, the drag identities. Its in the girl jazz band. The machine gunner jumping out of a cake instead of a stripper, the business of a funeral really being a party, the henpecked manager: pronounced ""beanstalk."" Even in boozing out of a hot water bottle.<br/><br/>Its so deft in structure, so accommodating to her strengths and weaknesses, that it makes me cry, knowing that Wilder only was tuned properly for two films. And this one was essentially a waste, except for getting her past the tipping point of being a legend, a presidential plaything and Warhol icon.<br/><br/>The problem of this movie is that after its all engineered and polished, after all the targeting and focus, it just isn't that funny. What was funny sixty years ago  men in drag is screwball situations  just doesn't catch today. You have to do a context reset and you might like who you pretend to be.<br/><br/>Its a great structure, a masterpiece of understanding and designing cinema for a specific purpose.

","The great Billy Wilder directs, writes, and has a say in the screenplay of one of the really great comedies. Some Like It Hot is up there in the best five comedies...ever made. Marilyn Munroe, Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are superb as the three leads in this risqué 1959 steam-roller. Wilder did everything to get up the noses of the censors, and was clever enough to get away with all of it. In 1959 men dressing and behaving like ladies...wearing ladies clothes...was dangerous ground to tread on. And the many sub-plots that this brought about were also ""no go"" areas. He succeeded just like the T.V. Classic Seinfeld...when they declared ""not that there's anything wrong with that"" when they did there great ""sexual preference"" episode. In the case of Some Like It Hot...we need to remember...this was 1959. Munroe was always difficult to work with...continually turning up late, and being obviously neurotic. In a famous B.B.C. talk show in the 1970s Curtis described Munroe as a ""fruit cake"". I am sure that was true, but she was wonderful in Some Like It Hot. The movie is a classic."

Brown seem to be ""sailing into the sunset"" together.  As Joe says ""nobody's perfect.""  But this movie's close."

","In 1929 Chicago, gangsters rule. Especially Spats Colombo (George Raft) who runs a speak-easy in the back area of a funeral home. That's where bass player, Jerry (Jack Lemmon) and saxophonist Joe (Tony Curtis) have gotten their latest gigs. On payday, though, the place is raided, with many folks arrested. J and J manage to flee, however, on the fire escape. Needing a car a day later, to drive to a job in Urbana, these two musicians unhappily end up at a garage where they witness the St. Valentine's Day massacre. Spats wants to gun them down, too, but they evade bullets and make it out when sirens approach. However, since Spats knows who they are, there will be nowhere to hide. That is, unless they disguise themselves as women and join an all-girl band on the way to Florida! Ha! Yes, Josephine and Daphne, in lipstick and heels, are reborn. Almost immediately, there are problems. Daphne's bosom becomes detached while the leader of the band, Sweet Sue, senses there is something different about these gals. However, worst of all, there is a gorgeous dame, Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe) who sings and plays the ukelele. Daphne has to keep saying ""I'm a girl, I'm a girl whenever Sugar waltzes by while Joe is equally smitten. When they finally make it to Miami, Daphne becomes the object of affection for a rich millionaire, Osgood (Joe E. Brown). If Osgood succeeds in courting ""her"", she could become his ninth wife. Then, Joe, itching to romance Sugar, disguises himself at off hours as another rich boy, Shell Oil Junior, and uses Osgood's yacht to find some alone time with Miss Kane. What a tangle of emotions, especially when Daphne can't dampen Osgood's ardor! Also, before long, the mobsters hold a convention in, you guessed it, Miami, with Spats front and center. What are two guys, er gals, er whatever, going to do? This hotter than hot film has been ranked the best comedy of all time and with good reason. It is downright hilarious, with a clever script of great one-liners and much physical comedy. The cast is likewise topnotch, with Lemmon and Curtis, a duo of humorous hijinks, leading the way. Monroe, too, is funny, touching, and drop dead gorgeous. Brown turns in one the most memorable character turns ever while the Raft and the rest have the audience rolling, too. Sets, costumes, and the fresh direction complete a masterpiece of mirth. Hot, cold, or lukewarm, whatever the day turns out to be, if you need the lift of laughter, this is choice number one."
"sol-","Null","24","41","3 January 2005"," My brief review of the film
","A delightful cross-dressing comedy, this was one of the first of its type and it still is one of the funniest. It is very cleverly written, impeccably acted, particularly by Joe E. Brown, and features excellent chemistry between the two leads. There are parallels in the film to actual events and attitudes that existed in the 1920s, giving the film a historical insight as an extra virtue. The film works so well not just because of its historical parallels but also because it spoofs gangster films and not just the cross-dressing joke. Overall it is a wonderful film that sparkles along to its glitzy Academy Awarding winning costume design."
"FilmBuff77","10","9","13","4 January 2002"," Utter Perfection
","Why don't they make 'em like they used to? Marilyn, Jack, Tony, Joe E. Brown, George Raft, etc....you just can't compile a cast like that anymore. Perhaps that's what makes the film work so well, the casting.  As in all Wilder films, everyone was *just* right for their part, and trying to come up with alternatives proves fruitless, especially for Marilyn's role [what can be said about her that hasn't been said before? The ""I Wanna Be Loved By You"" sequence is one of the sexiest in cinema, and it was accomplished completely through suggestion.  Notice Wilder's extremely effective use of the spotlight in combination with the black and white cinematography;  Marilyn never looked more luminous].<br/><br/>I really can't imagine Frank Sinatra in the Tony Curtis role (Wilder's first choice, apparently), because Curtis does an amazing job, as does Lemmon. They are convincing as women without going over the top (although Lemmon comes close), and Curtis's Cary Grant impression was spot-on. Wilder was a genius, pure and simple.  Who has had a better track record? [Some Like It Hot, The Apartment, Witness For The Prosecution, One Two Three, Lost Weekend, Double Indemnity (another universally acknowledged masterpiece), Ace In The Hole, Sunset Boulevard.....the list just goes on and on].<br/><br/>What's supremely interesting about this movie is that, over the past 40 years, its appeal has not waned.  It's just as raucous and hilarious now as it was then, albeit less shocking.  But if you want shocking, go see Scary Movie.  And if you want comedy (the best of all time, no less), go see Some Like It Hot.  So good it should be required viewing.<br/><br/>Note:  Another reviewer commented that Marilyn seemed ""chunky,"" but this is because she had a real woman's body, not the ""anorexic with implants"" image we are weaned on in today's world; this is the secret to her enduring sex appeal.  If Pamela Anderson Lee were playing Sugar, would it be half as sexy (or half as funny) as it is today?"
"lee_eisenberg","10","11","17","8 June 2005"," there's every reason to like ""Some Like It Hot""
","Back in the days when certain things were taboo in movies, there were always directors who were looking for ways to push the limits. Billy Wilder did this in ""Some Like It Hot"", the movie that may very well have been the best movie that he, Marilyn Monroe, Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon ever did.<br/><br/>Curtis and Lemmon play Joe and Jerry, two musicians in 1929 Chicago who have to flee a speakeasy before a police raid. Now unemployed, they get a job to play at an out of town joint. While they are getting the car, they witness the St. Valentine's Day Massacre, when one group of mobsters murdered another group. Desperate to hide, they dress up as women and get jobs in an all-female band, using the pseudonyms Josephine and Daphne. In this band, they meet Sugar Kane Kowalczyk (Marilyn Monroe), the sexiest singer imaginable. When the band arrives in Florida is when the real nuttiness begins. ""Daphne"" gets seduced by millionaire Osgood Fielding III (Joe E. Brown), while ""Josephine"" pretends to be a millionaire named Junior, who seduces Sugar Kane. But then, the mobsters who were behind the massacre arrive.<br/><br/>What is so great about this movie is how they push the limits. Before calling the all-female band, Joe tells Jerry that they're going to shave their legs. You must realize that back then, talking about legs was like talking about genitals. And just the idea of men dressing as women might be interpreted as saying that they're gay (Joe and Jerry are not gay). Finally, the last line in the movie is all about acceptance, no matter who someone is. But all in all, ""Some Like It Hot"" gets eleven out of ten stars in my book, as it is so damn hilarious and has some really good values. Splendid."
"Travis69","10","11","17","27 November 2003"," Some Like It Hot review
","What a great cinematic experience it is to view Some Like It Hot. The movie provides you with a bit of everything from madcap action, screwball comedy, mob drama, and campy romance, along with a little sugar on top in sweet sensation, Marilyn Monroe. Despite the apparent weight-gain she looks visually stunning, and her close-to-home performance is worth noting as well. There are many subtexts that lie in Billy Wilder's masterpiece, including one that could very well do with Marilyn's character Sugar Kane Kowalczyk. Much like Marilyn, the lounge singing Sugar is searching for love with a decent somebody other than the player-type she often frequents (in the film's case, saxophonists). Perhaps men found this sultry misses too intimidating, making Marilyn's love-life in the real world just the same.<br/><br/>
	Another suggestive undertone could do with the abundant `crisis of masculinity' shot off in the late 1950's. Two middling male musicians (Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon), all dragged out, seem to be granted opportunities they would never have had if remained as `men' (i.e. marrying a millionaire, accepting free trips and consolations, etc.). Is it femininity that gains all? Like Dustin Hoffman's Tootsie, it is apparent these `beauties' really weren't beauties at all; bosses-the mob and Sugar's-pick it up right away. Why the feminine gain? Do men make wiser women than younger girls?<br/><br/>  	All rhetoric aside, Some Like It Hot's concept is a lot simpler: the men join an all girls band heading to Florida, evading the possibilities of being found as the witnesses to a gangland rubout (a.k.a. the St. Valentine's Day Massacre). Of course there are many complications for these `women' along the way, including their intense magnetism towards Sugar. Never is there a dull moment in Some Like It Hot, with quickly paced classical cutting, a wholesome variety of locations, and a brilliant screenplay much to the allure of Wilder's other treasure Sunset Boulevard. Not many movies over 40 years can hold up the laughter presented in Hot. In one of the funnier scenes, a relentless drunkard in the midst of a `funeral parlor' seize-up demands more scotch-filled decaf: `How bout another cup of coffee!' Classic, indeed.<br/><br/>

Also in the band is Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe) and both the men fall madly in love with her.<br/><br/>Classic comedy. I've seen it at least 10 times and I laugh out loud at it each time. It's fast-moving with a hilarious script. When I first saw this I was afraid there would be gay jokes made at the expense of Curtis and Lemmon. There isn't one! The script beautifully side steps any offensive material. Even when Curtis asks Lemmon, ""Why would a guy want to marry another guy"" Lemmon says, ""Security!"" The acting is mostly great. Curtis and Lemmon are just perfect and play off each other very well. Curtis actually looks pretty attractive as a woman! Monroe is just OK. She hated making this movie--she kept flubbing her lines and looks overweight (especially during her big musical number). Raft is pretty lousy--very stone-faced. But he's barely in the movie so it doesn't hurt things. It's filmed in black and white which actually helps--I think Lemmon and Curtis would have looked pretty awful in color as girls. So--a classic comedy with plenty of laughs and a famous last line--""Nobody's perfect"". Well worth seeing again and again. I give this a 10."

"rmax304823","9","12","20","9 July 2005"," Snappy and hilarious
","It isn't the first time men were in drag on the screen and certainly not the last, but surely it must be the funniest example.<br/><br/>I'll skip the plot and just make a few offhand observations. One is that the writers put a near-perfect polish on this script. They didn't simply throw gags and comic situations into the story hoping they would all add up to a funny movie. Instead they worked running gags into the dialog. Some of them are so utterly without symbolic -- or even sensible -- content that they become in themselves sidesplitting. ""Type O blood."" It must come up half a dozen times in outrageously irrelevant contexts.<br/><br/>And one that took me at least ten viewings to catch. I will now spell it out in case anyone out there is as dull as I've been. Near the beginning, when Joe and Jerry are still Joe and Jerry, Joe pitches some woo to Nellie Wymeyer in order to borrow her car, a Hupmobile 1929. An hour into the film, long after this brief exchange has been forgotten, Josephine has cornered Sugar on ""his"" yacht and explains to her the origin of his impotence. It's an imaginative and tragic tale. It seems he met his only true love at the Grand Canyon. She was as blind as he was. They stood together on the edge of the highest cliff. He took off his glasses. She took off her glasses. He took a step towards her. She took a step towards him. ""Oh, no!"" cries Sugar. ""Yes. Eight hours later they brought her up -- by mule."" That's not the running gag though. The running gag is that while Josephine is improvising this blatantly phony yarn, making it up as he goes along, free associating, he mentions that the girl he loved was named Nellie and that her father was president of Hupmobile. Absolutely nothing more is made of the connection between Nellie Wymeyer's Hupmobile and this baloney Josephine is slicing -- in fact he skips rather blithely over it.<br/><br/>I don't think I'll give away any other gags, which means I can't really describe the movie in any detail.<br/><br/>But mention should be made of the score and the arrangements of the contemporary tunes, for which I guess Adolph Deutsch is responsible. They're wacky when that's called for and sweet in an old-fashioned way when ballads are required. ""Stairway to the Stars"" has never sounded so romantic, and ""I'm Through With Love"" more wistful. (Catch the key change after Monroe finishes singing.) The underscore is remarkable too -- a frenetic combination of bass and tenor saxophone. (What else?) Monroe seems a bit thick waisted but it doesn't detract from her sex appeal because she's so Hollywood gorgeous. That transparent dress she almost has on during her love scene with Tony Curtis doesn't dampen her appeal either.<br/><br/>The two male leads give unimpeachable performances. I know Tony Curtis has often been criticized for his ""mannerisms"" and his accent but they fit his character well enough in the Bing Crosby part, while Jack Lemon couldn't be improved upon in the Bob Hope part of the continually hoodwinked, constantly cackling breathlessly. All the supports are just about right too. Sid Polyakoff -- ""Spielt mit der PhilharMONic!"" And where on this planet did casting find all those goons who play George Raft's companions. ""These are my lawyers. All Harvard men."" Those FACES.<br/><br/>I can't find anything bad to say about the movie. It's funny from beginning to end. If you haven't seen it yet, you owe it to yourself to catch it when you have a chance."

I wish that was the standard for women these days. But really, everything about the film is great: From Lemmon and Curtis' crazy attempts to hook up with Monroe's character, Sugar to the creepy old guy who apparently likes large ugly women who look like men.

","Having just enjoyed last year's 'My Week with Marilyn', where Michelle Williams plays Marilyn Monroe, the epilogue says that Some Like It Hot was her next film and how it was a huge hit.<br/><br/>After the semi-scandalous shenanigans that occurred during the filming of that crazy, doomed film in question - The Prince and the Showgirl, it indeed would be very fitting to re-watch (the sixth, or seventh time?) this bubbly frothy classic, that actually starts out as a Prohibition- set gangster movie.<br/><br/>Few films manage to instill one with excitable anticipation at a seventh viewing but this Billy Wilder scripted/directed one still does. It's more than mere comedy, it has literally everything with a perfect cast playing, well, perfectly, with Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis in drag (to fool the gangsters after witnessing a shooting) one of the most enduring double acts of all time. And, of course, the real shame is that Marilyn wasn't able to treat us to more of this sort that she plays so naturally - she really does shines and fizzes effervescently.<br/><br/>It's indeed, the subtle but clever innuendo that is the icing on the cake - we don't need to be shown any more or hear anything stronger to know exactly what is going on. This helps makes it so timeless.<br/><br/>Many know and love the film and cite it as one of their all-time favourites - it's to them that I say, sometimes you need the merest of an excuse to indulge, as you would with some special chocolates or fancy bottle of wine. Some Like It Hot is the perfect antidote to dark, wet and stormy afternoons, is non-fattening and actually very good for you, as laughter is indeed, the best medicine.

"larry41onEbay","10","5","7","13 September 2010"," Top 10 interesting things about SOME LIKE IT HOT
","Billy Wilder was best known for dramas DOUBLE INDEMNITY, THE LOST WEEKEND & SUNSET BLVD. but taste where changing and he added a new partner I.A.L. Diamond. And he wanted to get back to his roots when he wrote screwball comedies like BALL OF FIRE, NINOTCHKA and MIDNIGHT.<br/><br/>Top 10 interesting things about SOME LIKE IT HOT<br/><br/>1) This is actually the third version of the story after the 1935 - French film and 1951 - German musical version. Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond changed it to 1920s gangster/prohibition setting and added St. Valentine's Day like massacre plot and cast 1930's actors Pat O'Brien, George E. Stone and George Raft as gangsters. Look for Edward G. Robinson Jr. (son of the Edward G. Robinson) to jump out of the cake near the end of the film!<br/><br/>2) Danny Kaye and Bob Hope or Frank Sinatra and Jerry Lewis where all considered to secure studio financing with Mitzi Gaynor as the girl. But when Marilyn Monroe heard about the film she wrote to Wilder asking if she could be in it after the success they had with 1955's THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH. So after she was signed for $200,000 and 10% of the gross Wilder was then able to cast the cheaper newcomers he really wanted, Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis as the male leads.<br/><br/>3) Lemmon and Curtis were afraid of their young careers getting damaged, of the make-up & costumes not working and especially walking in high heels... they did hire a trainer but fired him after they realized walking like men in heels was funnier! <br/><br/>4) George Raft who started his career as a coin tossing gangster in the original 1932 SCARFACE was originally a dancer and taught Jack Lemmon & Joe E. Brown to tango so well, watch closely, they even pass a rose between their teeth while dancing!<br/><br/>5) Supposedly when costume designer Orry-Kelly was measuring all three stars for dresses, he half-jokingly told Marilyn Monroe, ""Tony Curtis has a nicer rear end than you,"" at which point Monroe pulled open her blouse and said, ""Yeah, but he doesn't have a chest like this!"" Film critic Roger Ebert notes: ""she wears a clinging, see-through dress, with gauze covering the upper slopes of her breasts, the neckline scooping to a censor's eyebrow north of trouble."" <br/><br/>6) In 2008, a Californian man (who found a little black dress in his closet) was stunned when appraisers for U.S. TV series ""Antiques Roadshow"" determined it once belonged to Marilyn Monroe. The frock - which Monroe was sewn into for SOME LIKE IT HOT (1959) - was estimated to be worth $250,000 <br/><br/>7) Tony Curtis came up with the idea to having his character Shell Oil Jr. sound like Cary Grant, who upon seeing the film said ""Nobody talks like that!""<br/><br/>8) Marilyn Monroe was famously fragile, shy, insecure and often late. Wilder said a scene that would normally take an hour to shoot took 3 days to get right. It required 47 takes to get ""It's me, Sugar"" correct. Another scene required Monroe to rummage through some drawers and say ""Where's the bourbon?"" After 40 takes, Wilder pasted the correct line in one of the drawers. After Monroe became confused about which drawer contained the line, Wilder had it pasted in every drawer. When she finally does say it, she has her back to the camera, leading some to wonder if Wilder finally gave up and had it dubbed. <br/><br/>The girls in the band tell the story of one day they couldn't get Marilyn out of her trailer so Wilder asked Monroe's stand-in to rehearse the song ""Running Wild"" with the crew. Before long Marilyn heard the music and someone else singing her song so she came out to see what was going on Wilder took one look at her and said, ""OK everybody, now from the top"" and Marilyn nailed it on the first take!<br/><br/>SOME LIKE IT HOT director Billy Wilder was once asked why he put up with Monroe's nonsense. He famously replied, ""My Aunt Minnie would always be punctual and never hold up production, but who would pay to see my Aunt Minnie?"" <br/><br/>9) RECOGNITION: 6 Oscar nominations for Writing, Director, Cinematography, Sets and Lemmon for Actor (unfortunately that year it was competing with BEN-HUR which in my opinion is not that funny and Charlton Heston wears an even shorter skirt! Not fair!) SOME LIKE IT HOT only won only one Academy Award for Best Costume (FOOTNOTE: for strategic engineering under substantial and natural monumental obstacles, I'm sure.) Golden Globe wins for Best Comedy, Actor Lemmon & Actress Monroe; the Roman Catholic Legion of Decency awarded it a ""condemned"" rating (it's now considered PG-13) and finally in the year 2000, the American Film Institute listed SOME LIKE IT HOT as the number one greatest American comedy film of all time. What's number two? TOOTSIE...<br/><br/>10) One last piece of trivia, about my favorite scene. When they previewed the movie they found a problem with one scene, the audience was laughing so hard they missed several jokes so Billy Wilder gave a pair of maracas to Jack Lemmon to shake between the punch lines and re- shot the scene to allow the audience time to get the laughs out of there system!"

","This is to me quintessential Billy Wilder, spoofing the gangster genre and cheekily bending the genders in a joyous romp that is standing the test of time in this perceived new age of movie watchers. The cries of it being a one joke movie don't carry weight because the final result is two hours of tongue in cheek winking entertainment that shatters that particular charge.<br/><br/>The cast here are uniformly excellent, Jack Lemmon & Tony Curtis bounce of each other in a sort of lowest denominator camp extreme that makes for mirth in abundance, and Monroe may just give the greatest spoof {of herself} performance in cinema history as she plays up perfectly to her image so played out in the press of the time. George Raft throws his lot in with a delightful caricature show, whilst Joe E Brown almost steals the film as Osgood, in fact he gets the icing on the cake final line that is now considered right at the top of the tree for closing lines.<br/><br/>The off screen troubles with Monroe are some source of reference, and it really isn't my wish to waffle about stories that are available to you at a click of your mouse, what we know is that Wilder with the help of I.A.L. Diamond managed to create a much loved film that all involved can take as a legacy of success that the masses will enjoy for generations to come, it is what it is, 10/10."

Yet the whole, curiously, doesn't quite add up.<br/><br/>Probably because the entire premise -- two male jazz musicians passing as women to escape the Mafia -- devolves into the notorious final, utterly improbable, line: ""Nobody's perfect!"" But by then any pretext at reality has been dropped. We are immersed in some Neverland of movie-making which, really, has never been attempted before or since.<br/><br/>Namely, a thoroughly ridiculous vanity film for the director, writers, cinematographer and actors that remains utterly delightful nearly half a century later -- and always will.<br/><br/>About halfway through, audiences realize they're not watching anything resembling real life. Instead, they're watching some of the best talents in the business having fun! And fun it is! The script is tight as a drum: the direction is flawless (particularly in light of the on-set problems with Miss Monroe): the cinematography is luscious (never has Monroe been lit and photographed so successfully; not even in ""The Prince and the Showgirl."").<br/><br/>Yet what we're given is scene after scene with two masterful actors -- Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis -- masquerading as women. And Marilyn Monroe -- masterful in her narrow range -- also masquerading as a woman.<br/><br/>Let's face it: without her voluptuous body (and Orry-Kelly's jaw-dropping costumes), Miss Monroe would have been NOTHING had she been Kate Moss. Or any other actor. Imagine ANYBODY else ""breathing"" those lines and slinking around in those gowns and getting by with it.<br/><br/>You can't.<br/><br/>Every scene ""works."" Lemmon and Curtis are priceless -- particularly Curtis -- in female drag. Not for one second do they condescend to ""playing"" women. Sure, the plot demands it. But there's not a moment where they're ""putting down"" the ""weaker"" sex. That would have been an easy ""comedic"" choice back in the day. That nobody chose it says a lot about the talents and sensibilities at work here.<br/><br/>Only Joe E. Brown could have been cast as Osgood, perhaps. So obliviously innocent is he that he makes his love for ""Daphne"" work without a hint of homosexual subtext.<br/><br/>It may be a small miracle, in fact, that a film of this era, dealing with two men in drag, and an older wealthy man in love with one of them, has absolutely NO hint of homosexuality, much less anti-gay sentiment. The film is, truly, beloved in homosexual circles for precisely that reason.<br/><br/>But forget all that. ""Some Like It Hot"" becomes a tour-de-force for everybody involved: a film about the joys of acting and pretending, rather than a film to be believed or taken seriously -- since it's so preposterous.<br/><br/>One finally yields to the audacious conceit that Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are ""believed"" as ""Josephine"" and ""Daphne"" and simply lets the deliciousness of their playing wash over audiences.<br/><br/>The tidal wave that is Marilyn Monroe (though nearly impossible to work with, by this point: her lines being pasted inside bureau drawers and anywhere else on the set that couldn't be seen, because she couldn't recall even the simplest of them), is perhaps the ultimate in feminine pulchritude on screen. (Monroe was reportedly pregnant during filming, though she miscarried.) Forget that she's written (and plays) a woman as dumb as a post. She looks like nothing anybody ever saw before or since.<br/><br/>So ""Some Like It Hot"" works, scene by scene. Yet, curiously, if fails in the end because it's so patently phony.<br/><br/>No matter the era, when a man proposes to another man (thinking he's a woman), and that fiancée pulls off his wig and confesses, ""I'm a man,"" the last line is NEVER, ""Well, nobody's perfect."" No matter how funny. No matter ANYTHING. By then we're in Neverland and all that's left is to relish the performers relishing performing.<br/><br/>That, we do."

","This is a wonderfully entertaining film that has to have one of the best final scenes in movie history--seeing Joe E. Brown and Jack Lemmon in this scene is truly delightful. However, I do wonder if perhaps, maybe, the film is a tiny bit overrated--especially since it is now ranked relatively high on IMDb's Top 250 list. It's an exceptional film...I just don't see it as quite THAT exceptional.<br/><br/>Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon stumble upon a mob hit. And, since mobsters really DON'T like witnesses, they know they'd better hide--and quick. So they hit upon the idea of hiding in an all-ladies' band, as they, too, are musicians. There, Tony falls in love with Marilyn Monroe--and it's hard for him to balance his female persona with the bookish guy he also pretends to be to impress her. As for Jack, he becomes the focus of a rich older man's attentions (Joe E. Brown). So how do they both balance these relationships with a strong desire NOT to be killed by the mob? The film has some nice supporting acting by George Raft and Pat O'Brien-and it's nice to see them return to films. As for the acting, it's generally very good, though I think Curtis' acting is a bit broad at times--but oddly charming as well.<br/><br/>Overall, there's a lot to enjoy and it's fun throughout."

Also, you might not have noticed, but most comedies (except for Woody Allen's ""Annie Hall"" and a few others of his) rarely hit the big-time or become timeless classics.  However, it was nice to see that AFI recognized ""Some like it hot"" as being a terrific comedy and they ranked it 14th on their 100 greatest American films.<br/><br/>  Two good friends, Jerry (Jack Lemmon) and Joe (Tony Curtis), witness a murder by one of the biggest gangsters but manage to escape but instead of running to the police, they decide to hide from the gangsters by dressing up as two women who play in a band (I forgot to mention that their job is to play in a band). It's on the trip with that band that they meet Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe) and they naturally both fall in love with her.<br/><br/>  The rest of the movie is pure comedy and I don't want to spoil the fun for anybody so I guess you'll just have to see it.  The movie also has some great scenes like the one where Curtis imitates Cary Grant.  It's worth at least two good watches if not three."

","''Some Like It Hot'' is the best movie with Marilyn Monroe already made! When I was deciding which movie from Marilyn's box I was going to watch, ''Some Like it Hot'' was the one which I payed less attention of them: the cover is not beautiful as ''Gentlemen Prefer Blondes '' or ''How to Marry a Millionaire'' and the fact that the movie was black and white made it less appealing to me. Anyway, I decided to watch and I don't regret it at all: I had a lot of fun with the story!:) ( And by the way, I saw how handsome Jamie Lee Curtis' father, Tony Curtis, was.)<br/><br/>Joe and Jerry are friends and musicians. They two are broke and needing to pay their bills, so they go to almost all opportunities of a job they can get. One day, when they decided to take a job in a very distant place, they become witnesses of a massacre,leaded by Spats Colombo, a guy from the Italian Mafia. The problem is that Spats and his gang noticed that Jerry and Joe were there, and now they are hunting both musicians to kill them. Needing to hide, Joe and Jerry decided to cover their identity, and they both dress up like women: Joe becomes Josephine and Jerry becomes Daphne, and they get a job in a women's band. Once they arrive in Miami, many problems and confusions starts to happen, since Joe is using two identities (one as ''shell junior', the millionaire, to make Sugar fall for him)and Jerry is having problems with a rich old man who is in love with ''Daphne''.To make things worst, the mafia came to Miami as well."

How could Joe fit into Beinstock's clothes? How did he know what kind of clothes Beinstock had packed to begin with? How could Jerry fit into the bellhop's uniform? Why did everyone accept Joe and Jerry as women except Spats and his thugs? Despite the fact that Mulligan is there, and the hotel is a public place, Little Bonaparte orders a hit. Makes sense to me, too!<br/><br/>How did Sugar know Joe had gone to the pier after he was chased out of the ballroom by Little Bonaparte's goons? And even if her bicycle was jet-propelled, there is no way in hell she could have gotten there before he, Jerry, and Osgood shoved off!<br/><br/>But it's so terrific and so perfectly executed with its perfect cast, you're more than happy to forgive its many faults.

Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are great as 'Josephine' and 'Daphne'; they may not be the most beautiful of women but they do at least look feminine enough that one can believe they would be mistaken for women. Marilyn Monroe is on top form as Sugar; particularly in the scenes were she is wooed by Joe's 'Shell Oil Jnr' persona. The laughs come thick and fast combining elements of farce and slapstick. One might worry that 'fifties morality' would be a problem but the attitudes are far more modern than one might expect. Overall I'd definitely say this film is a must see."

","Humor, beyond the pure pleasure of laughter, can provide insights into the rules, norms and taboos of the times that by showing the distortion that provides release. At the time this was made, it was focused on a bygone era of murderous mobsters and their living sex toys.<br/><br/>Not only were gender roles defined, there were to the degree that the issue hadn't even been raised, neither in the time of depiction 1929 or three decades later when the film was made. The fun was that all it took for men to gambol with the chicks was their putting on dresses and wigs, and raising their voice an octave.<br/><br/>The DVD shows the complete film with commentary by the son of billy Wilder's co-writer, Babaloo Mandell along with Jack Lemon and Tony Curtis, describing more than the technical aspects Most touching were how Marilyn Monroe resonated to the fictional character. Curtis, without any bravado, told of how his on stage scene when he convinced her that he was impotent, and with tenderness and passion she ""cured"" him, echoed their actual love affair previously.<br/><br/>We also see the genius of writer director Billy Wilder at work in a way that can't be described outside of such a film as this where his interpersonal and literary talents were at play. While this is appropriately in the genre of comedy, it is really so much more. It is a love story, and a tale of the tragedy of the real Norma Jeane that was never far away from the actress. Sure, at times the pain of her early life (see Wikipedia) broke through to the detriment of efficiency of the filming. But so what? The film on one level provided laughter, but on another insight into the human condition.<br/><br/>It is also a benchmark of sexual stereotypes where the setup for that final memorial line, the universal absurdity of the disclosure that the object of sexual desire would not make a suitable wife because, ""I'm a guy."" This was a world where women could roll in bed together without any thought of sexuality between them, and the joke was there were two who were pretending, only playing a role, performing a part.<br/><br/>How far the world has come, a truth that must be acknowledged whether pleased or disturbed by the revolution.

","Of course, of course _ ""Some Like it Hot"" is arguably the greatest screwball comedy in the history of Hollywood. But, as they say, the devil is in the details. One of those details _ casting _ could have instantly derailed this classic. Who to dress up in drag with Tony Curtis, run from the mob led by George Raft and hook up with Marilyn Monroe at her most sensuous? Oh, and to field a marriage proposal from Joe E. Brown despite a, uh, gender issue? And by the way, what actor to play over the top without taking his own brilliance too seriously and ruining the whole shebang for everybody? On the 25th anniversary of the film, I acted as host-interviewer of ""An Evening with Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond"" and got a rare peek behind the scenes and an up-close look at both Wilder and Jack Lemmon, the actor who met the aforementioned requirements perfectly. I hope you find the following story amusing. Among other things, it illustrates that, no matter how high the budget and how big the stars, film is still an art form and chemistry matters, and that chemistry is very often predicated on serendipity and just plain luck.)<br/><br/>IN Hollywood, they say it's not what you know, but who you know.

A dervish behind thick Coke-bottle glasses chomping on an ever-present cigar stub, he was at once elegant and raw, a man who had fled the Nazis, pulled himself up by the bootstraps through talent and guile, and beaten Hollywood at its own game.<br/><br/>Jack Lemmon was just a nice guy. REALLY. The quintessential Hollywood Everyman, even nicer and more accommodating off-screen than on, which was saying a bunch.<br/><br/>He and Wilder would have one of the industry's great collaborative friendships. But not just yet. And this is how it started.<br/><br/>Lemmon told me he did not know Wilder well when, as luck would have it, he happened to be dining with his future wife, Felicia Farr, at Delmonico's restaurant one early Sunday evening at the same time as Wilder. The great director spied him and dropped by his table later on the way out.<br/><br/>Wilder, as was his way, came right to the point. <br/><br/>""Gunna do dis story where you'd dress up in drag and run avay vit a girls' band after seeing the St. Valentine's Day Massacre _ vonna do it?"" he asked the startled actor (and who played startled better than Lemmon?).<br/><br/>Recalled Lemmon while sitting in his office (his Oscar for 1972's ""Save the Tiger"" gleaming on a shelf behind him): ""In that one sentence, I had the whole story.

","Some Like It Hot is an American comedy film, made during 1958 and released during 1959, which was directed by Billy Wilder. This comedy made controversy out of its use of not very common themes in the cinema theaters. The use of themes like homosexuality, mafia and gangster difficulties, and alcoholism were all themes that were not common at all during the ages of the 1950s. The use of stereotypes as blondes symbolized as dumb and unconsciously acting women, gangsters as selfish and crude men, and musicians as poor and needy people make the movies way of description easier since just by getting to know the characters you know what they are and what they want. It all starts at an old 1950s Chicago, when Jerry and Joe, two musicians escape from the closure of an illegal pub. They run away with no where to go and look for jobs since they are almost money- less. The most valuable things they have are their instruments. They find out about a band who is leaving in tour and needs two musicians, but the problem is that the band is composed by all female musicians, so they reject the job. After looking for other jobs Joe and Jerry happen to become witnesses of a mafia murder so they run away again but this time away from the mafia. For them to get away from the area they finally take the female band tour and leave with the other female musicians as if they were women. Everything happens to go well as they pretend to be female musicians but someone intervenes in their plans, and that someone is Sugar, interpreted by Marylyn Monroe. She happens to be a really beautiful but dumb girl who is part if the band. They both fall in love with her. They finally reach their destination, Miami, Florida. They get there and another character appears, he is Osgood. He falls in love of the female version of Jerry, Daphne. The story goes on and Joe tries to make Sugar fall in love with a fake millionaire version of him, and it sorts to work out. Joe got the idea that Jerry should take Osgood, the money-abundant old man, dressed as Daphne out for a dinner to a Latin bar at the coast, while Joe dressed as the fake millionaire version of him takes Sugar with him into Osgood's yacht at the beach. The morning after it happened that Daphne and Osgood got engaged, Osgood without knowing that Daphne is in reality Jerry. Sugar is sad because her ""new loved man"" has gone. Jerry and Joe find out that the Mafia convention is taken place in the same hotel they are in. The gangsters happen to recognize both Jerry and Joe as women and look for them. They hide and happen to witness another murder but his time the murder of the gangsters who were following them. Now the new gangster follow them and Joe has this idea in which he could reveal himself to Sugar and take her with him and Daphne to Osgood's yacht where they left together as two couples, Sugar and the real Joe, and Osgood and Daphne, who in reality is Jerry. Osgood doesn't care he is a man. All of these events go around the themes I mentioned. Homosexuality is highlighted when Osgood doesn't care about Daphne's sex and when Joe, as a woman loves Sugar. Gangster and Mafia problematics when they witness and are followed by the mafia in both cities, Chicago and Miami. The story made controversy when it was revealed to the audience since they weren't used to themes of that big impact in society. In my opinion the movie has to fix some details as the cast acting skills and the short and brief ending. Everything else in the movie is mostly good. The settings, the music, the filming techniques, and many other characteristic that build a great movie."

","""Some Like It Hot""<br/><br/>It is a very interesting movie considering that it was made in 1959 in black and white, when color cinema already existed. It is a combination of screwball comedy, romantic comedy, thriller and gangster. With great music and an ingenious screen writing by Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond. The director is also Billy Wilder.<br/><br/>The movie is set in 1929, during the time of the Prohibition. It starts when two Chicago musicians Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry(Jack Lemmon) have to run from the police. In the middle of the little chaos, the same luck brings them to witness a murder on Valentine's Day. Making them two wanted men by Chicago's mafia. While they are looking for a job, they find a vacant on a girl band group for saxophone and bass players, respectively the instruments they both play. In the desperation, they disguise as women and join the band. They name themselves Josephine (Joe) and Daphne (Jerry). While in the girl band, Joe falls in love with Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe) and an old millionaire man, Osgood Fielding (Joe E Brown), falls in love with Daphne. Making it funnier because Osgood does not know that Daphne is a guy.<br/><br/>All of the main actors did an excellent performance, considering that it is seen as one of the greatest comedy films of all time. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are both dramatic and funny, which engages the audience with both of them. On the other hand, Marilyn Monroe is probably the most complex character. She acts as a more ""elegantly vulgar"" character and female drinker. She portrays the woman dependent of a man. And many have criticized the scene when she appears singing 'I Wanna Be Loved By You' with a nude color dress, and the lighting focused on a way that she appears to be naked.<br/><br/>I loved the scene when Joe is sitting on the bench while the girls are in the beach because it gives the plot a major turn around, creating a third character portrayed by Joe. And it complicates everything more. The fact of a lie on top of another lie and other lies, which give the audience a sense of suspense about how will it turn out. One scene that I did not specifically loved was when there is a second murderer because it looks a bit unrealistic and it is the same thing occurring all over again. An unrealistically bad luck.<br/><br/>This movie was considered extremely controversial and was even banned in certain places like Kansas. The fact of Joe and Jerry transforming themselves into Josephine and Daphne creates a sexual confusion on the very conservative time period that the movie was made. As the director Curtis Hanson said about the movie: ""It's a film about sex – from the title to the final line. It's not just about sex as in people having sex; it's also about sexual attitudes, sexual roles and, of course, sexual identity."" The relationship of Osgood and Daphne was probably the most criticized one because it becomes bigger and bigger at the point of them being engaged and when Joe asks Jerry ""Who's the lucky girl?"", Jerry answers ""Me!."" This gave a sense of confusion because the character could not realize why could not he marry Osgood. Finally, when he confesses to Osgood ""I am a guy!"", this one replies ""Nobody's perfect."" Which leaves the audience with a sense of confusion and trying to convey an idea of sexual identity. But overall, it was a very good movie with beautiful scenery and an unusual plot. It is considered one of the funniest movies of all time, and even though it was a bit controversial when it came out, it is nothing that you would not see in movies nowadays. <br/><br/>This movie has been considered to be a screwball comedy, which is a type of comedy that "" distinguishes itself for being characterized by a female that dominates the relationship with the male central character, whose masculinity is challenged."" It is also a romantic comedy, where we can see the romances of Sugar and Joe, and Osgood and Daphne being a major part of the plot. A thriller, where we do not know what will happen and if someone will ever find out that they are guys. It leaves the audience waiting for the climax. Finally, it is also considered a gangster film, where it is a crime-dealing movie and the Chicago mafia is trying to capture Joe and Jerry. The movie won an Oscar for costume design in black and white and the music is also very nice. The song ""I Wanna Be Loved By You"" had its most famous performance by Marilyn Monroe in this movie.<br/><br/>I would give this movie a 4.3/5<br/><br/>This review was written by a high school sophomore, who likes to listen to music and watch movies. It was written for a film appreciation class."

","No need to recap the plot nor echo consensus points.<br/><br/>The movie is perfectly cast. The chemistry between Lemmon and Curtis is perfect. Add a wide-eyed Monroe and it's an outstanding comedy trifecta. Still, seeing the film again after first release, I wonder how much hilarity audiences of today find in the movie's sexual innuendo. After all, the premise was cutting-edge in 1959 when the word 'panties' in Anatomy of a Murder raised a ruckus with enforcers of the film code.<br/><br/>In that same year, just watching from a theatre seat during the cross-dressing, plus the many innuendo scenes was like being a daring part of taboo-breaking. The bawdy subtext was a totally new experience in the commercial movies. Thus the amusement factor was heightened by novel comedic material, previously forbidden. But I wonder about today's younger audiences for whom the innuendo may even seem a little tame, given today's almost non-existent standards.<br/><br/>In my little book, it's still a funny movie, thanks mainly to an expert cast, but hardly an all- time topper as it is in some ratings lists. Besides, it's the only comedy I can think of to work its way around not just one, but two, on-screen massacres!"

Thinking, ""So this is comedy cross-dressing is supposed to be."" (that is looking at you Big Momma and Tyler Perry) Ranked as the greatest American comedy by AFI (as at Oct 2012), the movie is a remake of a 1935 French movie, Fanfare d'Amour and was meant to be shut in color but as the makeup of both Curtis and Lemmon was obvious it was then shut in black and white.<br/><br/>Marilyn Monroe can carve a M in to a rock with her smile and her acting is so well done that you are intrigued to see her anytime. Monroe is known mostly as a sex icon, and this movie assisted in such claims as the dresses she wore were more too seductive to be classified as funny. To say she had the movie by the balls will be a statement men will agree to, when they are watching this flick.<br/><br/>The plot is about two male musicians who will do absolutely anything for money as they are constantly broke. They were in the wrong place at the wrong time and witness a mobster performing his ""executionary"" duties. This made them run off while being shut at.<br/><br/>To hide from their pending death, they took a job as musicians in an all-girl band. So to fit in they shaved their legs, wore makeup and wore a dress to pass as women.<br/><br/>But things took a turn for the worse when Marilyn Monroe strolled by.<br/><br/>The film was awarded an Academy Award for Best Costume Design. It also won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy. Marilyn Monroe won the Golden Globe for Best Actress in Musical or Comedy, and Jack Lemmon for Best Actor in Musical or Comedy.<br/><br/>Billy Wilder the director is one of only five people to have won Academy Awards as producer, director, and writer for the same film (The Apartment). Tony Curtis has been in over a 100 films and he is the father of actress Jamie Lee Curtis.<br/><br/>Lemmon is popular in these days as the actor in the movie Odd Couple.<br/><br/>Some Like It Hot, is a movie I advise you watch over and over again.

","Although you can still somewhat describe this movie being somewhat of a screwball comedy, it's also really a movie that has more hints of a more modern type of comedy in it. The overall comedy and approach of it all and the story feels more matured and seriously put together, as if it was a movie out of a far more serious and respected genre, such as a drama or a thriller. It makes me sort of see ""Some Like It Hot"" as the first 'modern' comedy.<br/><br/>In essence this is actually being one very simple movie. It relies almost entirely on its main premise of having two guys who are forced, due to circumstances, to dress up as girls and to join an all female band, in order to get away from the mobsters that are chasing them and want to kill them. But of course lots of other stuff starts to happen and things get complicated more once they start the trip. They get themselves even in more trouble, which is of course all due to Marilyn Monroe.<br/><br/>It's perhaps Marilyn Monroe's most iconic and memorized roles. She never was the best actress around but she still always had an incredible screen presence, which made audiences fall in love with her. It was of course not in the least due to her looks but also thanks to her naive, girl-like charm. Besides, her singing was also always great and she does some good singing in this and sing her most recognizable song 'I Wanna Be Loved By You' in this. But you really shouldn't forget about Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon. I mean, they are the ones acting in drag, mostly throughout the entire movie. They truly become almost unrecognizable, which is not just because of the way how they look but also due to their fine acting. I wouldn't imaging there were many actors at the time, fighting over a role to play a female character for almost the entire movie but they are the ones that simply did it and for that along they already should get a lot of respect.<br/><br/>It's a pleasantly fast moving movie, that takes us to a lot of places and there is always something going on. The characters are great comedy ones and then I am of course also talking about its fine supporting cast, that also has some other quite big names in it from the past, such as George Raft and Pat O'Brien.<br/><br/>One of the first great and successful 'modern' comedies.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","""Some Like It Hot"" is hard to explain. The film, if you've never seen it, is going to feel like something you've seen a hundred times before. And you probably have, but they did it first. To be successful, two guys dress up as women, and then one falls for a woman (Marilyn Monroe) -- so how does he tell her without her hating him for keeping the secret? <br/><br/>We have seen plenty of films where guys get close to women because of some trick -- usually innocently -- and then have to inevitably reveal the truth. And sometimes this involves cross-dressing. I think it's safe to say that ""Some Like it Hot"" was the first film to play this plot, especially with the cross-dressing.<br/><br/>This film is funny, to be sure, and has a very nice innocence to it in that it seems pretty obvious to the audience that the women are men.

The plot is fundamental comedy; two Chicago musicians in 1929 Prohibition America are looking for a job after police bust up the club they were playing at due to it supplying alcohol. Through wandering around the streets, they witness a gangland murder and have to hide from the Italian Mafia who do not want any witnesses to their crimes... So they take up a job as two female band players in an all female band going to a beautiful resort in Florida. While on their way they meet a host of beautiful girls and of course the iconic and intoxicating Marilyn Monroe in one of her finest roles - she succeeds in embodying her role in every dimension.<br/><br/>This truly outstanding comedy is far ahead of its time and is subtly and not too subtly all about sex and standard human behaviour. Greed, love, money, sex and lust. All processed in a wonderful way that would be appropriate for a 1950s comedy. What I like about 'Some Like it Hot' is the very fact that it is not crude and unnecessarily sexual comedy like the idiotic examples we get today.<br/><br/>Jack Lemmon provides an extraordinary performance in a role that should have won him his first Oscar (it was awarded to Charlton Heston for Ben Hur that year, due to the fact that Ben Hur was an epic production). Tony Curtis and Marilyn Monroe are both sublime in their roles and Billy Wilder's craft make this an undoubted masterpiece and the greatest comedy of all time.<br/><br/>10/10"

","""Some Like it Hot"" is Billy Wilder's classic farce about a pair of male musicians (Tony Curtis & Jack Lemmon) who join a female band in order to hide out from the mob. Naturally, complications ensue, not the least of which is the temptation presented by luscious fellow musician Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe). More than fifty years later the film is regarded as one of the finest American comedies ever and I concur.<br/><br/>I was already well aware of Lemmon's comedic prowess but I had no idea that Tony Curtis could pull off a role like he did here. In my opinion, he steals the show although the three principle actors each have memorable moments and great chemistry together. Given the talent of Curtis & Lemmon, Marilyn's somewhat limited acting skills would seem to be the weak link here but she nevertheless fits in well, all the while oozing that elusive quality they call 'star power'.<br/><br/>The script does a good job of blending high- and low-brow comedy. There's no shortage of snappy dialogue and farcical situations. Even gangland executions can't put a damper on the proceedings. Wilder's directorial style is crisp and follows the action admirably. The entire visual & aural package is attractive but the emphasis is firmly placed where it should be: on the comedy.<br/><br/>So, there you have it. If you haven't seen it, do so; if you have, see it again."

","I'm sure no one had to twist arms to get Marilyn Monroe, Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis to sign for the leading roles once they looked at the hilariously witty script by Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond. What must have looked good on paper is even funnier on the screen--the three stars give their all to make this one of the most memorable comedies of all time! (""Dumb and Dumber"" fans might not agree!!)<br/><br/>The story begins with down on their heels musicians accidentally witnessing a gangland slaying by mobsters. Naturally, they flee the scene and decide the safest thing to do is disguise themselves as dames by joining an all-girl band in need of two musicians. Complications develop when Daphne (Jack Lemmon) falls for the charms of the band's singer, Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe). Hectic goings-on continue throughout the course of the fast-paced yarn, with Daphne being romanced by a sex-starved millionaire (Joe E. Brown) and Tony Curtis getting out of drag to woo Marilyn with his impersonation of Cary Grant. It's screwball comedy at its finest--with some of the punch lines buried under laughter (if you see it in a theater).<br/><br/>
The mad pace continues to the very end, with Lemmon deciding to accept the millionaire's marriage proposal--leading to the film's final punch line fadeout.<br/><br/>Deserves its status as one of the best comedies of all time. An ingratiating performance by Monroe (and she CAN and does sing, contrary to someone's earlier comment on her voice), especially good in her scenes with Jack Lemmon's character. As for Lemmon, he all but steals the show once he grabs those maracas and fancies himself kicking up his heels as Daphne. He and Curtis underplay their cross-dressing assignments for the most part--but are still very funny.<br/><br/>The dumbing down of comedy today--with leering one-liners about sex dominating all the dialog and toilet humor being ""in""--may leave some with the feeling that this is a mild mannered sex farce. But they're wrong. It's still a sizzler with more class than the dumb, sometimes gross jokes and situations that are the stuffing of the newer comedies like ""There's Something About Mary""."
"the red duchess","10","6","10","10 January 2001"," About SO much more than the gender-terrorists will have it.
","'Some Like it Hot', that ultimate paean to life in all its protean subversiveness, begins with death.  A funeral to be precise.  Of course, it's not a real funeral - a gang of grimly gormless bootleggers are smuggling illegal liquour in a casket, Death mocked by whiskey, the water of life.  This gives a socially disruptive comedy a metaphysical depth not always present in Wilder.  <br/><br/>Because, for all the farcical high jinx, there is real death in this film, which is a true gangster film, not a spoof.  No matter how many times I see this film, it never ceases to shock me, in the garage massacre scene, that Jerry and Joe are a dying man's last jerk away from being mown to pieces like yesterday's grass.  Why not, we've just seen it happen, and such 'innocent' murders were commonplace at the time. It's ironic, then, that a film driven by self-preservation should result in the discovery of different selves.  This is why Spats and cronies must die - they are tied down, by genre, by history, by period, by identity - Spats is literally what he wears.  Joe and Jerry survive by transforming, from one genre to another, gangster to comedy, from one part of the country to another, from one gender to another.  'Hot' is another of Wilder's modern fairy tales, and transformation is a necessary component of any good fairy tale.  <br/><br/>That opening sequence is still breathtaking - the police shootout where people actually die; the solemn funeral 'front'; the arrangements for the police sting.  When Mulligan moves from the quiet of the funeral home to the Jazz Age vibrancy of the speakeasy, it's like he's magically entered another realm, shown by the very Wilder mirror that reflects the fun.  Even before Joe and Jerry enter, the film is rife with disguise, deceit, division, reflection, transformation.  This is 'Hot''s real subversion - Joe and Jerry aren't disruptive imps, changing the world in their own image; they are playing the world by its own rules, its own self-delusion.  After all, the film isn't set in 1929 for nothing, and the monumental shadow of the Crash looms over every scene, every musical-comedy cliche of the millionaire.<br/><br/>The 1920s, the Jazz Age, Prohibition, gangsters - all this is one big aberration in American history, a subversion of what it conservatively means to be an American, where hedonism, a weirdly social self-interest reigns, where respectable people are forced by law to become criminal just to have a lousy, lethal drink.  This isn't just a subversive comedy about gender and identity - after all, dressing up as a woman isn't quite the same as menstruating or having babies - this is a two-fingers to Eisenhower's vision of America, where people have to pretend to be what they are not (conformist, all-American, nuclear-family etc.) so as not to stick out and be lynched.  <br/><br/>Do I really need to say that this is hilarious (although there are longueurs, some lines don't take off, and the film itself doesn't really zing until we reach Florida - maybe I've seen it too often), that Marilyn Monroe for once is a beautiful and sexy woman, rather than a caricature of one, that I know every scene and line by heart?  What's most interesting is that while Joe is the most convincing woman in the film (best scene in the movie - Josephine kissing Sugar near the end), it is Jerry, the most aggressively male to begin with, who ends up wishing he were a girl.  Do people really think through the consequences of this film, that if there is a wedding night, Osgood and Daphne..."
"pyrocitor","10","5","8","29 July 2006"," A comedy milestone way ahead of its time
","Some Like It Hot<br/><br/>The premise for a comedy film being two men dressing up as women may seem commonplace in today's day and age, where anything, no matter taboo may be thrown in for a laugh (Kevin Smith anyone?), but for it's time, the central idea for ""Some Like It Hot"" must have seemed pretty risqué. Fortunately enough, director Billy Wilder really knows what he's doing, as he handles the somewhat delicate subject matter with a deft and confident hand, not overplaying the concept but instead extracting as many laughs as he can from it while still remaining totally tasteful, which in turn just makes the joke so much richer. <br/><br/>The script is without a doubt one of the wittiest and best constructed of all time, with tons of wonderful back and forth exchanges between Lemmon and Curtis, and the period dialogue, with names like ""Spats Columbo"" and ""Toothpick Charlie"" is a treat to listen to. The period feel of great depression era costumes and sets are also excellent - all together, a very convincing feel of the time period. Not to mention that there is an actually suspenseful car chase, a cinematic rarity for the time.<br/><br/>But more than anything else, the talking point is how entertaining and funny the whole film is. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are hilarious and charming as the two beleaguered leads, forced to masquerade as female musicians to save themselves from the mob. Marilyn Monroe has also never looked so beautiful, and despite the stories of the ridiculous number of takes it took her to get her lines right, in the final cut she comes across as fairly natural, even raising several laughs. The supporting cast also give great performances and manage to also raise many laughs, especially Joe E. Brown with the closing line ""Nobody's perfect"", which has to be one of the most memorable conclusions in film history. <br/><br/>All in all, Some Like It Hot survives the cinematic test of time by coming across as just as funny when viewed currently as it must have been back in the 50s. The acting is wonderful, and Curtis and Lemmon have terrific chemistry together, and iconic Marilyn never fails to dazzle us. On a long night in need of a laugh or several, Some Like It Hot is most definitely worth a viewing - it is certainly more tasteful and unexpectedly hilarious than most contemporary comedies!<br/><br/>-10/10"
"ClassicAndCampFilmReviews","10","5","8","4 August 2005"," One of the best comedies off all time.
","I recently picked up a special edition DVD of the classic ""Some Like It Hot"", and upon arriving home with it, tossed out my old battered fullscreen VHS version. I watched this film again last night, with the added bonus of seeing it for the first time in widescreen, and was immediately struck once again by how perfect a movie it is.<br/><br/>You've got a Billy Wilder film with female impersonators in it, in the forms of Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon, and Marilyn Monroe with a screen name that reeks of porn and/or strippers - ""Sugar Cane"". What more could you ask for? This wondrous mix combined to make one of the greatest comedies in the history of film.<br/><br/>Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon portray down-and-out musicians who accidentally witness a mob massacre and immediately flee from the mob as George Raft's character says, ""I don't like no loose ends."" In desperation, they disguise themselves as women - Curtis as ""Josephine"", and Lemmon as ""Daphne"", in order to join an all-girl band and leave town.<br/><br/>Once ""Sugar Cane"" (Monroe) sashays past the pair on the way to the train they're about to board, all bets are off. Staring after her as she walks away, Lemmon, as ""Daphne"" exclaims, ""Would you look at that...That's just like jello on springs!"" The rest of the plot summary I'll leave out. What I will remark on is how really filthy this movie is, for its time. And very gay! The innuendos and double-entendres are priceless. And Lemmon, who had one of the most expressive faces in film, gives an amazing performance. Tony Curtis looks scarily convincing as a woman (Lemmon just looks strange), and Marilyn is hypnotically beautiful and funny at the same time.<br/><br/>This was a woman whom the camera truly loved. Pregnant during the making of the film, she looks just slightly more voluptuous than usual for the time - in fact gorgeous - and in closeups, ethereal, vulnerable, and breathtaking in a way that almost brings tears to the eyes.<br/><br/>Joe E. Brown gives a hilarious performance as ""Daphne's"" suitor, and Tony Curtis gets to give his (passable, but still very funny) Cary Grant impression. Side note: I think it's pretty well known that there has been the legendary rumor for years that Curtis said that ""Kissing Marilyn Monroe was like kissing Hitler"" because of problems on the set with her erratic behavior. In recent years Curtis has claimed that he never made that statement. Whatever the truth, the pair do exhibit really wonderful chemistry in their love scene together, and the skin-colored/sequined dress Marilyn Monroe wears for that sequence is absolutely perfect. She couldn't sit down in it, so a special board/rest was set up for her. <br/><br/>This is a film that still stands the test of time; a true ten-star classic."
"Imboredagain719","Null","5","8","16 April 2004"," A hilarious flick.
","Some like it hot is a great comedy. It seemed to be a bit racy for being made in the late 50's, but maybe that's why it is so popular. The humor in this movie is clever and witty. Minus the wardrobe, the music and the look of the cars, it seems like it would be a movie made today, mainly because of the timeless humor.<br/><br/>
The story line is also very good. The viewer is hooked from the beginning and is on the edge of their seat until the very end. Joe is the undeniable ladies man that plays the sax and Jerry is the paranoid bass player. They take the ride of their lives to save their lives from the mob. They put themselves in a situation that not too many men would be upset about. But jealousy, lies and the fact that they are men gets in the way, causing much humor.<br/><br/>
The acting in this movie is the best thing about it. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon have a great chemistry and are very believable as best friends. Then throw Marilyn Monroe in the mix and you've got a great group of actors with great chemistry. All of the main characters acted with such ease and the parts just seemed to come so naturally to them."
"JPTaylor","9","5","8","18 April 2004"," One of the greatest, most insane screwball comedy ever to grace theaters.
","Some Like It Hot is not an incredibly artistic, graceful film with deeply significant themes of love and sacrifice - it's a screwball comedy.  Yet it is remembered as one of the greatest screwball comedies ever to hit theaters.  It is completely over-the-top, filled with unlikely situations, bizarre coincidences and quirky characters.  <br/><br/>Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis, playing Joe and Jerry, two down-and-out musicians looking for work in Chicago just before the stock market crash of 1929 that would shove America - and the world - into the Great Depression. The two witness a killing by Al Capone's goons - part of the St. Valentine's Day Massacre - and desperately try to escape to where they will never be found.  Without giving away any details, they find themselves in the midst of a rather precarious situation (today, perhaps a comedy cliché - not so then), involving deception, unrequited love, and relationships with a startling number of combinations of genders.<br/><br/>There is a great dynamic between the characters of Lemmon and Curtis.  They are in constant competition to win the heart of Sugar (Marilyn Monroe), a rebellious and decidedly naïve woman who has completely given up on men who are not rich enough to own a yacht.  Lemmon and Curtis are constantly bickering and wanting revenge, yet they are forced to cooperate lest they give away their secret to the onlookers.  Their story gets convoluted the point where it is difficult to remember which is which, with the story's extremely tight pace and the many twists along the way.<br/><br/>One cannot say enough about the about the brilliant comedic acting seen here.  Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis are funny not merely because of their dialogue, but because of their wild energy.  They slip in and out of roles before they even realize what they're doing, going from complacent to angry to scared witless without missing a beat.  Joe E. Brown is sure to get under your skin as Osgood Fielding III.  And Marilyn Monroe - well, she mostly shows a lot of cleavage.<br/><br/>Ultimately ""Some Like it Hot"" is a tightly compressed batch of hilarity. There is a reason why it is listed as the American Film Institute's #1 comedy (although this reviewer doesn't entirely agree with that claim). Modern movie-goers shouldn't be turned off by its black-and-white nature; it puts modern buddy comedies to shame."

","Some like It Hot has to be one of the funniest, most entertaining movies ever!  It is so funny that even the biggest sourpuss in the world would most likely laugh, especially about the very last line of the movie.  This reviewer has seen a lot of movies and Some like it Hot definitely is one of the best.  Old and young alike would enjoy this movie and that is always a good thing.<br/><br/>Out of the entire movie there is only one thing that isn't too great about it.  Sometimes when the characters are running or riding bicycles the camera is angled so that the viewer is looking at them from the front.   The background behind them looks incredibly unreal during these scenes.  It's as if they are in front of a painting and they are riding on one of those bicycle exercise machines.  That is understandable though considering that it is a movie from the 50's.  That is about the only thing that could use some work in the movie.  If that whole scene was changed to be realistic than this movie would be nearly perfect.  It is so, so funny!!!<br/><br/>The acting is great!  All the actors especially, Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon, and Marilyn Monroe, are incredible! They are all so hilarious and their acting doesn't seem at all unreal, in fact, if there had been different actors/actress chosen for this movie, it wouldn't be as good.  Curtis, Lemmon, and Monroe are perfect together and they make for a very entertaining movie.<br/><br/>The movie is in black and white, but it's as if it was in color.  The acting and just the way the movie is made, it all makes it so it's as if you can see what color everything would be if it was in color.  It is definitely not a boring black and white movie.  <br/><br/>Some like it Hot is a great comedy movie and this reviewer doesn't see how anybody could give it less than a 10.   It can be watched over and over again and still be funny.  This one is a definite for your home video library!"

The results some say resulted in the funniest film ever made.<br/><br/>Some Like It Hot concerns a couple of jazz age musicians in 1929 witnessing the murder of informant George E. Stone. Of course the head doer George Raft spots our intrepid duo and Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are forced to flee Chicago.<br/><br/>The getaway plan. Take a gig with an all woman orchestra going south to Florida. The orchestra has Marilyn Monroe as a singer so the trip will have its pleasant diversity.<br/><br/>After the trouble Wilder had with Monroe on The Seven Year Itch he swore he wouldn't do another film with her. But United Artists wanted a big name for box office guarantee before he could get the financing and Curtis and Lemmon weren't big enough. So Monroe was signed and by all accounts the picture was another trial to make for all concerned.<br/><br/>Tony Curtis's feelings were well known about Monroe, he didn't like her. Yet his scenes with her were very funny indeed both with him in drag and doing a spoof of his idol, Cary Grant. <br/><br/>Jack Lemmon was far more philosophical. I saw him in an interview once simply say that Marilyn was a girl with a whole lot of problems and unrealized talent when she died. That's what you would expect from Lemmon, one of the nicest people ever in the film industry.<br/><br/>Jack Lemmon also got an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. But Some Like It Hot ran into the year of Ben-Hur sweeping all the Oscars that year. It wasn't even nominated for Best Picture. Billy Wilder lost for Best Director. The only Oscar it did win was for Orry-Kelly for costume design for those recreations from the Twenties and the special costumes that Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis wore.<br/><br/>Billy Wilder sprinkled his cast with a lot of people identified with the gangster genre. Who more than George Raft who really lived the part in real life. And others like George E. Stone, Mike Mazurki, and Nehemiah Persoff. Pat O'Brien plays the federal man on the trail of the mobsters and in his memoirs O'Brien thanked Billy Wilder profusely for giving him a part in a classic film when his career hit the skids in the Fifties.<br/><br/>Of course the real daring here was Joe E. Brown as the dissolute playboy and his infatuation with Jack Lemmon in drag. Today Brown's character would be really a gay guy who's into drag queens and Lemmon after some initial misgivings might just decide that gay for pay pays a lot better than playing the bull fiddle. But the Code while not broken was stretched a might in Some Like It Hot.<br/><br/>A film that didn't get into the top five in 1959 is now considered the funniest comedy of all time. You won't get any argument from me over that one."

The humor is top notch and very smart. The funniest parts are when Curtis and Lemmon are bickering with each other. Apparently the black and white look was done because both of their makeup made them look so ugly that Wilder thought black and white cinematography would conceal their ugly makeup. Nothing wrong with that though, black and white movies rock!

","'They don't make them like they used to!' We've all heard that saying, but when it comes to this movie, it's very true. This is a 'classic' in every sense of the word. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon star as Joe and Jerry, jazz musicians who inadvertently witness the St. Valentine Day's massacre. Knowing they were spotted and the mobsters are on the lookout for them, they disguise themselves as women and escape to Miami with an all-girl jazz band. Lead singer of the band is Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe) and Joe, now in drag and calling himself Josephine, falls in love with her. Using some male clothing he managed to commandeer, Joe sets out to impress Sugar by pretending to be millionaire heir to Shell Oil. At first, things seem to be going well for him as he changes from 'Josephine' to 'Shell Oil Junior', maintaining both disguises successfully, however for his friend Jerry (using the name Daphne), things aren't as easy as one of Miami's genuine resident senior millionaires, 'Osgood Fielding III', has become smitten with 'her' and does everything to woo Daphne with roses, dinner and dances, and even a proposal of marriage. However, their seemingly complex, but carefree life in Miami is suddenly turned upside down as the hotel they are staying in, is hosting a conference for ""Italian Opera Lovers"", which is actually a cover name for a meeting of mobsters. The gang from Chicago are there along with their leader 'Spats', Joe and Jerry are spotted and realise they must quit the band and leave as soon as they can. Joe in his 'Shell Oil Junior' disguise, breaks Sugar's heart by convincing her that he can't carry on seeing her and has to leave to go and marry a woman his family has 'chosen' for him. After several chases, the guys, still in their drag, hide out in a conference room and again witness a mob killing, this time of 'Spats' and his gang. Now on the run from the other gang, Joe reveals his love and true identity to Sugar and along with Jerry (still dressed as Daphne) and with Osgood's help, the four escape in Osgood's boat heading out to his yacht. In the back of the boat Sugar and Joe confirm their love and kiss, but Jerry tries to dissuade Osgood with a list of reasons why they can't be together, finally pulling off his wig and revealing he is a man, this leads to one of the most famous lines in movie history as Osgood simply replies..'Nobody's perfect'. Directed by the great Billy Wilder, this film is frequently found at the top of lists of the greatest comedies ever made. Keep an ear out for Tony Curtis' impersonation of Cary Grant as he plays 'Shell Oil Junior'. This is a stunning movie and is a 'must' for anyone's DVD collection."

Curtis falls for Marilyn Monroe while Lemmon becomes the centre of affection of an old lout who is at the resort that the band marks as their next stop.

","Some Like It Hot is a retelling of a West German tale titled Fanfaren der Liebe (1951) (Fanfares of Love) beautifully directed by Billy Wilder with an all-star cast including the eternal beauty of Marilyn Monroe, and comedy styling's of Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon. With a central prolific theme that has been told more than once and yet is just as prevalent today as it ever was or will be: What we want and what we need are often two separate things. However, under the expertise of Wilder, the pure star quality of cast and crew shine out all the more. The gags come thick and fast with almost every sequence either a set up for the next gag or a gag in the making. Some Like It Hot is a tale that begins with a bitterly cold February in Chicago 1929, which two musicians find themselves on the run from the mob, after witnessing the Saint Valentines Massacre. Our intrepid hero's Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) disguise themselves as female musicians Josephine (Curtis) and Daphne (Lemmon), and join an all-girl orchestra bound for Miami.<br/><br/>Leaving behind a bitter Chicago winter, they meet the intoxicating Sugar Kane Kowalczyk (Marilyn Monroe), which Jerry remarks ""Look how she moves. Like Jell-O on springs. She must have some sort of built-in motor. I tell you, it's a whole different sex.""(Jack Lemmon Some Like It Hot 1959) Henceforth comedy ensues with the gags coming thick and fast, lightening reflexes with the dialogue between Joe, Jack and Sugar and perfect comedic timing between them. <br/><br/>A testament to all that is womanhood, has yet to be a finer than Marilyn Monroe, seemingly poured into the gowns lovingly crafted by Australian costume designer Orry-Kelly, with neck lines and translucent qualities that would even have the censors of today raising eyebrows. With her classic solo of ""I Wanna Be Loved by You."" Albeit Marilyn does not have the best singing voice, which is superfluous when one considers the situation, a pretty girl standing in front of an orchestra and singing a song. Monroe and Wilder turn it into one of the most blatantly sexual scenes in the movies. <br/><br/>Monroe wears a clinging, see-through dress, gauze covering the upper slopes of her breasts, the neckline scooping to a censor's eyebrow north of trouble. Wilder places her in the centre of a round spotlight that does not simply illuminate her from the waist up, but toys with her like a secondary neckline, dipping and clinging as Monroe moves her body higher and lower in the light with teasing precision.<br/><br/>All the time Monroe seems oblivious to the effect of singing this song so innocently. To experience that scene is to affirm as to why no other actor since, male or female has more sexual chemistry with the camera.<br/><br/>Underneath all the frills, bold sexual symbolism, and gender bending, the movie is ultimately about Joe and Jerry (Curtis and Lemmon) with truly outstanding supporting characters like Osgood Fielding III (Joe E. Brown) and Spats Colombo (George Raft). While Joe (Curtis) when not in drag introduces himself as the Shell Oil heir and wickedly parodies Cary Grant's unmistakable accent in brilliant fashion, so much so that when Daphne/Jerry (Lemmon) says accusingly ""And where did you get that phoney accent? Nobody talks like that!"" Jerry (Lemmon) gets the fuzzy end of the lollipop taking the selfless route and entertains a real millionaire whose yacht is being used by Joe (Curtis) in an attempt to seduce Sugar (Monroe). Daphne (Lemmon) is so unlike a real woman in mannerism as much as appearance that when real millionaire Osgood (Joe E. Brown) attempts to wine and dine him, it is hilarious that he cannot see behind Jerry's (Lemmon) disguise. With Osgood seducing Jerry (Lemmon) on the dance floor and Joe (Curtis) seducing Sugar (Monroe) on the yacht is both romantic and wickedly funny at the same time. The payoff happens during the following morning, when Joe returns to their room to find Jerry now engaged to Osgood. Keep an eye Jack Lemmon (Jerry/Daphne) during this scene; he is so energetic, so full of life, almost to the point of hamming it up with his castanets. Jerry/Daphne (Lemmon) is exquisite in this sequence. He is deliriously happy at finding his soul mate. He is so hilariously convincing that even when asked by Joe (Curtis), ""Why would a guy want to marry a guy?"" that we completely buy it when he answers, ""Security!"" Even though the violence in this gem of the silver screen is neither satire nor comedy but visceral and grim, which adds to the overall feel that the Hero's (Joe and Jerry) very lives are in peril and we joyously buy every gag and punch line that Billy Wilder expertly delivers to us. I do not believe I am alone in the opinion that Wilder was one of the greatest filmmakers of the 20th century. Escaping Europe before World War II, Wilder set about commenting on the world around him with a sensibility and awareness seldom seen in cinema today. Yet he could create a film that, yes has a darker undertone of the mob's ruthlessness, but oh so wonderfully light hearted and romantic characters that once they realized what they wanted wasn't what they needed, and that they needed no pretence to attain what they desired. Simply put Some Like It Hot is one of those timeless classics that are just as relevant and amusing today as it was when it was released. It captured one of those great moments in movie-making, where a film no longer is a simple representative of its period, but has transcended itself to become something that is truly timeless. Osgood (Brown) delivers the best curtain line in the movies. If you have seen the movie, you know what it is, and if you have not, you deserve to hear it for the first time from him."

","Some Like it Hot is an exhilarating comedy that follows two struggling musicians that witness the St. Valentine's Day Massacre in Chicago 1929 and they try to escape the Mob. To get away from the Mob they joined an all women's band going to Miami but the only problem is they're both men. Joe and Jerry both pull off the role of women perfectly because they acted like women good enough that it fooled other people to think that they were women. I would say that the element of disguise is a good way to describe both of them. Both of their instruments played a pivotal role in why they got to Miami, Joe and Jerry play two instruments that the women's band needed. I would say that it provided Joe and Jerry with an escape and way to get away from the Mob and start a new life in Florida once they were done with disguising themselves and women.<br/><br/>In the movie I believe that Joe and Jerry played the role of two women perfectly and it was good writing. They disguised themselves well enough to blend in with the band and become one of the girls. None of the women in the band thought that they were men. With both of the personalities that they were given in the movie as men, Joe and Jerry transferred it as women very good. For me this is the earliest movie of guys disguising themselves as women and during the time this movie was made, it was done very well. There are some things that come in pairs or grouped together in this movie. During that time that Joe and Jerry are women they both attracted to the same woman, Sugar Kane, who is played by Marilyn Monroe in this film. They both fall for her when they realize that she in the same band that they ""joined"". They also go on dates, but Joe dresses up as a rich man to impress Sugar, while on the other hand Jerry ""attracts"" a rich man named Osgood. Also there is an important shooting scenes that happened that can go together. In the beginning, Joe and Jerry witness the St. Valentine's Day Massacre, where the Mob leader, Spats and his men kill another gang in a parking garage. At the end of the movie the head Mob boss has a ""surprise"" for Spats. They had a cake for Spats but what he didn't know was that there was an assassin in the cake who shoots Spats and his men.<br/><br/>From watching a few movies similar to Some Like it Hot I kind of knew that to expect, but there was some stuff that I saw that I didn't expect to see in it. I was surprised that the girls in the band wouldn't see the signs that Joe and Jerry could possibly be a man and that adds to the creativeness that they had to blend in like women. I think today it would be a lot easier for a girl notice that a guy is disguising themselves as a girl. Back in the late 20's, women really wore the same clothing and looked the same, so blending in with late 20's women society would be easier back then, than doing it today. All Cross dress runaway films are comedy. Some like it Hot is my MLK film, therefore it is a comedy.<br/><br/>From watching this movie there are some new things that I learn. Even though this is the first time that I have seen Some Like I Hot, there are a few things that I recognized. It seemed really easy for Joe and Jerry to be like the women in the band because they just acted the opposite of their personality and they seemed to blend in very well. From what I also saw, it seems that women are still looking for the same type of men that women are today. Women would want the kind, gentle, down to earth gentleman that would treat a woman right. I saw that in the movie and I believe that is what women wanted in a man back in 1929.<br/><br/>Some Like it Hot is an exciting Comedic film that follows two musicians that witness a shooting, who escape Chicago and try to restart their lives. Trouble is they have to dress up as women to join a band to get out, I guess cross dressing does work."
"Desertman84","10","3","4","27 February 2012"," Marilyn Monroe's Best Performance
","Some Like It Hot is a comedy film that was directed by Billy Wilder and it starred Marilyn Monroe, Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon and George Raft. The supporting cast includes Joe E. Brown, Pat O'Brien and Nehemiah Persoff. The film is a remake by Wilder and I. A. L. Diamond of a 1935 French movie, Fanfare d'Amour, from the story by Robert Thoeren and Michael Logan, which was itself remade in 1951 by German director Kurt Hoffmann as Fanfaren der Liebe. However, both the French and German films were without the gangsters that are an integral part of the plot of Some Like It Hot. Wilder's working title for his film was Fanfares of Love, then Not Tonight, Josephine before he decided on Some Like It Hot as its release title.<br/><br/>The launching pad for Billy Wilder's comedy classic was a rusty old German farce, Fanfares of Love, whose two main characters were male musicians so desperate to get a job that they disguise themselves as women and play with an all-girl band in gangster-dominated 1929 Chicago. In this version, musicians Joe and Jerry lose their jobs when a speakeasy owned by mob boss Spats Columbo is raided by prohibition agent Mulligan. Several weeks later, on February 14th, Joe and Jerry get a job performing in Urbana and end up witnessing a gangland massacre in a parking garage. Fearing that they will be next on the mobsters' hit lists, Joe devises an ingenious plan for disguising their identities. Soon they are all dolled up and performing as Josephine and Daphne in Sweet Sue's all-girl orchestra. En route to Florida by train with Sweet Sue's band, the boys (or girls?) make the acquaintance of Sue's lead singer Sugar Kane. Joe and Jerry immediately fall in love, though of course their new feminine identities prevent them from acting on their desires. Still, they are determined to woo her, and they enact an elaborate series of gender-bending ruses complicated by the fact that flirtatious millionaire Osgood Fielding has fallen in love with ""Daphne."" The plot gets even thicker when Spats Columbo and his boys show up in Florida. <br/><br/>Nominated for several Oscars, Some Like It Hot ended up the biggest moneymaking comedy up to 1959. Full of hilarious set pieces and movie in-jokes, it has not tarnished with time and in fact seems to get better with each passing year, as its cross-dressing humor keeps it only more and more up-to-date.This was also Marilyn Monroe's best performance in her legendary acting career.Overall,this comedy is one of the enduring treasures of the movies, a film of inspiration and meticulous craft for movies like this, with a sense of humor that is as broad as it can be sophisticated, come along only infrequently."

","Well, dear fellow film lovers: If you ain't seen this one you ain't seen nuttin'! A few years ago, ""Some like it hot"" was rated the greatest comedy ever made and though I do not much care for -- or believe in -- such ratings the fact is that I was readily in agreement with this one and I continue to think so.<br/><br/>It is a film full of verve, sharp dialog, stinging one-liners, quick pace, imaginative chase sequences, and possibly the quickest-witted ending answer in the history of the cinema: Nobody's perfect! Yep, too true, nobody is perfect - but in this movie director Billy Wilder came as close to the Holy Grail of a perfectly directed movie as I can remember: Marilyn was at her most sensual and in the best acting form I ever saw from her; Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon, Joe E. Brown and George Raft peerless; and the supporting cast of Nehemiah Persoff, George E. Stone, and many others was marvellous. Absolutely no weaknesses in the acting that I could detect.<br/><br/>Finally, a word about the outstanding photography in the ""film noir"" tradition yet never interferes with the smooth narrative.<br/><br/>What a movie!

","Some Like It Hot is #14 on the American Film Institutes' Top 100 movies of all time. It's probably the best screwball comedy ever. <br/><br/>Tony Curtis is a saxophone player and Jack Lemmon is a bass player who accidentally witness the 1929 St. Valentine's Day massacre in Chicago. To hide from the mob they dress as women and join an all girls' band that happens to have Marilyn Monroe as a singer. They ride on a train to a gig in Miami with all the girls and you can imagine what problems they encounter. Along the way, Tony Curtis falls for Marilyn and an old rich coot Joe E. Brown falls for Jack Lemmon who he thinks is a woman, of course.<br/><br/>Jack Lemmon could never top his performance here as Jerry/Daphne. His portrayal as a woman with bad lipstick, ill-fitting dresses, and treacherous high heels is hysterical.<br/><br/>Marilyn Monroe is an absolute knockout and this film shows her at her sexiest. She was also a great comedic actress.<br/><br/>Tony Curtis is excellent as straight man to Jack Lemmon.<br/><br/>The entire supporting cast is terrific and Billy Wilder's direction is right on. There isn't anything ""wrong"" about this great film. The photography is superb and the dialog is perfect.<br/><br/>Of course, Joe E.

"esteban1747","8","3","4","30 August 2003"," An extraordinary and very funny comedy
","I do not remember how many times I have seen this comedy and each time I enjoy it. When I want to sit looking at a good film, ""Some like it hot"" is a very good option. This comedy had real ingredients of the period of dry law in US, which gave a nice and reasonable plot. Marilyn Monroe and Tony Curtis were great, simply one of the best looking couple of the former cinema. George Raft acted in the role of gangster. I do not think that this role was difficult for Raft, someone that during the 50s was always working in nightclubs and casinos in Havana linked to the foreign and internal maffia at that time, so it was easy to him to do what he used to do in his real life. Pat O'Brien acted not as a priest as usual but as a good inspector-detective. But better than all this was the acting of Jack Lemmon and Joe E. Brown (whom we used to call ""Big mouth"" or ""Bocasa"" in Spanish), both gave the necessary ingredients to make this comedy one of the greatest of all time. The film is good from the beginning until the end, but certain scenes were simply the funniest, one of them when Curtis and Lemmon were having a chat with the nearly naked ladies in the train at night, the other one when Marilyn met Curtis in the yacht and Curtis showed falsely no feeling for kisses of Marilyn, but again the best came at the end when Lemmon told Brown that he was a man and Brown told him that it does not matter because nobody is perfect."

"jaredmobarak","8","4","6","6 January 2008"," Where did you get that phony accent? Nobody ""talks loike thet!""Some Like It Hot
","I was finally able to catch up with what many people call the funniest movie ever made, Some Like It Hot. This is now the first and only film I have seen with Marilyn Monroe as well as directed by Billy Wilder. The hype on these two seem to be correct and I look forward to checking out more from both. However, the real success of the film is the portrayal of our two leads by Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis. Both bring a fantastic comedic element to the story and play their roles to perfection. So many films afterwards have taken the general plot linetwo people see a gang shooting and run away/change identities to not get killed only to end up running into the mobsters coincidentally in the city they have relocated to, and remade it. None of them come close to the level of achievement that this one has, way back in 1959.<br/><br/>Right from the get-go, seeing the thug/big-nosed Italians hiding in the back of a hearse in order to smuggle whiskey during Prohibition, we know exactly what we are in for. Wilder allows the story to play out on both a dramatic and comedic level, never straying too far into one to let the other fall away. Sure there are some laughs at the start, especially between Lemmon and Curtis in the funeral bar and a couple moments poking fun at the ""coffee"" code language, but only after the two go on the lam as women instrument players in Florida do the big laughs come. The two men are just so manly that looking at them in drag brings a smile to your face, let alone when they actually talk. Lemmon is brilliant as Daphne, the loquacious girl that likes to talk too much and have fun, slowly getting so good at being a female he starts to believe he is one. ""Just keep telling yourself you're a boy."" As for Curtis, he shines as three separate roles. He must be believable as the gambling, womanizing, sax player Joe; the millionaire, yacht-owning Shell Oil tycoon; and the best friend, Conservatory-trained musician Josephine. Each character is created and used to enhance all the others as he tries to con Marilyn Monroe's Sugar into falling in love with him.<br/><br/>Monroe plays the flighty blonde to great success. She continually calls herself dumb and the words that come out of her mouth, as well as the believing of all the drivel that comes from Curtis' tycoon (some real funny lines), prove that fact. Being that I had always heard she wasn't too bad an actress, I wasn't quite sure what to expect since my impression of her was more model used to sell seats, not any skill at the craft. While she is definitely radiantly beautiful here, I have to believe she isn't just being the pretty face. Yes, she gets top-billing, but although she isn't in the movie for that much compared to her co-stars, she does well with the time she is given. I'm not sure how successful the movie would have been without her to have the boys play off of. The glowing smile and sex appeal are one thing, but her scene of depression upon being dumped shows a vulnerability and strength through tears, yet keeping a calm, collected voice, show that maybe there really was something there.<br/><br/>Where the film really works is with the situations brought about by the duality of our leads. Their fighting with themselves and each other, sometimes forgetting what sex they are at the moment, let alone truly are, is priceless. Lemmon's fast-talking naïveté gets him to bring the biggest laughs, thanks in part to a wonderful supporting role from Joe E. Brown as Osgood Fielding III, but Curtis is right there behind him. His machismo, used to put Lemmon in line, contrasted to his gentility, when with Monroe, is spot-on, as is the accent of affluence used to win her heart. Credit goes to Wilder for one of the best scenes from the film involving all four characters. The transitional cuts between Curtis and Monroe, attempting to let him feel love again, with Fielding and Lemmon, cutting up the tango dance floor, are absolutely hilarious. The juxtaposition of Daphne's tall, muscular frameat times leading the dancewith the small, thin, elderly Brown can't be viewed without some amount of giggling.<br/><br/>It may not be the funniest film I have ever seen, but I can totally see where people are coming from when making that statement. Released just before the 1960's, this film can be seen as incredibly influential to the comedy genre and cinema in general. One-liners are present throughout and the acting is professionally handled at all times, bringing the laughs, but also staying grounded for those moments of seriousness when relationships are failing and death seems awfully close at hand. I hope to catch up with more work from all four principals here, to view some movies of an era I am not very proficient in, and to hopefully enjoy myself as much as I did here."
"ackstasis","9","4","6","16 December 2007"," ""I don't care how rich he is, as long as he has a yacht, his own private railroad car, and his own toothpaste.""
","If films directors could be characterised as different types of beverages, then Billy Wilder would surely be the glass of sparkling champagne. To date, I've seen three of his films {the other two being 'Double Indemnity (1944)' and 'Sunset Blvd. (1950)'}, and every single one absolutely brims with class, a triumph of witty writing and procificient direction. Even though 'Some Like It Hot (1959)' was voted #1 in the American Film Institute's '100 Years 100 Laughs,' I didn't initially consider it the sort of film that I would enjoy. After all, who wants to watch a movie about men dressing up as women? Needless to say, I had completely underestimated the talent of both Wilder and his terrific cast, and 'Some Like It Hot' revealed itself to be a very funny film, indeed. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon star as two jazz musicians who witness the Saint Valentine's Day Massacre of 1929 and are forced to flee Chicago posing as two members of an all-girls band. Comedic sparks fly when both men fall for sexy blonde vocalist ""Sugar Kane"" Kowalczyk (Marilyn Monroe) and, maintaining their female disguises, begin to fight for her affection.<br/><br/>The most astonishing thing about 'Some Like It Hot' is that it never goes to where you expect it. The script, co-written by Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond {from a story by Robert Thoeren and Michael Logan}, is basically a romantic screwball comedy, but with flourishes of the film-noir and gangster genres, most noticeable in the scenes featuring hardened mob-boss Spats Colombo (George Raft). Not many comedies open the proceedings with the brutal, cold-blooded murder of seven men, but Wilder's film does, and it's executed in such a way that, somehow, the unexpected scenes of violence never seem out of place. At the very least, these sinister events provide the perfect incentive for Curtis and Lemmon to throw on a dress, a wig and some make-up, their facade wholly believable in the face of such an unpleasant alternative. Wilder filmed 'Some Like It Hot' in black-and-white, not only to evoke the appopriate time-period, but, more importantly, to obscure the unavoidable imperfections in the men's make-up. Though the end result isn't very convincing at all  as a male, I certainly wouldn't make the mistake of approaching either Josephine or Daphne  it requires a suspension of disbelief that we're more-than-willing to make.<br/><br/>The comedic duo of Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon works extremely well. Curtis tends to appear rather self-conscious posing as a woman, finding more comfort as the multi-millionaire heir to Shell Oil, as whom to poses to win over Sugar Kane. On the other hand, Lemmon is entirely uninhibited as Daphne, exploding into feverish episodes of feminine behaviour that lead us to believe that perhaps his performance as a woman has convinced even himself. While Curtis' Joe (a.k.a. Josephine) spends his time attempting to woo Marilyn Monroe (whose character, self-described as being not particularly bright, absolutely oozes sexuality), Lemmon's Jerry (a.k.a. Daphne) finds that he has larger problems, as an obsessed old millionaire, Osgood Fielding III (Joe E. Brown), falls in love with him. Keeping the entertainment level as high as possible at all times, Wilder thankfully denies us the seemingly-inevitable, clichéd moral lesson that usually arises once the supporting characters discover the true identity of their girlfriends. Most legendary of all is the reaction of Osgood Fielding, in the film's final line, as Jerry admits that he is merely a man posing as a woman: ""Well, nobody's perfect."""

She was good in the Seven Year Itch and the Misfits, so critics can't say she only had one great movie. But this is my favorite because she is cute, funny and somehow sexy and innocent at the same time. I have a feeling that's the way she really was in life. She couldn't help that she had that great skin and sex appeal. Would this movie be on nearly everyone's favorite 100 movies without her? Curtis and Lemmon are great, along with the supporting actors - Joe E Brown (Nobody's Perfect Line one of the all time great quotes.

Thank you Billy for this wonderful film, but I really don't think it holds a candle to some of the great works of Chaplin or Keaton. It is not as funny as the finest works of the Marx Bros.<br/><br/>No, not the greatest comedy, but perhaps, yes, perhaps the most entertaining comedy of the cinema. It is the kind of film where you inwardly give a little squeal of pleasure as each unlikely twist of the plot falls into place. When Jerry refers to men as 'dirty beasts' it sends a shiver of pleasure down the spine with utter certainty. This is situation comedy that makes 'Friends' look like Mother Courage. The real art in this farce-like structure is to keep all of the complications bubbling along and Wilder & Diamond do this just about perfectly.<br/><br/>So now I feel mean-spirited for not praising this lovely film more fulsomely.

Driven by the outstanding performances of three top-notch stars in Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis and the one and only Marilyn Monroe, Some Like It Hot will make you smile, make you laugh and maybe even make you cry but only because you're laughing so hard at times. If you go in expecting the greatest movie ever, you may end up being a touch disappointed. If you go in with more reasonable expectations you can't help but enjoy this delightful screwball comedy.<br/><br/>The setup of this film's plot almost guarantees comic gold and sure enough it pays off. Curtis and Lemmon play Joe and Jerry, two musicians in Prohibition-era Chicago who witness a mob hit and have to get the heck out of town before they end up dead. They end up donning dresses, posing as women and joining an all-girl orchestra headed for Florida. Reborn, so to speak, as Josephine and Daphne the pair plan to ditch the band and resume their normal, non-dress wearing, lives as soon as they hit Florida. But on their new orchestra's train ride to the Sunshine State there is a complication. That complication comes in the shape (and oh what a shape!) of singer/ukulele player Sugar Kane Kowalczyk, played by the incomparable Monroe. Needless to say our two men find themselves very much attracted to the bubbly, beautiful Sugar. Of course the fact that they are ""women"" very much complicates things. Hilarity ensues.<br/><br/>Once the orchestra hits Florida this film really takes off. Joe, or Josephine if you prefer, decides he and Jerry/Daphne should stick around for a while. Taking a break from being disguised as a woman, and now posing as a Shell Oil millionaire, Joe tries to woo Sugar. Meanwhile an actual millionaire falls for ""Daphne"" which obviously causes all kinds of complications for Jerry. Much of what ensues is simply priceless. There are a few jokes and gags which fall flat but there is so much here that works you forgive the film for the moments which don't quite measure up. And given the rather juvenile nature of so many modern comedies the more subtle nature of the comedy here is a blessed relief. This movie presents a truly ridiculous situation but it's never over the top. Director Billy Wilder found just the right tone to make the film work and the truly remarkable cast brings the story to life. There are some terrific supporting performances but it is the big three of Monroe, Curtis and Lemmon who really make this film work. What can you say about Marilyn Monroe that hasn't already been said? She simply owns the screen. Watch her perform the song ""I Wanna Be Loved by You"" and I dare you not to fall in love. If this film has a straight man, Curtis is it. He's suave, reserved, and altogether perfect no matter which disguise he happens to be in at any given moment. But in this film it may be Lemmon who shines most of all. He pours his heart and soul into being ""Daphne"" and it is an absolute treat to watch. Curtis and Monroe are both terrific and certainly have their share of moments and witty one-liners but the best moments and best lines seem to be reserved for Lemmon. It's obvious Lemmon had a lot of fun making this film. You'll have a lot of fun watching it. So what if it's not the ""best comedy ever""? It's a wonderfully written, brilliantly performed, incredibly enjoyable film. That's more than enough to make it well worth your while."

","I'm sure everything about this movie that needs to be said has already been said. It is one of the greatest movie comedies ever made, if not the greatest. THE classic among classics.<br/><br/>There are quite a few goofs in it, but who cares? The film is one hilarious goof after another, both intentionally and accidentally.<br/><br/>Even the fact that never would anyone mistake either Jack Lemmon or Tony Curtis (whether in drag or not) as anything but full-blooded heterosexual males, doesn't deter one away from the enjoyment. In fact it adds to it.<br/><br/>I have watched this film countless times, and never tire of it. It always leaves me in good humour, particularly after what has to be the best line of the whole movie, i.e the closing remark ""nobody's perfect"". That may be so, but ""Some like it Hot"" is the perfect tonic for the blues."
"FilmOtaku","7","6","11","7 September 2004"," A film that will always endure the test of time
","There are certain films that are just so 'classic' that when one mentions it, they are usually met with a knowing smile. 'Some Like it Hot', directed by the great Billy Wilder is one of those films. <br/><br/>'Some Like it Hot' is Wilder's gender-bending comedy wherein two small time musicians, Gerald (Jack Lemmon) and Joe (Tony Curtis) find themselves witnesses to the St. Valentine's Day massacre in Chicago, 1929. They escape, only to find that the only way they can afford to leave town is by dressing up as women and joining an all-woman band traveling to Florida. When Sugar (Marilyn Monroe), a singer and band member enters the picture, the two men fight over her and come up with ways to romance her, while trying to keep their identities (and genders) secret. This works out better for Joe, who finds himself falling for her, while Lemmon ends up with a romantic interest of his own. All the while, the two are threatened with discovery by the band leader, and eventually, by the gangsters who have been holding a nationwide search for them.<br/><br/>I actually watched 'Some Like it Hot' during a Film Club meeting and realized that I had seen this film about a dozen and a half times. Instead of being bored, however, I was afforded the luxury of 'discovering' certain things that I either hadn't noticed before, or had at least glossed over. One thing is that the script is really quite good. Not only does 'Some Like it Hot' have arguably the greatest last line of any film ever, but some of the rapid fire dialogue is hilarious; made even better by the great delivery by the actors. Lemmon and Curtis are always good, but Monroe, while not a great actress is good in this film, and has seriously never looked more beautiful. One other element is some of the chances the film took. There were some risqué scenes and lines that I still am stunned made it through the censors at the time. ('It's not how long it takes; it's who's taking you.')<br/><br/>Many good things have been said about 'Some Like it Hot', and most of it is true. It is truly a classic film, and Wilder is a brilliant filmmaker whose diversity is almost unparalleled. Check it out if you haven't seen it.<br/><br/>--Shelly"
"uscmd","5","18","45","18 July 2004"," I think its over rated.
","I think this movie is a great example of the double standard used to rate movies. Its obviously got a great cast, and has its moments, but there's no way I see this as the ""number 1 comedy of all time"" or ""the #11 movie"" as shown in IMDb.<br/><br/>I think (and this is really true with some foreign films) that sometimes the director's reputation or the prior history of some of the stars, creates a bias. And once a movie gets over rated, its nearly impossible for the collective public to reverse that impression.<br/><br/>I think that ""old boy"" system works both ways....under valuing some films by new directors, as well as grossly over rating films by old timers.<br/><br/>Back to this movie specifically....there are holes in the plot you could drive a truck through, and many of ""the gags"" are worth a smile at best. Not a single belly laugh in the entire movie.<br/><br/>But then, according to our ratings, the only comedy rated above Some like it hot, in the last 45 years, was the movie Jim Carrey made in 2004, that was in and out of the theaters in 15 minutes. (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind).<br/><br/>Personally I laughed my butt off in Airplane the first time I saw it, and every time I see ""Trains, planes and automobiles,"" and neither of those are even in the top 50, comedy wise.<br/><br/>Often I think, that despite 45 years of studying cinema, including university level courses in cinema theory/appreciation, that there's just more to their evaluation then I understand.<br/><br/>Watch it....but keep the expectations to a minimum and you might just enjoy it."

","Every genre has to be judged by its own standards. To be good, a drama film should be interesting, a mystery film should be mysterious and surprising, a musical should have good songs, a horror film should be frightening, and more to the point here, a comedy should be funny. There. I said it. A comedy should at some point have some joke that is in some way amusing. This seems to me to be a pretty solid and logical test of quality. And going by it, Some Like it Hot is not a good movie. In fact, it's an utterly terrible movie. Don't accuse me of being unable to deal with subtle humor; I can. P.G. Wodehouse and Henry Fielding are subtle, and I really like them. This isn't subtle. This is really in your face and painfully, dreadfully unfunny. There seriously isn't one joke in this that isn't massively predictable and totally unamusing. And as for the acting? They're not brilliant performances. They're really, really annoying, and it made me happy when all three of the main characters just stopped talking. This is a comedy, and a comedy is supposed to be funny. This isn't funny, and so it's a catastrophic failure. I suppose I'm happy for those of you as can find something to enjoy here, but I really don't get what it is."
"bobbaxter","10","5","9","13 July 2006"," Cross Dressing and Cross Purposes
","Hidden identity is a running theme in SOME LIKE IT HOT. Two musicians, Jerry and Joe (Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis) witness a brutal Mob hit orchestrated by ""Spats"" Colombo (George Raft). This is Chicago in 1929. Our two heroes know how the Mob deals with potential witnesses. They respond, in typical screwball comedy fashion, by disguising themselves as women, joining an all-girls band and fleeing to Florida. This doesn't really make sense, but hey, it's screwball comedy. It's not supposed to make sense.<br/><br/>Of course, our two cross-dressing fugitives run into the ultimate real woman: Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe). We know that at least one of them will end up in love with her, just as we know that a showdown with Spats is inevitable. It's the film's other twists and turns that make it unpredictable.<br/><br/>There is one more predictable twist to the movie: a man will fall in love with one of our cross-dresing fugitives. The fall guy is millionaire Osgood Fielding (Joe E. Brown), who delivers the film's ultimate punch line. Naturally, Fielding passes up all of the beautiful women in the band and woos the homeliest gal of the bunch. He introduces himself in a priceless scene in which each punch line sets up the next. Eventually, Fielding tangoes with ""Daphne"" (Lemmon) while ""Josephine"" (Curtis) disguises himself as a millionaire and lures Sugar to Fielding's yacht. Brown and Lemmon tango with superb comic timing, even passing a rose back and forth between their teeth. Meanwhile, Curtis and Monroe engage in one of filmdom's most famous love scenes.<br/><br/>Dialogue drives SOME LIKE IT HOT. It's high-octane dialogue, too. The script, by director Billy Wilder and screenwriter I. A. L. Diamond, is a marathon of punch lines. Even the best visual gags usually have a line or two of dialogue to set them up or follow them. Usually, the dialogue comments the film's oddball situations. For instance, when we first see Jerry and Joe in drag, they complain about how hard it is to walk in high heels. Sugar immediately appears, gracefully strutting in heels through some well-timed puffs of steam. The men see her and comment, ""It's like a whole other sex!""<br/><br/>Like its main characters, SOME LIKE IT HOT is in disguise. It features gangsters, but it's not a gangster film. It has musical numbers, but it's not a musical. It's really a comedy about sex, and nothing more. It firmly cemented Marilyn Monroe's reputation. She is the benchmark, the ultimate sex symbol against which all others are measured."

","This is a fun movie for almost anyone. It combines the talents of Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon, Billy Wilder, George Raft (old time gangster/actor), Joe E. Brown and, don't worry, I didn't forget Marilyn Monroe. She is great in this but so is everyone else. It might be hard to imagine Tony and Jack as girls but when they make their transition they do it completely having brand new personalities. Tony does three characters here.<br/><br/> Joe E. Brown has the best line in the movie right at the end of the film so don't miss the last few minutes. This is a chase film with the two male leads running from a gang of murderers. Tony and Jack don women's clothing to make their escape and join an all girl band.<br/><br/> The girlish appeal of these two guys is right up there with Dustin Hoffman's ""Tootsie."" I would have liked to have seen a sequel with all these characters but they did not do sequels back in the 50s.<br/><br/> If they redid this today I cannot imagine anyone who would be able to do any of the major roles."

","Set in 1929, prohibition and alcohol is definitely one of many undertones to this film. Two men, Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are musicians with very bad luck and who can't seem to make ends meet. In the middle of winter in New York City the two men witness a mob whacking and now have criminals chasing after them. Their luck seems to change when they pose as women to play in an all girl band headed for Florida. As they meet their train for the job, they are dressed as women, and you can't help to think `those are two ugly chicks'. This film being made in the 1950's, is about cross dressers and a little hint of homosexuality, with Marilyn Monroe seducing her audience with her good looks, its hard to believe that people would stomach this film as a family movie while Leave it to Beaver is playing on the television at home.<br/><br/>
Some like it hot ironically portrays Monroe's real life where alcohol is her first and only resort, and her trouble with men and love. Her role is the stupid blonde that can't really think or do for herself, and that women are just gold diggers. Even though her role is stereotypical she is a very convincing actress.<br/><br/>Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are great actors and a great pair for this film. Totally hilarious is an understatement as two men posed as women are fighting for affection of the same girl. The scene where they break their feminine characters are great.<br/><br/>The music is great from hot Jazz to smooth classical, the right music is in the right scene at just the right time, which adds to the emotion of the characters.<br/><br/>There is also some great action scenes in some like it hot. The most impressive is in the beginning as the cops are chasing a car full of mobsters, gunfire and car crashes fill the screen. Even though it's a 50's film it was just as effective as today.<br/><br/>Some like it hot is a great family film, in which you will have fun just watching it. This film is highly recommended and a great piece to add to your home video library."

Desperate to flee for their lives, they take a job as two women musicians in a girl's traveling band. <br/><br/>	Who other to be in the girls traveling band than Marilyn Monroe, the sexy, seductive, cute and spunky sex icon of the 50s.  This, on top of the absolutely hilarious plot, makes for one great movie.  Playing off of Marilyn's sexuality, the whole movie is basically based on the Joe and Jerry's attraction and yearns for sugar, yet, obviously, it is out of the question.<br/><br/>	Having a very well casted crew and the perfect idea, plot, and quite a hilarious ending, this turns out to be quite an enjoyable movie.  Obviously, being based a lot on sexual desire, you may not want your children to watch this movie, but it is very gratifying to any audience of a slightly higher age. 	 	If you have heard any positive things of this movie, you have heard right. The only great movies are the ones made in the good ol' black and white days.  Overall, this movie receives a 9/10 for everything within it."
"carlgt1","8","5","10","25 February 2001"," A fun movie, but perhaps overrated?
","It's a funny movie but I'm a little amazed that it appears as the #1 comedy movie of all time with the AFI, and even at IMDB it's #50 (ahead of Chaplin & Marx Bros classics among others).  Yet compare the size of the ""memorable quotes"" page from ""Duck Soup"" to ""Some Like It Hot.""  The characters & love interests were all a bit shallow, and it wasn't a revolutionary film or anything like Chaplin & Marx Bros.  So I don't really understand what makes it a top-rated movie.  Is it a revolutionary film just because it had guys in drag in 1950's ""square"" America?<br/><br/>On the other hand, to answer another critic here, it's silly to compare a screen legend like Marylin Monroe to a 90's plastic-surgery legend and non-actress like Pamela Lee Anderson etc.  They had actresses back then, not aerobicized bimbos who's best performances were with Tommy Lee on Internet-downloaded movie clips.   ""Some Like It Hot"" is better than most dreck put out nowadays but I can't really see giving it higher than an 8 of 10, 3 of 4 stars, B grade, etc."

","A film containing at least one of the best actors of the 50's and 60' Jack Lemmon. I feel he is the star of the film and carries to an extent some of the other performances. The film is well set in the 1929 period and faithful to the period detail. However I feel despite being a huge Jack Lemmon Fan that it has not faired well from the passage of time. With a lot of films of 40 to 50 years ago there is a tendency to view with rosy coloured glasses and not from having sat through it again and critically evaluated it. The humour is particularly dated and the plot with honesty thin. Okay it was a great film for its time, but films have improved in the 48 years since this was made."

Then there is the chance to see Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis in drag for much of the movie - Lemmon, as daft Daphne, looks a fright but puts in a great, bubbly, comic performance as the girl who really does snare her own millionaire; while Curtis, as the overly made-up Josephine, sashays about with some style, while also appearing as a mock playboy who talks like Cary Grant (allegedly).<br/><br/>George Raft is the gangleader the 'girls' are running away from; while Joe E Brown is great as Daphne's beau Osgood, a man who after lots of marriages to show girls will marry just about anyone!

"saamejlali","9","2","3","29 April 2016"," challenging the hegemonic discourse
","In the scene (Transformation) from the film 'Some Like it Hot"" 1959, directed and produced by Billy wilder, we see Joe (Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) startled after they have witnessed a gangster murder scene that takes place in the 1929 Chicago. In an earlier scene the two musicians are looking for job and when they get offered an all paid gig in Florida they are very happy. However soon they will find out that the job is for women musician only. Here we have Joe looking frustrated and trying to come up with some other ideas while Jerry tells Joe what if they did it. What if they took the gig and pose as women. Now Originally Joe is against this idea and asks Jerry if he is out of his mind. But soon after, they find out that the gangsters are looking for them. Thus Joe decides to make the call and accept the gig in Florida. Now this is where it gets interesting. Here we have Joe, the alpha male making the call to accept the gig and as soon as he starts the conversation, he is able to switch his voice to a female voice on cue, without thinking about it. At the same time we have Jerry surprised and trying to copy and imitate Joe's voice and behavior. Next we get a cut to the next scene, were Joe and Jerry are dressed up as drag. In this scene they use (low angle tracking shot with top lighting) as they are walking side by side. Jerry is having a hard time walking in his outfit and his legs look more spread apart then Joe as they walk down the train station. Then we get another (tracking shot) and we see Jerry now known as Daphne, looking at Joe, now known as Josephine. Jerry takes one look at Joe as they are walking and he quickly turns around again to get a second look (POV shot). He seems confused as how easy it is for Joe to walk in that outfit so comfortably. He regains his composure and tries to imitate Joe. Once they see the girls boarding the train Jerry starts having doubts and tells Joe that it is no use and that ""we cannot get away with this Joe."" Joe reminds him that the name is Josephine now and tells him that, ""wasn't this your idea?"" Again, here we have the more masculine guy accepting his feminine persona more easily as the less masculine guy is confused and doubtful about his. For its time, this movie was revolutionary in my opinion. In challenging the hegemonic discourse of the time, or perhaps even now. Not only it challenged the idea of male masculinity but it also challenged heterosexuality and homosexuality such as (LGBT) politics. It renders the idea of biology mute and it instead creates a gray area of preference for sex. This is where we can apply the notion of queer theory. ""queer theory challenges notions of homosexuality and heterosexuality within the mainstream discourse, and instead posits an understanding of sexuality that emphasizes shifting boundaries, ambivalence's, and cultural constructions that change depending on historical and cultural context."" Adapted in part from Brooker, A Concise Glossary of Cultural Theory. <br/><br/>To further help explain my point of view, in the next scene we have Sugar (Marilyn Monroe) walking towards the wagon in the train station. Jerry that is somewhat confused and having a hard time, signals at Joe and lets him know of her presence. (POV shot to Sugar, eye line match, low angle tracking shot to her legs.) In this scene Sugar is walking with the same confidence as Jerry, when he was walking down the runway in train station. They even have somewhat similar jackets with fur and they both are making the same duck face with their lips. Both guys are sexually attracted to Sugar. But in the end we have Joe, the guy that is more masculine and able to switch back and forth between his personalities more easily ending up with Sugar. Mainly because he is confident of his masculinity. Then we have Jerry who also likes girls but towards the end he seems like he does not mind if he ends up with a guy. When later on Jerry tells Joe that he is engaged, Joe says ""congratulations who is the lucky girl?"" Jerry replies ""me."" At this point Joe looks at him shocked and reminds him that he is a boy and to keep saying that to him self. After repeating it a couple of times, Jerry replies and says ""I wish that I was dead."" Keep in mind that Jerry is still attracted to sugar during this whole time. But it seems like he doesn't mind marrying Osgood Fielding III, for security reasons. Perhaps a reference to a though job market for guys during those time. Over all the film does a great job of challenging the dominant ideological hegemony and it leaves the audience guessing and wondering."

","In some ways the forerunners of fish out of water comedies and gender bending comedies more frequent in later eras. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon play poor musicians accidentally witnessing a mob mass execution during Chicago prohibition. They manage to hide out in Florida an all girl band where Tony is courted by Marilyn Monroe temporarily dressed in Florida entirely in black and white photography as a man and Jack in drag posing as a woman to avoid being executed by the mob is courted by Joe E. Brown. The comedy mounts as Tony has to convince Marilyn he is not an idle rich millionaire and Jack has to convince Joe he doesn't date males. One could expect the mob will show up in Florida to take revenge on escapees of the Valentine's day massacre and then continues to pursue Tony and Jack once they discover how they escaped dressed as women. Brilliant and enticing for its day Tony, Marily and Joe shine as they always do. Jack, who does more of the high jinx physical comedy than the other players in most of his comic films will please those who like his style but not those who think his mugging is too grand in focus for the screen. Holds up well today as a fun two hours yet not a true Golden Hollywood Classic."

","Montserrat Prada <br/><br/>Analysis Some Like It Hot<br/><br/>Some like it hot is a unique comedy due to the time in which it was created. Throughout the movie two travesties ran away from a mafia group because they were present in a killing in a parking lot. Not only that but it contained revealing outfits of the girls of the orchestra which was not something well seen by the audience of the time. The movie contained many aspects that were not well seen and it sill was a very good movie which I believe make it a excellent movie. Some Like it Hot is a movie full of emotions that captures the audience for being so unique and entertaining. A important aspect that should be valued from the movie is that it is made in black and white and even though you cant see color, it still makes you imagine the colors and go deeper into the movie. <br/><br/>Some like it Hot is a romantic comedy and has a gangster theme as well. A large part of the movie the girls struggle with their love life. When they get to the hotel several of them get involved with the rich man that are waiting for them in the benches. This makes it romantic because the audience experiences the tears and happiness of the character throughout the movie and romance is a important theme that takes place in the whole movie. Since the start of the movie when the boys decide to take the job with the girls there is a sense of laughter when you see them acting and looking as girls. They struggle being girls and its funny to see the way in which they experience the opposite of what a boy is. Some like it Hot makes you laugh through a big part of the movie due to the boy characters acting as girls. There is also a theme of gangster because in the movie the boys run away from a mafia group that is looking for the two of them. This contributes to the gangster theme and also creates a sense of fear and suspense to the audience. <br/><br/>Some like it hot is a risky movie due to the aspects of homosexuality and woman exposure it involves but that is what makes it a more entertaining and funnier movie. The audio and the image makes the movie even more entertaining because eve though it is in black and white it still projects a good quality image and has a good audio. <br/><br/>The costumes are something that calls the attention. The girls wear very elegant dresses while their staying in the beach. They wear, especially Sugar, very reveling dresses that don't cover up much. This was no something usual to see in the time. There is one famous scene in the movie in which Marylin Monroe is singing in the stage and the camera makes a deep focus on her face. The camera focuses from the chest up which makes her look as if she was naked. This is a very reveling seen and that is what makes the scene famous. <br/><br/>My name is Montserrat Prada. I am and live in Costa Rica. I am in tenth grade at Lincoln School. I am currently in a film appreciation class where I can appreciate the beauty of films and can analyze them in a professional way.

","What makes a film funny? If we were to be completely honest, we would probably admit that the film has to make us want to laugh and that there are several quite different ways to do so.<br/><br/>""Some Like It Hot"" hooks you with its characters, who are all small and very sympathetic fish in a wild current of events that they never control and still dream that by them they'll find their luck in life.<br/><br/>Little pleasures of little people, set during the prohibition the film misses no opportunity to show ordinary people secretly drinking, thus furnishing an echoing background of its major theme, the quest for love and money. There are a lot of great punch lines, like ""Nobody talks like that."" (Cary Grant does indeed!) or ""Well, don't look now, but the whole town is underwater!"", but where the film touches the sublime is when Joe and Sugar tell themselves badly masked lies, everyone of them hoping to profit from the other in an extraordinary relationship, while in fact its just the repetition of the same kind of relationship that Joe and Sugar are having all of the time.<br/><br/>Besides, it's a pleasure to see Jack Lemon throwing himself into his role as he does. If it wouldn't be for his childish enthusiasm, the whole wonderful ""crowded bed scene"" wouldn't be half as funny as it is.<br/><br/>Because of this and because of its wonderful music and its marvelous pacing that leaves you no moment uninvolved ""Some Like It Hot"" is one of the best comedies ever made, if not the best, but since I saw ""Kin-Dza-Dza"" I don't want to claim that any more."

","SOME LIKE IT HOT ***** Billy Wilder's 'Some Like It Hot' is a hilarious story of two Chicago musicians (Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon) who turn to female foreigners as they flee to Miami with an all-girl's band to escape from a mob hit chain leader (George Raft) whom they witnessed doing one of his deeds. Excellent entertainment ensues as Curtis and Lemmon become more involved and perplexed in the humorous and romantic entanglements they're placed in. Marilyn Munroe is delectably delightful as the band singer who draws Curtis in with her sensuous and semi-flamboyant charm. Joe E. Brown plays millionaire Osgood Fielding who takes a liking to the bewildered Lemmon. The script is witty, the characters are freshly comical, and Wilder contributes a commendable directorial to one of cinema's classic comedies."

","Jack Lemmon is downright hilarious in this one because he plays his role with gusto and seriousness. There are moments in this film so crazy, so impossible to believe, and yet, because of this man's superb acting job, we are in comedy heaven. Lemmon's Daphne is one of the most incredible and masterful acting jobs in the history of cinema. His comedic exchanges with each of the other actors in this film are a wonder to witness. When he is with Monroe, we never doubt he has become possessed by the spirit of his creation. Minutes after his engagement, watching him plan his wedding is a riot, and no one can keep a straight face while he is dancing with his soon-to-be fiancé.<br/><br/>Billy Wilder once again proved his talent as one of the most multi-talented directors in Hollywood as he guided all the members of his troupe to this terrific films.

","After just viewing 'Some Like It Hot' for the very first time, I must say that I can barely write a cohesive review of it. It is the finest and best-acted comedy I have seen, ever. <br/><br/>Even though it clocks in at just over two hours, SLIH is entertaining from beginning to hysterical end - barely slowing the pace to give a viewer time to get restless. The trio of lead actors, the snappy, innuendo-laden dialogue, the romance, the comedy, the snazzy music, the believable plot: all of these elements meld perfectly into a vivacious, vibrant movie. <br/><br/>While Tony Curtis doesn't disappoint with delivery here, it is Jack Lemmon and Marilyn Monroe who compete for the starring role - one well-deserved by both, to say the least. Lemmon's frustrated, desperate, easily-persuaded character pairs flawlessly with Curtis' scheming, womanizing 'Josephine', and the two, decked out in drag while fending off fresh bellboys and dirty old men, are endlessly facing new and hilarious obstacles at every twist in the plot. Lemmon simply shines here, whether he's struggling to keep his masculinity disguised among unsuspecting attractive women or running through the Seminole-Ritz in too-short bellboy trousers and black pumps. <br/><br/>I was truly surprised by Marilyn's performance here, too. While her overly-breathy sex kitten persona repels me from most of her films, she was extremely convincing as the sweet, innocent singer in the all-girl band who keeps a flask in her garter and befriends the dynamic duo in drag. <br/><br/>'Some Like It Hot' oozes with sexuality without being crass; it achieves almost-constant comedy without degrading itself with lowbrow humor or extreme slapstick; it paces its musical numbers, its storyline gives needed character depth and definition to its protagonists, it balances lighthearted, good-intentioned levity with conscience and grace. Don't let the black-and-white turn you off. 'Some Like It Hot' is a great movie all the way through - this is the kind of film that defines 'rewatchability'. You won't be disappointed. <br/><br/>Oh, and aside from Milton Berle, the usually endearing, adorable Jack Lemmon is probably the most hideous woman ever to grace the silver screen."
"ecjones1951","Null","2","3","28 November 2004"," Still the Gold Standard
","""Some Like It Hot"" is the best farce ever produced by a major Hollywood studio. Viewed as farce and not as a straight comedy -- but it's both -- its lofty position on so many ""movie best"" lists is easily understood.<br/><br/>The glue that holds ""Some Like It Hot"" together on screen is Jack Lemmon. His scene with Marilyn Monroe in the upper berth of the train is probably his most brilliant in the film, but he has several. Its dialogue is top heavy with innuendo, and no one but Lemmon could have pulled it off without descending into embarrassing burlesque. The script requires Tony Curtis to do an extended burlesque, and while he was not the subtle comedian that Lemmon was, his ""Cary Grant"" is still a comic delight.<br/><br/>The exposition is lengthy for a comedy, but sets up numerous punchlines that will be used again and again. Such gags as the one about ""type O blood"" actually get funnier with repetition.<br/><br/>Pat O'Brien's Chicago detective is always overlooked in discussions of this film. I don't think he has a single line that isn't a pun. His deadpan delivery may be lost on audiences who don't recall the dozens of crime movies he made at Warner Brothers in the 30s where he played this sort of role straight.<br/><br/>According to legend, ""Some Like It Hot"" was filmed in black and white for two reasons, one of which is the (very) revealing costumes Marilyn Monroe wears on the bandstand. The second is that Billy Wilder fretted that he could not get Lemmon's and Tony Curtis's drag makeup to look believable in color.<br/><br/>:sigh: I'm afraid younger viewers are put off by B/W movies. TCM hosts Robert Osborne and Ben Mankiewicz share my thinking, and I have heard both men urge viewers to give a black and white movie a chance.<br/><br/>In a world where the Vice President of the United States can tell a senior U.S. Senator to ""go blank himself,"" and Janet Jackson can do a striptease on national television, I'm afraid ""Some Like It Hot"" must seem creaky and stodgy indeed. Yet, ""It's not what's said and shown, it's what ISN'T said and shown"" that make ""Some Like It Hot"" such a treat.<br/><br/>It should never have worked, but Wilder and writing partner I.A.L. Diamond and a gifted cast breathed life into dozens of hoary clichés. Taking on such broad, heavily mined topics as the battle of the sexes, gangsters, Prohibition and skirt-chasing musicians was a gamble, but it worked. It worked in 1959, and it works today because there is no psychological subtext weighing down the story, as there is with ""Tootsie"" (1982).<br/><br/>""Tootsie"" is a drag comedy that wants audiences to laugh, but also to rethink and ponder gender roles in society. ""Some Like It Hot"" has no such pretensions, which is why it has not dated as much as more recent comedies that share its theme."

","When I was in high school, I worked in a local bookstore in the evenings. One day I happened to come upon a book on Marilyn Monroe. Up until that time, I had a vague idea about who she was but I'd never seen a movie of hers or really knew too much about her. While paging through the book, I was astonished at the pure sexual energy that she generated, even in the printed form, in fact it was so raw that I was kinda turned off by it.<br/><br/>Around that time I saw that ""Some Like It Hot"" was going to be on TV. I tuned in, trying to fine tune the station (I'm dating myself) and was just able to receive a rather fuzzy picture. I watched in my bedroom and even though the picture quality was very poor, I sat mesmerized. That same sexual energy that Marilyn had in printed form oozed out from my TV set. She had a bright, white, glowing quality to her that just floored me.<br/><br/>This movie will always have a special place with me, being the first time I ever heard or saw Marilyn Monroe. After that movie, I was hooked on her for years and years. On a side note, a couple years ago I was able to view her belongings at Christie's auction house. That was the first time I really realized she was real person, and not some confection created by Hollywood."

","From a first point of view, `Some like it hot,' appears to be a story about two young musicians  who are looking for a job, while at the same time are in trouble with the mafia.  The two Musicians end up leaving  town for a job to pay off their debts,  but to find out exactly what happens  in this movie, you must see it to believe it. 	In the beginning,  a police chase is going on between the police and a mysterious car loaded up with a coffin.   The car out runs the police, and arrives  at a funeral home.  Two men  get out of the car  and unload a coffin that was filled with alcoholic beverages.   At the same time the police are plotting to crack down on a secret party in side the funeral home because they are serving alcohol which was illegal at the time. <br/><br/>There is loud music and dancing going on inside the funeral home.   Jack Lemmon (Jerry) and Tony Curtis (Joe) are playing in the band while the police jump in on the party, thus ending their job as musicians in the band. The dynamic duo is looking for a job so they hear about an all girls band that is traveling down to Florida.  They were not interested, until they were caught witnessing a murder done by the mafia.  The two realized that they must get out fast.  They shaved their legs, grabbed their frocks and headed for the train to Florida.  Jack Lemmon's character from this point is a female bass player by the name of Daphne.  Tony Curtis' character is a female tenor sax player named Josephine.  Daphne and Josephine, meet Sugar (Marilyn Monroe) on the train to Florida.  They all arrive at their hotel in Florida. Daphne is carrying three instruments, when she stumbles and meets who is a middle aged millionaire named Osgood Fielding III, who has a perverted mind.   While Daphne and Sugar are playing with the girls on the beach, Tony Curtis dresses back up as a man so he can try and score a date with Sugar.  While they are performing, Daphne receives a bouquet of flowers from Osgood, and was asked to have dinner with him.  At the same time Josephine's male form Joe   is on a date with Sugar.  The next day, the mafia shows up to the hotel, for a convention of Italian opera singers. They suspect something is up when they see Daphne and Josephine.   They suddenly realize that the two women, were also the two men who witnessed the murder that they committed.   A couple men from the mafia began chasing Daphne and Josephine around.  Josephine escaped and was running  in to the ballroom where the band was playing.  While she was running, she tripped and landed on Sugar.  Everyone found out that Josephine was a man.  Right away she began to run  out of the ball room.  As she was running out, she met up with Daphne and Osgood.  The three started running for Osgood's boat.  After they all got in his boat, Sugar came running down from the dock, and jumped into the boat.  Josephine/Joe is upset and tells Sugar that she should go back, but Sugar still loves HIM.  At the same time, Daphne tries to convince Osgood that she is not for him, but  he doesn't buy it.  She then does something unbelievable! can't be said with out spoiling.  In other words I guess Osgood still likes Daphne/Jerry.  To the reviewer, this is a funny but sick ending. 	Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis do a wonderful job playing the two girls,  it is just as if they were trying to get in touch with their feminine side. Jack Lemmon's Character is silly and wild, while at the same time, Tony Curtis's Character is serious and smart.  The two make a great duo in this film. 	The Reviewer would rate this movie Five out of Five Gold Stars.  It is incredibly funny seeing two men dress up as women and pulling it all off, with out any one really noticing right away.   This movie is worth renting. Be sure to make room for this on your video rack!"

This film is on the run all the way through, from the Valentine's Day Massacre, to Marilyn biking down the steps to the jetty, and it never lets up. It is gripping all the way, with not a single longueur. But there are other reasons. It's brilliantly scripted, and the dialogue is matchless. The gender-bending is wholly undisturbing and somehow actually tasteful. Curtis as a shady Cary Grant is unforgettable. Sweet Sue and Beanstalk are made for each other. Another reviewer points out that George Raft wasn't told he was in a comedy. Joe E Brown's one-note is pitch-perfect. But the real reason for this film's perfection is Marilyn. Her neuroses are legendary, her unreliability iconic. She kissed like Hitler, and needed 30 takes for every line. These, and her visibly stunning starriness, must have spurred the rest of the cast and the director on to reaching even greater heights. Wilder did make some great films, but this is the hottest.

","SOME LIKE IT HOT is a tasteful blend between a hilarious comedy, an unconvincing romance, and a parody of crime. The story is very simple, with some universal themes. It is interesting to see so many different characters, which complement each other, in one film.<br/><br/>Two friends and musicians flee from Chicago, because they have witnessed a massacre. They are persecuted by dangerous gangsters. The only salvation for the two of them is a female music group, that is traveling by train to Florida. They disguise themselves as women and join the band. However, it is not easy to be a man, who is disguised as a woman...<br/><br/>Mr. Wilder has managed to spin a good joke at the expense of American girls' lust, madness in high society and parodies on crime, which have marked the thirties of the last century in America. There are not many films which develop nice and pleasant romance from a little nasty joke. A funny disguise, caricature of mafia, naive rich men and silly blondes offer good fun, but do not guarantee a good movie. <br/><br/>The protagonists are, what is almost incredible, very complex characters, which are torn between crucial issues of life, mentality and lifestyle. They, through a hilarious adventure, are rushing toward a trivial goal. The essence is in a series of meaningless and futile attempts, which were aided by the opportunism and escapism.<br/><br/>Black and white technique is a big hit in this case. Scenery exudes with a certain charm. Makeup and costumes are not too showy. The soundtrack is very good.<br/><br/>Marilyn Monroe as Sugar ""Kane"" Kowalczyk is a ukulele player and singer. She is a very simple character who has complex problems, which involve an escape from a saxophonist and hunt for a young and helpless millionaire. Ms. Monroe, besides deliberately infantile voice and enchanting stature, has showed, for the umpteenth time, a talent for comedy. Tony Curtis as Joe/""Josephine""/""Shell Oil Junior"" is a poor saxophone player. He is a serious and somewhat calculating character. His vocal imitation of a big movie star is more than interesting. He is everything that Sugar wants and all that which she escapes.<br/><br/>Jack Lemmon as Jerry (Gerald)/""Daphne"", is a double bass player. He's a bit silly character, who wants to escape from reality at all costs. Each new opportunity or possibility, like a boomerang, returs him to the uncertainty. His support is Joe E.

","There are four Oscar worthy performances in this Billy Wilder comedy classic. Marilyn, Jack, Tony and Joe all shine in the beaches of Florida where sweet Sue and her band, featuring luscious Miss Monroe and two real dogs perform in an all female band. The problem is that the dogs aren't real women: they're musicians hiding from the mob, having witnessed a St. Valentine's Day massacre style hit. Mob head George Raft wants them dead, so what's the best way to hide? Dress up as a woman of course!<br/><br/>Drag goes back to the silent era in cinema, so the concept is far from new, but the writing, directing, black and white photography all come together with excellent editing that perfects the timing of all the gags. Joe E. Brown, who had done his share of drag in film, takes a shine to jack Lemmon here, getting some great moments and the tag line that has become a classic, much like Marie Dressler's final quip in ""Dinner at Eight"".<br/><br/>It is considered an Oscar sin that Marilyn Monroe did not get a nomination for this part. ""Jello on springs!"", Jack Lemon comments, but it's the Cary Grant like portrayal of Tony Curtis the gets her attention, making her think that he owns the huge yacht that really belongs to Brown.<br/><br/>So many great moments, from Monroe's two big songs to Lemmon and Brown's tango. It later became a hit Broadway musical (practically forgotten today), but nothing can diminish the perfection of this film, one for the ages. Without it, I doubt we'd have "" Victor/Victoria"", ""La Cage Aux Folles"" or ""Priscilla, Queen of the Desert""."

","It's a classic comedy starring Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon as two musicians who witness a mob hit and, to protect their identities, disguise themselves as female musicians and flee the state with a female band disguised, only to find themselves being chased by men and the mob.<br/><br/>Curtis and Lemmon are like a mismatched couple, bickering and becoming frustrated with one another as they go through their misadventures on the road. It serves up some chuckles and humor and helps with the film's steady-moving plot. Marilyn Monroe as female lead Sugar Kane is surely the highlight of the movie and did what I think is one of her most iconic roles, bubbly, innocent-acting and vulnerable in her acting and singing two show-stopping songs. Her spellbinding beauty is sure to charm anyone and she had some good chemistry with Curtis. <br/><br/>However, the film does suffer a little from Curtis and Lemmon's at times overzealous acting and the lack of suspense from the pursing-mob subplot. Overall, though, it's not a bad film and is good for some laughs.<br/><br/>Grade B-"

","Some Like It Hot is a wacky, clever, ludicrous comedy that starts off like a firecracker and keeps on throwing off lively sparks till the very end.<br/><br/>The plot is a classic screwball. The setup: It's Chicago, 1929; the era of jazz, prohibition, bootlegging and gangland rub- outs. Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) are two hack jazz musicians who inadvertently witness a mob killing on St. Valentine's Day. In a desperate bid to flee the scene, the boys jump onto a train to Florida disguised as Josephine and Daphne (""I never liked the sound of 'Geraldine'""), the newest members of an all-girl jazz band where they fall for attractive, bubble-headed ukulele- player Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe). Once in Florida, Joe poses as the tycoon Junior, sleazily designed to fulfill Sugar's every fantasy of a man while Daphne, carried along on the tides of farcical necessity, is propositioned by an addle-brained millionaire Osgood (Joe E. Brown). Seductions and obvious complications ensue. Identities become fluid and changeable. Just when things start looking up, the goons arrive for a mobster's convention at the same hotel where the girls and the two erstwhile guys are playing. And soon a volley of bullets and witty lines fly by!<br/><br/>Fifty-five years on, Billy Wilder's charade has lost none of its luster, largely because of the absolutely riotous turns by the three principal cast members. Monroe's performance as the fuzzy blonde Sugar has a deliciously naive quality. She's a comedienne with that combination of sex appeal and timing that is unrivaled even today. Both Curtis and Lemmon are absolutely impeccable as they bicker, cross-dress, and chase their way into audience's hearts. Their interactions are never less than the stuff of comic gold (watch Lemmon mouth ""If those gangsters come in here and kill us, and we're taken to the morgue dressed like this I'll die of embarrassment."") while they play off of one another in such a way that they simultaneously propel the plot's shenanigans and develop their characters. <br/><br/>The movie's lasting impact, however, is owed in great deal to the direction and the Wilder touch is indelible: a work of shocking confidence. He treats the outlandish plot so deftly that the ridiculous somehow appears possible and the shocking turns into laughter. He keeps the momentum of this madcap comedy such that it keeps rolling along, a mirthful romp that knows just when to draw back before crossing the line to the vulgar.<br/><br/>There's an illusion of effortlessness about Some Like It Hot that contributes to its endurance: though the characters are sweating through the madcap circus, Wilder and the top-notch cast keep the proceedings effervescent and breezily paced, giving us a movie with remarkable audacity that transcends all ages for the sake of a universal good time. A peerless classic!"

","This is not about just Marilyn Monroe. She does cast a spell with her sublime and appeal; no breaking news here! In addition, the movie is about a story of two musicians– Joe, the sax player (Tony Curtis) and Jerry, the bass player (Jack Lemmon). <br/><br/>In the era of bootlegging in 1929, Joe and Jerry live in Chicago, struggling to make their ends meet. Small, infrequent performances and Joe's manipulative charm on ladies see them through the day's end, until they find a gold mine of an opportunity to perform in a hotel in an all paid trip to Florida. The only concern is, they have to pose themselves as women. Some disappointments, some rejections and 7 murders later they agree to take the job. And then, unrolls the bundle of fun, music, adventure, poolside frolics and a visual treat that is Sugar Cane (Marilyn Monroe). <br/><br/>Joe and Jerry, both very nimble characters, bring to life a beautiful, comic camaraderie which drives the plot of the entire movie. Sugar is an innocent, aspiring singer who fits perfectly in the scheme of love, sensuality, comedy and chaos. <br/><br/>Although having seen umpteenth similar comedies that came after this, 'Some like it hot' still seems fresh, witty, genre-defining and worth all the accolades it has gathered all these years.

She also happens to give a pretty good performance and the duo of Tony Curtis/Jack Lemmon is great too. I never really saw why people were so excited about Marilyn Monroe until I saw this movie.

The 2 musicians that are dressed up as women are played by Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis in their best performances since I don't know when. Writers Billy Wilder and I.A.L.

","The highly regarded Billy Wilder comedy Some Like It Hot relies on an original, really offbeat and audacious plot for the time (1959), where savoury and incredibly well written dialogues fly for two hours. The adventures of these two travesties are very enjoyable to follow, and the Curtis-Lemmon did a perfect job, a notch above Marylin Monroe even though she is coherent with her character.<br/><br/>Overall, the comical potential has been well exploited, even if, due to the changes in mores, what seemed improbable and funny back then doesn't shock anymore. Moreover, the script sometimes goes through slow passages with endless scenes as the one on the boat, and one could question the purpose of the musical interludes as they appear more like promotional parts for Monroe. But, despite these few flaws, Some Like It Hot remains a sure bet in the comical genre."
"tavm","9","1","1","19 August 2013"," Billy Wilder's Some Like It Hot is still among the greatest movie comedies, if not the greatest
","I've only seen this movie once before on the late show when I lived in Jacksonville, FL, with my aunts. I remember thinking this was pretty funny. Now that I've watched this on DVD with my mom (who had never seen this before), it's even more funny than I remembered it. I mean, seeing Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon try to convincingly play women in order to escape some gangsters, especially in front of the actual females they're surrounded with, can be pretty funny since they don't really look anything similar to them but I guess the fact that many of them do drink might have been a factor. And then there's Marilyn Monroe, looking as luminous as one expects but also one of the most charismatic of actresses especially considering her off-screen troubles that seemed to affect everyone involved including director Billy Wilder. Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond's screenplay just cackles with such great lines. Oh, and I also loved Joe E. Brown's performance as the millionaire that falls for Lemmon's character. His seemed to be the best one here, even better than Lemmon's who was the only player to get an Oscar nomination. And while George Raft and Pat O'Brien played their typed roles of gangster and cop, they played them well enough to still deliver the goods. In summary, I'm not sure if I agree with the AFI listing this as No. 1 among great comedies, but Some Like It Hot is still one of the most entertaining of them, that's for sure!"
"LLinus","8","1","1","10 August 2013"," A classic, charming movie.
","I'm usually not much for old comedies, although i have to say, this one was truly original, cheerful characters that created the comic impression throughout the movie, which made me grin all the way through. Tony Curtis is an entertaining actor to observe, pulling off three different characters in one movie is nothing more but impressive and shows that he is a very adjustable person. Marilyn Monroe who played 'Sugar Kane Kowalczyk', to me seemed to be very suitable for the character itself, she lived through the character as if it was a part of herself. <br/><br/>Billy Wilder took such good care of this film, able to display excitement, love and comedy all together, the synchronization among all the cast on what could have been very chaotic couple of scenes if not done correctly, but manage to control this exceptionally. The shooting location and the backgrounds gave it a very comfortable awareness which made it feel like a cup of hot coco on a cold winter day. This classic comedy gives us a perspective about some of the joy and yet, the difficulty of being a women, it's displayed positively towards the audience."
"sashank_kini-1","9","1","1","5 June 2012"," Steamy but not sleazy and hilarious but not brainless rom-com that mayn't have gained its legendary status without its irresistible cast
","Marilyn Monroe is the greatest proof that an actress can stimulate burning passion among men just by talking; watch those brilliant lips move and those lovely teeth - don't they excite you, tantalize you till you fall off your couch? Monroe should've got those aphrodisiacs patented. Then comes those lovely puppies that adorn her bosom, and they stand out proudly, flaunting their fullness in her revealing gowns. It's a wonder 'Sweet' Sue missed that; everything in Marilyn screams out 'sex!' and Monroe does a feat by layering Sugar with creaminess, nuttiness and sexiness so she's worth much more than those dumb desperate harebrained bimbos. Sugar has a mind and a heart - she may be dumb and gullible, but she's certainly not vain; she doesn't even understand her own eccentricities sometimes, like always falling for bespectacled Saxophone players who only have one thing on their minds. She loves to drink anytime, anywhere and knows she doesn't have much of a voice but can use her charm to please anyone. This makes her unique, and we don't just gawk at them puppies all the time. Marilyn brings steadiness to her role, and she never lets go of Sugar in her scenes, in spite floundering her lines and creating a fiasco on sets. Her 'I want to be loved by you' is candid, hummable and touching. The high key lighting on her makes her ethereal. This is one performance that will not be forgotten. Modern rom-com actresses like Katherine Heigl, Jennifer Aniston and some lesser known ones can't bring such sizzle on screen because they take their characters too lightly - Aniston talks like a female county sheriff while Heigl (though I haven't seen much of her) is very clichéd and dull. Megan Fox unfortunately is too hot to make an impact as a true actress; she's all ogle-ogle.<br/><br/>Fortunately, Some Like it Hot isn't a Marilyn vehicle, though she anchors much of the film. There are two equally funny male counterparts who share an enviable chemistry, letting loose punch lines after punch lines. Yes, the movie needs to be watched twice to prick out some jokes that missed your ears while you were laughing. On the second viewing, I heard Jack Lemmon's quip on how women were able to walk with those shaky heels: "" Must be how their body is shaped out"" ( or something like that) he remarks, and our minds then try to imagine those hourglass figures and we realize the naughty humor. I found the cries of the drunken man for more coffee funnier in my second viewing. Every pun, innuendo and running gag makes you laugh, though not fall off your seat like some new comedies. But I like it this way, the same way I adored Ninotchka, City Lights, Singing in the Rain and Awful Truth, because they share a common aim to treat the audience with humor, not only with jokes but also with the chemistry and the balanced narrative. Sometimes when we fall off our seats too often, we are alienated from the story and we only wait for more jokes. When such movies try to evoke sympathy for the characters later, we feel indifferent and disappointed. I specifically point out Bollywood films like Housefull, Priyadarshan film (except Hera Pheri) and the Shreyas Talpade capers that seem to drown their movies with gags, only to bring a spurious tear-jerking moment later. Only one world for those movies: FAIL.<br/><br/>The supporting cast comprises of bandmaster Sweet Sue, played by Joan Shawlee, a far from sweet, instead being a rather feared martinet who keeps the pixiesh girls in check but underestimates their wildness. She is also discernible as she does not trust Geraldine and Daphne (Curtis and Lemmon in disguise) and tries to probe them whenever she gets a chance. It's a little surprising neither her character nor Dave Berry's (who plays the band supervisor) get more screen time after Sue quietly instructs Beinstock to keep check on the two. They are the ones who are dropped like a brick, sadly. Then there is the liquor mafia king Spats who, along with his over-sized lawyers, hunts for Lemmon and Curtis' characters after the two witness the gangsters massacring a rival gang. These characters, in Alfred Hitchcock terminology, are simply MacGuffins who make the path for sexy Marilyn to enter and smoke up the screen. Also, had these gangsters not been introduced, the movie wouldn't have had its memorable climax that's proves to be a double-edged sword for our unfortunate guys in drag. Climax in a comedy has to be strong, and a bit of irony helps, for example though Charlie Chaplin's City Lights has a happy ending, the climax and falling action before do not make situations favorable for the tramp, but do make things better for those around him. Had such twists been omitted, the movie would not have gained much reputation with a straightforward climax. Some Like it hot has a terrific climax, and we couldn't have asked for a better one.<br/><br/>Tony Curtis' Joe is a selfish, crafty and inconsiderate – he relies on Lemmon's Jerry to gain personal advantage (the booking on dogs being the most trivial example), he makes his partner a puppet to attain Sugar (how smartly he arranges the date between Jerry/Daphne and Osgood), and he ignores the consequences of his deception with Sugar until the very end. But what's most important is that he changes. Poor Jerry on the other hand conceives most of the plans, encounters Sugar first, but gets the second billing in the end because of Joe. His courtship as Daphne with Osgood is the funniest moment in the entire film but then I remember 'Nobody's Perfect!' and I can't decide which is funnier.<br/><br/>Some Like it hot, in unbearable Mary Murphy's own words, is on my hot tamale train!"
"ElMaruecan82","10","1","1","2 April 2012"," If the best jokes have the greatest punchlines, then ""Some Like it Hot"" is indeed the greatest comedy...
","Is ""Some Like it Hot"" as funny as its reputation implies? Yes, sir. Has it aged a little? Less than more recent comedies. Is it still funny anyway? Another yes. Is it really the funniest American comedy? It sure is one of them. Is it the best? Well, according to the American Film Institute it is. <br/><br/>Let's get to the point now, Billy Wilder's screwball classic is not the greatest American comedy because it's the funniest, but just because it's one of the most classic among the funniest (and vice-versa). You might find ""Airplane!"" or ""Animal House"" funnier, or have a fondness for the wisecracking humor of the Marx Brothers or Mel Brooks, unless you're one of these purists who believe that nothing can beat the Silent Era pioneers, or that Woody Allen is the king of Comedy. Hell, it's also your right to find Sandler or Ferrell funnier. However, this is one comedy that will reconcile all these tastes. <br/><br/>Comedy is probably as old as Cinema, and that providing laughs was the first premise of filmmaking when the special effects were still missing. ""Some Like it Hot"" is right in the middle of Comedy's chronological map, old enough to be a classic, and modern enough to keep all its appeal toward modern audience. The film opens in the Prohibition days, in Chicago, paying tribute to classics such as ""Scarface"", ""The Public Enemy"" and ""Little Caesar"" with a fitting role for George Raft, as the story bad guy: Spats Domino. The plot –do I need to describe it? - involves a bass player, Jack Lemmon as Jerry, and a saxophonist, Tony Curtis as Joe, who accidentally witness a shooting that is a reminiscence of the infamous St Valentine's Day Massacre. They disguise themselves as women to be hired in a female band going to Florida. Meanwhile in the train, they meet Marilyn Monroe as Sugar, a sweet, naive and idealistic ukulele player.<br/><br/>If the film's setting pays tribute to old Hollywood, the content is incredibly fresh and subversive in the way it portrays women from two average Joes' point of views: as sensual and sexual objects of desire. Jerry's comment on Sugar's voluptuous body while she walks at the train station and reference to Jelly-O springs is so full of lust when it concludes by ""It's a whole different sex"". The film plays with cross-dressing and gender comedy with the perfect dosage of naughtiness and innocence. The part where Sugar is in the same bed as Joe aka Daphne and he keeps repeating in himself ""he's a man"" gives you an idea about the kind of reaction he's having, being in bed with such a beautiful instrument player. Along with ""Anatomy of a Murder"" and ""Psycho"", ""Some Like it Hot"" is one of the most defining examples of the agonizing days of Censorship, indeed, I would have never thought I would hear the word 'frigid' coming from Marilyn's mouth.<br/><br/>But beyond its modern tone, ""Some Like it Hot"" is mostly carried by two top-notch performances from the two leads and two strokes of genius in the casting of Marilyn Monroe as Sugar, and Joe E. Brown as the old billionaire who falls in love with Daphne in Florida. Sugar has this naivety and sweet tenderness that wouldn't have been believable if another actress played that part. Marilyn embodied this kind of personality, trusting men, victim of their lies and promises, but what lead to her demise in real-life is used for a much happier ending here. Still, there is something poignant in the way Sugar trusts the two girls, but the film never keeps that in a mean-spirited tone, especially since it's a matter of life and death for Joe and Jerry and since, Joe E. Brown steals the show in every single scene to incarnate the kind of comeuppances Jerry needed for his exuberant behavior. <br/><br/>""Some Like it Hot"" is punctuated by countless iconic scenes, from Monroe playing her ukulele and singing ""Runnin' Wild"" to her ""I Wanna be Loved by You"" song, we're both fascinated by Monroe's sex appeal and Joe and Jerry's struggle to keep theirs intact. And the story doesn't take its plot for granted but adds a supplementary twist by introducing another romance between Jerry and Sugar. Jerry exploits Osgood's crush on Jerry to disguise himself as a 'harmless' billionaire, inviting Sugar in Osgood's yacht while the owner is dancing a frenetic tango with his sweetheart. The way the subplots interact between the last confrontation with Spats Domino is cleverly handled and plays as a fantastic tribute to Wilder's clever writing. Yet even before the last five minutes, the film is funny without having this little thing that elevates it above all the other comedies.<br/><br/>Many comedic films end with the conventional happy ending or the resolution, it might have a final gag or a funny bit, but hardly the highlight of the film. ""Some Like it Hot"" follow the principles of the greatest jokes, it can drag a long, be averagely funny, even annoying, but if the pay-off is hilarious, the joke works. Movie endings can redeem any film, but this applies even more for comedies. And in ""Some Like it Hot"", not only the ending is one of the greatest of any film, but if you pay attention to the dialog between Daphne and Osgood, it works as a summary of everything that went before, and the last dialog couldn't have worked without all what happened.<br/><br/>We all know that Daphne will sooner or later remove his wig and reveal his identity as Joe did with Sugar, but Osgood seems so casual about that the final line must be a killer, the strike of the film, its triumph, and on that level, Wilder did it again, after Norma's ""close-up"", ""Well, nobody's perfect"" are three distinct words that differentiated a funny screwball comedy to a perfect classic."
"TheFamilyBerzurcher","Null","1","1","19 March 2012"," Timely, Tiresome, Stylish
","It's impossible to approach SOME LIKE IT HOT without noting how timely it must have been in addressing the gender confusion barrier. ""Nobody's perfect"" could have been the motto of the hip liberalism that would hijack the next decade. It is slick, it is fun, and it is directed and written with Wilder's trademark arrogance. But does it deserve such a formidable spot among the ever-memorable comedies? Maybe so, for the unexplored timeliness alone.<br/><br/>Wilder's most entertaining characteristic, once one gets used to seeing it, is his belief in universal idiocy. SOME LIKE IT HOT settles into some kind of saucy contempt for Y chromosomes before introducing Monroe's enduring archetype. I am reminded most in HOT of how her busty figure is an icon of days gone by. She is undone by the study in transsexuality, but still radiates even under the usual suppression of her brain. The plot tries to slyly maneuver her curves as if seducing her, but in stepping back we realize how surprisingly weak the story and characters are. The script - the ultimate Wilder - is 90% joke with a not-so-veiled dirtiness. Instead of spending dialogue time developing character, Wilder takes us on a 130 minute, cyclical, comedic joyride around the block of dramatic irony. Endlessly. We keep expecting the twist ending that we never get. It's a genius idea, one that wasn't his. And it doesn't convert into motion so well.<br/><br/>Though it is aided by the fascinating experimentation with sexuality. Jack Lemmon's erratic hustle is enough to exhaust you. And we are met by Tony Curtis and his imitation of Cary Grant. It is Monkey Business without the complexity. But it is an astonishing impersonation and his subtlety comes as a welcome gift while being battered by Lemmon's anxiety. Lemmon might seem more comfortable in the dress, but which one do you notice throwing off his (her?) wig?<br/><br/>But in the enormous dearth of character we see just how exceptional Wilder's writing had to be. And perhaps how magnetic the three primary players were.<br/><br/>I'll also take this time to mention how refreshing it is to see musical realism. Actors gyrating in rhythm and actually passing off the impression that they can play their instruments is all too rare in Hollywood.<br/><br/>75.3"
"rdukeesq","Null","1","1","4 September 2011"," a true comedy classic and one of the best films I have ever seen
","So I watched the film classic from 1959 ""some like it hot"". Let me describe the movie in simple terms; what happens when you take a pure B movie plot, add great dialog, superb acting, and near perfect direction from a Hollywood legend, well you get pure comic gold. This is one of those movies you hope they never remake. It is now more than 50 years since this Billy Wilder gem was made and its stands the test of time. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are perfectly cast as two down on their luck musicians who are on the run from the mob. They take a gig as female band members in order to get out of town and hilarity ensues. The dialog between them is fantastic and they sell every line that would probably be real cheesy if delivered by almost anyone else. Marilyn Monroe is well HOT. This is my first Marilyn Monroe movie and well I get it now. I always saw pictures of her and said o.k shes a babe but, man there really was just something about her. My favorite lines in the movie are in the very last scene. I won't spoil it for the possible one person who reads this someday, but man I almost peed myself. If you haven't ever taken the time to see this movie do it, unless you are made of stone I dare you not to enjoy this comic masterpiece. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/"
"ddearment1003","Null","1","1","19 March 2011"," An excellent comedy that shows how a womanizer learns the meaning of love.
","The film Some Like It Hot, directed by Billy Wilder and released March 29, 1959, was set back in the prohibition era. The storyline is centered on two main characters, Joe- saxophone player, played by Tony Curtis, and Jerry-bow fiddle player, played by Jack Lemmon. They are two struggling musicians, trying to find work in the era of probation, and depression. They unwillingly become the subjects of a mob hit when they witness a mob hit on a rival gang. Joe, played by Tony Curtis, and Jerry, played by Jack Lemmon, search for a way to escape from the mob. There safe haven comes by what was original set as a joke by a female friend of Joe's at an employment agency, they take a job as musicians in an all girls band. The catch is that they are now to be known as Josephine and Geraldine. Can they convince the girls that they are girls themselves? Once they are part of the band, Joe and Jerry befriend Sugar, played by Marilyn Monroe, and Joe is having difficulties due to his natural male instincts. Can Joe mask his true male instincts when he is with Sugar? Joe has always been known for being a womanizer and always looking out for himself. Joe even goes as far as asking what Sugar is looking for in a man, and he takes mental notes so that he may charm her. Joe begins to discover he has true feelings for Sugar and no longer wants to hurt her or manipulate her. He knows that with the mob hunting for Jerry and him, he will never be able to have a true relationship with Sugar. It is a story of maturing, finding what matters, and finding that when you love someone, you love them more than yourself.<br/><br/>The back drop of the story is to understand that Joe is a lady's man and Jerry is conservative. Jerry is the analysis of the pair and just wants to work and pays bills, Joe is always looking for the next best thing, even if he has to beg, plead and barrow. On their way to a temporary gig that has been assigned to them by an employment agency, they come across a chance encounter with mobsters at a garage, there to get the car that Joe has borrowed, and are witnessed to the St. Valentine's Day hit. To escape the individuals that participated in the massacre, Joe decides the only way to save Jerry and he from being killed is to take a job with an all girl band that is leaving for Florida. The plan is to lose their identities and escape the city without the mobsters' knowledge; this is done by Joe becoming Josephine and Jerry becoming Geraldine. Joe, however, becomes attracted to Sugar, played by Marilyn Monroe, and this puts a wrench in the plans due to his infatuation for her. Jerry is accepting the role he has taken on, Geraldine; he even goes out with a millionaire that is swooning for her/him and comes back stating that he is engaged.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie the viewer is able to understand the significance that director was trying to convey in the films comedic sense. Joe is coming of age and needs to see that his womanizing needs to end in order to grow up. Jerry who is already looking at all the angles wants to always do the right thing. The emphasis that is shown on how Jerry is the voice of reason is shown throughout the movie. In the scene where Joe is trying to convince Jerry to give him all the money that they made for the week of work so that he, Joe, can go to the track because he knows a sure winner, points out that Joe still needs to grow-up and take on responsibilities. This is a prevalent theme throughout due to the focus being on Joe's manipulation of Sugar by being her best friend when he is Josephine and asking questions as to what type of man she likes, to than becoming the exact man she is looking for down to the glasses, being a millionaire, owning a twelve room yacht and being a helpless man in her eyes. Joe's use of manipulation and getting what he wants is all that he is concerned with, until in a moment of realizing he truly has feelings for Sugar. Sugar has become not just someone he is trying to win over, she becomes his friend. Joe sees Sugar as someone he cannot hurt; he doesn't want to deceive her anymore.<br/><br/>Does Joe do the right thing? The film gives the sense of danger, romance, and human nature. Will love conquer all? Will truth be the best remedy?"
"williwaw","10","1","1","1 December 2010"," Oscars for MM, Jack Lemmon, Joe E Brown, Wilder and Picture
","Some Like It Hot is arguably the funniest movie ever made. I remember when the picture was announced, and MM had been off the screen for a while. I was so happy to see MM back to work and anticipated its release. In my wildest hopes could I ever image the classic picture it became. <br/><br/>Billy Wilder initially wanted Frank Sinatra to star with Jack Lemmon. Mitzi Gaynor was to be Sugar Kane. However when MM found out about the script her agents approached Wilder and after clearing the pix with her home studio 20th Century Fox MM became Sugar Kane in this UA pic and an immortal iconic portrayal resulted. We all know of the battles MM had with Wilder and their mutual antagonism towards each other. Such is the price of Genius. Tony Curtis replaced Sinatra and the billing was Monroe-Curtis-Lemmon. Curtis who recently died carped about MM all his life and I feel some of it is because MM took an essentially supporting role and made it the star role. While Curtis was excellent Jack Lemmon is magnificent. A special notation should be for Joe E Brown who was retired but cameback to work and gave an memorable performance.<br/><br/>""Some Like It Hot' is very sophisticated today, 50 years ago it was stunning. Two Men in drag, and one may have as the saying goes ""jumped the fence"" and lived with another man in a relationship!<br/><br/>No praise is enough for this film and those artists who worked on it and I feel Marilyn Monroe should have won Best Actress ( MM wasn't even nominated!), Jack Lemmon should have won Best Actor and Joe E Brown Best Supporting Actor. Billy Wilder should have won for Best Director and the Picture itself should have won for Best Picture.<br/><br/>Bravo Wilder, Monroe, Lemmon, Brown!!"
"Daddytopcat","9","1","1","13 July 2010"," Some Like It Hot
","""SOME LIKE IT HOT""<br/><br/>In a departure from his earlier usual genre of dramas and romantic dramas that Billy Wilder has directed and/or written, ""Some Like It Hot"" is more or less a screwball romantic comedy. <br/><br/>Released in 1959, the film is a light-hearted vehicle for the talents of Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis, Marilyn Monroe and Joe E. Brown. Not a costume drama, but more of a costume comedy: Lemmon and Curtis must flee after witnessing a St. Valentines Day type mob hit in Chicago and decide to cross-dress to be able to join an all girl band headed to Florida.<br/><br/>Hilarity ensues and throughout the film the innuendos and awkward situations that cross- dressing can produce are cutting edge of that time. The inferences to sexuality are tamer by today's standards and some obviously do not have the same ""punch"" as when the film was first released. The costumer, who won an Oscar for their efforts, showed daring ideas and wardrobe choices for Monroe that further justified her status as a ""Sex Symbol.""<br/><br/>Unlike other screwball comedies, ""Some Like It Hot"" actually has a plot and a strong storyline that keeps the viewer engaged. From the opening car chase scene to the final line in the movie, there is a keen anticipation of what is going to happen next; will it be a scene showcasing Monroe singing, or a scene of humor either through sight gags or dialog. Either way, it all adds up to the overall cohesiveness of the film.<br/><br/>Charles Lang was nominated for an Oscar as Cinematographer due to his working with the lighting director and costumer to accentuate Monroe's shapeliness. Lang obviously has a fine eye in regard to not only camera angle and type of lens, but also to the lighting placement, be it overhead, side, filtered, etc. Monroe is predominately shot with overhead lighting and a ""fuzzy"" filtered lens. This gives her the overall appearance and feeling of a fluffy kitten or a warm, fuzzy sweater. Or both.<br/><br/>Jack Lemmon acts as the comic relief of the two cross-dressers. His lines and antics garner more of the laughs than Curtis'. As in most comedies, there is usually the ""set up man"" and the ""straight man."" Curtis plays the role of the ""straight man"" by trying to keep Lemmon out of trouble. Curtis also has a third persona to play, that of a fake millionaire as he tries to capture the heart of Monroe. All involved give a solid performance. <br/><br/>So travel back in cinematic history about 50 years, get a big bowl of popcorn and prepare to be entertained by some of the biggest stars of that era.<br/><br/>I can assure that most will like: ""Some Like It Hot."""
"Steffi_P","9","1","1","30 May 2010"," ""Cinderella the Second""
","What is it about the comedies written and directed by Billy Wilder that made them so endlessly watchable? Well, the short answer is of course that they are bloody funny. For a longer answer, read on First off let's look at screenplays. Some Like it Hot was Wilder's first collaboration IAL Diamond, after years without a consistent partner-in-crime. Neither man is entirely responsible for the fresh brilliance of this picture, but it seems in bouncing ideas they were able to feed off each others' abilities. The general style of comedy is very much Wilder's – the mix of plausible situation and outright farce, the elaborate visual gags derived from Ernst Lubitsch – but it seems likely that Diamond brought in a tighter and more disciplined angle, no doubt adding a joke or two of his own along the way. But what's great about this screenplay (and what makes the picture so continually engaging) is the way it progresses through different types of humour.<br/><br/>So, we open with a setting that is fairly familiar from classic gangster movies – a speakeasy, a Tommy-gun shootout – but with a sprinkling of jokes of a by-the-way nature. We get things like the organ stop being a secret way of opening the speakeasy door – little irreverent twists on hackneyed clichés – and the reason they work so well is because of how nonchalantly they are presented. It's a great way to set the tone and keep the laughs coming without making things too riotous at this early stage. Then, when the cross-dressing antics begin, Wilder and Diamond are able to milk a good half-hour's worth of gags purely out of the awkwardness and potential pitfalls of their situation. But if the entire rest of the movie were simply a load of jokes about blokes in dresses, it would eventually get repetitive. Therefore, when we arrive in Florida the whole thing spirals into a farcical free-for-all, complete with a couple of resident oddballs who make the two leading ""ladies"" seem normal by comparison.<br/><br/>Speaking of the leads, it really is impossible to imagine anyone other than Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon as Josephine and Daphne. Curtis, that rugged and mean-faced man of action, makes a surprisingly good woman, in both looks and mannerisms. Lemmon is great too but there is more of the outrageous comedy drag look about him. It's a pity Curtis couldn't do the voice and had to be dubbed, otherwise I think he would have been in line for an Oscar nomination too. And this is incidentally the role for which Marilyn Monroe won a Golden Globe. Yes, her reputation now may be as a dumb blonde sex object, but in her day it was acknowledged that she could act. And this is just about her best performance, because it's the one part of hers that makes you forget that reputation, and just see the woman.<br/><br/>But it's the supporting players that keep this one chirpy, especially towards the end of the picture where all bets are off and things are allowed to get completely silly. Rubber-faced Joe E. Brown is at the heart of the farce, so perfectly exaggerated in his looks and manner, like a cartoon character made flesh. And when the gangster subplot resurfaces, the authentic but somewhat ordinary George Raft will no longer do as chief baddie – the comedy game has been raised since then. So instead we get Nehemiah Persoff doing a very credible and entertaining Mussolini impersonation. And what about that creepy bellhop? Al Breneman, apparently. Where did they find that kid? He's brilliant! For movie buffs who have become familiar with this and later Billy Wilder comedies, it seems strange to think that before Some Like It Hot he was largely known as a writer and director of grim and cynical dramas. It appeared now though that he had hit upon a formula he felt happy with, and for whatever reason was compelled to put that pessimistic past behind him. His partnership with IAL Diamond was to last for the rest of their respective careers, during which they would make only one non-comedy. However, while they penned a number of a real classics together, they never quite equalled the box of delights that is Some Like It Hot."
"zardoz-13","10","1","1","5 April 2010"," The Greatest Cross-Dressing Comedy Ever!!!
","""Double Indemnity"" director Billy Wilder created the ultimate cross-dressing comedy with ""Some Like It Hot."" The sight of Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon dressed up as a couple of female is unforgettable! Wilder and long-time collaborator I.A.L. Diamond based their screenplay on ""Fanfaren der Liebe"" (1951), an original German musical. This lively farce about men masquerading as women juggles broard slapstick with sly sexual innuendo. The premise that two hopelessly red-blooded American guys could conceal themselves in a woman's only band is outrageous. Indeed, despite the amendments made to the Production Code in the wake of the Frank Sinatra classic ""The Man with the Golden Arm,"" ""Some Like It Hot"" managed to raise a lot of eyebrows. United Artists released the film without the MPAA logo in the credits or title sequence because the Production Code refused to give it their approval. Similarly, the Roman Catholic Legion of Decency gave ""Some Like It Hot"" their ""C"" rating which stands for 'condemned.' Believe it or not, Bob Hope starred in another movie called ""Some Like It Hot"" in 1939, but it shared on similarities with the 1959 movie aside from having the same title.<br/><br/>The action unfolds in Chicago, 1929, as the police pursue a hearse and riddle it with gunfire. The guys riding in the back of the hearse aren't funeral attendants. Instead, they are some rough-looking mobsters armed with pump-action shotguns. They manage to elude the cops, but irreparable damage has been done. They raise the lid on the coffin and several bottles of shattered bootleg hooch are among the many other bottles. Notorious hoodlum Spats Columbo (George Raft of ""Background to Danger""), owns a speak easy that served liquor in coffee cups. Chicago Detective Mulligan (Pat O'Brien of ""Angels with Dirty Faces"") busts up the party at Mozarella's and has some tough words with Spats. Meanwhile, Joe (Tony Curtis of ""The Vikings"") and Jerry (Jack Lemmon of ""Mister Roberts"") give the police the slip and escape. Joe wagers everything that they have on a 10-to-1 dog, Greased Lightning, at the race track and they come up losers. Sig Poliakoff (Billy Gray of ""Two for the Seesaw"") gets them a one-night stand in Urbana, but the boys have no car. Joe talks an old girlfriend out of her green coupe for the 100 miles that they have to drive. The musicians head for the garage, but complications ensue. They take refuge behind a car and witness the infamous ""St. Valentine's Day Massacre"" and they can identify the ringleader, who had his men wipe out another gang in a blaze of gunfire.<br/><br/>Jerry and Joe are so desperate to clear out of the Windy City that they dress up in drag so they can get a job with an all-girl band scheduled to play in Florida. They change their names to Josephine and Geraldine, but Jerry has second thoughts and changes his name to Daphne. They climb aboard the train to Florida. The upper berth scene on the train is a classic. Earlier, Jerry covered for Sugar Kane (Marilyn Moore of ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"") when she dropped her flask after a performance on the train. Sweet Sue (Joan Shawlee of ""Prehistoric Women"") and her manager Beinstock (Dave Barry of ""High Society"") had warned Sugar that they don't approve of her drinking and will drop her from the band if they catch her with a drop of liquor. Anyway, Sugar climbs into Daphne's berth above Josephine's berth and before they realize it all the girls in the band are mixing up drinks and bringing crackers. When the girls drop ice down Daphne's back, it is just too much for Jerry and he yanks on the emergency brake cord. After they arrivein Florida, Daphne has to deal with elderly tycoon Osgood Fielding II(Joe E. Brown of ""Earthworm Tractors"") who pinches her/him in the elevator, while Joe disguises himself as a millionaire with a yacht, Junior, and turns his charm on Sugar. Since Sugar has a weakness for men with glasses, Joe sports spectacles as Junior. Eventually, Columbo and his henchmen migrate south and show up at the hotel.<br/><br/>The ending is hilarious!"
"emhughley","10","1","1","6 December 2009"," Absolutely hilarious...
","Marilyn back on top after a 2 year vacation from the screen, and boy was she worth the wait! Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis bosom buddies indeed. A huge success all the way around. The script, direction, co-stars and sets are all superb. Jack Lemmon as Daphne is the other reason to watch it. I feel his role excelled past Tony Curtis because Daphne was written with better comedic situations in mind. Apparently Lemmon got along better with Monroe because in his own words, he completely understood the painstaking artistry of what it took to do that thing she did. Jack Lemmons comedic delivery is first rate here. Tony Curtis is completely believable and does a great job as Monroes love interest. Marilyn delivers a spectacular performance as Sugar Kane, the dizzy blonde routine so beloved by her fans. As Sugar, Monroe is equal parts vulnerable and confident. I am very surprised Monroe wasn't nominated for an Oscar for this role. In her personal life she had so many unresolved issues with rejection, and what a pity Hollywood never really respected her in that form. She sure as hell made a lot of money for the studios and the suites that ran that town back in the day. My favorite sequence (among many) in this film, is the train sequence and Marilyn uttering the line ""Goodnight Honey"" to Jack Lemmon. The eventual party that ensues in Jack Lemmons berth makes my side split every time I see it. Im glad the film was shot in black and white. The film holds up very well even with todays standards. I hope it is never ""colorized"" for the next generation. If you are ever in San Diedo CA. go to the Coronodo Hotel where this was filmed. It looks exactly like it did back in 1959 and there are a lot of photos on display about the making of the film. Most of us know the rest of the plot by heart so I wont get into that. I do want to thank Mr. Wilder for this contribution to top notch film making. I am recommending this film to anyone who wants to see true original comic genius at its best."

","Another film I saw at my university in my Introduction to Film course though this one compared to the other two films I've watched which I've already reviewed though they were silent movies, which were Sherlock Junior which was mildly enjoyable and The Jazz Singer which was very good.<br/><br/>Some Like It Hot is my sort of film, it had sound and was a typical classical Hollywood narrative but despite that it's still an old film and I usually am not a big fan of them. My dad and Nan are big fans of old movies and told me that Some Like It Hot is a hilariously brilliant film.<br/><br/>When I went for my weekly lecture I had good hope that this film would be good, but I didn't expect it to be brilliant. I was wrong it was amazing. Now wonder this has been deemed one of Hollywood's golden age classic comedies.<br/><br/>The basic story is about two male musicians played by Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis who are struggling to make ends meet in Chicago when they witness mobsters committing murder. They inevitably get caught witnessing the crime but escape the criminals unscathed but they get blood all over them and soon know they will be wanted men so they decide to join an all girl band that is travelling to Florida as the agency that they work for need two girls who are a saxophonist and a bass player.<br/><br/>They dress up as the two women, but it's not that simple come arrive in Florida. They both fall for the singer of the girl band Sugar played deliciously by the sexy Marilyn Monroe and also attract attention from a rich millionaire (Well Jack Lemon does) and Tony Curtis dressing up in a captains outfit to woo Marilyn whilst at the same time trying to keep in disguise.<br/><br/>This movie is hilarious. I was laughing all the way through. The comic chemistry between Curtis and Lemmon is superb. The timing of there comic antics is spot on. It becomes particularly funny when they are in the women's clothing and become Josephine and Daphne. Some of the antics I loved was when Curtis first dresses up as a captain and when Lemon as Daphne is doing the tango with he rich millionaire with a rose in his mouth had me crying with laughter. Also it's great fun when the Mobsters catch up with the two later and try and get away from them and the ending particularly when the rich millionaire finds out that Daphne is a man quotes the best line from the film. When Lemon reveals himself to be a man as he tells the rich millionaire he can't marry him because he's male, he dosen't care just as he dosen't care that 'Daphne smokes' etc. He says ""Nobody's perfect"" Very funny indeed! Of course Mariyln Monroe has to be mentioned for her part in the film she makes a great impact on screen and not just because of her looks, she has great acting ability and a nice singing voice too. <br/><br/>But it wasn't just the acting and the gags they were funny, they were also witty and inventive and that is partly in thanks to a superb script by great director Billy Wilder. He also edits this beautifully and the narrative has a great structure and well the story of men dressing up as women is great too! I was also pleased with the length of the film. Some may say two hours would be too long for this sort of film, but it sub stains itself. I couldn't find anything to fault about this film and at the end of watching it in the lecture me and my classmates clapped and gave it a standing ovation.<br/><br/>I will certainly watch this movie in the future and I recommend that if you haven't seen this yet even if your a teenager like me you should see this you will regret it if you don't. I'm glad that this film was deemed one of the comedy classics of all time and that I was finally able to experience and agree with it.<br/><br/>A wonderfully made, acted and hilarious comedy!"

","The day I watched this film for the first time was a good day because I regard it now as one of my favourite films. Yes it was made 50 years ago and judging by the number of votes this film has attracted most people would be forgiven for thinking that this film was not that great but fortunately for me it is a classic and the cast and crew have created a superb romp of almost continuous fun and laughter. I believe the cast list could have been quite different for all sorts of reasons but as far as I am concerned the people who were involved conspired to produce a perfect comedy. I would recommend anyone watch this film and as long as nobody takes it too seriously I an convinced that most people will find it as funny as myself and numerous other people have. I would advise the person that is watching it for the first time just relax, tune in to the humour level and pay attention because there are a lot of visual and vocal subtleties. Even if the humour doesn't appeal I suspect the most hard nosed critic will at least accept that it is a superb creation. To me the film is 120 minutes of joy and the world is better off for its existence and I just hope that a lot more people watch it to appreciate why."

","Some like it new, some like it old, but some definitely prefer it hot.<br/><br/>This classic comedy has more than enough punches, laughs and kicks to set even the dullest audience roaring with laughter. It is sheer joy from beginning to end and matters little that it is shot in black and white and was made in the fifties. So why is it such a hot movie? Perhaps it is the skill of the three famous names that star in this magnificent movie, Jack Lemon, Tony Curtis and Marilyn Monroe that makes it such compelling viewing , or the hilarious situations they find themselves in. Whatever it is, it will have you falling about from beginning to end and desperately wanting more of the jokes, songs and cleverly written, witty dialogue when it finally finishes.<br/><br/>It is no surprise to learn that this film was nominated for not just one, two or even three academy awards but seven. This could have as much to do with the skill of Jack Lemon and Tony Curtis to disguise themselves as women and become part of a group of travelling female musicians, as it has to do with the beauty and radiant charm of the one and only legendary Miss Monroe.<br/><br/>Altogether it has so much to offer it is hard to know where to begin.<br/><br/>The acting is superb and the characters fun, charming and appealing. From the delightful Josephine (Tony Curtis) and the naughty Daphne (Jack Lemon) to the voluptuous Sugar (Marilyn) it is packed full of unexpected twists and turns. We wonder how complicated life can become for these two unlucky musicians Jo and Jerry, who, out of work and desperate, decide to 'become' women in order to get away from a group of gangsters who want to see them dead. Could this be a sexual identity crisis or just a cunning plan to show off their amazing jazz talent and wear painfully high stiletto heels? It isn't long before they set eyes on the stunning blond bomb shell Sugar who, just to add to the fun and appeal, is innocent, cute and nicely naughty. The rebellious but delightful Sugar befriends the two new girls and a beautiful friendship begins. It isn't long before Daphne is covering up for Sugar's secret drinking and having heart to hearts and whiskey in Daphne's sleeping compartment. And yes, Daphne looks great in curlers! <br/><br/>Sugar is happy to confide in her new girlfriends about the most personal issues, including her dreams of meeting a shy millionaire who wears glasses and owns a yacht. Much to Daphne's disgust, best friend Josephine becomes that retiring and innocent millionaire man of her dreams who pretends to own a yacht in order to entertain Sugar and allow her to concentrate on helping him overcome his shyness with women. You guessed it! This therapy comes in the form of teaching him to kiss. It helps greatly that he sounds like Cary Grant and is dressed in stolen yachting clothes even down to the spectacles. Naturally Sugar falls madly in love, not realising that her dream man is, indeed, Josephine. With a few tight costume changes and near misses including hiding in a bubble bath, Jo just about keeps his double identity a secret.<br/><br/>In the meantime, Daphne is being pursued herself, or should I say himself, by the real millionaire of the story; a rather small, old and unattractive man with round, dark rimmed spectacles desperate to find his eighth wife. It seems the more insulting and rejecting Daphne is to his advances, the more he wants her, not realising that Daphne is in fact Jerry. This is a brilliant contrast to the 'real' love that is developing between Josephine and Sugar or do I mean Joe or is that Maxamillion Junior? The hilarious double identities and storyline come to a climax when the gangsters catch up with the two new female jazz players and they find themselves hiding under tables, avoiding machine gunners jumping out of a huge birthday cake, and running for their lives. Heartbroken Sugar thinks that her hero has deserted her and as she pines for him the desire is too much for Josephine who, during a lovely song from Sugar all about how she is 'through with love', decides to suddenly become Joe and kiss her in full view of the audience, still dressed as a woman. Is Sugar so through with love that she has now turned lesbian? No, thank goodness! Shocked but recognising that kiss, Sugar chases after Joe on a bicycle with the gangsters in hot pursuit.<br/><br/>The film ends in its usual hilarious way with all four main characters speeding out to the yacht. Sugar now in love with the recently confessed Joe, a low down unemployed saxophone player, and Maxamillion deciding that he really doesn't mind being in love with a man and that 'nobody is perfect' especially when they have all turned out to be so very definitely hot!"
"lombardo42","10","1","1","9 May 2009"," The Greatest American Comedy And One Of Wilder's Best
","""Some Like It Hot"" is ranked number one on the American Film Institute's Top 100 Laughs; making the film basically the funniest movie of all-time. Yet, I couldn't refrain from asking myself if this movie really deserves the number one spot, or even ""Tootsie"" at number two; perhaps there IS something about transvestitism that appeals to the general public, mind you, if they're done skillfully. I feel I'm in no position to argue. With that said this delightful comedy has a little something for everyone to enjoy.<br/><br/>After being nearly arrested for entertaining in an illegal backdoor dive and gambling club two musicians named Joe and Jerry, played by Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon, flee the scene and quickly start looking for jobs elsewhere. After hearing that a certain opening is available for a saxaphone and bull fiddle player Jerry tries to convince an agent that he and Joe can qualify for the engagement -- the only catch is that they have to be women. Joe refuses the idea and suggests the alternative and play at a dance located 100 miles out-of-town. In an effort to provide themselves with transportation Joe charms his way with a woman to borrow her car located at a parking garage. While there Joe and Jerry witness a mob massacre; narrowly escaping death themselves. In fear of their lives the two flee the state, joining an all-girl band masquerading as women and head out by bus to Florida.<br/><br/>During this bus ride the two men encounter an attractive blonde named Sugar Kane Kowalczyk, played by a voluptuous, then pregnant Marilyn Monroe. From the very first meeting she comes across as a not particularly bright, bottle-sipping ukulele player who wants nothing more but to marry a nice, kind man with lots of money -- like a millionaire with glasses. As the story progresses Joe takes a fancy to Sugar and funny complications ensue. The band eventually arrive in Florida, and Joe and Jerry, now calling themselves Josephine and Daphne, instead of fleeing on arrival decide to play out their stint at a hotel lounge. Meanwhile, Joe attempts to win the affection of Sugar while pretending to be an English millionaire equipped with glasses and a yacht. But their amusing absurdities come to a halt when the mob from Chicago, headed by Spats Colombo (George Raft), catches up with them by odd chance at the same hotel.<br/><br/>There are two reasons why ""Some Like It Hot"" works and why so few of the same kind of movies that followed have been a success. 1) The cast. In addition to the superb character actors, Pat O'Brien and Joe E. Brown, you just can't go wrong with Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis and Marilyn Monroe. The two men play off each other so well and they're a delight to watch. And to top it off you have Marilyn Monroe, in what I've always considered was the last triumph in her film career before making her final picture, ""The Misfits"", a year or so later. 2) Billy Wilder as director. Wilder has such a strong ability for comedy on screen it is unparalleled, HE is unparalleled; watch any or all of this man's movies and you'll understand why he's considered one of the greatest filmmakers of the 20th century. Presently, ""Some Like It Hot"" is working on being nearly 60 years old, and it doesn't seem dated one bit."
"st-shot","8","1","1","22 February 2008"," Wilder's Broad Comedy is Hilarious.
","I more strongly prefer the masterly noir work of Billy Wilder, (I find his comedies forced with equal amounts of hit or miss humor) but Some Like It Hot is one comedy that excels on many levels. The script crackles with wit, there's plenty of slapstick and about half a dozen classic film moments.<br/><br/>Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis are out of work musicians whose luck takes another downward turn when they witness the St. Valentines Massacre. They take it on the lamb, adopting female identities and hook up with an all women band who has a sweet gig in Miami. The plan is to just get out of Chicago and away from the mob. Miami however does not prove to be a safe haven.<br/><br/>Lemmon and Curtis are a perfect comedy team in Hot, superior to any of Lemmon's many teamings with Matthau. Lemmon's tendency to over act is evident in the early moments but once in drag it becomes pitch perfect. Curtis has never been funnier whether he's vamping it or doing his atrocious Cary Grant and the two acting styles work well as they comically frustrate each other from start to finish. Marilyn Monroe never was much of an actress but here she exudes the ultimate dumb blonde stereotype that creates the legend.<br/><br/>There's a certain burlesque and stereotype to Wilder's work certainly evidenced in the buxom presence of Monroe and broad portrayals of Italian gangsters ( George Raft)Irish cops (Pat O'Brien) along with Keystone Cop chases that come across a little fatigued. O'Brien is hardly on screen and Raft had long ceased to ever be capable of acting and was no longer menacing. Joe E. Brown as an aging playboy more than makes up for the rest of the lackluster supporting cast courting Lemmon with hilarious nonchalance and along with the two male leads delivers Wilder and I.A. Diamonds snappy dialog with maximum comic effect."

","After ranting in my West Side Story write-up about how certain movies cry out to be experienced in an actual movie theatre (although I did conclude that West Story Story can be appreciated on a smaller screen), I decided to write about another classic movie that actually is enhanced by the smaller-screen experience: Billy Wilder's 1959 comedy gem, Some Like It Hot.<br/><br/>I did get to see this in a movie theatre in Hollywood a few years back (with excellent popcorn!), and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's a beautifully executed piece, in all ways: The plot moves along briskly, the situations are exploited for all they're worth without ever descending into heavy-handedness, and Monroe, Curtis and Lemmon show the world why they became Movie Stars of the highest calibre - their characterizations are flawless, their comedic timing impeccable, and Curtis looks gorgeous in drag, let's face it.<br/><br/>At home, on the smaller screen, this film plays amazingly well. The intimacy level is higher, of course, and you're easily drawn into the delightful story without feeling as if you're watching something horrifically dated, which I do feel with most films made before the '70s, say. The great Billy Wilder wrote and directed some fantastic movies in his career, and Some Like It Hot is right up there, at the pinnacle."

Tony Curtis is sufficiently dashing but as a criticism, (the only one this movie warrants) the on-screen chemistry with Marilyn Monroe is non existent. The couple didn't get on behind the scenes and this translates to the final product.<br/><br/>Marilyn Monroe plays Marilyn Monroe beautifully which is exactly what the script requires and even though she was a tad overweight, she still manages to set hearts a fluttering and to sizzle with sensual vim and vigor.<br/><br/>'Some Like It Hot' bounces from one hilarious situation to the other with a succession of genuine belly laughs.

","The dazzling team of Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond deliver the textbook screen comedy in Some Like It Hot, one of the most charming, brilliant, and hilarious films of the American cinema.  Marilyn Monroe is luminous as the aptly named Sugar Kane, and the dynamic duo of Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis are knockouts (in more ways than one) as two down-on-their-luck musicians who disguise themselves as women to avoid a mob rubout. It is nearly impossible to overstate the quality of Some Like It Hot, which seems about as close to perfect as a feature film can get.  From Monroe's scorching sex appeal to Lemmon's verve and elan, from Curtis' dead-on Cary Grant impersonation to Joe E. Brown's legendary final line, Some Like It Hot is a supernova in movie heaven."

The only thing that stands out about this ""greatest comedy of all time"" is the fact that Marilyn Monroe is so chunky! Not to condone our societies current body image ideals, but if Marilyn Monroe was even attempting to make it into movies these days, I doubt she would get her foot in the door... yet another counter to the ""stands the test of time"" statements. Additionally, neither of the two lead actors' performances even hold up to much of their other work... come on, tony Curtis was funnier in Spartacus! And Lemmon, as we know, just aged like a fine wine.

"arminhage","3","5","12","30 December 2014"," Don't watch this movie based on Billy Wilder's credentials
","I noticed that most people watch this movie solely because of 2 names. Billy Wilder and Marilyn Monroe although the real credit goes to Jack Lemmon who became a woman and played as a woman so good which I almost forgot he was Jack Lemmon! Jack Lemmon's performance was nothing short of a masterpiece dwarfing any subsequent similar attempts like Dustin Hoffman's in Tootsie so there is something very original and unique about this movie however even Jack Lemmon's mind blowing performance was not enough to cover the shitty screenplay, insane cheesiness and obvious deficiencies in production. Let's start from Miami. I have no problem that Wilder decided to film Miami in San Diego California. Palm trees are palm trees and the thing about the difference in direction of afternoon shadow on east coast and west coast in not something an ordinary audience would pick up immediately however filming the the movie in a famous landmark like ""Hotel Del Coronado"" was an unforgivable insult to the audience's intelligence. That's something I never expected from Billy Wilder, a shameful disappointment. The second problem was character development or the character ark. Sugar Cane (Monroe) was a woman attracted to millionaires, yachts, private train cars and money of course. She was the best imitation of a shallow character. Now to make her fall in love with a 2 bit musician like Joe (Tony Curtis) was required a great character ark. Sugar Cane remained the shallow character till the very end. She fell in love with a fake millionaire or his fake money to be more precise as there was nothing lovely about the fake millionaire that Joe invented but his money. When Joe called her o say goodbye, she became upset and sad because she lost the millionaire. She never fell in love with the quality of kiss or sex, bottom line is that she never fell in love with Joe as a human being. What one could reasonably expect was shocking and emotional encounter between Sugar Cane but what really happened was a flat hasty encounter as Joe exposed himself in front of everyone and gave her the hasty and flat kiss. Based on what was developed (or not developed) in the movie, the logical response was anger and despise not that hasty baseless character ark in final minutes of the movie. It was so bad and cheesy that it could win an award of cheesiness and awfulness! Also nothing was cute about the humor, the flat humor was as childish as a Pink Panther cartoon which made the movie almost boring. 2 hours was a long time for such movie, a better editing and possibly trim it to 90 minutes could mask most of the problems so I would say the editing was a masterpiece of awfulness by itself. I don't know where the 8+ rating came, I can't find a reasonable answer why a serious film critic would give this movie anything more than 4. 3/10"

Lemmon has one of his best roles as a woman in love. Brown is delightful as the man who lusts after Lemmon and gets to utter the film's famous closing line. The only quibbles are that the characters are cartoony and the violence is somewhat jarring for a comedy. As great as this is, Wilder would follow it up with another great comedy, ""The Apartment."""

But, those who give it some sort of special or iconic status are doubtlessly seeing things through some Marilyn or other golden age colored glasses. The acting is not that much better than many other period films nor is the subject matter particularly differentiating (despite numerous claims otherwise in various other reviews, the guys-dressing-as-girls-and-getting-laughs idea was pretty well worn even by the late 50s.)

","An amusing, well-packaged comedy, but with the humour too broad and self-conscious to ever be the classic it's chalked up to be.<br/><br/>There seems to be some debate over which of the two male leads is funniest. Clearly it's Tony Curtis (Who has recently denied he ever said his infamous ""kissing Marilyn was like kissing Hitler"" quote - Lemmon insists he did), who gets a dual role, not just as a female impersonator but as a Cary Grant send-up. After this superb take-off you can never watch a Grant film in quite the same way again. Curtis is better looking, cooler and much subtler in the role than Lemmon. To this regard, Jack irksomely overplays his part, his mannerisms and body language constantly over the top. There are some great lines (""I'll make it up to you"" ""You're making it up pretty good so far""; He's got an empty stomach and it's gone to his head"") and, apart from dubious soft focus for Marilyn's close-ups, the direction is excellent for a screwball comedy. The decision to film in black and white was also a good move. And look out for some great in-jokes, such as George Raft scolding a coin-tossing crook with ""Where'd you get that cheap trick?""<br/><br/>Perhaps the 120-minute running time is too long for the subject matter, and it does get a bit draggy in parts. Forty-two years have passed since the film was made, so that the somewhat naive laughs of gender and sexuality confusions no longer pack the same punch in a more enlightened age. Nevertheless, as an historical document this is still an important work."

","Well nobody's perfect. Well, this Billy Wilder's remake of the French 1935's Fanfare d'Amour and the German 1951's Fanfaren der Lieb isn't that perfect. Full of rampant sexual innuendo, and silly gender-bender cross-dressing gags makes this movie ridiculous, but that will always be part of it's charm. I don't know how these men pass as women. A great example of a three act structure that straddles different genres with violence and comedy. The movie was all innocent fun, though it's always on the brink of disastrous double-entendre. In the midst of notorious gangland murders in 1929, Chicago. Two musicians, Joe (Tony Curtis) & Jerry (Jack Lemmon), witness the St. Valentine's Day Massacre type murder. The desperate musicians have no choice, but to disguise themselves as women and join a all-girl band to escape the gang life, and hide out from pursing gangsters. Now in Miami, Joe falls for the lead singer of the band, the troubled Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe). He pursued her, by disguising himself as a millionaire to win her over, while Jerry is being courted by a real millionaire, Osgood Fielding III (Joe E. Brown), mid while the gangsters out there still looking for them. The cast was great in their roles. Tony Curtis is brilliant, and his Cary Grant voice was amazing. Jack Lemmon is demoniacally funny and more likely to taken for a woman than Tony Curtis. Marilyn Monroe is just Marilyn Monroe. I really doubt it's acting,e ven the opening scene with the boys has her drinking whiskey no less and her playing a dull blonde trying to get marry a millionaire. Not really role model material. Marilyn was hostile, and was marked by refusals to participate in filming and occasional outbursts of profanity. Visibly Monroe was obviously trashed out during the film. It really does show if you look closer and think about it. It's a surprise to find out that Marilyn Monroe was pregnant when filming this movie. You can tell in some scenes, it was a body double. Still, she's as beautiful as any film she does, but that's doesn't make it a great actress. Not many actors enjoyed filming with her, it was too high maintenance with very little acting to make up for it. Tony Curtis wasn't really into kissing her saying it was like 'Kissing Hitler'. Her singing was mediocre as well. Brown was great, and funny and his final line in the film is a master stroke. Wilder wrote many of the most wittiest one-liners on film in one line. That final line sum up the film so well. It's not the best movie, but nobody's perfect, so it's works for what it is. A fun, good, movie."

","I heard about this from it being number 1 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs, and it deserved to be, it is one of the greatest black and white comedies in history, from Oscar nominated director Billy Wilder. Basically two musicians, Joe (Tony Curtis, Jamie Lee Curtis's Dad) and Jerry (BAFTA and Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Jack Lemmon) who need a job playing their instruments, one day witness a murder, and the gang are now on their trail. To hide themselves, and get a job at the same time, they disguise themselves as two women (probably one of the first cross-dressing films) to join a women's live concert band. They call themselves Josephine (obviously) and Daphne (Jerry didn't like the name Geraldine). During their time in the band, they meet the solo singer of the band, Sugar Kane Kowalczyk (gorgeous Golden Globe winning Marilyn Monroe). To make sure he can get her, Joe disguises himself as a captain of a boat who calls himself Junior, with a very convincing Cary Grant impression/accent, another reason for this disguise is that Joe (as a woman) has an admirer, while disguised Jerry is pestered by Osgood Fielding III (Joe E. Brown). Also starring George Raft as Spats Colombo and Pat O'Brien as Det. Mulligan. The romance, the dressing as women, the accents, comedy faults and great ending with the great line, number 48 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes ""Well, nobody's perfect"" (after Jerry says he's a man) make this an excellent classic comedy. It won the Oscar for Best Costume Design, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy. Jack Lemmon was number 43, and Marilyn Monroe number 39 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, she was number 6 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women, Tony Curtis was number 86, and Monroe number 3 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols (she could have been number 1), and she was number 11 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, the film was number 16 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films, it was number 14 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and it was number 5 on The 100 Greatest Films.

In the meantime, they interact with Sugar (Marilyn Monroe) and lots of silly capers follow.  They run into the mob again at the end, but get away because everybody involved is so stupid.  At the end, we get this amazingly surprising revelation, ""but I'm a man!""  Capped off by a very memorable ending, ""Nobody's perfect!""  All these reviews say that this has them rolling around in laughter.  All it evoked from me was a wry chuckle, about the most laughter I got out of this movie.<br/><br/>What is supposed to be funny about this?  What is so ""sensual"" from Marilyn Monroe's performance?  Having not yet become a prolific movie-watcher, this is the only movie I've seen her in (primarily because it ranks so highly on the AFI 100 and IMDb charts and I wanted to find out what made it so good), and I can't tell if she really is the '50s equivalent of Pamela Lee, or is supposed to act the part of a bimbo.  The radiant sexuality she was supposed to exude is marred by the plain fact that she was a bit chunky.  At least Pamela has the body!<br/><br/>Which leads me to wonder: were '50s audiences this deprived?  That was my assumption, but I see loads of reviews from contemporary viewers saying that they found it hilarious -- which leaves me baffled.  Just *what* was so funny?  Almost each and every odd moment that is supposed to evoke humor only prompts me to say, ""This is stupid/moronic/silly.""  What perhaps makes this so *un*funny for me is the utter lack of realism.

Someone want to clue this philistinic reviewer in?<br/><br/>At this point, I must add that I am extremely disappointed in the quality of the reviews here.  I came here to find out *what* it was that I had missed, and I got basically *nothing* of useful content.  I mean, there must be *some* good reason that this is #14 on the AFI list, right?  Did it revolutionize the genre or the industry in the way that the mildly entertaining ""Citizen Kane"" did?  How?  I would have hoped and expected that the reviewers here, presumably of more intelligence and sophistication than the movie-going public at large that opts for ""There's Something About Mary,"" would have *something* useful to say about *what* makes this movie funny.  ""Jack Lemmon was great in drag"" tells me *nothing*.  That Jack Lemmon dressed in drag tells me *nothing*.<br/><br/>I'll refrain from passing judgment in the form of numbers of stars or #/10, pending some *useful* explanation for this unexplained phenomenon.  I might mention that this is the only movie in the top 20 on the AFI list about which I am thoroughly baffled for its being there.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, some recent-year movies I *did* find enjoyably funny include ""Election,"" ""The Big Lebowski,"" and ""Fight Club.""  (Now, Tyler Derden telling us that blowing up credit card company buildings will help achieve ""economic equilibrium"" -- now *that's* funny!)"

","Some Like it Hot is a truly delightful and hilarious comedy, complete with brilliant performances and great writing. This is the sort of comedy that has the desire of sex as part of the plot, and while there have been films that have ignored this, this film embraces it to stellar effect. The plot is brilliant in construction and almost elaborate, about two men escape after witnessing a mob fight, and join an all female band disguised as women, and this is where the film gets complicated. The direction from Billy Wilder is spot on, the cinematography is beautiful and the music is gorgeous. Other than the performances, the real treasure comes in the script, a mother load of classically delicious lines that are not only funny but intelligent as well. The performances are note perfect, while Tony Curtis and Jack Curtis give truly wonderful performances, it is the beautiful Marilyn Monroe in a deliciously seductive and sly performance who steals the acting honours. All in all, a truly wonderful comedy, right up there with comedies like Duck Soup and Night At the Opera as one of the best comedies of all time. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

"Snow Leopard","Null","2","4","20 September 2004"," Wilder & A Fine Cast Make a Goofy Story Very Enjoyable
","Billy Wilder's great story-telling skills and a fine group of performers take a pretty goofy story and make ""Some Like It Hot"" a very enjoyable movie, whose carefree disregard for realism belies a skillful and creative production. With a tale so full of implausible developments and characters, it's almost as if Wilder wanted to see just how far he could stretch it and still come up with a top-quality picture. It's hard not to compare it with Hitchcock's ""North By Northwest"", released the same year, in which Hitchcock and another excellent cast tell an equally unlikely story with exceptional craftsmanship.<br/><br/>With their energetic yet contrasting personas, Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis make an ideal leading pair for a movie of this nature, . Their energy and their sense of just how far they can exaggerate things make it very easy to like their characters and to become interested in what happens to them, and in turn that makes everything else fit together.<br/><br/>While much of what Marilyn Monroe does cannot properly be called acting, she does work particularly well here. She was very well-matched with her character, and comes across quite naturally. The supporting cast all have much smaller roles, but they are also crucial to making the movie so entertaining. George Raft, Nehemiah Persoff and Joe E. Brown all get some particularly good moments.<br/><br/>Wilder himself pulls out all the stops to add a lot of creativity to the settings and to move things along at an ideal pace, bringing the characters to one new predicament after another. The most implausible developments become amusing when handled with such craftsmanship. While some of Wilder's other pictures were more impressive as artistic achievements, for entertainment value this is as good as any of them."

","For being such an old film, this was hilarious. It's especially filled with little nice touches, things than the moment when you see them, you can't help but laugh. A lot of the humor makes fun of the mob, a little of it is even black humor. When I sat down to watch it, I had no idea it was so unbelievably funny. The humor is pretty much constant, there is mostly something to laugh at every single minute of the entire movie. Something that's great about the humor is that it comes off as naturally funny, it doesn't try too hard to be funny. Tony Curtis was great, so was Jack Lemmon; even Marilyn Monroe was pretty good in this movie. This movie has some of the funniest moments ever seen on film, and should be viewed by pretty much everyone who's into romantic comedies. I've only seen it once so far, but I have a feeling that I'll watch it many more times. It's one of those films that never get old.

Am I sexist?  When it comes to the beautiful job in the creation of the quintessential beauty of Marylin Monroe, yes, I enjoy the great aesthetic gift of nature to mankind that she was.  Not to mention that she wasn't a dumb blonde, but surprisingly insightful.  When she married Joe Dimaggio, a reporter asked her if she regretted her early tragic life.  Marylin Monroe answered, ""No, because it all brought me to this wonderful moment.""  That's real insight. Unfortunately, Dimaggio had no idea how to commit to loving someone who was deeply troubled by her past and evidently he couldn't stand the competition, so once again she got dumped and dumped on.<br/><br/>""Some Like It Hot"" is a Black and White tragedy that could have been such a great success in Color."

","It was Monroe who couldn't get around.
My dad told me a long time ago that Marilyn was a beautiful woman. I stared at the voluptuous woman moving across the screen and her slightly bloated figure, wondering where her beauty lay, and now her face burned me.
In the movie, she describes her ideal man in a tone of infinite fascination, saying that he should wear his eyes, because it would make him look naive and helpless, just like herself. To the heartbreaking face of innocence. But Billy Wilder saw right through her, put her on the moonlit yacht, and told her in a blissful voice, ""I wish my mother was here, and she saw me with a girl from Nevada and shell ii."" It's eerily true. At the end of the movie, she hops on a yacht with a poor guy.
The essence of comedy is coincidence. There must be a ""wish mama was here"" moment in life, but there was no yacht that happened to be there at the end of the day, and even if there were, she would not have followed the pauper. That dreamy expression made her face seem to have been enveloped in a light mist, filled with longing for the world of flowers. The desire of a moth for a lamp is no better than the desire of a butterfly for spring. The moving dream is that the candle fire like spring fog dense unknown place. The century she was in had not yet begun like a flower in a fog, and Titanic was not yet happy that her head had fallen into the water. Who would have thought of the thousand doom that lay ahead? Who can blame a woman for a lack of resourcefulness for a desire that is not even ambitious? She lost to grace kelly, she lost to Jacqueline Kennedy, nezha was just a kid even though he had three heads and six arms, and sun wukong was just a monkey even though he had one head and six arms. This world belongs to the tang priest who looks the most like the tathagata. The western sky is also only one, even if the mouth is hard, also have to admit that the western world today looks like the United States. Women are like grace and Jacqueline. Monroe, the woman like Monroe, like wrong love on the queen of tang's monk, in addition to the United States, in addition to sad, what still have? Had to desolate send jade emperor brother to travel, but this is not her fault, pig eight quit, sand monk, sun monkey did not mention, she never saw a better man.

","There is plenty about this comedy with music that stands the test of time. Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis play musicians who are being pursued by gangsters because they have witnessed a murder.

How do they fool anyone with those ridiculous wigs? Does Jack Lemmon actually put out for Joe E. Brown? Don't ask.

""Polish?"" she is asked. ""Yes, I come from this musical family. My mother's a piano teacher. My father was a conductor.""

"zeekwunlau","8","0","0","14 April 2020"," After Monroe, there are no more elves
","Monroe, as always, canary-style performances. Full of enthusiasm, sexiness, sweet voice, and grinning smile. However, the screenwriter of this movie is quite reluctant, the male protagonist who is dressed as a woman is not recognized, and then he is not recognized as a man. This ridiculous screenwriter has made the actors and directors no matter how hard they try. This film is inevitably attributed to mediocrity in the long film.<br/><br/>However, I think most people will not pay attention to these details, just looking at the little elf Monroe is enough. This is one of the last films in her short life. The thought of the stunner's death in a few years will inevitably be sad.<br/><br/>In fact, this film has a lot of highlights, for example, reflecting the Chicago gang fight, which is the prelude to the gangster film in full swing in the future. Almost all the characters in the future gangster movies are this image. And the public officials who always keep an eye on the gang are also an excellent addition to this movie. I mean, this movie, which is not a gangster film, raises the benchmark of gangster movies to a relatively high level.<br/><br/>The years are really long, the three of those years: Hepburn, Elizabeth Taylor, Monroe. One by one passed away. If Monroe did not die that year, we would eventually see an old woman like Taylor. And this contrast is simply unforgivable. Monroe used her premature death to freeze her beauty in our hearts!"

Curtis and Lemmon on the run after accidentally witnessing a gangland massacre have to dress up as females to hide from the mob and Monroe joins them. Ends with famous Joe E.

"frankde-jong","8","0","0","31 December 2019"," Billy Wilders has a perfect command over the screwball genre
","In my review of ""Parasite"" (2019, Bong Joon Ho) I said that mixing crime and comedy is best done by Joel and Ethan Coen. Now I have to admit that also Billy Wilder understands this job.<br/><br/>In ""Some like it hot"" the mix is heavily tilted towards comedy, the role of crime being limited to giving an inducement. But that does not diminish the achievement of Wilder in any way. I have long evaded this film because I am not a great lover of comedy's with men in women's cloth. They tend to be rather silly ans insiped. Think of films as ""Tootsie"" (1982, Sydney Pollack) and ""Mrs Doubtfire"" (1993, Chris Columbus) not to speak of a play like ""Charlie's aunt"". It is the merit of Billy Wilder but also of his main actors that they make such a funny film out of such an antiquated concept. When the story moves from Chicago to the seaside of Florida it almost becomes a naughty version of ""Les vacances de Mrs Hulot"" (1953, Jacques Tati).<br/><br/>I already mentioned the main actors. They all did a splendid job. Jack Lemmon was at the peak of his career and would make ""The apartment"" the next year (aslo with Billy Wilder). Tony Curtis, often casted for his good looks in the beginning of his career, had proven his ability for serious acting in ""Sweet smell of success"" (1957, Alexander Mackendrick) and ""The defiant ones"" (1958, Stanley Kramer) in the previous years. For Marilyn Monroe it is one of her last appearances. She is still sexy and innocent at the same time, as if fully unaware of the effect that her body has on men. In ""Some like it hot"" she sings ""I wanna be loved by you"" in a very sensuous way, dressed in a robe that shows (almost offers) her breasts in the most advantageous way.<br/><br/>During the film two relationships evolve. One is between Jack Lemon as Daphne and Joe Brown as an old millionaire. In this relationship Joe does not know that Daphne in reality is a man. This relationship is hardcore screwball, but on a very high level. The other relationship is between Marilyn Monroe as Sugar Kane and Tony Curtis playing a fake milliionaire. In this relationship Marilyn does not know that Tony Curtis in reality doesn't have a dime. This relationship outgrows the screwball character and even becomes a real romance. Especially poignant is that the Marilyn Monroe character says she always falls in love with the wrong men and is finally looking for a serious and quiet one. Just as in real life one is inclined to think."
"davidmvining","10","0","0","27 November 2019"," An expert mixture of comedy, tension, sex, and romance
","This movie is about as pure entertainment as movies can get. It's an expert mixture of comedy, tension, sex, and romance that creates such a complete package of good times that Hollywood has very rarely come close to matching. Working with I.A.L. Diamond for the second time after Love in the Afternoon, Billy Wilder crafted an essentially perfect film.<br/><br/>Set during Prohibition, we follow two jazz musicians after they witness a gangland murder and try to run for their lives. They're broke and can't even pay to get to a regular job 100 miles from Chicago much less fund an escape from the mob, so they do the only logical thing. They dress up like women and join an all-female band headed to Florida for three weeks. The two have been so consumed with bare survival in the winter of Chicago where they could only ever find unsteady work, that romance has been a secondary objective for a long time. Suddenly thrown into a train car with a dozen beautiful women including Sugar Kane (played perfectly by Marilyn Monroe), the two don't need to worry about feeding themselves or the back rent on their apartment or the coats they lost in a bet at a dog race.<br/><br/>Jerry, played by Jack Lemmon, embraces his femininity fully while also embracing the potential for sexual escapades. Joe, played by Tony Curtis, is a bit more forward thinking and knows that if they give away the game they'll be off the train and ready to freeze to death in the winter cold. Jerry sees their escape as an excuse to have fun, but since none of the other women on the train are suspicious of them, they treat the two like any other girl, ruining Jerry's attempt to have a surprise party with Sugar Kane by piling into his single berth in a display of absurdism that still feels completely natural in the film.<br/><br/>Two romances develop in the film. The first is between Joe and Sugar. It was Jerry who originally tried to make a lustful move towards the innocently sensual Sugar, but it's Joe who makes a concerted effort to win her heart. He's a man in a disguise who takes up another disguise (as a millionaire) while she is a woman who professes a need for a millionaire but also admits that she can't help herself around saxophone players (which Joe is). They're both lying about who they are to the other. Sugar is lying to both herself and to Joe's alter ego, Junior, about what she wants while Joe is lying to Sugar about who he is. The mutual lies end up canceling each other out in a way.<br/><br/>Jerry gets the second romance, this one with a real millionaire, Osgood Fielding III (played wonderfully by Joe E. Brown). He's a serial husband looking for his next wife (either eighth or ninth, only his mother keeps an accurate count), and he's smitten by Daphne, Jerry's alter-ego. Joe ends up bullying Jerry into playacting for Fielding in order to help Joe woo Sugar. The dual scene of Joe's reversed seduction of Sugar and the night out that Fielding and Jerry share is a marvelous display of contrasts. Joe is playing an impotent (maybe homosexual) rich dandy who needs Sugar Kane's feminine wiles to bring him back to life, so to speak. She tries with all of her innocently sexual energy. At the same time, Jerry and Fielding are dancing in a Cuban nightclub, Jerry accidentally leading at times while they grow closer in synch to the point where they can perfectly transfer a rose stem from one mouth to the other. It's a perfect mesh of comedic visuals with narrative push, driving the absurd romances on both sides forward.<br/><br/>The action of the film comes to a head when the gangsters from Chicago coincidentally have a get together with mobs from across the country in the same Florida hotel. The slapstick nature of two men dressed in drag running from gangsters reaches its peak here, embracing the absurdity with both arms fully. The resolution to the two romances is rather perfect as well. Joe and Sugar shedding their mutual deceit and falling into each other's arms in the back of Fielding's boat while Fielding dismisses all of Daphne's flaws as acceptable, even the fact that Daphne is actually Jerry.<br/><br/>Never has Wilder's common motif of masks and deception been more explicit than in Some Like it Hot (though The Major and the Minor comes close). He uses it to great comedic effect, crafting one of Hollywood's great comedies that feels as fresh in 2019 as it surely did in 1959."

In order to escape town, the pair dress up as women to join an all-girl band heading for Florida. In a bid to woo the troupe's beautiful ukelele player and singer Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe), womaniser Joe ditches his Josephine persona to become billionaire Shell Oil Junior, which causes all manner of problems for his pal Jerry. Meanwhile, the Chicago gangsters are in the Sunshine State for a convention, booked into the same hotel as the band. How long will it be before they recognise the two fugitives?<br/><br/>Voted the number one funniest movie of all time by the American Film Institute, Some Like It Hot is pure comedy gold that never puts a foot wrong, from its exciting opening car chase between cops and gangsters, to its now famous last line, ""Well, nobody's perfect"".

A film that made a choice that many would have considered a bit ""too ambitious"" or "" too outrageous"" for when it was made that choice being having two men dress and act like women. I definitely feel the idea of cross-dressing would be more acceptable in today's world despite some of society's/culture's differences on the matter, but making a choice such as cross-dressing back in 1959 was a very bold move. The story of the film is a cleverly written piece a comedy gold which combines not only humor but wit, amusement, and great direction. The comedy genre is probably one of the hardest genres to become acclaimed by both critics and audiences, whereas, other genres like dramas some times have easier when it comes being considered an acclaiming film.

","How unbelievably historical are the scenes in which Marilyn Monroe, playing Sugar Kane Kowalczyk, a struggling singer looking for love and a good life, sings those beautiful love ballads; first time standing in front of her band and second time, sitting on the side of a piano, confessing she is ""through with love""--both times so real and so timeless.<br/><br/>She is such a cynical character, but she is a timeless work of art, her flamboyancy befitting perfectly among the likes of equally cynical characters, from the mobster Spats Colombo (George Raft) and his circle, to Detective Mulligan (Pat O'Brien) who is pursuing justice for his ego--and then, of course, Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) the two musicians on the run, disguised as the opposite sex. Billy Wilder created a world filled with characters who are all looking for primordial things: Mulligan, for instance, loves taunting the mobsters he is investigating, as he throws his cigar in their face and yelling in the mobsters' big boss hearing device--how he would love to nail them, only to feel smarter.<br/><br/>But the main boldness of this film is the sex shape-shifting of its two lead characters, Joe and Jerry, as they struggle to survive and adapt to the habits of the opposite sex like, you know, going into the correct (or incorrect) bathroom. Yet by keeping the act rolling and by hiding its liberal views, this film shines through its comedic genius. There is a rhythm to everything. The characters, while uneducated, are smart, witty and quick to answer. Comedic timing is on point; there are dozens of techniques, characters and scenarios which I recognize and are attempted to be remade even in today's comedies.<br/><br/>There is a scene in which Joe, disguised as a millionaire and acting as a subtle parody to Cary Grant, attempts to win Sugar over. He lies about having a yacht and how he will take her there and whatnot. These characters live in the moment and flow with an incredible freedom and precision. In this scene, he and Sugar change lines on the spot: ""Look, if you're interested in whether I am married or not...""; ""Oh, I'm not interested at all.""; ""Well, I'm not.""; ""That's very interesting"" Sugar closes with an eager smile.<br/><br/>Billy Wilder made a mess of unorthodox characters, all driven by Darwinist senses: Joe and Jerry claim to be pals looking out for each other, but as they get closer to Sugar, they constantly try to out-smart each other to win her, while Sugar is straight-up: ""I want a millionaire"" and she admits she is not very bright. Watching this film, you get the feeling they could be caught at any time, and I will not spoil the ending, but I will tell you that the ending line is what truly seals this film's place on the pantheon of greatness. I will not tell you what it is, but it completely makes you wonder whether Joe and Jerry were playing the joke on everyone else or the other way around--and if so, did anyone care?<br/><br/>""Some Like It Hot"" is one of those masterpieces which will be remembered for how great of a comedy it is and not much more; but the scenes with Marylin Monroe are of an inviting sexuality--all dressed in glamour, presentable, yet igniting primordial thoughts. These are characters whose motives change to what brings them immediate pleasure, forget the consequences, he can find out that I am a man after the wedding! What's the big deal, anyway?"

","It's absolutely thrilling how funny and rather progressive ""Some Like It Hot"" is, even a full 60 years after its release. The main story isn't particularly original, but Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis are so perfect in their lead roles that it's a pleasure to just abandon yourself to the movie's lightness. For his part, Lemmon gives an energetic, animated performance, while Curtis instead goes for broke and treats the material seriously, and the two contrasting approaches makes every scene memorable in different ways. Marilyn Monroe is on hand as an unlikely love interest, but this is Curtis and Lemmon's show, and writer-director Billy Wilder and I.A.D. Diamond's screenplay is laugh out loud funny. Despite its age, the movie has a surprisingly progressive attitude towards gender roles and the different pressures experienced by the two sexes, but it doesn't get bogged down by politics and instead focuses on its characters, and the finished product is a charming classic."

","Some Like It Hot is a comedy in which it shows how two men (Curtis and Lemmon) have to flee from a mafia band that wants to kill them after having witnessed a horrible crime. Meanwhile, they learn that an orchestra composed solely of women is looking for two components to join them. At first they think that it is not a very viable option, but given their economic situation and the mafia that persecutes them, they do not hesitate to join the musical group disguising themselves as women to go unnoticed. During their stay with the orchestra they will meet Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe), the singer of the group and a very passionate young woman.
This film, true masterpiece of the director Billy Wilder, is one of the best comedies thanks to its protagonists Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon in which the viewer can have fun all the time.

","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>Posing as women in order to become part of an all-female music group in order to elude Chicago gangsters is quite the foundation for this late 50's comedic romp. Wrong place, wrong time for two blokes who witness gangstersÂ….erÂ….umÂ….doing business and run away after they are spotted is how the movie starts out. While it starts off rather serious it quickly switches to a screwball comedy with a gluttony of gags around the two guys trying to keep their female cover within the band as long as they can while not getting aroused (double entendre) as they befriend Marilyn's character. How long will they be able to keep their cover and their lips off Marilyn? Will those Chicago gangsters ever catch wind of their whereabouts? Overall the plot was fine, nothing great.

","""Some Like It Hot"", 1959<br/><br/>***.5 (Very Good)<br/><br/>A mini, capsule review. I viewed this film yesterday for the first time. I already knew the reputation of this film as one of Hollywood's best comedies. I was impressed and entertained by the clever and insightful screenplay, acting, film editing and directing. The story is set in 1929 Prohibition Chicago and then moves to Miami. This was one of the first films of it's kind for it's day back in 1959. Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis are funny as two down on their luck musicians who witness a gangster murder, aka: The St. Valentines's Day Massacre. They go on the run from the gangsters and decide to go to Miami disguised as women while accompanying other traveling female musicians.<br/><br/>Billy Wilder directed and co-wrote the adapted screenplay to this film. From this film and his previous past successes, Wilder has displayed a real talent for creative and insightful screenplays. In this film, he uses his social commentary style to positive effect in a cross dressing comedy. ""Some Like it Hot"" also makes fun of gangster films. Production values are high: cinematography, art direction and makeup. Wilder actually chose to photograph this film in black and white because of the garish makeup designs of it's two acting leads: Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon. ""Some Like It Hot"" succeeds on several levels: funny and insightful social commentary and acting. The editing and directing show a natural pacing and rhythm that works very well for a comedy film. One of Hollywood's best ever films of any genre."
"marissas75","10","0","0","29 March 2007"," Cross-dressing and so much more: one of the funniest comedies ever
","Its reputation holds true: ""Some Like It Hot"" is an inimitable classic of Hollywood comedy. Though men dressing up as women (and vice versa) is one of the oldest gags in the book, Billy Wilder brings this plot device to its culmination.<br/><br/>It probably begins with the fact that in ""Some Like It Hot,"" there are two men in disguise out-of-work musicians Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon)instead of just one. Sometimes, in comedy, nothing succeeds like excess, and with two cross-dressers, the movie can spin out twice as many funny situations. Also, the two men act as one another's foils and confidants, in a kind of friendly rivalry.<br/><br/>In all comedies of this type, the disguised hero inevitably falls in love with a beautiful girl (here, Sugar Kane, played by Marilyn Monroe) and has an old man fall in love with him (Osgood Fielding, played by Joe E. Brown). ""Some Like it Hot"" splits this plot between its two heroesJoe gets the girl, Jerry gets the guyand then takes things in unexpected directions. Joe creates another persona for himself as the millionaire ""Junior"" in order to woo Sugar, which allows Curtis to do a hilarious (and anachronistic) impression of Cary Grant. Meanwhile, Jerry gets struck by a sort of gender confusion, which allows Lemmon to give the movie's standout performance. Jerry is always more comfortable as a girl than Joe iswatch the gleam in his eye when he announces that his name is ""Daphne""and when Osgood proposes to him, he goes over the moon. He says it's because he figures that he can get a quick divorce and lifetime alimony, but really, it's obvious that his girlish pride has been flattered.<br/><br/>Sugar Kane is the quintessential Marilyn Monroe rolethe ditzy, vulnerable sex symbol from the wrong side of the tracks. I don't care how much trouble she caused on the set; her performance is completely adorable. Interestingly, Osgood is just as sweet and trusting as Sugarperhaps even more, since he is asexual to the point of naïveté. <br/><br/>There's so much great stuff in ""Some Like It Hot"" that some of it even goes overlooked. I tend to forget that there are funny Mafia-movie parodies at the beginning and end (Joe and Jerry are forced to don their disguises to hide after witnessing a Mob murder). The movie really presents a wide variety of humor, not just two hours of pointing out how silly it is for a man to act like a woman. Anyone who loves good-natured, slightly subversive, impeccably crafted, high-energy comedies will certainly like it hot."

","I haven't seen this film until this past weekend. I know it has been highly rated as an all time classic comedy and I can see why. I love Tony CUrtis and Jack Lemmon as two male band players forced to dress up as women in order to get out of CHicago after the Valentine's Day massacre in 1929. Tony Curtis deserves a lot of credit for playing the male suitor to Marilyn Monroe's Sugar. Even though Jack Lemmon is hysterical as Daphne, you can't forget how giddy and happy he is when he finds love with a male suitor played wonderfully by Joe E. Brown. I forget who plays the female conductor but she's also wonderful in the film. It's sad that Marilyn Monroe died so young only three years after making this wonderful classic film. She and Tony Curtis appear made for each other in this film. Jack Lemmon was well deserved of his Oscar nomination but I can't imagine why they left out Tony Curtis. Billy Wilder chose wisely to film it in black and white. I love the train ride scenes and once they are down in Florida. I love and miss both Jack Lemmon and Marilyn Monroe.

","""Some Like It Hot"" is an outstanding comedy from 1959, directed by the genius that was Billy Wilder and starring three true Hollywood greats. Marilyn Monroe, Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis supply all the laughs with their flawless comedic performances. The film is based around two musicians (Curtis and Lemmon) who find themselves witnesses to a gangland shooting. They search desperately for a musical job that will send them else where so they can escape the mob who are quickly tracking them down to ''silence'' them. The only available job is that of a girl group. Desperate times call for desperate measures and the unlikely pair take on fake names and through make-up and dress become women impersonators to join the girl group undetected.<br/><br/>Of course, their quest is not an easy one and it leads to truly hilarious results. I'm not going to reel of endless details of the film's funniest moments but needless to say there are a whole wealth of them. Marilyn Monroe is outstanding in the film, and it proves once and for all what an under-appreciated true great of comedy acting she was. Curtis and Lemmon are a flawless double act and both put in career defining performances here. Monroe was reportedly at her most difficult during the film's production, but whatever was needed to create this truly wonderful box office gem was well worth it.

Conveniently, the two girls missing were the bass and sax players (hey, it's the movies).  Reluctant at first, the boys were finally persuaded after an accidental run-in with the Chicago mob.  So they hiked up their ""high-heels"" and got on that bus as 'Geraldine' and 'Josephine', instead of Jerry and Joe. As usual, mishaps and jealousy of a girl (Marylin Monroe) take place, and it unfolds into one of the most witty movies of the time.  Go out and rent this flick."

","Sorry but NOBODY is perfect. Although I adore this movie, and count it to the ten best comedies of the XX.

This wouldn´t be that disturbing if you couldn´t see the actual California coastline at the horizon during the first beach scene and everyone who´ve been to Florida knows there are definitely NO cliffs at all at the Floridian coast. This is the only small mistake I find in this all-time classic, and when I read some of the bad comments (I´m really astonished that there are actually some of them!) I think those people should better watch ""There´s something about Mary"" or other comedies dedicated to mediocre tastes. Those who seriously consider the screenplay and the dialogue a bad one have absolutely NO idea what defines a good script and a good movie. I give this comedy-highlight (despite the california blooper) a 10."

Also, while the transvestism per se isn't funny, it opens nice ways for the plot to develop. (But I guess that also holds true for white guys putting on blackface, eating watermelon and stealing televisions.) So, in short, if you can hold back the civilized reflex disgust of seeing constant mockery of transvestism, this movie might give rise to a few laughs."

","After an hour of grueling agony, my wife and I had to turn this god-awful waste of videotape off.  There wasn't anything even remotely funny in it, and everyone acted like a moron, especially Monroe's character. In fact, Marilyn Monroe showed off genuine talent because it's not easy to act that stupid.  She played the quintessential DUMB Blonde. In fact, the only good thing in the movie was that the acting was pretty good.  But good acting can in no way make up for idiot characters and dialogue, a weak story and inept direction."
"MovieAddict2016","7","3","9","2 December 2005"," Not the funniest film ever made, but essential viewing
","The first time I saw ""Some Like it Hot"" as a teenager I didn't really like it very much. It was one of my father's favorite films but after he watched it again with me even he claimed he found it to be quite disappointing, and that he had ""remembered it being funnier."" I know the whole genre-swapping thing was risqué in 1959 and I appreciate the layers of the film - all the sexual references (such as Tony Curtis' pointed foot during his scene with Marilyn Monroe as a pretty obvious sight gag) and other stuff that goes on. However I couldn't help but find my overall reaction somewhat mixed. Viewing it again a few years later I found it to be a bit more enjoyable, but I still would not call it the greatest comedy of all-time.<br/><br/>In my opinion Wilder's other collaboration with Jack Lemmon, a similarly ahead-of-its time and racy film called ""The Apartment"" (released a year later), is superior to ""Some Like It Hot."" But this one seems to receive even more critical attention than Wilder and Lemmon's other film and I believe it was voted by the AFI as the second funniest film of all time (with ""Tootsie"" at number one).<br/><br/>The performances cannot be faulted. Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis are both very good and Curtis' classic Cary Grant impersonation has become something of a film legend. Monroe isn't the best actress in the world (and it's certainly not as good a performance as she gave in ""The Misfits"" a couple years later) but she's basically there to look pretty and be bubbly, and that works well.<br/><br/>Overall I'd say this comedy works rather well for the first forty minutes, but like many body-swapping comedies of today, once the ideas run out it kind of gets old fast. The Cary Grant impersonation and Lemmon's hilarious (and rather disturbing) romance with a rich man whilst dressed up as a woman both add a bit of flair to the plot, but in the end I'd say I find it to be more fondly remembered than it perhaps deserves to be - but that's just me."

","Most dedicated film fans will know the storyline of this classic comedy. Two guys dress up as women to escape the mafia after witnessing the St Valentine Day massacre. Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis give stealing performances. Marilyn Monroe is also great as the innocent and naive starlet. Jack Lemmon's performance to me is probably the funniest comedy movie performance of all time. He is an absolute riot! What a great actor! However I gave this classic less than 10 stars as I dislike mafia and gangsters. These days I usually skip the first 30 minutes (i.e. the worst part of the film): The antics of Spats Colombo and the other cretinous lowlife gangs leave me cold. Also the film would have had a much better ending if ALL the mafia gangsters came to a grisly end."

","""Some Like it Hot"" is the first of its kind. By that I mean that countless movies followed with the same plot: men can't do something being men so they dress up as women only to fall for a drop-dead gorgeous woman who just so happens to be really close with them. This movie however is the first to do this and does it in the best way possible.<br/><br/>What's good about ""Some Like it Hot"" is that it stays away from clichés and doesn't center around friendship and heartbreak, but moreso on the humor aspect of the movie. Almost every scene in the movie keeps you watching and throws you in a hysterical fit. It's a movie that shouldn't be over-analyzed, and should be watched solely for entertainment.<br/><br/>Jack Lemon is brilliant in his Oscar-nominated performance as the witty and eccentric Dephne, and plays his character with such convincing mannerism that we tend to forget it's actually a man. In one hilarious and unforgettable scene, 'Daphne' convinces himself he's a woman by telling Joe 'Josephine' (Tony Curtis) that he's never been happier because a millionaire proposed to him. It is both comical and original, showing that you can only pretend to be someone for so long.<br/><br/>Marilyn Manroe co-stars as Sugar, a sexy and beautiful alcoholic musician who falls for Joe's third identity, Junior. This creates an even more comic-genius plot, having countless identities running around trying to stay in character. It definitely defines comedy brilliance.<br/><br/>The whole concept of the story of ""Some Like it Hot"" is complete comic material. This movie allowed the three main actors to really reach out and play around with their roles and to have fun while doing it. It's not often that a movie features a lot of improvisation in order for the character to feel both real and staged.<br/><br/>Influencing countless movies, comedies and romantic dramas alike, ""Some Like it Hot"" still stands as one of the best comedies of all time. And for a good reason."

","Some like it Hot is a film that contains a blend of adjectives; humorous, seductive, ironic, pitiful, just to name a few. The plot of the film is rather funny as two men take on a journey in which they witness a crime which then shuttles them to an adventurous chase, (in which they are the ones chased). Marilyn Monroe's presence in this film makes every scene she is seductive, and as to Marilyn's talent; as an actress she is an amazing doctor.<br/><br/>It is pitiful to watch this film reflect a view on women in the 50's, for the way in which they are all portrayed as gold diggers who lack the confidence in becoming anything else than a housewife. In this case Some like it Hot does a good job on demonstrating life back then. This film's popularity is solely due to Monroe's rising popularity as well. It is a bit ironic how Monroe's character has a weakness for men and turns to alcohol when her relationships tumble down. This is a very close portrayal to her real life, making the film all about Marilyn Monroe. Some Like it Hot should have been titled, Some Like Monroe, for the way in which she is made to show the typical blonde image  some people possess."

This is the movie where I realized what an absolute genius Jack Lemmon was. He was sooooo good. I had a friend who I got a DVD player for as a gift and what movie did I get her? Some Like it Hot! She came to work the next day screaming that it was the funniest movie ever. She said she watched it 5 times in one day, she couldn't believe how funny it is.

Well-structured and paced until the overextended home stretch, with Lemmon and Curtis in fine form (the former gets most of the best lines, the latter trots out a pretty amusing Cary Grant impersonation), despite the fact that neither one is remotely convincing as a member of the opposite sex; trouble is, it's just not all that funny, stretching its one-joke premise razor thin and lacking invention during the expected plot complications. Amusing enough to rate as decent entertainment, but its reputation as one of the funniest films of all-time is puzzling; maybe one's mileage would improve if they find men wearing women's clothes inherently funny by concept alone?

","IMDb is having a great injustice, doubtless the misguided influence of political correctness. Keep in mind this was released in 1959. I saw this at the Lawrence Park theater in Broomall, probably age 10, before Valenti. Thanks goodness I looked much older, but I don't believe there were any restrictions anyway at that time. After seeing it shortly after its release, I have probably seen it 30 times or more since, both at the Cinema & on little screens. Clearly one of the greatest comedies of all time & unequivocally one of my top two (with the other being Tampopo.) Some Like It Hot was arguably MM's best role & she was almost up staged by her two drag partners in crime, Jack Lemmon & Tony Curtis, for whom this was arguably their best role as well. Billy Wilder was at the height of his powers & despite his famous difficulties with MM, he managed to squeeze her most endearing performance & provided flattering cinematography. I believe this was Wilder's finest comedy, which is saying something. Keep in mind this was 1959 & was conceived under a long Eisenhower administration. Wilder was way out on this one & I suspect JFK requested the dress MM wore when she crooned him for his birthday come from this flick. Don't write many comments, but trending down ain't right for this MASTERPIECE."

Second, they disguise themselves as women to belong to an all women band and flee the state. Finally, they love the same woman, a member of the band who plays the ukulele, but they are found by the Mafia. I like the cast of the main characters in this film because they all act very well. Especially, I like the actors of two male musicians. I think it is difficult that actors act as women, but the actors of two male musicians act well and make the film very funny. Then, I also like the actress of the heroine, Marilyn Monroe. In this film, she has some scenes where she sings. Therefore, we can listen to her song and voice. In my opinion, though she doesn't sing well, her unique voice attracts us. When I watched the scene, I listened attentively to her song. This film has a lot of point worthy of note. This is the funniest film I have ever seen."

Catching their eye is the band's vocalist & ukulele player as the two are instantly enticed by her beauty and compete for her affection while maintaining their disguises.<br/><br/>Directed by Billy Wilder, the film carries a zestful atmosphere from the beginning & is full of hilarious moments that hold up pretty well even today. The screenplay is another work of quality that benefits greatly from Wilder's innate ability to infuse humour even in the most unexpected moments. Camera-work is fluid, editing is neat & music compliments its narrative excellently.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, the main cast comprises of Marilyn Monroe & her two bosom companions in Tony Curtis & Jack Lemmon. And although Monroe's performance may not be that enticing, her screen presence certainly is. Curtis & Lemmon also share an amazing chemistry together but the latter turns out to be an absolute live-wire in his given role & impressed the most.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Some Like It Hot has wonderfully endured the test of time and remains one of its genre's most enjoyable, entertaining & influential works.

Her character in Seven Year Inch doesn't even have a name! Her Sugar Kane (aka Sugar Kowalczyk), while ""not very bright"" by her own admission, has an optimism and a sadness that was what made Monroe the icon she is today.

The films closing is a riot involving this plot line. <br/><br/>That set up for this film seems quite simple, but when you watch it you realize how difficult it was to set up & how talented the cast is. I think it can still be enjoyed by viewers, even now. This film is not the first to involve men dressing as women for comic effects. Charlie Chaplin did it in a short before 1920. It is the best film to use it to comic effect though honorable mention should be made to Tootsie & Mrs. Doubtfire in this category.<br/><br/>This one is better because the script works so well than nothing about it seems absurd or abnormal.

","'It's the biggest slapstick comedy ever created,' Billy Wilder used to warn the reporters.<br/><br/>Gangsters from the era of prohibition and ladies from a female orchestra. Milioneers and the unemployed of the Great Crisis. Escapes and chases. Love. Sex and dressing-ups. All this spins in a craftly-planned order.<br/><br/>In the year 1984 an English magazine 'Time Out' judged 'Some Like It Hot' very harshly. 'Stereotypical sexism, hopelessly stupid jokes, lots of bad taste.' Five years later, the same magazine asked 60 film critics and directors to join a survey for 100 greatest film in the history of cinema and Wilder's movie ended up on the 4th place. As the greatest comedy of all times. In movie guidelines edited by that newspaper, the quoted opinion has never been repeated.<br/><br/>The idea was given to the writers by a German film 'Fanfares of Love' with a female orchestra 'The Cyclamens' and dressing-ups. They however changed everything here. The plot begins in the year 1929 in Chicago. Joe and Jerry. Two unemployed musicians. They unwillingly become witnesses of the infamous St. Valentine's Day massacre and the begin running away in female costumes. They join a female orchestra which is on its way to Florida. Joe. Dressed as Josephine. He falls in love in a singer called Sugar. And Jenny as Daphne becomes an object of energetic courtship of an old millionaire.<br/><br/>A parody of gangster movies from the 20's. It fluently bind with humor and burlesque of the crazy comedies from the 30's. The dressing-ups give occasions of playing uncountable spicy jokes. And they co-create the atmosphere of the film which is filled with eroticism. But Wilder succeeds in keeping balance.<br/><br/>The film was such a big success thanks to marvelous acting of the the three main performers. Tony Curtis as Joe makes a parody of Cary Grant. Jack Lemmon with the role of Jerry/Daphne begun a wonderful co-operation with Wilder (7 movies, including 'The Apartment'). And Marilyn Monroe. Sensual. Full of charm. Always troubled with something. She made a discrete parody of a naive-blond-type. And she filled the gaps of her role with some songs.<br/><br/>There was however a mass of trouble with her. Monroe was usually late or she didn't appear on the stage. She didn't remember her dialogs. She sometimes got the grip after more than 20 cuts. There is a scene. She goes into Joey's room in it. And she asks, 'Where is the bourbon?'. That scene was repeated 47 times. Nothing helped. Even cards with text that were put in the drawers she was opening. Noot even big signs behind the camera. Her partner, Tony Curtis, was significantly frustrated. He was tired of repeating because his freshness of play was gone. After the scene with the kiss, Curtis said, ""Kissing Monroe is like kissing Hitler"". The behavior of the actress was later explained by her shyness. Her problems. Suspecting her own disbelief in her talent. And psychological depression caused by the fact that she was pregnant at that time.<br/><br/>The movie won Golden Globe Awards for the best comedy and the performances by Marylin Monroe and Jack Lemmon. However the Oscar went only to the costume designer - Orry-Kelly."

"Det_McNulty","8","1","2","4 April 2007"," One Of The Most Delightfully Entertaining Films Ever Made; ""Some Like It Hot"" Remains The Definitive Screwball Comedy
","Throughout cinema history there have been many historic comedians, all varying in style and range. From the likes of Chaplin and Keaton to the Pythons and the Coens and to directors like Billy Wilder. Wilder is a man who never failed to create the perfect slice of entertainment, as he once said ""movies should be like amusement parks"". Although, Some Like It Hot is a flawed film and not on the same level as Wilder's true cinematic masterpieces it still remains a highly accomplished work of entertainment. And there are no wonders as to why it was ranked no.1 on AFI's ""Funniest Movies of All-Time""; it truly is a spectacle in the art of comedy.<br/><br/>Some Like it Hot contains one of the most simple, yet wonderfully unique premises of all-time. Set during the prohibition Some Like It Hot follows the mishaps of two male musicians who are looking for a job, while being caught up with the mob. Unable to find work they opt in to play for a female band and so have to cross-dress to gain ""discreet"" access to the band. Surprisingly both fit in with the group and quickly befriend Sugar (Marilyn Monroe), a friendship that soon develops into them both falling for her...<br/><br/>The idea of Some Like It Hot is incredibly outlandish and extraordinarily outrageous. The film's complex was a long way ahead of its time and one that was risqué and daring on release due to the supposed ""homosexuality"" portrayed in the film. Today, the film remains one of the triumphant examples of comedy, ultimately being a satire on '20s America portrayed through slyly hysterical humour. The film shows off the talents of Wilder and the array of talent he has cast on the film. The rampant script propels the film at extraordinarily fast pace and uses subtle metaphysical language to portray half-disguised sexual-innuendo. The sexual-innuendo remains one of the film's highlights due to the way it is incorporated into the script through fast wit, raunchiness and ""flashy"" language. To simply imply the script is ""good"" is an understatement; the script's craftsmanship is beyond the realm of genius and is so goofy, screwy and intelligent that it is impossible to deny the brilliance.<br/><br/>Some Like It Hot is a film I can watch anytime, due to the amount of material and level of enjoyment on offer, it is a film bursting with charisma and charm. Actors Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis are two of the finest American actors to ever grace cinema, their partnership created through the fantastic chemistry is inseparable. It is an example of pure character acting at the top of its game. Jack Lemmon (as with most of the films he starred in) steals the show with his wildly energetic, charismatic and ""fitting the role"" performance. Jack Lemmon's persona is so uplifting, consistently succeeding in being the actor's actor. Then you have the hysterical Tony Curtis who brings bold hilarity and fierce energy to the screen, an actor who always feels suitably cast. Marilyn Monroe on the other hand is an actress I have always felt to be untalented at ""acting"", yet skilled at working with spontaneous comedy and probably due to her own infamous personality. Although not a good actress, she is still cast with accuracy and slides into her role as Sugar with ease because of her own similarities to the character. She also adds another element of iconic value to the film.<br/><br/>Although there is nothing much below the surface of Some Like It Hot that does not stop it from being an intellectual illustration of class A comedy. For a film so eccentric it is honestly amazing at how remarkably efficient the film is at succeeding in offering mass-appeal. Some Like It Hot is full of dry sexual tendencies, symbolic sexual imagery (yes, not only hidden in the script, but subtly shown throughout the film) and the indisputable class the film carries. The use of simple set-pieces helps rotate the comedy, offering impulsive comedic actions and a countless array of jokes.<br/><br/>The film's notorious line ""well, nobody's perfect"" goes for the film too. Although not as perfect as Wilder's ""league of their own"" masterpieces (Sunset Blvd., The Apartment, Double Indemnity, Stalag 17) that still does not stop it from being a gem of cinematic joy. Wilder is one of the few directors who truly deserves his legendary directional and screen writing acclaim, it is beyond fact that Wilder had a genuine aptitude for cinema. Some Like It Hot is an example of Wilder's fantastic versatility and his trademark of dealing with warped identities."
"FloatingOpera7","10","1","2","17 May 2006"," Films Of The 50's: Some Like It Hot
","Some Like It Hot (1959): Starring Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon, Marilyn Monroe, Joe E. Brown,, Nehemiah Persoff,Billy Gray, George Stone, Dave Barry, Edward G. Robinson Jr. Director Billy Wilder, Screenplay Billy Wilder.<br/><br/>""So you play that fast music, that jazz ? Well, I guess some like it hot""..........<br/><br/>Billy Wilder directed 3 great films that begin with the letter ""S"", all dating from the 1950's: Sunset Boulevard (1950), Sabrina (1954) and Some Like it Hot (1959). This has long been regarded as the most hilarious comedy movie of the 50's. Filmed in black-and-white like the other Billy Wilder films of this decade, the movie has become an American classic. Marilyn Monroe is not only playing on the sexual icon angle she always uses, but is effectively funny (who knew she could do comedy ?) and is charming in every scene. Still, this film, despite the fact Marilyn Monroe was the draw, belongs to Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon, portraying Joe and Jerry, two friends who get caught in the middle of the St Valentine's Day Massacre of the 1920's, the time this film is set. The mobsters are after them for being witnesses to the event and they must flee and take up new identities. They dress in drag and become Josephine and Daphne, join an all-girl jazz orchestra en route to Southern Florida where they will entertain the wealthy guests of a luxurious hotel. Posing as women is incredibly difficult for them, and their masculine habits (smoking, swearing, drinking, lusting after other women) are hard to break. Their chemistry together (and with Marilyn Monroe's character Sugar) is outstanding and the dialog is so witty, the jokes are genuinely humorous, if old-fashioned. There is a sense of fluidity in every scene. They are drinking alcohol during the ""Prohibition"" at a wild party in the beginning of the film, there's a massacre, they flee, they dress as women to hide from the baddies after them, board the train with the other female musicians, stay at a hotel by the beach, ride on a yacht, etc. Even the guys' transformation from male to female seems oddly natural, and they play the role of women in an over-the-top way. The film, in a haphazard sort of way, helped to promote the historic Hotel Del Coronado in San Diego, California, where much of the movie was filmed, including scenes by the beach side which I find are really beautiful. Look for Edward G. Robinson's son, Ed Jr, in a small cameo role. This film, despite being comedic, also contains a very passionate (for the time) make-out scene between Marilyn and Jack Lemmon, hilariously juxtaposed with a tango dancing scene with Tony Curtis and Joe E. Brown. Marilyn Monroe's sexuality was not the kind of sexuality that say the women in Sex In The City possess. Far from being the overtly assertive girl who gets what she wants, Marilyn seduces men in a casual, almost blind manner. Although she is always depicted as a ""dumb but sexy blonde"" type, or moreover, the innocent sex kitten, she does appear to have a social-climbing agenda, and it's evident in this film. Joe E. Brown as Osgood Fielding III, a wealthy man who owns yachts - and most notably falls for Jack Lemmon's in-drag character Daphne - is originally the man Marilyn Monroe is after. But Tony Curtis' Joe character poses as him and gets Sugar ultimately. The use of mistaken identities in comedy is as old as Shakespeare and still works effectively in movies like this. The ending was abrupt and implied brief homosexuality (didn't anyone get that at the time ?): ""I can't marry you because I'm a man"", says Lemmon to Brown. ""So,"" he replies, ""nobody's perfect""."

"johno-21","9","1","2","10 March 2006"," A Billy Wilder classic
","Billy Wilder made some of my favorite films in Double Indemnity, The Lost Weekend, Sunset Boulevard, Stalag 17, The Seven Year Itch and Some Like It Hot. A great presenter of romantic comedies and of drama as well. It was interesting reading how Frank Sinatra, Danny Kaye, Bob Hope, Jerry Lewis and Anthony Perkins and Mitzy Gaynor had been considered for this movie. Who knows what could have happened with Billy Wilder directing but what he got out of Marilyn Monroe, Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon was classic. I often wondered why this was filmed in black and white instead of color and the IMDb explained it as Wilder didn't like how Curtis' and Lemmon's makeup appeared on screen in color. I can't buy the explanation given that their makeup looked green on screen. That could have easily been corrected. I think color would have brought more attention to their overall appearance as men dressed as women and made them look less plausible and more like men in drag in the enhancement of color so for overall effect he shot it in black and white. It also fits the 1920's themed story. I've never seen this on the big screen but it was a staple on TV in the 60's and 70's and has been since. I've probably seen this at least a dozen times and have alway enjoyed it. It's been a few years since I've seen it last and I wouldn't mind seeing it again soon. A great cast in support with George Raft, Pat O'Brien, Joe E. Brown who is especially good and Nehemiah Persoff. Nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction and Best Actor for Jack Lemmon, it won it's only Oscar for Best Costume Design. It's a quick paced, fun film but for me falls a little short and I would give it a 9.0 on a scale of 10."
"DonFishies","8","1","2","7 February 2006"," A must-see comic classic
","Some Like it Hot is one of the funnier movies I've seen in a bit, and even though it's been ripped off, parodied and homaged in countless films since, it was still a joy to watch. It's surprisingly violent, and definitely threw me off guard with what to expect. It gave me a good laugh at the looking back at the mob years in 1959, and comparing it to the likes of what we have now.<br/><br/>It was great seeing Jack Lemmon grace the screen again, and he rocks the casbah with Tony Curtis. But clearly, Curtis is no Walter Matthau. Monroe though, other than being eye-candy...is totally useless. Seriously, like I know I've never watched a movie of hers before, but she was so totally useless, and didn't deserve being the best credited star. Definitely a weak point of the film.<br/><br/>But the direction, the acting, and the slapstick style of the movie is excellent, and is far better than what we have now. I hadn't seen anything by Billy Wilder either, and now feel the need to continue.<br/><br/>I love the last line though. Just utter perfection, and makes the film live up to its name in gold.<br/><br/>""Well...nobody's perfect."" Just, fantastic. I was giggling for a good 5 minutes after. If you're looking for a bit of a light laugh, and some screwball antics (laced with sexual innuendos that soared right over the 1950s crowd), here's something for you.<br/><br/>8.5/10."

"eyeluvhotboyz","10","1","2","16 April 2004"," Marilyn Monroe, jazz, and the mob... you can't go wrong with that!
","Some Like it Hot is a fantastic movie, for the older crowd.  With great actors and actresses, a great plot, the mob, and a little bit of jazz, they couldn't go wrong. Some Like it Hot stars the sex icon Marilyn Monroe as Sugar.  Sugar is a musician in an all-girls band that always falls for male saxophone players. Over the course of the movie, she goes from being strong to completely vulnerable, then to completely crazy at times.  They could not have picked a better actress to play this role.  It seems like it was purposely written for her.<br/><br/>This movie also stars Jack Lemmon, as Daphne (otherwise known as Jerry), and Tony Curtis as Josephine (otherwise known as Joe).  These two actors did a fantastic job.  They play two male musicians that witness a mob hit.  They then decide they need to leave town.  They need to disguise themselves, though, so they dress up as girls, and join an all-girl band.<br/><br/> After the band, including Daphne, Josephine, and Sugar, arrive in Florida, the plot heats up.  Josephine (Joe) ends up falling for Sugar, who thinks he's a girl, and Daphne gets hit on but a millionaire that thinks he's a girl.  Meanwhile, the mob is still looking for the Joe and Jerry to kill them. <br/><br/>This movie will have the viewer on the edge of their seat wondering what will happen next.  It will also have them cracking up laughing.  This reviewer would give this movie a 10, but not recommend it for small children.  There are many adult themes that would not be appropriate."

","Some like it HOT!!! What else is there to say? 		<br/><br/>	When presented with the opportunity to watch this film, honestly, I was very excited. This movie stars Marilyn Monroe, whom I absolutely adore! This has by far become one of my favorite movies of all time!<br/><br/>	The plot of this movie was about two men who are trying to flee from a `mafia' that is after them. They want to escape the state, but are not really having any success. Well, one of the two men has a brilliant idea to audition for an all girls band (the two men are talented musicians). Seeing as how they are men, and would never even be considered for this band, the only way for them to audition is to dress up, and play the role of a woman. Any situation that involves men trying to portray woman is just hysterical, but watching men who are trying to be women, yet thinking the other woman are totally sexy, is even funnier!!! 	The two men, or dare I saywoman, are accepted into the choir, and are recognized for their musical abilities. Well just as expected, the two men just drool over the beautiful Marilyn Monroe, who plays a gorgeous singer names Sugar. Sugar thinks that these two ladies are just so lovely and kind. However, one of the men seems to like her more than the other, or at least just expresses it more. One of the scenes that was just so funny was where all of the ladies are on the train on their way to Florida. In the middle of the night Sugar sneaks over to one of the men's beds and asks to lie down with him (or her). The man becomes very very excited (and when I say excited I think you know what I mean) yet still trying to disguise himself as a woman. He tells Sugar that he will get some brandy (which sugar is very fond of alcohol) and they will have a little party. He goes on to tell her that maybe the night will bring a few surprises. Eventually all of the woman hear that there is a party in `number 7' and they all pile onto the bed with Sugar and them man, and start drinking. The woman all start tickling him, he gets scared that they will see up his nightgown and realize that he's not really a woman, so he decides to pull the emergency brake on the train, causing all of the other girls to fall onto the floor on top of each other. 	This movie was just the most perfect comedy. The acting is phenomenal as well as entertaining, and the ending brings quit a surprise to the viewer. I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone. It was just absolutely hysterical, and enjoyable to view."

Josephine (Curtis) falls for Sugar (Monroe) whilst rich millionaire Osgood (Joe E Brown) falls for Daphne (Lemmon).

","Billy Wilder's ""Some Like It Hot"" opens in 1929 Chicago and follows the desperation of musicians Joe ""Josephine"" (Tony Curtis) and Jerry ""Daphne"" (Jack Lemmon) to get out of town after witnessing the St. Valentine's Day massacre.  The solution?  Board a train to Miami posing as girls with an all-female band!  Everything about Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond's script is hilariously pitch-perfect, including the train sequence, the meeting of Daphne and Osgood Fielding (Joe E. Brown, whose closing line is a gem), and the yacht sequence with Joe and the sweetly dim-witted Sugar Kane (the incomparable Marilyn Monroe, who gives one of her best comic performances). Side-splitting support from George Raft, Pat O'Brien and Joan Shawlee add to the fun.  Oscar winner for Best B&W Costume design (Orry-Kelly).  A definite must-see comedy classic! ****"

","In drag or drab, Lemmon & Curtis are marvelous together.  Monroe's chemistry was terrific and natural for both of them, and Joan Shawlee never missed a chance to strut her stuff as Sorority Sue.  The gags are riotous, the dialogue rich with jokes and film in-jokes, some subtle, some not-so-subtle. Joe E. Brown, mugging unabashedly, steals every scene he is.  His tango with Lemmon is priceless.  Georgie Raft does such an accurate deadpan spoof of himself that you're not quite sure whether he gets the jokes.  He did. Nehemiah Persoff excels as Li'l Bonaparte.  Another thing here is that the singing, enjoyable and untaxing, never gets in the way of the plot, and the pacing is frenetic throughout.  the guys-in-drag bit had not been done before in a manner of such heartfelt empathy as Jack Lemmon gives it --<br/><br/>Treat yourself to this one; it deserves its reputation as one of the top comedy classics of all time."

Curtis, Lemon, and especially Marilyn Monroe, are all great here, but the comedy sense is a bit too screwball to work well for the entire 120 minutes.

","I was surprised to read comments that didn't like this movie.<br/><br/>   I personally loved it.  The acting, which several have disliked, is great. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are each dead on in their roles, and Lemmon should have won the Oscar.  Marilyn Monroe gives a comically sexy performance.<br/><br/>  Billy Wilder has shown his versatility, making a mark in film noir, serious drama, satire, comedy (of every sort), romance, and war.  This movie is one of his best.  The script is absolutely hilarious, with some of the best lines on film. <br/><br/>  This film has one of the greatest final lines in film, rivaled only by Casablanca and Sunset Blvd."

","AS I am not Historical Film Critic,like those with qualifications,it is hoped that following comments may be of some use.Nowhere in IMDb's<br/><br/>site about Some Like It Hot is it mentioned that the film goes back to Fanfaren der Liebe(1951) which goes back to Fanfaren d'amour (1935).True,it does mention that writing credits go to Michael Logan,about whom,in user comments at his site,Some Like it Hot is mentioned referring the reader to Fanferen der Liebe and back to Fanfaren d'amour. However,all the CREDIT for Some Like It Hot seems to go to Billy Wilder,whose remake/adaptation is quite remarkable.What is my point?: I'd better study the History of Films and learn how to write user comments , e.g.when to submit them to IMDb and how to express that Marylin Monroe's wiggling walk is quote ,from the film,"" Like Jell-0 on Springs""unquote.It is no wonder that I am indeed captivated by her, like many others, such as the Kennedys;may they and she Rest In Peace."

","When I first heard Tony Curtis doing the Cary Grant send up I thought to myself, no, that can't be, I must be hearing things. Fortunately, Jack Lemmon dubiously assures the viewer otherwise when he states that 'nobody talks like that'.<br/><br/>That's just one of the many gems to be found in ""Some Like It Hot"", the Billy Wilder screwball comedy set in 1929 Chicago, with an opening scene that takes out a liquor filled coffin by mob chasing cops. Spats Colombo's (George Raft) gang members resemble Dick Tracy caricatures, notably led by Mike Mazurki, who I can't think of as anyone other than 'Iron' Mike from his pro boxing and wrestling days. He and fellow Spats henchman (Harry Wilson) have a great natural gangster look that make up artists spend hours trying to achieve today.<br/><br/>Of course the film stars Marilyn Monroe doing Marilyn, the 'boop-boop-be-do' accent of her song number had me envisioning Jack Kennedy at his birthday party. Though undeniably gorgeous in her first appearance on screen at the train station, I was left rather intrigued with the era's vision of female beauty considering today's preoccupation with borderline anorexics. In the scene with Tony Curtis attempting to cure his aversion to women, Monroe actually looks quite plump in the middle and on her upper arms. And was it the lighting or the cut of her dress, but there were times when her appearance seemed almost lurid. One thing's for certain though. Another reviewer in this forum compared Monroe to the 1950's version of Pamela Anderson. Sorry, but it was Marilyn who broke the mold for all others to follow.<br/><br/>For my money, the best performance of the film goes to Jack Lemmon. While Lemmon and Curtis held their own for most of the film, Jack's Daphne character was inspired following the engagement to Osgood Fielding (Joe E. Brown). He genuinely had me going 'huh?' as to his actual intentions of marrying Osgood, and those maracas clinched it - that was a hilarious piece of work.<br/><br/>It was fun seeing Brown again, I remember watching him as a kid in the 1950's. The one title I can recall is ""Sons o' Guns"", and even though I can't remember that story, I can always picture Brown's cavernous mouth enunciating some unknown grimace. He uses the trademark here as well, maybe a couple times too many, but he still gets his share of chuckles.<br/><br/>As far as the movie's reputation, I won't deny it's place among the greats of film history, though I find myself somewhat divided in my own feelings. Certainly it has it's moments, but at the same time it has something of a dated quality where the laughs are laid out in front of you, almost to the point of slapstick. I'd rather have it come across in the dialog rather than the buffoonery, sight and sound gags rather than hysterics. For a film that relies a bit more on the latter, it still works in the hands of an accomplished director and a talented cast."

","Some films are terrifically overrated, even if they are solid, enjoyable little films. Perhaps the most glaring example of this dictum is Billy Wilder's 1959 black and white comedy Some Like It Hot. It often appears on Best Of lists as the top comedy of all time, but, while a good, solid film, it is nowhere near a great film, in screen writing, technical measures, nor in, well, laughs per minute. Let's tackle those three things in reverse. Perhaps the funniest film ever made, in terms of laughs per minute is Stanley Kramer's 1963 all star comedy, It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. It's a pants-pisser that unleashes 2-3 guffaws per minute. The scene where Jonathan Winters destroys the gas station is priceless. By contrast, Some Like It Hot hasn't a single guffaw in the whole film- a number of moments that make you smile and tee-hee, but guffaw? No. Part of this is because the film has not aged well- it's hard to still laugh at drag jokes nowadays. Also, the film is not even a parody nor satire, like Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove Or: How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Bomb. Then there's Wilder's own significant cache of comedies, the best of which I'd argue is his VASTLY underrated 1966 black and white comedy, The Fortune Cookie, which is far superior to Some Like It Hot, for many reasons, but primarily because, while the films shared Jack Lemmon, The Fortune Cookie had Walter Matthau and no Marilyn Monroe, while Some Like It Hot was burdened with Monroe, and lacked the comically impeccable Matthau. More on the Monroe debacle in a bit."

","It is quite an eye-opener for me to acquire that such a contentious sex-metamorphosis paranoia film could be made more than 50 years ago for the mainstream audience by the renowned Hollywood tycoon Billy Wilder, also sad to say, half century has elapsed, the evolution of mankind seems to be stuck in a halted mode. <br/><br/>Certainly the film must be a comedy, which Billy Wilder is the virtuoso, the story is designed with scrupulosity, the set of the two pairs exudes some wonderful chemistry, for instance, which is vividly showcased by the parallel scenes of furthering their relationships respectively in the middle of the film. <br/><br/>All the gags work swiftly and suitably at their occasions, the villain side was weakened to the lowest amount lest it would intrigue the audience a way too violent imagination, the ""spat"" stunt alone is capable of making the aftershock of the blood splattering all on the screen wane. <br/><br/>The truly hero of the cast is Jack Lemmon without any doubt as Tony Curtis' role falls flat and Marilyn Monroe was definitely not at her best moment (even arguably her worst), Jack single- handedly distinguishes himself with his quirky accent and exquisite lady-gestures, I could never imagine he was able to act as a woman with such an extended plausibility!<br/><br/>I haven't watched too many Marilyn Monroe's films, still, her pitiable role as a typical halfwitted blonde in the film interconnects her real life status, which could only leave me some earnest sorrow and compassion to her, and then it spontaneously coordinates flawlessly with the pitch of her role in the film, eventually it renders me an even stronger appreciation toward the film itself, which I bet Billy Wilder would never expected! <br/><br/>One little complaint is the ending seems too hasty although leaving us the popular wisecrack WELL, NOBODY IS PERFECT. I wonder how come there has been no sequel or remake of this masterpiece, which will serve as a timely final straw to this era, where the comedy sector has never been so barren and vapid as now."

"Quinoa1984","10","1","3","22 May 2010"," a perfect example of a light-dark comedy standing the test of time
","Billy Wilder's Some Like it Hot is about what makes men different than women. It's funny, uproarious, because men who are big womanizers (they're musicians in 1929 prohibition-era Chicago after all) have to go in disguise as women so they aren't recognized as the men they are by mobsters who want to rub them out for several hits they witnessed. I loved seeing how the actors worked off of one another, especially because they had such wonderful dialog to work with. That is one part of it, and how steady the story actually is (it really never falters from being a classically told story for all of its wackiness that ensues), but it's just the repore of the stars, the power they exude on screen (that is, that Marilyn Monroe exudes) and how funny they are in playing it both serious and fun in a single beat.<br/><br/>Now that that premise is out of the way, what else is funny about it? Where to start? For one thing just how Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis have their reactions to how they look or who they are as 'women' (""I'm more of a Daphnme"", Lemmon's Jerry says), and how they both react in varied ways to Marilyn Monroe's Sugar. Her character admits that she's stupid, but is she really? She's playing this ""girl' in other movies before, and yet it's a little varied this time around; she'd love to find a rich man on a yacht, sure, but she'd also just like to find a man who would treat her right. It's here that the fun, and some hidden depth and incredible sexual innuendo, comes out of the relationship between 'Cary Grant' Joe (a great-bad imitation) and Sugar, especially the scene between the two on the Yacht and their meeting on the beach... which is almost all of their scenes. They're quite brilliant.<br/><br/>Jack Lemmon also scores very highly here with his performance as Jerry/Daphne. Any moment he has to react to Osgood is so funny because of how he reacts and how Joe E. Brown so consistently reacts to Daphne's expressions. It's surely one of the classic moments in movies at the end, but I perhaps loved even more just seeing how the two actors were in the tango scene (and Lemmon's reaction to that to Tony Curtis, the ""We're engaged!"" bit is one of the funniest scenes of its time, or any time). We get to see by Wilder's script and direction how men and women (or men as women or men as men) portray each other or react when trying to court. It's a sex farce that was somehow acceptable (I'm surprised some of the innuendo and dress got by with the censors at the time), but also has stayed fresh, maybe fresher, because of how precise it is in its observations on sex and relationships. It sort of goes between the very dark comedy of love in Sunset Blvd. with the lighthearted Hollywood stuff of Sabrina.<br/><br/>The former may still be Wilder's best film, but Some Like it Hot finds him working at the peak of his powers with comic timing and sharp dialog for able and ready performers. Was Monroe ever funnier? Perhaps sexier in Seven Year Itch, or a technically better or deeper actress in Don't Bother to Knock. But she's on par with her male co-leads in delivering the goods as someone who gets how to do this comedy. It's rare for lightning to strike like this in comedy in general- The Producers, Duck Soup and His Girl Friday had it- and this is another example."

","Don't get me wrong; this is a very funny film. The situations these characters find and put themselves in are simply ridiculous and outrageous, making ""Some Like it Hot,"" a very enjoyable movie. Jack Lemmon is perfectly cast as usual, and delivers one great line after another as in just about every film he's in. Marilyn Monroe is brilliant here and proves to be a much greater actress than I would have thought. Tony Curtis also does very well in his role, and is very funny in claiming to be the owner of the Shell gas stations. My only problem with this film is the general job of acting done in this film. Somehow a lot of the movie just didn't come off as very realistic to me. In another film involving men disguising themselves as women (""Tootsie""), everything that happens seems believable and real. Here the acting by most of the supporting cast does not seem real to me. I personally find a film funnier if I can imagine all of the events really happening. Nevertheless, I guess it's just a comedy and shouldn't be critiqued too hard. There are plenty of laughs in this movie and I enjoyed it very much. I don't agree with the AFI's decision to name it the #1 comedy of all time, but it's not too far off. Not perfect, but you'll laugh at so many things here it really won't matter.<br/><br/>***1/2 out of ****"

","Only at the threat of facing the firing squad do Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis don women's wardrobes in hopes of escaping murdering mobsters. So begins the picture, which in 1999, topped the American Film Institute's best comedy of all time list, Some Like It Hot (their inclination for laughter seems curious as Tootsie was listed second). The duo dressed-in-drag join an all-female band headed to Florida to entertain the wealth. In transit they meet the bodacious Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe), a real woman, with whom they befriend, secreting alcohol and sharing tales of past loves gone wrong. Chaos soon ensues as the cross-dressing escapees try to stay below the radar of the suspicious band-leader, are courted by women-hungry millionaires, and fall head-over-heels in love with Sugar Kane.<br/><br/>Jack and Tony keep the outrageous action moving non-stop. Marilyn hypnotizes all in sight. Despite these, much of the film's comedic value impinged on the societal tension of the era. In 1959, this film challenged the mores of erotic decency, however, nearly half a century later, little is left of its lusty Eros now awash in contemporary hyper-sexual society. What remains is a classy comedy interwoven with magic, myth, and mystery. As the film's original audience enters their golden years Some Like It Hot will be remembered for its glorious and care-free style."
"jonathan-577","9","1","3","11 October 2007"," brilliantly orchestrated chaos
","The most astonishing thing about this movie is that it works at all. I love Billy Wilder but The Seven Year Itch drove me right up the fricking wall with its testocentric mugging, and why should this movie have been any different when it pulls the same trick? Well first off, the context has opened waaay up: it appropriates the St. Valentine's Day Massacre as its inciting incident, it sweeps from Chicago winter to Florida sunshine. And this time, the filmmakers figure out how to construct an interesting critique of masculinity through the medium of Marilyn. Give us TWO male protagonists, joined at the hip; give us some gangsters to put their hormonal aspirations into some critical context; and by the time you've thrown in Joe E. Brown's lovable goofball playboy, the layering is so intense that it almost begins to resemble depth, and the construction so disorienting that it constantly feeds the comic requirement of surprise. That Tony Curtis's impersonation of a British millionaire sounds more like John Clarke only adds to the fun. And while Marilyn is still Marilyn, she's also looking a little rough around the edges here and there - her on-set nervous breakdown seems to have been incorporated rather than papered over. Brilliantly orchestrated chaos, suggesting that Wilder is only really Wilder when he's also A. I. L. Diamond."

","It was hard to believe all that Some Like It Hot' got away with in the 1950's. Sexual innuendos, cross-dressing, barely their `clothes' and more definitely made it an eyebrow-raising movie.  It was risqué, but it's what made it such a funny movie.  Marilyn Monroe did as excellent job at playing a dumb blonde (If she was really acting at all) and Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon did a superb job playing two cross-dressers trying to win a pretty girl's heart.  Marilyn Monroe played a sweet, innocent girly-girl in an all-female band who every guy wanted, especially Joe and Jerry (Curtis and Lemmon).  The two struggling musicians meet Sugar (Monroe) after they witness the St. Valentines Day Massacre and need to flee from the mob that is out to kill them.  The only way to escape from being killed is to cross-dress and join the all-female band.  The idea isn't too bad when they find out that Sugar is apart of the band.  The girls in the band seem fresh out of seventh grade: boy-crazy and naïve, though it didn't seem to bother Joe and Jerry whose alias' while being cross-dressers where Josephine and Daphne.  Even though the two guys were trying to win over Sugar while somehow remaining cross-dressers, it seemed to me that they were having a little more fun playing dress up than other guys would.  I think they became too comfortable as women and it was kind of creepy, but also very humorous.  While Jerry was having more success getting closer to Sugar and becoming more of her confidante, Joe was having more success in unintentionally wooing a rich yacht owner named Osgood Fielding III (Joe E. Brown).  This twisted comedy made me laugh the whole way through.  The mishaps and misfortunes of the characters were very inventive.  I thought that the ending was very witty and although I could see the direction that it was headed, I didn't think any other ending would have been as funny. Although, it didn't take incredibly talented actors to pull off a comedy such as Some Like It Hot', it is still a movie that I would watch again and again."

","What is rare and special about this movie is that it is still very funny and stylish to look at. What it also provides us with is a comedy chemistry on film between Curtis and Lemmon which probably can only be rivalled by Lemmon and Matthau( the old black and white partnerships have badly dated in style and content). The story is slow to get going but once it starts there is no flagging as the two stars belt out oneliners with a coolness and sharpness which done today would look tiresome and tacky. There are just so many memorable lines like ""nobody's perfect"", ""Shell Oil"" and ""absolutely nothing"" which taken in context of the film and depending on your mood can really make you laugh. In terms of Marilyn's performance though, the film is oddly moving in a strange sort of way. She cuts a charming, beautiful figure due to her looks, vulnerability and naivety. She just wants someone un- complicated and descent to love and marry her but can not find this as her beauty and sultriness  makes her too intimidating for these men."

I figured it had to be overrated--I mean, two guys in drag, once you've done the standard jokes, what else is there?--but it's a wonderful movie, well worth its reputation. The early Chicago scenes are fairly ordinary (and in fact the gangster bits never really catch fire), but once the boys get into their outfits the film never lets up. Tony Curtis got a lot of ridicule early in his career, but he was a very good comic actor, and his Cary Grant fake millionaire is simply hilarious. Marilyn Monroe is luminous as always, and perfectly cast as the archetypal sweet dumb amorous blonde. Jack Lemmon's acting has always been a bit too mannered for my taste, but once he cuts loose in the second half he's great.

	Some like it hot is by far one of the most twistedly funny movies of all time. Though it is not apparent, a person has to be sharp in order to catch it.

With the mobsters chasing those two transvestites. And the one guy chasing Monroe's character. And the other guy being chased by the millionaire who thinks he is a woman.<br/><br/>	This movie sucked. It was utterly ridiculous. What is the likelihood of a group of women not being able to tell the difference between another woman and two men dressed in women's clothing? This reviewer has seen a few transvestites and it does not take much to be able to look at someone and say whether are not that is a woman or a well dressed man in women's clothing'. That is to say he looks more like a woman than a man does, but is still unmistakably a man, especially in the scene where they go swimming. Now how does that work?

She cannot resist tenor sax players and never stops and always gets hurt.Her character is not one of the best,her weakness' are men, and alcohol. She is very naive, but plays the part well of a sexy jazz singer of the times. Her voice and good looks are a natural attraction to Joe.

The fact that they must dress up as women, and the billionaire who does not care that Daphne is really Jerry is hillarious. The extreme to which Joe tries to win Sugar over is amazing, to plunging in a bath tub with all their clothes on, and dressing up as a yacht owner to a yacht he doesn't even own. This is then topped by Jerry and Joe running from the mob dressed in girls clothing and heels. A funny movie for all to watch. Overall I would give this movie a 7 out of 10 for humour."

","Some like it hot written and directed in the 50's is a very sexually orientated movie. One from this time period generally thinks of the 50's as a very clean a pure time area with the classic nuclear family as it's backbone but this movie portrays a much different image and with Marilyn Monroe as the staring actress succeeds. This movie does something most people never thought of when they thought of the 50's these things include cross dressing and gay relationships. This movie is a mixture of a comedy and a love story. Shot in black and white this movie at first glance to be a classic film but as the viewer watches they relies that it most certainly is not your classic 50's film. The plot of this movie is very see through and has nothing really to it but the viewer can't help but appreciate it for the way it affected society and T.V today."
"spasticsnake","8","2","15","23 July 2008"," Some Like It ""What"" ?
","Ever since I first viewed this film in 1983, I found this this film funny but not as riotous as others found it to be. Now, 25 years later, I still find this film overrated. For years, I've been trying to figure out why. Now I'm attempting to articulate my feelings for this comedy, for it's another ""classic"" film which needs its merits re-examined. This film has a terrific comic premise, but it didn't need to be dragged out for two hours. Any film with a farcical tone risks losing sustaining power with a long running time. One other film which died under its own weight was the three-hour-plus ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"", whose success ultimately rested on its cast, a mixture of serious actors(Spencer Tracy, for one), good(Sid Caesar, Jonathan Winters, etc.)and mediocre comic actors(Ethel Merman anybody?). Then again, director Stanley Kramer isn't famous for his comic gifts. Now for the cast of ""Some Like It Hot"". No blame will be heaped upon Tony Curtis & Jack Lemmon, whose performances in & out of drag justifies the positive reputation of this film; in fact, this film screeches to halt whenever either of them is off-screen. As for Marilyn Monroe, I enjoyed her singing; otherwise, I found her miscast in this film. The role of Sugar Kane needed someone with an unquestionably stronger sense of self than Monroe was capable of projecting here. Her frequently reported unprofessional behavior off-screen is all too evident here within this film; sadly, it would be the beginning of the end for her career and her life. Nevertheless, her name meant big box office for the film, and it is forever preserved on this film; however, there is no accounting for taste in what the public finds sexy, then or now. As for the rest of the cast, the only other actors who showed comic timing were Joan Shawlee as Sweet Sue and Joe E. Brown as Lemmon's romantic partner Osgood Fielding. Too bad the same couldn't be said for either George Raft or Pat O'Brien. I'm sure neither of them were hired for being funny, yet it's too bad director Billy Wilder didn't allow either of them to deliver his dialog with a little tongue-in-cheek. But Raft & O'Brien stop the film in its tracks, and that is symptomatic of a film farce lacking in any sense of pacing. Any good film farce needs to move, but this one stagnates and lumbers about."

Of course, they have to disguise themselves as women, which leads to complications when the meet Sugar Cane(played by Marilyn Monroe) the knockout beauty of the band.

","Some like it hot is one of the best movies of the late 50's. It had the perfect cast, the perfect script and the perfect director. One of the most important things was that it had the perfect trio - Marilyn Monroe, one of the most famous sex symbols of the 20th century. Tony Curtis , a huge star and Jack Lemmon, a brilliant comedian. What could go wrong? One of the things I have noticed about the film is that Marilyn Monroe looks exhausted in most of her scenes and even in some just does not look attractive at all. I appreciate that she was pregnant to a baby she would a few weeks after shooting have a miscarrage to and that she was at the time suffering with her mental health. Also I always think of the story line as sort of a gansta film cros with a musical they just don't go. However, enough bad points on the film. The film is very good and deservs at least a 10 out of 10! I do think that the film should be brought out on DVD in technicolour the lighten up the classic film and bring it out of it's orrigional black and white format!"

","My wife loves this movie, mostly on the strength of Jack Lemmon's wild performance, but I have to admit that I've remained resistant to its charms. I don't DISLIKE it, but I always have trouble understanding how it pops up again and again on various lists as one of the funniest comedies ever produced.<br/><br/>Of course, much of my lack of appreciation probably has to do with the fact that cross dressing comedies have become a dime a dozen now, but were virtually unheard of at the time this film was released. And even more notable, Jack Lemmon's character actually kind of LIKES pretending to be a woman, so this film manages to work in some fairly ahead of its time gender politics into its mostly escapist comedy trappings. But the film is hampered by too much Marilyn Monroe, who was just a terrible actress, like it or not. The woman could not act, and no amount of sex appeal (though I think she had very little of that as well) could change that fact.<br/><br/>Still, my reservations aside, the strengths in this film mostly outweigh the weaknesses. Billy Wilder delivers a sharp script even if his direction seems to be at cross purposes with the movie's comedic elements, and Tony Curtis gives a hilarious and dead-on impersonation of Cary Grant that rivals Lemmon's manic antics in its pricelessness.<br/><br/>Grade: B+"

","Some Like It Hotthe perfect title to fit this movie, if anyone is shocked by Britney Spears then they'll be just as shocked by Marilyn Monroe, the only thing is this movie is set many years ago when swimsuits were more like body suits.  Growing up with the `Britney Icon', nothing could seemed to have shocked this reviewer, but Marilyn's even dresses and lingerie were making this reviewer cringe and very uncomfortable.  Despite Marilyn's ensemble, this is a well written story with fun little twists and turns. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon steal the show even though the famous Marilyn Monroe is also part of the cast.<br/><br/>Marilyn Monroe is remembered as this super sexy woman with class and innocence, after watching the movie the phrase `dumb blonde' comes to mind. This woman is all about sex appeal and her acting skills aren't exactly all that impressive.  Not to mention her blondeness comes from a bottle of peroxide, she comes across as cheap and easy, not the innocent girl who just keeps falling for the wrong guy.   <br/><br/>Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon, however, are true class acts.  They pull off a good fake out and truly could be confused as women ugly and oversized, but women none-the-less.  They make a great duo and could easily be seen as best friends outside of the set, their chemistry is great and their acting even better.<br/><br/>The storyline is a fun one, two traveling musicians following their dream and living from paycheck to paycheck, not willing to give up their hopes but really hitting rock bottom.  Then, wham!  They witness a crime, mafia related of course, and need to escape for their lives.  The only opportunity provided for an escape is being part of an all female band heading for Florida, these 2 Chicago boys have to then become cross-dressers to take up the opportunity.  This is then when they meet Sugar (Marilyn Monroe) and the rest is history.  There are a few interesting close calls and a funny ending to make this movie a worthwhile viewing.<br/><br/>All-in-all this is a movie that deserves to be seen by anyone interested in a light-hearted comedy, even though Marilyn is a bit racy and, well, annoying. Some Like It Hot is a must see and comes high recommended from this reviewer.  Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis bring this movie full circle and make an interesting pair, as men or women."

","A recent poll in saw this come out as the best comedy of all time.<br/><br/>Beating the likes of Odd Couple and Airplane!, Some Like It Hot is revered by so many, and while I can see the charm of it and concede that the performances are really excellent, the film *really* isn't that funny.<br/><br/>It stars Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon as 2 witnesses to a mob shooting. They're a saxophonist and a bass player respectively who're part of a band, but the mob are after them after escaping from the hit, and the only way they can hide is to dress up as women and join a female band. Enter the amazing Marilyn Munroe as a band member (Sugar Cane) they befriend - it just so happens they're both crazy about her yet cannot give up the facade of their disguises. <br/><br/>This provides much fuel for the contrivance of some very funny moments as Curtis' 'Josephine' sets about wooing her (By putting on an impression of a millionaire) while Lemmon's 'Daphne' gets the short end of the deal every time.<br/><br/>To say the least, the performances are truly top drawer, *particularly* Munroe's Cane, who even in the 21st century utterly exudes sex appeal. This was surely her finest role.<br/><br/>The boys do a great turn too and the chemistry is spot on from one adventure to the next.<br/><br/>The problem is the situations are in places funny, but it's never *truly* the funniest thing you'll ever see. The script in the Odd Couple (For me the greatest comedy ever) is head and shoulders above this, and that's what sets it apart. Sure, there are some very witty and intelligent lines here too, but somehow they're greater in number in the Odd Couple. I single the Odd Couple out as it was also focused on a cracking comedic partnership and also starred Lemmon. It also benefitted from greater comic timing.<br/><br/>This is certainly a classy comedy which is well acted and thoroughly enjoyable, but it suffers from a little bit of overhyping."

","Some Like It Hot? How about some like it perverted! This is surprisingly a very sexual driven movie, especially for the era. The movie is very sneaky with the dirty jokes. Some Like It Hot is about two men ( Joe and Jerry) on the run from the mob. They end up in disguise in none other than women's clothes to escape from the mob. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon did great playing females! A little too well. They were a great comedic duo and made the film funny. Who didn't need to be in the film is Marilyn Monroe who played Sugar the girl that Joe and Jerry of course fall for. The Sugar character is funny, but the casting director could have most likely found someone better than Marilyn Monroe. The only reason they should have Marilyn in the film is because of the music. She did do well singing the cute yet sultry songs that were in the movie.  It's hard to believe Marilyn Monroe was such an icon in that decade and still is today. Yes, she is pretty, but her acting skills were not great in this movie. It seemed like she was forcing the lines and facial expressions out. The plot is predictable now, but most likely in the 50's it wasn't predictable since it was very risky. It is not the funniest film ever but funny enough to at least see once. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon's comedic talents were the highlight of the movie, but unfortunately Marilyn's bad acting skills somewhat ruined the film. This movie is a 7/10."

","I never had high expectations for this movie. I want to believe a movie above a certain age can hold up but I guess I was a bit sour grapes about it because people kept heaping praise on it.<br/><br/>There's an intelligence required to write goofy comedy and although a lot of this could be considered low brow, the impeccable sense of timing and efficiency in which the jokes are served and delivered is nothing short of admirable. A real comedy, not a veiled dramedy which is what Judd Apatow does. We get a cool plot that keeps as viewing and its snapshot of gender relations makes the whole thing seem enduringly relevant (but it was never meant to be a movie with a message; that's what's so awesome).<br/><br/>The acting talent is amazing. Only Monroe maybe sort of falls short (yeah, I know). I get the impression she is a maestro at being the kind of character she's playing in real life; that sort of animated mannequin that men (including me admittedly) want to date so a lot of the time she is so on the money. But when it's time for her to do one of the more comedy orientated monologues the delivery seems to fall a bit flat. I think it might seem this way thanks to being surrounded by tons of better actors but she is certainly not bad and the script shines through.<br/><br/>Frequently kind of eye-rollingly lame (like when they desperately use music to convey that Monroe is somehow more attractive than the other women present) but that does not change the majesty with which so much comedy, both physical and verbal, is flawlessly choreographed and realized (the train carriage scene springs to mind)."

","Directed by Billy Wilder and starring Marilyn Monroe, Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon, this comedy follows two musicians (Curtis and Lemmon) during the Prohibition Era. The two friends have to flee for their lives after they attract the attention of gangsters in the worst way possible. The solution? Pull on a dress and join an all-female band headed for Florida. What else? Things start to derail when they lay eyes on Sugar (Monroe) and become instantly smitten.<br/><br/>Some Like It Hot has topped more than one list as the best comedy ever made. And yes, there is some truth to that. It is a very good comedy. Especially given its age.<br/><br/>It has been said that the pinnacle of humour is a dude in drag. And here we have two. The film was made near the end of the so called Hays Code era. This list of rules set very strict rules for what could be shown on screen and what kind of stories could be told, but towards its end these rules were not as ardently enforced. Still, I can imagine that this film was something of a game changer. Men in drag, Monroe's many many curves flashing all around, and plenty of jokes about flirting, fooling women, homosexuality and about how insulted the two main characters are when they're objectified while posing as women.<br/><br/>The film is sixty years old now, and while it was very progressive when it came out, it suffers from the gender stereotypes of its day. I don't believe you would see a modern film where Monroe's character was lead around quite so blatantly. Or at the very least it wouldn't be shown as something quite as acceptable.<br/><br/>Well okay, they definitely could make a film with such a plot nowadays, but it wouldn't be seen as one of the greatest films ever made. It would have to fight to reach a B-movie status.<br/><br/>And that's the great divide of this film. If you believe that films (or any art, really) shouldn't be given a pass for giving offense because of its age, then this is not a movie for you. It has a wide misogynistic streak. But, if you're willing to accept that it was made in the middle of the last century and that despite its best intentions, it does show some bias when it comes to gender roles, then I'd say that it is a very well written, acted and directed movie that will definitely stay with you."

","It's a new year so why not ring it in with an old movie? Criterion, a company that specializes in both foreign and classic films, has just released their edition of what is considered one of the funniest movies ever made. Thank goodness that the film lives up to that title. The movie was a box office smash, helped propel the career of Jack Lemmon, solidified that of Tony Curtis and ranks among the best known films of Marilyn Monroe. The movie is the 1959 film SOME LIKE IT HOT.<br/><br/>If for some reason you've never seen the film it tells the story of two musicians, saxophone playing Joe (Curtis) and stand-up bass player Jerry (Lemmon) working in prohibition Chicago in February, 1929. Looking for work they go to borrow a friend's car only to witness a group of mobsters gunned down by another gang led by ""Spats"" Colombo (George Raft). Escaping with their lives and looking for a way out of town they take the only job possible.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for them that means performing in an all-girl band. To do so the pair dress up in drag and change their names to Josephine and Daphne. Both of them are immediately drawn to the singer in the band, Sugar Kane Kowalczyk (Monroe). But impersonating women leaves them no way of acting on their impulses.<br/><br/>The band is on the way to Florida to perform there at a resort getting the boys far from Chicago. Sugar has her mind made up and shares her hopes with Josephine/Joe. She wants to steer clear of sex players she's fallen for in the past and find a rich young man who wears glasses and reads The Wall Street Journal. Josephine tells her she should have no problem.<br/><br/>The band arrives at the resort and Daphne/Jerry catches the eye of a millionaire named Osgood Fielding III (Joe E. Brown). She/he tells him to buzz off but he doesn't take no for an answer. He continues to pursue her...er...him...er...her like a dog attracted to a bone. While this is going on, Joe ends up dawning a pair of glasses and a yachtsman's outfit with newspaper in hand as he hits the beach and gets Sugar's attention. Okay you can see where this is going, right?<br/><br/>The film was filled with sexual innuendo and snappy dialogue that adds to the physical comedy on display. So much so that the film was produced without the approval of the Motion Picture Production Code. While it seems tame today it still garner's a snicker or two from younger viewers. When released in 1959 it was a huge hit and is considered one of the films that helped end the Hays Code that was the basis for censorship in films.<br/><br/>But does the movie hold up today? Absolutely. All due to that unique combination of items that rarely come together to create comedy genius. First was the script as composed by the famed pair of Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond. The two had a stream of hits together and this one was just another and also won critical praise. Then you have the fact that Wilder was directing. Finding a director in Hollywood who made as many famed films as Wilder is nearly impossible. A look at the films he made online is like reading half the list of the top 50 recommended films of all time.<br/><br/>But that's behind the scenes. What about onscreen? Curtis was on a roll at the time having just had hits with SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS and THE DEFIANT ONES. Monroe was still gorgeous but on the outs having just played out her personal life in public issues in her marriage and in need of a good film. Unfortunately only two more films followed this one before her untimely death. And Lemmon's career was just on the cusp having had several fantastic supporting roles. This movie would move him to star status. All of these three worked so well together onscreen that it made the movie work. It has to be seen to understand just how wonderful it is.<br/><br/>I could go on about the special items about the film but Criterion has done one better. They've included extras with this release that make it special and describe it in better detail. They include a making of featurette, Billy Wilder on THE DICK CAVETT SHOW, interviews with Lemmon and Curtis, a radio interview with Monroe, a short on the costumes for the movie and more. Best of all they've restored the movie in 4k from the original 35mm negative for a perfect picture.<br/><br/>Now is your chance to see this classic comedy in the best way possible. It's not one you will want to rent but one to add to your collection to be enjoyed over and over. And for those who've never seen it now is your chance to see why it's rated as highly as it is. I know I'll be watching it again."

","For the most part, I enjoyed this very unusual farce. Casting two men who made themselves up as women in order to escape the wrath of a murderous Chicago gang was a clever plot idea. The incorporation of the historic St. Valentine's Day gangland massacre into the screenplay provides some diversion from the business of trying to continue fooling people into believing that Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are women. Tony and Jack are the principal comedy team. We have 2 other actors: Marilyn Monroe and Joe E. Brown, who are principally strait men for the comedians. The members of 2 gang also serve, to a limited extent, as straight men. <br/><br/>The casting was near perfect. Tony and Jack made a great comedy team, and were made up to look like women about as well as possible. The main problems were their manner of walking and their voices, which should have given them away as men. This is a major weakness of the screen play: perhaps fatal if that bothers you too much. Sadly, much of stage and film humor relies on victims who are unusually nonobservant, clumsy or stupid. This reduces the comedic value. Implausible happenings and connections between scenes are frequent in this film. Again, too many of such reduces the comedic value of the film. However, as in this film, this significant negative can often be compensated for by sufficient truly funny happenings. Also, children are no doubt generally less bothered by implausible happenings, judging by the popularity of animations. <br/><br/>The scene where various members of the female band gradually squeeze into Jack's(as female)train berth because he has some bootleg liquor reminds me of the famous scene in The Marx Brothers' ""A Night at the Opera"", where more and more people have a reason to squeeze into their tiny hotel room, falling and climbing all over each other, until the last one opens the door and half spill out. <br/><br/>In addition to masquerading as a woman, Tony masquerades as a rich sea captain, several times going back and forth between one disguise and the other, primarily for the purpose of seducing Marilyn. Clearly, he is trying to imitate Cary Grant's manner of speaking as the captain, reasonably successfully. This somewhat reminds me of a later film starring Tony: ""The Great Imposter"", where he successfully masquerades as a number of men in their work.<br/><br/>It's clear from a comment by Joe E. Brown that the title means that some people prefer jazz. <br/><br/>As usual, Marilyn plays an innocently slutty gold-digger. And, as with so many of her later films, sounds like she was a basket case much of the time, showing up very late or not at all, forgetting her lines, crying and complaining. The director had to put up with these distractions because the public still loved her."

","Lubitsch, at around the time this film is set, would do something like this with a frothy Viennese aroma. There would be no mob subplot and no one gunned down, and just endlessly suggestive twirling with the embroidered limits of social appearances. Soon the French young upstarts at Cahiers would do it with youthful style and lots of cinematic annotation around acting and images.<br/><br/>Here we're stuck with a revue, effortlessly smooth but the jokes are broad and corny, the improvised skits are forced without breath. The appeal is more or less the same all these years later. Monroe captured with a naive purity that has become the image of who we like to think she was, and kept just a little off center so that we yearn for each next voluptuous appearance. Men in drag, musicians that flee with a girls jazz band to Florida to escape the mob, so that we can pretend to inhabit for a while what it means to be desired.<br/><br/>Classic in this case means older and the material is not much better than an Appatow film."

","While I am a student of Political history and could recite many a Marilyn Monroe fact or conspiracy theory to you, I had yet to see her in one of her iconic films. So finally I sat down to watch what is generally considered one of the greatest film comedies of all time. That is a lot to live up to and I didn't realize just how popular the film was until I logged on here to write this review. 8.4 on IMDb?! Now, please don't get me wrong...I enjoyed this movie. It was fun and wild and absolutely I can see how and why it pushed the limits back then. I'm not sure I have seen so many analogies and innuendos in one film. They were being shoved down your throat like a case of mistaken identity on Three's Company. The first analogy or clever innuendo is a chuckle and not much else but after the twentieth...it gets tired. The setting of 1929 makes some pretty intense action/gangster scenes even for the time. It was almost shocking to watch it now and that was kind of a neat mix to the comedy. Some of the comedic moments are almost dark in nature. I was surprised that I didn't really feel a lot of the humour had homophobic undertones which I thought would be a certainty. If anything, the very last gag in the film is almost pro-gay in some ways and it was definitely worth a laugh.<br/><br/>Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon were so young!! Curtis was handsome and fun and delivered his comedic moments perfectly. Lemmon was quirky and fun and certainly has legendary comedic timing. The two of them together are just awesome. A buddy film like this requires great chemistry and there is nothing short in their chemistry together. They seem like a bit of an odd-couple but they work great together. The stunning beauty of Marilyn Monroe and her sheer raw charisma on screen cannot be denied. When she first appears and every subsequent appearance you are just mesmerized. She's actually a much actress that I anticipated and her role is fun and breezy and perfectly performed by her. The chemistry between her and Curtis and even her and Lemmon is lacking. I didn't feel nearly any sparks between her and Curtis and that's really unfortunate. Romance is an important part of the film and it doesn't really fit well. George Raft is the perfect cookie cutter gangster. He is nothing more or less than the stereotypical ""Boss"" we would expect from a gangster flick. Same for his crew as well. They could have been lifted right from Dick Tracey. Dave Barry was a great supporting actor and gave some great comedy as the angry but stumbling Beinstock. Joan Shawlee is also good as the band leader and mother hen Sweet Sue. I also really enjoyed the campy and fun character played by Joe E. Brown as the man who falls for Lemmon's Daphne.<br/><br/>I have no doubt that to see the true brilliance behind the film you would have to look at from the perspective of 1959 films and the time period. The movie is set in 1929 and I couldn't help but notice the inconsistencies in the timing. Its small things but certain products that weren't available in 1929 (Cheese Whiz for one) or just certain dialect. Its a small thing but worth noting nonetheless. The comedy is definitely balanced out by the more violent scenes in the film so it almost turns out a darker comedy that doesn't always fit the slapstick tone and concept of the movie. It is a fun movie and certainly is a classic that shows up on many lists of being a top film. I don't necessarily agree with that but who am I to deny a film that has stood up to 50+ years. For me, it didn't floor me but it was entertaining. 6.5/10"

","Highly acclaimed as one of the best comedies in Hollywood history, Some Like It Hot has a neat comedic approach that was sure a topic on every gossiper's agenda in the late '50s. It's a funny little movie with an original storyline. Some Like It Hot utilizes it's beautiful costumes to their full potential, it's a beautiful film to look at it. The three stars are all very serviceable in their roles. Jack Lemon is the stand out owning the character and never looking back. Marilyn Monroe is deliciously sweet in the centerpiece of the film of beauty and sexuality. This is widely considered to be her career best, its a shame she missed an Oscar nomination for it. Tony Curtis does a fine job as well. My favorite scene is the legendary ""I Wanna Be Loved By You"" song lives up to the hype, it's a wonderful scene. My problem with Some Like It Hot is the lack of emotional investment I felt for the story or the characters.

","At first, i was surprised to see that the movie is in black and white but it's true that it fits well with the period (prohibition) and it helps the subject (transvestism). <br/><br/>Contrary of recent movies, the movie is slow paced and takes time in locations (Snowy Chicago, the train, Coronado hotel), which dynamizes the story. <br/><br/>If the idea of men playing women is usual today, I think this one is the grandfather of all of them. Its originality is the multiple transvestites and their distinct personalities. Lemon is wonderful as he loses his identity and Curtis is funny as a stiffer lady (and he has something to add belong his TV work in ""The Persuaders"").<br/><br/>At last, I see now a complete movie with Marilyn: i think indeed that as she gets older, she wins in appeal. But it's rather her fragile sensibility that opens her the gate of movies pantheon. In all cases, she was really an all-around performer and an excellent singer as well!<br/><br/>I don't really think it's the number one comedy of all time because I don't laugh continuously (as in ""Pee Wee"") but it's a timeless classic. A century after, the sincere enthusiasm of the cast is still contagious.<br/><br/>A funny thing i discovered with the bonus DVD is that all the promotional pics are fake: it's only Marilyn's head on a double body's but it's expected as she is indeed the ""late"" Marilyn Monroe."

","Okay, I admit it. I'm weird. I am not as taken with this film as the rest of the world. To me it's just one very long double entendre. And, it has one cast member (who unfortunately got top billing) who simply can't act -- Marilyn Monroe. She jiggles in all the right places, but that's about all I can say for her in any movie in which she ever appeared. I may be a man, but I enjoyed watching Joe E. Brown much more than Marilyn. Oh, and exactly where are those high ocean-side cliffs in Florida? But, I admit, in terms of the movie, this was pretty daring in 1958 (when it was filmed). Director Billy Wilder was often ahead of his time...as with ""Kiss Me, Stupid"" (with Dean Martin and Kim Novak), but his greatest talent seemed to be telling an off-color story.<br/><br/>I do give Wilder credit for using some historic movie gangsters and cops -- George Raft and Pat O'Brien -- in those roles in this film. And, those classic actors get the movie gets off to a good start. But, for me, once the guys (Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis) become girls, it kind of goes down hill and becomes rather repetitive. That's not to say Lemmon and Curtis aren't good here. They're excellent! Perfect casting! But to me, the joke is good for about 20 minutes...not over 2 hours. However, Wilder ended the movie perfectly when Joe E. Lewis says (when learning that his fiancé -- Lemmon -- is a man), ""Well, nobody's perfect."""

","It's interesting to me that, for a movie that is essentially silly and contrived at heart, SOME LIKE IT HOT works so well and holds up even today. I mean, as I'm sure you've heard if you've watched Thirteen at all this week, AFI recently named SOME LIKE IT HOT as the greatest American comedy of all-time. If the same movie were made today, I'm not sure it would fly. In today's more liberated society, men dressing up as women isn't that much of a novelty and it is my opinion that modern audiences would reject the coincidences that the plot hinges on (Lemmon and Curtis actually witness the St. Valentine's Day Massacre AND the mob chasing them just happens to show up at the same hotel in Florida!). However, because it is from the fifties and in black and white, today's audiences tend to be a little more accepting, as if to assume that's they way things were done back then.<br/><br/>While I don't agree that plot contrivance was a staple of 1950's cinema (though it is pre- eminent in a lot of Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond screenplays), I do agree that SOME LIKE IT HOT is a fabulous comedy. The key question is what makes it overcome those more absurd moments. It's not the performances. In spite of her iconic stature, Marilyn Monroe was never a very good actor and that remains true here. Tony Curtis is better imitating Cary Grant than he is at playing the Joe/Josephine character. Jack Lemmon doesn't disappoint and has many strong moments, even though when he is his Daphne make-up, his uncanny resemblance to The Joker from the BATMAN movies is very disconcerting.<br/><br/>No, I think what makes SOME LIKE IT HOT work is outstanding, precise direction. Billy Wilder writes some great dialogue, but I think his most underrated contribution to cinema comedy is his sense of pace and comic timing. The way some of his stronger films move and seem to breathe give them an energy that keeps the audience involved in the story, but also, to some degree, hides the less plausible elements of the plot. Even some of his lesser work like ONE, TWO, THREE (the Reel 13 Classic from March 29th) relies heavily on alternating between freneticism and stoicism and knowing just when to employ each (Soderbergh calls it ""rhythm and release""). The staging of scenes borrow equally from Ernst Lubitsch (dialogue-driven) and Mack Sennett (physical comedy) to create this hybrid style that became all Wilder – a sort of modern farce that, in the case of SOME LIKE IT HOT, had particular resonance because of how it innocuously played with sexual conventions at a time when attitudes toward sex and sexuality were starting to shift.<br/><br/>Most importantly, however, is that SOME LIKE IT HOT is just great fun. Smart dialogue, sharp direction, disguises, mistaken identity – the works, all executed with great deftness and care. While I disagree that SOME LIKE IT HOT is the greatest comedy of all time (haven't they seen AIRPLANE?) or that it is Billy Wilder's best film (see last week's blog for THE APARTMENT), it's still a fabulous, memorable movie that in spite of its penchant for silliness, will probably live forever.<br/><br/>(For more information on this or any other Reel 13 film, check out their website at www.reel13.org)"

","Okay, this movie is, indeed, very amazingly made. It's uproariously funny, pretty exciting, and has some very fine performances. Being a Wilder fan as well helps this movie quickly earn a bunch of big stars on the rating scale.<br/><br/>However, I have always had a problem with this movie, and it wasn't until recently, my fifth time seeing it (yeah, it took that long), for me to realize what it was.<br/><br/>I just don't believe Marylin Monroe's character.<br/><br/>The thing is, she's so easily taken advantage of... and she admits it herself. However, her admitting it makes it okay. Sure, they sort of undercut it by making Lemmon's character actually finally tell the truth, but the fact remains that Sugar is ditzy, she's blond...she's everything a man wants, but for all the wrong reasons.<br/><br/>Even the way Wilder puts the camera to her is very male-fantasy oriented. Think back, for a moment, to when she sings that one song, ""I wanna be loved by you/just you/nobody else but you."" She's singing at the camera, meaning she's looking directly at the audience members... presumably male, at least half-so.<br/><br/>In fact a lot of this film could be considered prurient, but at this point I'd like to point out that so much of it is so playful, so light-hearted, that it doesn't really hold up that way. It's only with Sugar Kane herself that I begin to reject the notion that anything ""real"" is happening, making it all seem vaguely false.<br/><br/>Just a quick dampener before I go back to enjoying the rest of the performances.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

Was this just a subtle attempt to tell the public, it's OK to live in both worlds?

Doesn't this seem to fit the wrong picture one man with another man, and a women with a man dressed as a women. This movie is full of humorous things, it's a must see, not only do you get to see two grown men dressed as women and acting like them. But you get to see two grown men doing a wonderful and convincing job. I enjoyed this movie, because it had a wonderful cast, good music, and a great script. This movie reminds me of a movie that just recently came out Connie and Carla. I believe that's why I liked this movie a lot, was because I liked Connie and Carla as well. The Connie and Carla movie was about two women who saw someone killed and they had to flee and try to hide. But they chose a odd way of hiding, now they aren't women they are cross-dressers.

","I recently watched this movie for the first time as a sort of tribute to the late lamented Billy Wilder, having heard it was his best comedy.  I agree there is much to admire in the plotting & pacing of this ""madcap farce,"" and also that one is inclined to forgive inconsistencies such as how Tony Curtis can put on, a few hours later, an immaculate blazer previously plunged into a soapy bathtub (& which was cadged from the luggage of a much shorter, plumper man).   BUT I have one large objection: the scene in which Tony Curtis attempts to seduce Marilyn Monroe by telling her that he is naturally not attracted to women, thereby prompting HER to attempt to seduce HIM, really suffers from the datedness of the arch approach to what could be discussed freely today: is he, or does he fear he is, a homosexual?  In order to persuade him that he is a sexually ""normal"" male, she kisses him repeatedly.   She does NOT do what any normal woman (in 1929, the supposed time setting, or 1959, the actual setting) would have done: take off some clothes & wait for him to have an erection.   Because, you will tell me, of the movie code of the '50s, she has to let her kisses represent a series of more erotic actions.   However, we are left unconvinced even by this metaphoric seduction, because we wonder, notably, how could Tony Curtis not respond to the luscious Monroe even in the filming of this scene (where she is lying on top of him), how could ""Joe"" school himself not to respond to ""Sugar,"" how could even a neurotically frigid male (such as Curtis is pretending to be) not respond for SO long?  It's odd that all the scenes involving men pretending to be women work well, but this one supposedly ""heterosexual"" scene strains credulity on every level."

","This is nothing but warmed up vaudeville, a one-joke farce without any message. Far better movies on a similar subject are ""The Gay Deceivers"" (1969) and ""La Cage Aux Folles II"". The fact that men dressed as women are thought to be so hilarious says something about our view of women. Why are women dressed as men not hilarious? Food for thought."

","At this point, Some Like It Hot has more than enough comments to<br/><br/>recommend it. What I am amazed at is the detractors. I can only<br/><br/>guess that a generation of network zit-coms has numbed their<br/><br/>brains. This movie is well constructed. It has some of the wittiest<br/><br/>dialogue ever. Lines that are thrown away here would be gobbled<br/><br/>up and turned to whole movies by other filmmakers. Every setup<br/><br/>has a very funny payoff. The timing of the acting and the editing is<br/><br/>exquisite. It's a bright, fast comedy--but with a little sex."
