","I'm a middle-aged black man now and sometimes I wonder if young people get it.<br/><br/>I was born in Richmond, VA, and I'm 1 (ONE) generation removed from segregation. <br/><br/>It is because of this that I was FLOORED by the performance of these young actors. Chadwick Boseman & Nicole Beharie did a magnificent job portraying the grace and courage of the Robinsons.<br/><br/>I couldn't have done it. Boseman has an UNCANNY resemblance to Jackie, and his performance was so visceral that it proved to me that I couldn't have done it.<br/><br/>I wouldn't have had the courage to stand up to racism by NOT fighting back. I wouldn't have had the patience to bide my time until folks decided it was time to see me as being more than sub-human. I absolutely wouldn't have taken the risk of playing a game while people threatened my wife and child.<br/><br/>When Jackie finally got angry enough to smash his bat against a wall, that was the ONLY thing I could relate to - then to realize he had to go back out there because it was about MORE than just him - I was flabbergasted by his courage.<br/><br/>This is more than a film about baseball. The nuances like watching people in second class seating still turning out to support Robinson in full-on ""Sunday church service"" dress was poignant to me.<br/><br/>This movie ain't just about Jackie.<br/><br/>My mom is from New York, and she was 7 years old when Jackie joined the Dodgers. She remembers this clearly.<br/><br/>It's obvious why you (as I did) would take your kids to see this film as it shows what happened and how far we've come. For me, it shows what other people did FOR ME that I was incapable of doing for myself.<br/><br/>This film has some corny parts to it - like most films of this ilk, it sanitizes some things and does tie a nice bow on some issues glossed over in the retelling...<br/><br/>..that doesn't mean it's not a darned good film.<br/><br/>I'm pretty cynical these days. It's not often that I watch a film with a lump in my throat the whole time. I am indebted to the young actors who portrayed the people of my grandparents' generation with style, class and urgency.<br/><br/>I will own this film when it becomes available and that date can't come soon enough."

","Greetings again from the darkness. After some soul searching, I have decided to turn off the critical side of my brain and concentrate on what is good about this movie. As a baseball and movie fanatic, a bit of trepidation creeps in when the two come together. However, this really isn't a baseball movie, though the story focuses on what may be the most critical turning point in baseball history. In fact, this turning point was much bigger than the American Pasttime ... it was also key to the Civil Rights Movement. The movie is a reminder of how different things could have been with the wrong man rather than the right one ... Jackie Robinson.<br/><br/>Writer/Director Brian Helgeland (s/p for L.A. Confidential and Mystic River) takes a look at what occurred in 1945-47, when Brooklyn Dodgers President and GM Branch Rickey (played by Harrison Ford) made the business decision to integrate baseball. We see his selection process ... Roy Campanella ""too nice"", Satchel Paige ""too old"". He settles on Jackie Robinson after their infamous 3 hour meetings where Rickey confronts Robinson with his need for a black player ""with the guts NOT to fight back"".<br/><br/>Chadwick Boseman portrays Jackie Robinson as a man thoroughly in love with his wife Rachel (played by Nicole Beharie), and one who says he just wants to ""be a ballplayer"", while at the same time taking pride in his world-changing role. We see his evolution from his stint as shortstop for the Kansas City Monarchs of Negro Leagues to his time with the Dodgers' AAA minor league team in Montreal and finally to his introduction to the Major Leagues in 1947.<br/><br/>This is an earnest and sincere movie that removes the complexities of the times and the main characters. Much of it is portrayed as good guys versus bad guys. The good guys are really good and the bad guys are really bad. Alan Tudyk has the unenviable task of portraying Philadelphia Phillies manager Ben Chapman, who famously unleashed a verbal assault of vile racism on Robinson. Mr. Rickey credited Chapman's small-mindedness as the single biggest factor in unifying the Dodger team around Robinson. The other famous moment given time in the movie is when beloved shortstop Pee Wee Reese (Lucas Black) put his arm around Robinson, shushing the Cincinnati fans. Of course as a baseball fan, I enjoyed the all too brief antics of Brooklyn manager Leo Durocher (Christopher Meloni) whose place in the Robinson story would have been much more profound had he not succumbed to the weakness of the flesh (so to speak).<br/><br/>Filmmaker Helgeland provides a tale of morality and social change, and provides a glimpse at the character and strength required by those involved. The story has much more to do with demonstrating how the times began to change than it does with how Jackie Robinson, an unpolished ballplayer but superior athlete, transformed himself into a perennial all-star and league MVP. And that's as it should be. As Rickey stated, acceptance will only occur if the world is convinced Robinson is a fine gentleman and a great baseball player. That burden must have weighed heavily at times, but it's very clear that Robinson was the right man at the right time."

","You probably think this film is completely focused on the story of Jackie Robinson. That is definitely not the case, as this film finds balance between the story of Robinson, baseball, and segregation. And this film succeeds in depicting all three aspects to bring a powerful, heartwarming, humorous film. The casting is great. Every actor fits his or her character perfectly. Harrison Ford does an amazing job portraying his character with his no- nonsense humorous attitude. He has a good chance of grabbing an academy award nomination for this roll. This is one of those movies that takes you for an emotional thrill ride. You feel for the Robinson. You want him to win. And you rejoice when he does. So sit back and let the film drag you in; it's worth your time."

","I did not expect a movie like this to be so good! <br/><br/>The acting was brilliant. Chad Boseman as Jackie Robinson did fantastic job playing his character. You can feel the turmoil building up inside him every time some racist moron starts to provoke him. Most of the time, I felt so much sympathy for him.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford should be nominated for an Academy Award. From beginning to end, he was spot on. He's one of the only people in the movie who actually treats Jackie like a human being from the beginning.<br/><br/>The other actors were good too.<br/><br/>With almost every sports movie, you can pretty much tell were the story was going. I will admit it was kind of predictable, but it was still enjoyable nonetheless.<br/><br/>The racism. Oh god. I understand that the film was set in the 40s and that's how it was back then, but the racism in this film angered me to no end. I could not stand some of these characters, especially one that stood out as the biggest piece of garbage in this entire film. I can't blame the filmmakers for that; in fact, if they did sugarcoat the language, I don't think the film would have been as strong. I guess the only good thing that comes out of it is how it helps build Jackie's character. You could feel the rage building up inside him.<br/><br/>I guess the only problem I have is how there was not as much baseball as there should have been in a movie about a baseball player. The gaming scenes were a lot of fun to watch but I felt that they were a bit too short.<br/><br/>Overall, the acting was great, the characters were great, and the story was great. If you're a sports fan, 42 is film worth checking out."

","Everyone will remember the name Jackie Robinson. He became more then a baseball player, he became a legend, and a hero. Almost 70 years later his influence is still felt today. You ask anyone who follows baseball they know the name, the number, what it meant to the sport, and this country.<br/><br/>Luckily the film doesn't try to do too much by telling the life story of Jackie Robinson, instead it focuses on Robinson's days in the Negro League in 1945 to his first season with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947. Even with America coming off its victory against Fascism in World War II, racism was still prominent. This was especially true with the racist attitudes against African-Americans. At a time when the society in America was still segregated based on race, Jackie Robinson became the first African-American Major League Baseball player. He broke through the color barrier that had kept blacks out of the Major League. Despite his amazing skills as a ballplayer, Robinson faces huge adversity dealing with the racist prejudice from the public, the fans, and fellow ballplayers. His greatness on the field had such a huge impact on the game and America's attitude towards African-Americans. Of course talent can only take a player so far, it was Robinson's character & pride that really made him standout. He became an icon in the civil rights movement in America, and ended racial segregation in America's greatest past time. This is why we remember his name, and his number.<br/><br/>Chadwick Boseman has such an uncanny resemblance to Jackie Robinson. He played Robinson beautifully as a man of great talent and character. You can see him boiling inside at moments dealing with the stress and anger Robinson must have felt with the world coming down on him. I love that this film isn't just about Robinson's courage, but that of those who supported him. Jackie's wife Rachel is played wonderfully by Nicole Beharie. She is beautiful, strong, and good natured. She had to be as strong as Jackie was to endure the rough journey ahead. While most love stories come across as corny especially in a sports movie, this works thanks to the chemistry and wonderful acting of Boseman and Beharie. Harrison Ford is unforgettable in his supporting role as Branch Rickey, the legendary General Manger who took great risks in signing Jackie Robinson. This was one of Ford's best performances, bringing charisma, charm, and heart to his role. Branch Rickey was a gutsy and innovative figure in baseball, and Ford did him justice. The acting overall is wonderful, and I give credit to a great supporting cast.<br/><br/>The film is a true inspirational story of how a baseball player helped change a sport, and how sport can change a country. Despite it's cliché moments, this film has a charm to it that makes it so beloved. Its my hope that 42 film will educate and inspire this generation and the next and that 42 won't become lost amongst the Sports film or bio-pic movie genre. Does 42 adequately match the legacy of the man tries it depicts? Is Jackie Robinson's life simply too great for a two hour motion picture? whatever legacy it will create, 42 is still a proud tribute to one of baseballs greatest figures."

","As Jackie Robinson was an excellent, multi-faceted baseball player, ""42"" is an excellent multi-faceted movie. Writer-director Brian Helgeland manages to artfully mix elements of drama, baseball action, humor and romance[!] while telling an important story about recent American history.<br/><br/>I thought it was wise for the film to focus on just a few years of Robinson's career, so that more time could be given to important scenes both on and off the field.<br/><br/>""42"" is not called the ""Jackie Robinson Story"" for a reason. The movie is about more than just one man. The film shows the roles that Brooklyn Dodgers owner Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford), Robinson's wife Rachel (Nicole Beharie), and journalist Wendell Smith (Andre Holland) played in Robinson's career and life. All the actors give fine performances. And Chadwick Boseman is fantastic in portraying Robinson's determination, anxiety, anger, athleticism and courage.<br/><br/>I also appreciated the scenes that touched on the cultural climate in the nation. Watch for what happens between a father and his son when Robinson is introduced at a game in Cincinnati.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed ""42"". It's a film that that should be a game-winning hit with baseball fans, and those who appreciate civil rights and American history."

","42, a biopic that unsurprisingly stuns the audience with it's non-cliché drama, amazing acting from every word delivered to every facial expression, and Boseman's athletic and acting abilities. People who have been worried about the SPECIFIC details of Jackie's life will be delighted to see an amazing copy of his life, with Robinson's stint in the Negro,Minor, and Major Leagues. Chadwick's athletic ability has been tested and he has passed, he showed a spot on portrayal of Jackie's movements/style. The cinematography was actually a sight to see, I'd have to say that during the baseball playing scenes, I would of probably been turned off if it specifically wasn't for this look, it captures the scene back then, while still keep in touch with today's audience. The supporting roles were just tremendous, I don't know if I'd say award winning but Harrison Ford will get notice for this role as Branch Rickey, he captures the charisma yet tough heartiness of Branch. Comedically, the jokes aren't cliché, they're not cheap and Boseman shows his range comedically and dramatically. In conclusion, 42 is an amazing looking film and even though it is rated PG-13, the racial topic isn't too weak or strong and at times they may actually overuse, the ""n"" word, this film is still one of my favorite bio pics that I've seen in a long time and I hope you""ll enjoy it too, I know the audience did because this was one of the few films where an applause occurred at the end of it and I'm not scared to say that I was a part of it."
"tavm","9","37","48","18 April 2013"," 42 is a near-great depiction of Jackie Robinson's breaking the color line in baseball history
","A few years ago during Black History Month, I reviewed The Jackie Robinson Story which starred Robinson. I mentioned he wasn't much of an actor but his skill in baseball was the reason he was used, anyway, so that made it worth seeing. So now we have another depiction of his major league career as portrayed by Chadwick Boseman and, man, he gets to portray his anger after getting some really appalling comments from a manager of the Pirates team (Alan Tudyk, in a really brave performance). But we also see Robinson get some support from his wife, Rachel (Nicole Beharie), a fellow African-American reporting on him named Wendell Smith (Andre Holland), and especially, Brooklyn Dodgers head Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford). In fact, the most touching part was when Rickey mentions something in his past that made him pick someone like Jackie for his team. So for every awful depiction of racism, there's a just as inspirational depiction of strength among his team of overcoming those odds. So on that note, I highly recommend 42."
"classicsoncall","8","16","20","14 April 2013"," ""I don't know who he is or where he is, but he's comin'"". - Branch Rickey speculating on the first black Major League ballplayer.
","When I reviewed the 1950 film ""The Jackie Robinson Story"", I made the following comment - ""What I'd really like to see is a modern day version of the Jackie Robinson story that does a more thorough job of his college and military years, with a lot better look at his International League and Dodgers career"". ""42"" comes close, as it hones in nicely on Jackie's days in the Negro Leagues and his start in the Majors with the International League Montreal Royals, a Brooklyn Dodgers farm team. The actor who portrays Robinson, Chadwick Boseman, bears an uncanny resemblance to the color barrier breaking athlete, and truth be told, actually does a better job than Robinson himself in the 1950 biopic, who displayed a surprising lack of charisma considering his accomplishments both on and off the field.<br/><br/>Be advised however that this is not so much a sports movie as it is about the state of the country and race relations in the latter half of the 1940's. As such, some of the scenes are painful in their depictions of racial intolerance. Yet at the same time, one gets a first hand view of how Jackie's teammates came to embrace him first as an accomplished ball player and then as a teammate and friend. The Pee Wee Reese (Lucas Black) scene in the latter part of the movie becomes an emotional moment when the Dodgers shortstop steps forward to challenge a stadium full of baseball fans to accept a new era in race relations. That was one of the pivotal scenes in the film for me.<br/><br/>Now had I not known in advance that Harrison Ford was portraying Dodgers owner Branch Rickey, I might not have figured it out on my own. Ford was totally submerged into his character, both physically and emotionally. He offered a nice balance between the often laid back approach he took to his position against the firebrand posture required when it came time to lay down the law on anti-discrimination. It was surprising to hear that his first encounter with a black ball player was forty years PRIOR to events in the film, a stunning acknowledgment that took four decades to come full circle regarding his own personal mission to combat racism.<br/><br/>All in all, I don't think you have to be a baseball fan to enjoy this film. The period details are attentively done, and the competent casting of the support players is a big plus. Especially effective is Nicole Beharie in the role of Robinson's wife Rachel, and Andre Holland as the chronicler of Robinson's career while reporting for the Pittsburgh Courier. Elements of comic relief are layered into the story to mitigate the harsh examples of racism, and you'll get a kick out of the locker room scene when Ralph Branca (Hamish Linklater) encourages Jackie to take a shower with him. There's just no way to make that come out right, but they took a pretty good swing at it."
"rannynm","Null","32","44","12 April 2013"," Inspirational, Educational and Humorous Story of An American Legend
","""42"" tells the story of the American legend Jackie Robinson, the first African-American major league baseball player. This film takes place in the 1940s when racism and segregation were very prominent, so Jackie has to overcome many challenges and deal with the doubt and judgment people have towards him. With the support of journalist Wendell Smith (Andre Holland), Rachel Robinson (Nicole Beharie) and Dodger's owner Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford), Jackie proves he has what it takes to make it.<br/><br/>I really love this film. Not only is ""42"" educational, but it also has a sense of humor, wit and a whole lot of inspiration. This film captures the hardships that not only Jackie and his family dealt with, but also the hatred that was shown towards the people that supported him. I really like the cinematography and the way the camera angles are able to capture the movement of the players and the unspoken communication between the team members. The costume and set design is also very well done and accurate for that time period.<br/><br/>My favorite character is Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) because he really shows emotion in a realistic way. Jackie is faced with challenge after challenge, but always overcomes, and Chadwick did a phenomenal job of displaying all that was going through his characters mind with nothing but a simple expression. Chadwick also captured Jackie's spunk and defiance towards the norms. Jackie Robinson is such an inspirational person and character. At any given moment he could have given up, let down the people that looked up to him, believe all the hate that was thrown at him, but he didn't, and that's what makes him a hero. I believe Jackie is a character that every man, woman and child can look up to and find inspiration in.<br/><br/>My favorite scene is when Jackie plays one of his first games as a Dodger. The manager of the opposing team is very slanderous and vile towards Jackie. He calls out awful racial slurs while Jackie is out on the field, but Jackie knows if he did anything about it he would be the one who gets punished. Finally after the other Dodgers had enough, Eddie Stanky marched over to the opposing team and told the manager to sit down. He knows he is breaking the rules, but when he sees a team member of his being harped on he takes a chance and stands up of for him. This scene shows that the color of one's skin doesn't matter and that Eddie would have done that for any one of his teammates. It's a wonderful example of equity and sportsmanship and it is very moving.<br/><br/>I give ""42"" 5 out of 5 stars because it is touching, funny, educational and inspirational. It's rated PG-13 which I agree with because it does run a bit long and younger children may find it hard to sit through, but it also contains a lot of racial slurs and slanderous language that may be hard for children to understand. <br/><br/>Reviewed by KIDS FIRST!

"will51224","8","11","13","5 May 2013"," More than just a great baseball movie
","I'm a big baseball fan, so I was excited to see this movie as soon as I heard about it. The release date of April 12th coinciding with the start of the baseball season, as well as Jackie Robinson Day on April 15th (when every MLB player sports #42 in his honor), felt appropriate and was clever marketing.<br/><br/>In case you live under a rock and/or you happened to go to one of the few elementary schools that didn't require its students to write a report on a famous black person for Black History Month, Jackie Robinson was the first African American Major League Baseball player, who played first and second base with the Brooklyn Dodgers from 1947 through 1956. After doing a little research about Robinson, I discovered that one detail that was left out in those grade school reports was that he wasn't really the first black player in the majors, only of the of the modern era. What I mean by ""the modern era"" is after the Negro Leagues, which existed for about 60 years, starting in the 1880s. There were actually some black players in the major leagues before the Negro League started. However, this does not make Robinson's accomplishments any less impressive.<br/><br/>I have a whole new respect for Jackie Robinson after actually seeing and hearing the racism that he had to endure. In one scene, a Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher even hits him in the head. (Speaking of which, it made me wonder what the hell took so long for helmets to be made mandatory.) Some of the behavior and racial slurs coming from the crowd, coaches from other teams, and umpires was truly disgusting to watch for someone who was brought up in a generation where it's no longer socially acceptable to be blatantly racist. Sure, racism is unfortunately still alive and well in America, but it exists on a more underground level, compared to 60 years ago when it was considered the norm.<br/><br/>Newcomer Chadwick Boseman did a fantastic job. I'm glad the producers cast an unknown because it made it easier to believe that he really was Jackie Robinson. It would be cool to see him be recognized with an Oscar nomination, but even more importantly, I hope this will be the start of a long career. The supporting actors were great as well, particularly Lucas Black as Pee Wee Reese, the Dodgers shortstop who supported and stood up for Robinson the most during his rough first years on the team, and Alan Tudyk as Ben Chapman, the unapologetically racist Phillies manager who was one of Robinson's worst tormentors. Tudyk was so convincing in the role, it was hard not to hate him. Then of course, there's the legendary Harrison Ford as Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey, the man who helped break the color barrier by deciding to sign Robinson. I didn't realize just how old Harrison Ford is until I saw him in this. He was almost unrecognizable, and really disappeared in his role. At 71 years old, he still looks good for his age though.<br/><br/>It was great to see how his teammates went from signing a petition against him playing with them to gradually accepting and respecting him. The only problem I had with the film was that it ended very abruptly. I was shocked when the concluding notes of what happened to all the characters started rolling, as they typically do in films based on true stories. I felt like they stopped telling his story too early. Aside from that, I was very impressed with the film's authenticity and honest portrayal of the characters and time period.<br/><br/>""42"" has already proved to be a hit. It opened at number one at the box office, and it broke some records for baseball-themed movies. At $9.1 million, it had the best opening day ever, and at $27.3 million, it had the best opening weekend. This will undoubtedly go down as one of the greatest baseball movies of all time. In my book, it's right up there with ""The Sandlot"" and ""A League of Their Own."" What's great about ""42"" is that it's far more than just a baseball movie. It's a movie about overcoming obstacles, staying strong during difficult times, believing in yourself, and standing up for what is right."
"diac228","7","5","5","23 October 2013"," Follows the formula, but doesn't add any zest to it.
","42 is the cinematic equivalent of a great hitter smashing a double—but not even considering going to third base even if he had a slight chance.<br/><br/>42 is an entertaining movie. It is motivating. It has all the qualities of your inspiring American story about an individual rising up against the ranks and accomplishing their far-fetched goals. The Rocky formula was nicely dropped on the Jackie Robinson story as this legendary player had to go up against layers of racism within the sport of baseball while also dealing with his team's tough pennant race. The movie had the personality that makes it immediately likable. You can't dislike this movie. You honestly can't.<br/><br/>The cast is good. The cinematography is good. The production value is grand. The effort is clearly here. All the cylinders are working.<br/><br/>But in spite of all this, 42 doesn't attempt to go the next step. This movie plays it extremely safe. It is a rough rated-R story that became condensed and watered-down to a PG-13 flick. It dabbles into the surface of racism, but doesn't dwell too deep. It only covers his early days, and doesn't cover the aftermath and his later years. The problems didn't exactly go away just because he survived his first year. Jackie Robinson's entire career was met with resistance. Some can argue he died younger because of all the stress associated with being the controversial pioneer.<br/><br/>What bogs this movie the most is that we have seen it all before, as sad as it sounds. He even starred in his own documentary back in the 1950s for crying out loud. A good movie will accurately portray the drama; but a great movie will make you practically experience it. It is this element that makes the World War II flick Thin Red Line a good movie, and Saving Private Ryan the one that represents and dominates the genre.<br/><br/>So 42 will entertain you and will make you root for the lead characters, but don't expect it to add anything new to the table."

","We have seen just so many baseball films come out, like Major League with Charlie Sheen, or Babe, and countless others. Although this covers new ground with the element of racism, the plot is altogether too familiar to get past a 7 for entertainment value.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed Harrison Ford's speeches, but in a nutshell the plot is just too simple. A black man joins the major leagues for the first time, plays good, some white people angry, and he sticks it through. Sure there were some side plots, especially near the beginning, but they have been unnecessary. What this film needed was some good old formulaic tension on the baseball field. Sure they gave us glimpses, but we need a whole game. Like in Major League where in the end they have to play a long final game. I thought this movie was going to go there, but no, they just cut to the credits and gave us some interesting history.<br/><br/>Anyways, quality film, but there are much more entertaining baseball films out there. This film could have been much darker, and I think by sugar coating the struggle of Jackie Robinson they eluded an 8 or a 9 rating."

","Robinson starts playing for the Montreal Royals who are an affiliate AAA team of the Brooklyn Dodgers. There is of course animosity among players and residents, but he rises above, keeps his cool and plays well. The following year, he gets a shot with the Brooklyn Dodgers. The manager (Christopher Meloni) tells Rickey he doesn't care about color, he'll keep anyone who will help him win, and send home his own brother if someone can play better. I really enjoyed Meloni's short performance and really wish he was in the film more. Unfortunately, due to some lifestyle choices, Meloni is fired and an older, non-charismatic manager fills in who basically is non-existent in the process or the rest of the movie, very strange. Robinson makes the team, makes people upset, strengthens the resiliency of those who look up to him and are faced with similar challenges, and diminishes the color barrier in major league baseball.<br/><br/>The pros were the scenes during the baseball games. They were amazing. The field, bases, players, etc., were wonderfully shot and you obviously didn't feel like you were watching a game that took place in the 40's. I did wish we saw Robinson hit the ball more. I know that many pitchers walked him or hit him, but he was a great hitter, and they don't even show him hitting a ball until the third time we see him in a baseball game.

","42 is a movie about that particular black man, who entered the league for the very first time, challenged everyone, including his teammates and won. Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) became the pioneer athlete to stand alongside the white sportsmen on the field when segregation & racial discrimination was a ""rule"" in United States. However, film does not actually follow the whole story of Jackie, it more tells a story of racial revolution in baseball, which escalated after one bold decision of Brooklyn Dodgers executive - Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford). Branch was the first manager to hire a black man, a talented black man who ran fast, who could catch any ball and who could bring hundreds of black spectators to the field. And since every of them, regardless their skin color paid money to see Robinson playing, this new transfer to the team could be successful.<br/><br/>Brian Helgeland wrote a pretty interesting and engaging script, with really good dialogues (well, he has a great experience of it from LA Confidential and Mystic River). Even though there is no much tension in the movie, it still makes you enjoy every minute of it. At first I was not comfortable with the idea of racial discrimination, because I've seen so many good movies on this topic, and it just makes me feel bored. Most of them look like each other much. I believe that any film that regards this topic, shall be very much emotional, which helps director to deliver a message successfully. The last film that affected on me, and for sure on every person, was The Help - a masterful presentation of historic segregation. But 42 does not arise rave emotions, it instead provokes great satisfaction. That is why 42 is an above average film.<br/><br/>Picking totally unfamiliar actor, Chadwick Boseman, for lead role, which actually presents the whole idea of the movie, is a risky choice by director. But Jackie was exactly as it should be. Chad delivers a passionate, evolving character who struggles with his emotions and almost every person surrounding him. His convincing performance is really worth to call potentially one of the best performances this year.<br/><br/>And Harrison Ford, it's been years I've not seen him acting well. In fact, the portrait of Branch Rickey is one of the best performances he'd ever had. Even though Mr. Ford gets older, he can make Brooklyn Dodgers story unbelievably interesting.<br/><br/>As for the rest of cast, everyone is good.

","An well done depiction of the struggles Jackie Robinson went through to just play baseball. I think all the casting was well done -especially Chadwick Boseman and Harrison Ford. It was hard to see the discrimination then and knowing how it continued for many years - but that was the time of my parents and it was true to the time (so sad). I think Harrison Ford should get an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor - it is such a good performance. I totally forgot who the actor was and got into the personality of Branch Rickey - it was all about the best for the baseball team - but he had a heart too for his players. It was fun to see J.R.Knight in a film again - I have always liked him. I liked the music (I grew up with it) and the costuming was accurate. The sets were well done and the language - that is the way it was - not tolerated now thank heaven. Jackie Robinson was a man of honor and strength - an admirable man."

","""42"" is less inspiring than bludgeoning, yet has inspiring moments. It is a fair depiction of racism in the mid-20th century, but the Jackie Robinson we see seems to be transported from the 21st century. The writing is good, but key scenes are wasted on drivel. <br/><br/>""42"" gets off to a bad start with its ""based on"" disclaimer. Isn't the true story good enough? Apparently, it wasn't dramatic enough for writer-director Brian Helgeland. So he ""improved"" it. <br/><br/>You do not honor a man by dishonoring another. Fritz Ostermueller did not bean Jackie Robinson on the head; he hit him on the shoulder, and there's no record of him yelling racist insults while doing it. Yet Brian Helgeland portrays him as a sort of neo-Nazi. And he makes an umpire who made a bad call look like a monkey. These are childish, if not racist. <br/><br/>There are many scenes that don't ring true, undermining the movie's credibility. <br/><br/>The Monarchs' bus at the rural Southern gas station is utterly implausible. If you don't let me use the restroom, I won't buy the gas, says Robinson. He gets his gas, but the bus might get a visit from the sheriff or the KKK on a lonely stretch of highway. Plus the scout from the Dodgers shows up -- not at the next ball field, but at the gas station in the middle of nowhere! He offers Jackie a tryout, and he just says, OK, without the least astonishment. A key scene ruined.<br/><br/>Branch Rickey offers Robinson a job, and again he just says OK. In reality they spent three hours talking; in the movie the white guy spends four minutes informing the black guy there is racism(!) out there. <br/><br/>I saw ""The Jackie Robinson Story"" - 1950 - first, and in it, Rickey tells Robinson to call his mother long-distance before deciding, who tells him to talk with a minister, who tells Robinson that the hopes of black people will be with him on the ball field. It was very well done. In ""42"" the key scene of the movie was wasted. <br/><br/>Robinson signs and promptly gets married, even though he is in New York, and she is in California, and in reality it happened three months later. We then see interminable banter outside a door about how much they love each other. But we never find out anything about Rachel, that she is a nurse, how he met or courted her, how she feels about marrying a target of the KKK. (Flashback?)<br/><br/>Next, we see Rachel walk into a Whites only restroom. This is precisely what Rickey told them not to do. They get booted off the plane and the airline threatens to call the sheriff. This could have been the end of Robinson's baseball career and we never would have heard of him. It might reflect the time, but it lacks believability.<br/><br/>In Daytona they board with a local black politician, who is ""in charge of the get out the black vote."" In Florida (the state with the highest per capita rate of lynchings) you could get killed just for registering people to vote, as happened to Harry T. Moore in 1950. <br/><br/>In 42-1950 Jackie Robinson plays himself, has a higher voice, is soft spoken, polite and even meek. Would this have sold movie tickets in 2013? Doubtful, without great writing. Helgeland turns him into an emotional volcano who keeps from erupting only with superhuman strength. That is 42-2013. The truth is probably somewhere in between. <br/><br/>On the other hand, the scene with Pee Wee Reese was well done, especially the bit with the kid yelling and then feeling shame. <br/><br/>The Ben Chapman incident is the most powerful in the movie, unsurprisingly, given the stomach turning language. By then, the movie had lost credibility. Yet, astonishingly, it is pretty accurate, judging by Wikipedia and other sources. Chapman's defense is that ""everyone"" yells prejudiced epithets. Pro players had to learn to ignore them -- including Robinson. The difference is that Robinson couldn't fight back. But sports writers did it for him, turning on Chapman en masse. Chapman wasn't fired until mid-1948, for being a lousy manager.<br/><br/>One of the strengths of 42-2013 is the character development of the white players. This is about the transformation of white attitudes, which took some courage, as well as the enormous courage of Robinson. But I never felt I got to know who Robinson really was. 42-2013 desperately needed some background on Robinson's youth, as in 42- 1950, perhaps through flashbacks. Helgeland should have hired a writer to help him.<br/><br/>The real emotional climax of 42-2013 could have been what came next, particularly being named Rookie of the Year by the (all white) sportswriters, which could have been a beautiful scene with Rachel, yet was reduced to text on the screen. Another scene wasted. <br/><br/>Larry Doby became the second black MLB player 11 weeks after Robinson, which 42-2013 fails to mention, and others soon followed, listed as text on the screen. ""The Jackie Robinson Story"" was filmed three years later. Apparently America was less racist than depicted in 42-2013, given the speed of desegregation of baseball. <br/><br/>Robinson, while amazing, was not the best black baseball player. Yet he is depicted as ""supernatural"": a hybrid of Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb and Roy Hobbs. Everything in 42-2013 is exaggerated, cranked up 110 percent, including the sepia-tinged over-saturated color and the overpowering, forgettable background music. The result is not an up-swelling of admiration as much as being manipulated by a exploitative, gimmicky film.<br/><br/>Compare ""42"" to ""Seabiscuit,"" which provides biographical backgrounds of the main characters, plus mini-documentaries of the historical period. The story is engrossing, powerful, inspiring and fun. ""42"" is less a story than an assemblage of scenes, with little sense of historical depth."

","42 (2013)<br/><br/>This is a ten star, top notch dramatic story and a four star, disappointing delivery. No, the acting isn't terrible, and in fact the filming and editing are up to normal professional levels. <br/><br/>But that's not what makes a good movie—not alone. This is more like Disney does the Jackie Robinson Story. Oh—does that sound familiar? Yes, there is a movie called ""The Jackie Robinson Story"" and it stars, believe it or not, Jackie Robinson, who was not an actor and in fact couldn't hold up his end of his own story. That movie, too, falls under the bus of righteous storytelling.<br/><br/>But of course the story IS fantastic. And important and dramatic. It needs a less fearful approach than ""42"" for sure. The attempts at showing his relationship with his wife are too long and generic, there is no showing of his amazing rise through the Negro leagues, there is nothing about his psychology, even—not beyond the anger and torment that are obvious. And you know full well there are good, respectable depths available (and written about) that need to see the light of day.<br/><br/>Most of all there is only the expected here. There is blatant racism (some of it really terrible) and there is hero worship. And all of this is told in a glossy, bland way. There's even the required slow motion as Robinson rounds the bases after a key home run. Bravo, movie makers. Nice thinking!<br/><br/>Ugh. It figures the director AND writer is someone like Brian Helgeland, with little feature directing experience (just ""Payback,"" which is however quite good). Bravo for Harrison Ford for taking on a good role and anchoring the whole thing a little.<br/><br/>Okay, so maybe you like feel good movies. Why not? See it. I have to admit I liked the story enough I stuck it out. I wanted to experience the events through the movie. And you can do that here. Maybe that's enough. For me it was not, and for me even further it's a shame. It doesn't put racism under the thumb enough, it doesn't make Robinson's heroic actions clear enough, it doesn't show the trap of money and necessity enough, and it doesn't even make the game of baseball as interesting as it really is.

","I was in fifth grade in 1957. Northern New Jersey, having just moved from California. ""Racism"" was a word, not to mention concept, I had never heard. It wasn't as though I ignored it, I was entirely unconscious that such a thing existed (something that would change a few years later when my family went to visit a Great Uncle in Florida.)<br/><br/>1957 was a time before pee-wee or Pop Warner football, at least in my town, and even predated most NFL broadcasts on television. Baseball was the national pastime, my pastime, and the subject of all my classmates' sports adoration of the era. And living in Jersey I had three teams from which to choose: Yankees, Dodgers, and Giants (at least for a couple years.) I chose the Yankees, home to Mickey Mantle, Phil Rizutto, Yogi Berra and others. I had all their baseball cards and many more.<br/><br/>I played Little League; my team was ""Local 207"", which I now understand was sponsored by ""a union"", although at the time I had no idea what that meant. I was All-Star Second Baseman one year, saved the final game of the year for my team by catching a hard-hit line-drive in the bottom of the ninth, and I was a hero for the next two months. The following year I made 16 errors, and did not try out for the team, or any baseball team again after that.<br/><br/>There is one other memory, burned into my brain so deeply I can remember the color of the sky and the exact location of the milk truck my teammates and I were sitting in; it belonged to one of the fathers and he used it to deliver to the neighborhood every morning at 4AM. It was a box truck, white with a rear door that slid out of the way, and on afternoon it was lousy with fifth graders, all jabbering about nothing as fifth graders often do, voices rising, rising again to be heard above the din. I sat in the back doorway next to two teammates. One of them was black, the only minority on the team, and one of the only ones I knew, our entire school having had only three that I recall, none of whom were in any of my classes.<br/><br/>Something out the back, and this part eludes me now, caused me to focus, then count aloud ""Eenie, meenie, miney, moe, catch a n!gger by the toe."" I instantly understood that I had made a terrible gaffe, but was too shell shocked to do anything but let my head fall and shut up. My black teammate got up, walked to the front of the truck, and we were never friends again.<br/><br/>I have never told that anecdote except once, this afternoon, to my wife as we left the showing of ""42"", the story of Jackie Robinson. She was aghast, I suppose it goes without saying. My tale only amplified the film, a revelation to her, for not only did she not know the Jackie Robinson story, she did not understand the pervasiveness of racism that existed throughout America at the time, in so many levels of society.<br/><br/>The bravery of Robinson, as well as Dodgers' owner Branch Rickey and others came as news, and for only the second time that I remember, she enjoyed ""a baseball picture"" (""Moneyball"" was the first.)<br/><br/>Harrison Ford turns in a surprisingly good performance (to my surprise), and the rest of the cast is marvelous, including, of course, Chadwick Boseman as Robinson and Nicole Beharie as his wife. But it is the story which has such power, brought low only by the swelling trumpets at the end and the cliché ending which I will not spoil except to say, well, you know, baseball and a man at bat and...<br/><br/>If the ""n"" word bothers you, you will not enjoy the film, as it is used nearly as much as ""Django"", but if you, like me, ever had occasion to seek forgiveness for having used it, perhaps the film will help set you free. It was part of the landscape and we were all unconscious then.<br/><br/>Well, not all of us. Not Branch Rickey, and certainly not Jackie Robinson. Two heroes of America, who might just have changed the world."

Robinson to Rickey, ""Are you looking for a Negro who is afraid to fight back?"" Rickey, ""I need a Negro with the guts not to fight back.""

The film stars Chadwick Boseman as Robinson together with Harrison Ford,Christopher Meloni,John C. McGinley, T. R. Knight,Lucas Black and Nicole Beharie.It was written and directed by Brian Helgeland.<br/><br/>It tells the story of two men - the great Jackie Robinson and legendary Brooklyn Dodgers GM Branch Rickey,whose brave stand against prejudice forever changed the world by changing the game of baseball. In 1946, Branch Rickey put himself at the forefront of history when he signed Jackie Robinson,who became the first African-American player to break the baseball color barrier to the team and also breaking Major League Baseball's infamous color line. But the deal also put both Robinson and Rickey in the firing line of the public, the press and even other players. Facing unabashed racism from every side, Robinson was forced to demonstrate tremendous courage and restraint by not reacting in kind, knowing that any incident could destroy his and Rickey's hopes. Instead, Robinson let his talent on the field do the talking-ultimately winning over fans and his teammates, silencing his critics, and paving the way for others to follow.<br/><br/>This story inspires and entertains with a vital chapter in this nation's history.It is a compelling, uplifting story about two men who deserve to be remembered.In addition to that,it is a compelling, uplifting story about two men who deserve to be remembered. This isn't a film filled with lights-shattering home runs like The Natural and the awkward dramatic devices are kept to a minimum.There's plenty of period action for the baseball fan, from a recreation of Ebbets Field to John C. McGinley's sterling Red Barber impersonation. Jackie is seen on the diamond, tormenting pitchers by dangling off the bases, forever threatening to steal the next bag.Also,it is really about the sport. This is a movie about a man who put on his uniform each day, stepped up to the plate and did his job at significant physical risk, in the face of hateful taunts, vicious threats and profound isolation. It's the stuff that history is made of.Definitely,an inspirational film that everyone should see."

Well photographed, story well written and good characters. I noticed there were a lot of barriers that the Dodgers itself had to suffer (bigotry, banned from hotels, possible strike by players, white people booing). But that did not move Jackie on the field.<br/><br/>Sad that the producers did not shot a local scene regarding Montreal where he played for the ""Royals"". There was an anecdote that Robinson was ran over on the streets, not for bigotry, but for heroism on the field. And of course at the time, French-Canadians were subject to some bigotry by the English Canadian majority (until a certain Maurice Richard gave them courage to stand up, there was a movie about it...). Jackie Robinson is well honoured here with a statue near Olympic Stadium. However, the jersey said it all, and the former ""Expos"" did made a replica in 1992.<br/><br/>For the rest, a movie to see.

","Just what I needed to get in the mood for spring training.<br/><br/>The first thing I like to do after seeing a film about historic events is to check the accuracy as portrayed.<br/><br/>Burt Shotton was actually the manager of the Dodgers in 1947, after the firing of Leo Durocher, the team was without a manager on opening day until Shotton was hired by Branch Rickey. Clyde Sukeforth served as interim manager for one day. All of the Dodgers portrayed were actually members of the team at the time: Ralph Branca, Eddy Stanky, Pee Wee Reese, Dixie Walker, and Kirby Higbe (Higbe was 2-0 with Brooklyn before his ill-fated trade to Pittsburgh, where he was 11-17).<br/><br/>Ben Chapman was indeed the manager for the Phillies, and Fritz Ostermueller was a pitcher for Pittsburgh.<br/><br/>There were also pretty realistic images of Ebbets Field and the Polo Grounds, even though those ball parks have been long ago torn down.<br/><br/>I especially like the guy who played Leo Durocher, by the way, though I believe the real reason for his suspension from baseball for one year was due to his association with gamblers and some shady underworld characters, not for his running around with women. His world-famous quote, though, ""Nice guys finish last"" made it in the script.<br/><br/>My only concern is, this film and almost all of the Academy Award nominated films this year depicted racism at its ugliest. Why is Hollywood so interested in continuing to stir up hatred between the races over something that happened so long ago, very few people are still alive today who even remember it? By the way, Jackie Robinson was not the first black player to play in the major leagues. Moses Fleetwood Walker played 46 games for the Toledo Blue Stockings in the American Association in 1884, 63 years before Robinson."

Filmmaker Brian Helgeland - who also penned the script - acquits himself by covering all the bases (particularly how even Robinson's own teammates' reluctance and ignorance speaks volumes) yet ham-strings in what could have been a bigger film (the movie only recounts his rookie year; important yes but so much more could've been explored).

This statement alone, sums of the excellent acting, scripting, and emotional delivery of the film.

Nothing about him is really revealed, except for the interplay between him and his wife, which seemed so syrupy it made my teeth hurt.<br/><br/>Actually, most of the characters are very aloof except for the ones that just beat you over the head with there motivations. <br/><br/>The movie is LONG: well over 2 hours.

"ironhorse_iv","8","4","5","11 May 2013"," Any fan of baseball need to watch this movie. It's a home run!
","This was a great movie even if you are not a baseball fan you will love this movie. It's a wonderful film and amazing story of the baseball legend himself, Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman). Robinson is so important to baseball that his number 42 went into retirement with him throughout the whole major league. No other player, got that. Not even Ty Cobbs, Babe Ruth or Hank Aaron. Before this, I don't think I ever saw Chadwick Boseman in anything much less even know his name, but he pulls off a very believable Robinson. The movie tells the story how Brooklyn Dodger's owner Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford) was able to bring in Robinson, and finally break the color barrier in the sport of Baseball. Harrison Ford is outstanding. Happy to see Harrison Ford in a decent film. It wouldn't shock me if he were to be nominated for Best Supporting Actor. Thank goodness for people like Branch Rickey that make this world a little brighter. I kinda wish the movie would have mentioned the person who scouted Robinson and actually introduced him to Branch Rickey. Clyde Sukeforth. A former catcher who managed the first two games Jackie Robinson played in a Dodger, but oh well. Written and Directed by Brian Helgeland miss a few historic moments in the film. I guess it was best to leave out what happen in 1947's World Series with the Yankees. I know it might lower the mood, but hey, it's history. Anyways, they can always show 1955's World Series where the Dodgers were really champions. While, personally, I'm not a Dodgers fan, I do like baseball. I know by limiting your story to one team might hurt the movie due to the huge different fan base for teams, I think it was important for the film to focus on the Dodgers. While there were a few Historical inaccuracies. Just for example like Wendell Smith (Andre Holland) and Jackie Robinson actually met even earlier than the Boston try out when Jackie faced a court martial while in the Army for insubordination for not going to the back of a bus when ordered to. Thankfully Jackie was exonerated and this terrible experience for Jackie went an long way towards Branch Rickey choosing him to be the first black major league ballplayer. It's still good with the information they do put into film. It's based on. Not all the events are historically accurate. And I don't need spoilers galore on how events are laid out in the movie. Maybe you need a reality check on how movies work. About the racism portray in the film. Yes, it's a bit harsh in some scenes, but at less they didn't make all the whites look like racists. There were a few supporting characters helping Jackie Robinson on his way. I would have love to see a bit of racist attitude of blacks against some whites so the movie doesn't feel like a movie about white guilt. Let's remember that racism isn't a black and white issue, but any race can be racist to another. Sad to know what he had endured back then. When I see what people had been through to overcome that, such a motivating to better our society. Brilliant! I can't imagine the restraint it must have taken for Robinson to not smash that guys face in, that one scene. Yes, there is a lot of black stories movies of pushing beyond racial barriers film, to the point, it's over sanitize the genre. So grateful that society had matured over the centuries give him coo-does for standing up for himself as he was a great ball player. Well paced and well acted film. The music score was amazing and beautiful to hear. 42 is a must watch."
"Samiam3","6","5","7","17 August 2013"," A noble, but safe biopic of a baseball legend
","42 has a handful of memorable scenes, a credible period feel, and moments of compelling acting; but somehow, the picture as a whole falls a little short of a home run.<br/><br/>The word I would use to describe 42 is 'safe'. While I wasn't looking for an Oliver Stone, hit-me-over-the-head with brutal honesty kind of motion picture, I found the drama of 42 to be a little bit muted. This is a respectable and educational bio-pic for a mass audience; but strong film making, it is not. <br/><br/>There is another problem I had. Harrison Ford gives a hammy and unconvincing performance that borders on caricature. Everyone else in the cast performs very naturally, while Ford relies more on overly theatrical mannerisms than emotion to give us a character.<br/><br/>42 seems a little bit short in length for comfort. It is obvious that certain scenes were cut, scenes which I would have liked to see. For example the relationship between Robinson and his wife is virtually non existent. He proposes to her in the first act, and their chemistry pretty much ends there. The film chose a good place to end its story arc, (when taking real history into account) but the ending itself feels a little rushed. <br/><br/>42 is a noble film, and a mostly accurate one. It is a film that many people aught to see, but not all of them will like. I believe that the story of Jackie Robinson deserved a bit more dramatic momentum and a bit less sentimentality than Brian Helgelands bio pic provides. This is a medium good film, that should have been a great one."
"GManfred","Null","8","13","2 August 2013"," Bland TV Movie
","It wasn't a TV movie, as it was in theaters for a time, but that's essentially what ""42"" is, a movie made for TV. With only one recognizable star (Harrison Ford, excellent as Branch Rickey) and a bunch of no-names in support, it is remarkable it has as high a rating as it does. Or maybe not so remarkable, given American audiences renowned tolerance for mediocrity.<br/><br/>In any case, ""42"" breaks no new ground and retells a story which is already out there. There are some racial insults, depictions of black/ white segregation policies and the challenges a black man with great courage will face. It is episodic and contains no emotional highs or lows, given the familiarity of the story and the tenor of the direction. Chadwick Boseman, who plays Jackie Robinson is tall and gangly, whereas Robinson had a stockier build, and missing was Robinson's peculiar pigeon-toed gait. It also contains innocuous background music - and I don't mean the great 40's songs played throughout the picture.<br/><br/>You may like it if are under the age of 30 or are an undiscriminating moviegoer (no pun intended)."
"NoodleMaster","5","14","26","23 April 2013"," A two-hour cheesy experience that turns into a giant Cheese Cake
","I've been a movie-goer since I was a tiny baby, and I honestly believe that this is the cheesiest cheese ball of a movie that I have ever seen in my entire movie-going life. The cheesiness starts right at the very beginning, with Harrison Ford (as Branch Rickey) saying something like this: ""I'm old, and I'm bored, so I'm gonna do something different. Fellows, I'm gonna bring a Negro to baseball!"", followed by an overly-shocked co-worker's line ""Sorry sir, but HAVE YOU LOST YOUR FREAKIN MIND?!"".<br/><br/>The crowd laughs, and from then on, this cheese-ball of a movie rolls and rolls and turns into this gigantic goo of organic mozzarella cheese cake. <br/><br/>There are two things that ""42"" tries extremely hard to do. The first is to be ""just another sports movie"", and the second is to make the audience recognize the nowhere near subtle message of ""PEOPLE WERE SO RACIST BACK THEN! LOOK AT ALL THIS RACISM! OH GOD THAT WAS SO RACIST!"", and oh my lord does it nail BOTH very well. <br/><br/>I'm not sure if screenplay writer Brian Helgeland took his script and dipped it in a giant pot of organic cheese, or if he, instead, decided to empty a 600 Litre bottle of cheese syrup on his script. Either way, ""42"" ends up being an uninspired, clichéd, formulaic, and predictable biopic. In fact, it is clichéd and cheesy to a laughable degree. Everything from the dialogue, the one liners, the ""inspirational"" music that sometimes starts a minute or two before the actual ""inspirational"" speech, it's all there. <br/><br/>""42"" never loses its ""TV movie"" feel. While ""Field of Dreams"" was a classic baseball movie, ""42"" is the equivalent of an over-budget exclusive one-time NBC showing that unfortunately got the 6am time-slot. <br/><br/>The movie is even more disappointing when you take into account the exceptional performances and cinematography. The talent is definitely there, but the execution falls short. <br/><br/>It never tries to be something more than ""another sports movie"". There is so much focus on the message, ""LOOK AT ALL THIS RACISM!"" and the LEGEND of Jackie Robinson, and not enough of on Jackie Robinson himself. A grittier approach may have been preferable (which is actually what the trailer showed), but instead we got a forgettable sports movie with a writer that was stuck in the 80s. <br/><br/>The end result is a movie that rolls done a 500 mile cheesy hill that turns into one, clichéd, uninspired, formulaic, enormously over-sized two hour movie that swims across a 50 yard organic cheese cake factory and rolls right out, turning into a giant cheese cake served on a fake silver platter."

","I have got to admit, I went into this movie with very high hopes. Having done well at the Box Office, and with myself being a real sucker for a good Sports flick, I was more than excited to give this movie a watch. <br/><br/>Having just finished watching it, I must say that I am severely disappointed in the films final product. Now don't get me wrong, there are plenty of positive aspects to this film- I think it was excellently made, had spectacular Cinematography (if you get a chance to see it in BluRay instead of DVD, I would highly recommend it), and had put together a very solid Cast of Actors. However, where this film falls short is in its Depth, both in characters and story. <br/><br/>With such a dramatic topic at its disposal, the movie seldom dives deeper than the kiddy pool. Instead of a hard-hitting look at all the extremely powerful, emotional, and impactful events that surrounded Jackie Robinson, the Brooklyn Dodgers and MLB as a whole, we are given a PG ""everything is roses in the end"" cream puff of a movie. Powerful moments seldom occur and character depth is severely lacking. With a story that had SOO MUCH potential going into it, it's truly disappointing to see the end product, so devoid of impact. <br/><br/>Overall it's a decent movie about a phenomenal story, but unfortunately it's shortcomings far outweigh its breakthroughs."
"rddj05","5","7","11","26 May 2014"," Competent Storytelling, But Safe, Cliché, and Predictable
","I suppose this film would be somewhat interesting to view for anyone who is completely unaware of the Jackie Robinson story. Aside from maybe 1 or 2 scenes, this safe and predictable film could easily be shown to grade-school kids. <br/><br/>Antiseptic and color-by-numbers, in just about every way (again, except for 1 or 2 scenes). The writing is sometimes groan-worthy, and no cliché is left unturned, including slow-motion running of the bases after home runs and a saccharine, syrupy-sweet shots of Mr. Robinson and his wife. Every scene is played and shot almost exactly how you would expect (but hoped not), and most of it seems to take place on a carefully constructed movie set. Basically it's pretty much a Disney version of The Jackie Robinson story. But it gets the story across. <br/><br/>Mr. Helgeland Oscar-Award winning screenwriter and obviously very talented, but screen writing and directing are different skills. I must admit that I kept wondering what a more skilled and inventive director like Spike Lee would've done with a story like this."
"zkonedog","8","2","2","5 March 2017"," A Much-Needed Modern Update On A Historic Sporting/Cultural Event
","Though perhaps seeming preposterous to baseball fans, sports fans, or just cultural historians in general, there are many younger people alive today who do not know the incredible story of Jackie Robinson. Despite the fact that such an inspirational tale SHOULD be known and loved by all, part of the reason for the disparity is because the last mainstream-media version of the story was produced in 1950...just three years after Jackie broke the color barrier and starring Mr. Robinson as himself! Though a nice film in its own right, ""42"" truly captures the poignancy of the story using Hollywood drama.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""42"" recounts how Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman), with the help of Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford), broke Major League Baseball's color barrier in 1947 with the Brooklyn Dodgers. Along the way viewers are introduced to other key players in the Robinson saga including wife Rachel (Nicole Beharie), manager Leo Durocher (Christopher Meloni), and fellow teammates like Pee Wee Reese (Lucas Black) and Dixie Walker (Ryan Merriman).<br/><br/>In terms of telling the basics about the Jackie Robinson story, ""42"" is a superb rendition. All of the important events are touched upon and in their proper places, while even the little details (like what the old-time stadiums looked like) are replicated. You'll feel like you are truly back in late 1940's America, warts and all.<br/><br/>What truly makes this film stand out, though, is the acting from pretty much all the main characters. Ford especially shines with his spot-on Rickey, while Boseman embodies the courage, grace, and often torment that Robinson perpetuated on a day-to-day basis. On one occasion, Alan Tudyk (playing a particularly galling opposing manager) shines in his portrayal of the kind of racism that was hurled at Jackie from ballpark to ballpark.<br/><br/>The only reason I can't give this film a full five stars? Simplicity. This is very much a ""by the basics"" type of movie and thus if (like me) you already know the ins-and-outs of the Robinson story, it won't have you thinking about anything new or touch any emotions that you haven't already felt. This is very much a film for those you know nothing about Robinson.<br/><br/>Overall, though, ""42"" is an excellent choice of film-making if only because it revives a subject in desperate need of a face-lift. The experience can be enjoyed by the entire family (children all the way on up) and pretty much every segment of the population. I am glad that it was made."

","Generally excellent movie with very good jobs done by all except Ford, whom I believed a little mis-cast, one performance will be lost on most - John C. McGinley's Red Barber was astonishingly spot-on. It was a masterful performance by a veteran actor but Red Barber wasn't the ""BACK - BACK - BACK - WAYYYYY BACK!!!!"" sort of announcer. He calmly described the scene and only occasionally raised his voice. He was the master of the play-by-play and nobody has done as well since. McGinley perfectly caught his style and tone. Unfortunately it's a performance only a few old-timers will recognize and thus appreciate. Too bad. But if nobody else says it John, fabulous job! Red would be happy."
"hazysistersunshine33","7","2","2","14 July 2014"," Pretty good bio-pic with an important message
","This movie, in a nutshell is about Jackie Robinson, the first black man to play pro Baseball. I don't know too much about baseball history, but it looks like he was amazing at the sport and especially base stealing. He played for the Brooklyn Dodgers and his number was 42, henceforth the name. This seems like a pretty straight forward bio-pic, with some intense scenes of racism. I actually thought there would be more racism. It seemed like it may have been toned down a bit for ratings. Still, some scenes were pretty uncomfortable to watch. I know it's important to know this history, but it's difficult to watch. Seeing people being treated inhumanly brings out a lot of emotions. Chadwick Boseman was excellent it and I'm looking forward to seeing him in The James Brown movie. I'm also not a big fan of sports movies. I would rather be watching a real game where you really don't know what's going to happen, but the game scenes were actually pretty exciting. Harrison Ford's performance was interesting. I couldn't tell if the acting seemed calculated because his character was aware of the history he was making or if the actor was going for an Oscar. All in all, I enjoyed it, better than I thought I would actually."

","When I heard they were making the Jackie Robinson story I was sure it was going to gloss over the glory and concentrate on the ugly. But I was wrong. It treats every aspect of Robinson's story with respect and it rings true. Robinson broke the colour barrier at the behest of Dodgers manager Branch Rickey. His reason was to end racism in baseball and to find that one player who would give them the world series. Rickey was ahead of his time. and Jackie Robinson was a man at the right place at the right time. Robinson fought back by not fighting back. and in turn he influenced a whole generation of people and made them question their own beliefs. A Victory in itself. Harrison Ford is the show stopper his Branch Rickey is so good It's a shame he wasn't nominated for an Oscar. Ford has rarely been better. Lucas Black as Pee Wee Reese. is outstanding Black is a actor one rarely thinks about. Yet he can do the job. Here he does so effortlessly I will make a attempt to remember his name and check out more of his movies. 42 isn't a feel good movie. It's a honest attempt to tell the truth and it succeeds.

","This is the type of film that struggles to have resonance with anyone but Americans. Personally, I've only heard of the name and I knew he was a baseball player, I'd no idea what he'd done. Fortunately, 42 is a film so unpretentious that its American celebration works universally. While it does have that soppy cinematic style with overdone colour grading that started with Forrest Gump and has been misused ever since, it's rarely sentimental and never melodramatic. There's great scenes where there's been room for the actors to actually act rather than be props to make a political point. Granted, it still makes political points, but it feels more true to the characters and story. However, most of the drama occurs around the protagonist as he is relatively passive and it results in too many characters pushed aside. The film is full of charm though. Harrison Ford is particularly good, it's great to see him disappear into a character rather than play himself. I may not have learned much besides the significance of Jackie Robinson to baseball, but it certainly was entertaining when it could've gone so wrong. Very well-handled film.<br/><br/>7/10"
"sddavis63","7","2","2","19 July 2013"," Breaking The Colour Barrier
","I've sometimes said that while baseball is not my favourite sport, it is the closest thing there is in sports to a spiritual experience. It's gentle and comfortable and then all of a sudden it briefly bursts forth with periods of excitement. For the most part you could say that about this movie. It's a good movie. It's not full of excitement. It is, for much of the time, a rather sensitive portrayal of racism, how to combat racism, and - of course - of Jackie Robinson's struggle against racism as he makes his way to the major leagues.<br/><br/>As a baseball movie, this is very well done. There's an authenticity to the on-field action. It's all quite believable; none of it looks staged or acted. But it isn't a baseball movie, of course. It's a movie about racism, with baseball in the background.<br/><br/>I never saw Jackie Robinson play. He retired from baseball seven years before I was born. But, of course, I know a lot about his story. The movie seems an accurate (if somewhat tame, to be honest) portrayal of Robinson's experiences. My own impression, from what I've read, is that Robinson was treated much worse than what we see here - where the worst example of racism directed at him is the disgraceful conduct of Philadelphia Phillies manager Ben Chapman, who ruthlessly taunted Robinson with racist comments the first time the Phillies played the Dodgers - although that incident helped cement Robinson's place as part of the team. <br/><br/>Chadwick Boseman was excellent as Robinson, effectively portraying Robinson's attitude - bristling at the racism he had to endure but controlling himself at the request of Dodgers owner Branch Rickey, who told him that he didn't want a man with the guts to fight back, but rather a man with the guts not to fight back. Boseman's portrayal was very good, as was Harrison Ford's as Rickey.<br/><br/>There were a couple of decisions I might quibble with. There was no portrayal of Robinson's appearance in the 1947 World Series after the Dodgers won the pennant, although I suppose that would have been anti- climactic, since the Dodgers lost to the Yankees and Robinson didn't have a great series. There was also no portrayal at all of his time in Montreal with the Dodgers minor league affiliate, the Montreal Royals - although, again, that would have been anti-climactic, since Jackie's wife Rachel (played in the movie by Nicole Beharie) said years later that she had only good memories of Montreal, and that she and Jackie never had a problem in the time they lived there. So, I understand both of those omissions, but it still seemed to me to leave a gap.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd say this is a good movie - much like a good baseball game. It doesn't go into a great deal of depth about the story - much like Rickey advised Robinson, it's almost as if those who wrote the script and Brian Helgeland who directed it were keeping everything in check. A lot of it is pretty slow moving and not especially exciting, but there's enough interesting things in it to make you appreciate having watched it. (7/10)"

","This was a strange week to watch '42' for the first time - the week of the demonstrations and riots after the Zimmerman/Martin verdict. Just when we think we have a handle on racism, complete with a Black President etc, the ghosts of the past deny being forgotten. This film hopefully, now on television, will put things back into perspective if just enough people watch. Brian Helgeland wrote and directed a solid hit with a fine cast, but this is a painful film to watch on the one hand, and a celebration of one of the first cracks in the racism veneer of this country.<br/><br/>Briefly the story can be summarized as follows: 'In 1946, Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) is a Negro League baseball player who never takes racism lying down. Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford) is a Major League team executive with a bold idea. To that end, Rickey recruits Robinson to break the unspoken color line as the first modern African American Major League player. As both anticipate, this proves a major challenge for Robinson and his family as they endure unrelenting racist hostility on and off the field, from player and fan alike. As Jackie struggles against his nature to endure such abuse without complaint, he finds allies and hope where he least expects it.'<br/><br/>The supporting cast is strong: the beautiful Nicole Beharie as Rachel Robinson, Christopher Meloni as Leo Durocher, Andre Holland as Wendall Smith, and Ryan Merriman, Lucas Black , Alan Tudyk, Hamish Linklater, Brad Beyer, James Pickens Jr. and on and on. At times the direction is lax and the story seems to be sidetracked, but it is the powerful performance of Chadwick Boseman that keeps the spirit of the story vital. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"

","This movie, though we associate the number 42 of Jackie Robinson's Dodgers' uniform with baseball, is a film about far more than baseball; in fact it has not that much to do with the game as it does with the character of the man himself, as well as another man, Branch Rickey, and the truly important mark these two men made on American history.<br/><br/>I shudder to think what would have happen, how longer things would taken to change the course of civil rights and integration in the U.S. if someone with a lesser character and strength had been the one chosen by Rickey, or any other professional sport league owner.<br/><br/>The movie will once again depict the ugly state of relations and of racism in the years the preceded his final acceptance by the fans. If some still feel the time of shame has past, think again; it should for generations to come be a reminder that we should not forget from how far we have come and perhaps how further we have to go to be civilized.<br/><br/>The movie is well done; it takes you in the corridors of the game's business side and into the life of a player like no other. I don't believe any scene has been overdone or overplayed. Brian Helgeland has done a superb job with the writing of the script and it's delivery onto the screen, as he directed it. Everyone's performance was, I think, inspired and it shows.

","The Second World War over and the professional baseball players were coming back home to play but a new war was about to begin that at the time no one expected. The war to brake the color barrier in baseball that's been in effect for at least the last 50 years. And it was returning US Army veteran Let. Jackie Roosevelt Robinson, Chadwick Boseman, who was the person chosen by Brooklyn Dodger owner Branch ""Rick-a-Dink"" Rickey, Harrison Ford,to do it! <br/><br/>Rickey who although was a part, as a player manager and owner, of the segregated baseball's Major Leagues for some 40 years was deep down inside a true not phony liberal at heart and always wanted to tap the reservoir of fine black baseball players from the then Negro league and bring them into the majors. Now in late 1945 it now seemed the right time for Rickey to do it. And the person he chose was 26 year old Negro League's Kansas City Monarch infielder Jackie Robinson. As history was soon to prove Rickey couldn't have been more right in whom he choose.<br/><br/>Jackie given a chance to play for the Brooklyn Dodgers' top minor league club the Montreal Royals in 1946 tore up the league winning the batting title with a .344 average and it's MVP, Most Valuable Player, award. What was even far more of an accomplishment for Jackie is that he was able to withstand all the racial slurs as well as threats to him and his wife Rachal, Nicole Beharie, and family members to achieve that feat. At first not at all that sure to be on the 1947 Dodger roster Jackie did in fact make it, he ended up batting over .600 in spring training, an on baseballs opening day of that year April 15 Jackie stepped up to the plate against the Boston Barves and history was made: The color barrier in Baseball was not only broken that day but forever after.<br/><br/>The film ""42"" depicts the 1947 Brooklyn Dodger season with Jackie Robinson not only trying to win the National League Pennant for his team those ""Loveable Bums"" the Brooklyn Dogeres but also win over his teammates who, with many of them from the south, not all that eager to be on the same baseball field, much less team, together with him. As for the Dodgers' opponents it was the Philadelphia Phillies managed by the ex-Brooklyn Dodger infielder Ben Chapman, Alan Tudyk, who gave Jackie most of his troubles with his racial heckling and even at times tried to have Jackie criminally assault, in front of thousands witnesses or fans, him by having his teams pitchers throwing at Jackie's skull! That before the introduction of batting helmets in professional baseball.<br/><br/>It took far more courage on Jackie's part to keep his cool and not take matters into his own hands then batter those, who both mentally and physically abused him, over their heads with a baseball bat. Which in one case in the film he broke against the clubhouse wall.Jackie, who was named rookie of the year in 1947, did together with his team the Brooklyn Dodgers bring the National League pennant to Brooklyn in 1947 beating out the previous pennant winners the Saint Louis Cardinals. But far more then that Jackie proved Branch Rickey's experiment of bringing black and later Latino ballplayers into the Major leagues to be not only be a total success but the right thing to do as well. <br/><br/>P.S ""42"" the title of the movie was the uniform number that Jackie Robinson wore during his entire 10 seasons as a Brooklyn Dodger; He wore uniform #9 as a Montreal Royal in 1946. Since 1997 the 50th anniversary of Jackie breaking the color barrier in baseball uniform #42 has the distinction of being the only number retired from all of professional baseball.Almost but not quite as big a feat as Jackie stepping up to the plate on that sunny April afternoon in Brooklyn's Ebbets Field and changing the course of professional baseball history forever."
"bkoganbing","9","2","2","21 April 2013"," It Happened In Brooklyn
","I was born on September 26, 1947 and at that time when I made my earthly debut in Brooklyn, the Dodgers had clinched the National League pennant that year. Just about the time that Branch Rickey's great experiment was concluded and America's national pastime was integrated. I grew up with the Brooklyn Dodgers and well remember how in 1958 they and the New York Giants moved to the West Coast. Jackie Robinson had retired at the end of the 1956 season so forever he was a Brooklyn Dodger.<br/><br/>The story behind 42 needs to be told to a new generation to appreciate what we in Brooklyn lived during those years. Jackie, Gil Hodges, Roy Campanella, Don Newcombe, Duke Snider, Carl Furillo, Pee Wee Reese, these were the best and some of the best players at their positions during their careers. Because Branch Rickey stepped up to the plate so to speak and led in the integration of baseball, the Brooklyn Dodgers dominated their league for the ten years after the breakthrough year of 1947. And the other teams that won pennants in those years the Braves and Giants were those that closely followed the Dodgers in signing that untapped pool of talent that were in the Negro Leagues.<br/><br/>Many years ago Denzel Washington played Jackie Robinson in a made for television film about his bad experiences in the US Army before all the action in this film took place. Denzel would have been perfect for this film had he been younger. However the relatively unknown Chadwick Boseman is both suggestive of Denzel Washington and truly steps into the character of Jackie Robinson who bore a lot more of a burden than the normal angst of a team sport athlete trying to see if he has the right stuff to play at the highest level of his chosen sport. <br/><br/>One thing I was glad to see in 42 was the emphasis on Rachel Robinson's character and her support of her husband. When Branch Rickey was looking for the right black athlete to be the great experiment he placed a great emphasis on character. A couple guys did not get to be the first because they led some playboy lives. Rickey worried and rightly so that those opposed to what he was doing wouldn't hesitate to dig up any kind of personal dirt on whomever he chose. Robinson was a deeply religious man and the story he and the former Rachel Isum is one of the great love stories of the last century. Nicole Beharie plays Rachel and by all accounts she also captured the character of the woman who is still alive and has made sure that his memory and achievements are not forgotten. 42 earns its highest commendation from me for making sure that Rachel is not relegated to the sidelines.<br/><br/>You will look in vain for a trace of Indiana Jones in Harrison Ford's portrayal of Branch Rickey. With a little bit of makeup Ford also becomes the character whom some called the Mahatma of baseball after another guy who was freeing his people. Rickey whose other major achievement in the sport was developing the farm system was as you see Ford on the screen. A man who was a Methodist lay minister he and Robinson bonded over the religious faith they shared. Rickey left Brooklyn in 1950 after a front office power play forced him out and gave control of the Dodgers to Walter O'Malley who was the one who moved them to Los Angeles after the 1957 season. Rickey signed on with Pittsburgh as their general manager and integrated a rather lack luster outfit. His work would start to bear fruit in the late Fifties after he had left the Pirates.<br/><br/>42, Robinson's uniform number was retired in all of baseball some years ago in tribute from one generation to a pioneer who made it possible for people like Willie Mays, Hank Aaron, Frank Robinson, Ernie Banks to enjoy the star careers they had in my childhood. We who grew up in Brooklyn and idolized the Dodgers are also custodians of a legacy as well. 42 is a film that should be seen and seen again by those who want to know what the post World War II civil rights struggle was all about.<br/><br/>And remember, it all happened in Brooklyn."

Didn't like the remark about Pittsburgh either as I am a Pittsburgh fan.) <br/><br/>Other than that, it is a great movie with great acting by Chadwick Boseman and Harrison Ford. Boseman could be the new Denzel Washington. He is just superb and has a great sense of humor. <br/><br/>I believe this movie will be an Oscar contender."
"KarlCicitto","10","3","4","25 April 2013"," So good it flies by. Get a sequel started.
","You know a movie is riveting when 2 hours flies by in what feels like 40 minutes. You know that the writer has excelled at making racism real when your film companion asks if it really happened the way you are seeing it, asking with genuine concern. The film is tight. The characters are well and quickly drawn. There is a nice and clear, fast moving narrative line that isn't damaged by a musical score that occasionally gets schmaltzy. This film should be required viewing for American History students, a.k.a, all of us. The film maker didn't slap a halo on Jackie Robinson, deify him, or portray him as a martyr. The story is told on a real and human level and you get the feeling that what you are seeing is what happened, that the relationships are close to what they may have really been. Before it has even finished one month of screenings, 42 may be in the discussion for best baseball movies ever, with Field of Dreams and the rest. The acting is wonderful. The fashion is a gas. Harrison Ford turns in a gem. Chadwick Boseman and Nicole Beharie honor Jackie and Rachel with pure performances. Andre Holland is totally believable as Wendell Smith. Alan Tudyk inspires great hatred as Ben Chapman. And the guy who plays Red Barber had the audience chuckling with the old announcer's unique way of calling the game. Don't miss this one, and bring the kids."

","Jackie Robinson is one of the most well known professional baseball players in the history of sport. Robinson's legacy is held in such high regard that his jersey number 42 is the only number retired by all 30 MLB clubs in honor of how much he changed the sport. He went through so much on field and off field pressure because he is the most notable African American player to try and succeed in a fully white league. The man who went through all of this racial resistance to perform in a league he almost instantly succeeded in deserves a film that would show how much he went through and how much resistance there was not only from the public but the white men he was playing against on the field. 42 does not achieve this goal because of one major flaw. The writers of the film take one thing for granted that is a fatal flaw, they made a movie assuming from the start the he was a legend and took for granted that he was just a guy who became a legend in our minds now.<br/><br/>42 stars Chadwick Boseman as Jackie which is an interesting decision because of how little fame he has had before this film. Casting an unknown actor gives the sense that the audience is able accept this man as Robinson rather than an actor who is already a big deal. Boseman delivers a performance as well as he can, but there are not many people on the planet who could have been cast in this film and not crumbled under the pressure of being a legend. Before the film starts it decides to make a film about a baseball player playing in the Negro Leagues who was almost destined to be the man who broke through the barrier and was able to become a Hall of Famer. This choice hurts the film by not showing the audience why it was Robinson that was chosen by the Brooklyn Dodgers Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford) to hold this burden on his shoulders. The writers take for granted this choice and do not show any alternate disagreement or confusion on which Negro League player to make this transformation come true. Throughout the run-time the film jumps through weeks and months whenever it fits to move the story along and to keep the legend growing. This not only hurts the story as a whole, it at times ruins some of the great performances that do pop up in the film.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford as Rickey does give a surprisingly honest performance which has not happened recently in his career. Though the writers do not let him be a completely well rounded or smart character, rather making it seem like he picks Robinson because that is the obvious choice, Ford brings some emotional and passionate moments to the screen that do work very well. On the other hand the way Alan Tudyk's character throws out the racial slurs every minute is surprising for a PG-13 film. Though it is probably hard to watch for a 2013 audience who is much more experienced in a culturally diverse world, the film actually could have used some more grit and racial circumstances showing how rough this long baseball season was for Robinson, his wife (Nicole Beharie) and all the African American supporters during this time.<br/><br/>For anyone who has never heard of Jackie Robinson or this story, 42 might be worth while for some. In that sense a child probably will get more out of this film than any knowledgeable adult, especially one who is a baseball fan or is familiar with Robinson's story. For the most part the film has good intentions to show this story to a 2013 audience and promote his story. Otherwise if your are looking for a more honest to life or complete story of this man you won't find it here. There is still room for someone in the future to make a solid film out of this story, and for a man who helped transform Major League Baseball into a professional sport who is full of players from all around the world that is something his legacy deserves."
"howard.schumann","8","4","6","28 April 2013"," Entertaining, but falls short of transferring Robinson's greatness to the screen
","Growing up in Manhattan meant that Brooklyn, for me, was on the wrong side of the tracks and I never went to Ebbets Field to see the Brooklyn Dodgers play baseball. I can never forget, however, listening to the old redhead, Red Barber, sitting in his catbird seat, marveling at the talent of the first African-American player to break baseball's ""gentleman's agreement"" and play in the major leagues. Robinson could do it all - hit, run, field, and generate the kind of enthusiasm that is so rare in today's game. His achievement paved the way for other baseball greats such as Don Newcombe, Roy Campanella, and Willie Mays.<br/><br/>Robinson, who spent his entire major league career (1947 to 1956) with the Dodgers, was voted Rookie of the Year in 1947, Most Valuable Player in 1949 with a .342 batting average, and was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1962. How Robinson faced and overcame the obstacles to success is dramatized in the film, 42 written and directed by Brian Helgeland. While the film is mostly accurate and captures the truth of racism in baseball during the years 1945, 46, and 47, it is cliché-ridden and falls short of transferring Robinson's greatness to the screen.<br/><br/>Played by the excellent Chadwick Boseman, Robinson signed with the Dodgers organization after a search of ""suitable"" black players by team President and General Manager Branch Rickey. Though Rickey is portrayed as more of a saint rather than a business executive, he was indeed instrumental in breaking baseball's color barrier. The film begins in 1945 when Rickey, in one of the best performances by Harrison Ford in many years, tells his staff of his determination to integrate baseball. When told that he will become an outcast, Rickey responds, ""So be it. New York is full of Negro baseball fans. Dollars are not black and white, they're green - every dollar is green."" Overlooking some of the older, more established players in the Negro League like Satchel Paige, Rickey signs Robinson from the Kansas City Monarchs (without compensation to the team) to tryout in Spring Training in Florida. Robinson appeals to Rickey because he had excelled in four sports at UCLA, had been an officer in the army, and had played with whites. He was also hitting .350 for the Monarchs. The film describes the racially-motivated abuse the young ballplayer and his new wife Rachel (Nicole Beharie) faces during his first spring training in Florida. Aside from Rickey, his main source of support is black sports writer Wendell Smith (Andre Holland) who, not surprisingly, is not allowed in the press box but has to sit in the stands with a typewriter on his lap.<br/><br/>Having survived spring training (the next year it was moved to Panama), Robinson signs with the Montreal Royals and has an outstanding rookie season. Rickey tells Jackie that if he wants to play for the Dodgers, however, he will have to turn the other cheek and endure racial taunts without responding. When Robinson asks him if he wants someone without the guts to fight back, Rickey tells him ""I want someone who has the guts not to fight back."" Soon after joining the Dodgers in 1947, he is subjected to racial slurs not only from the other team, but from his own teammates as well.<br/><br/>Many on the team sign a petition refusing to play if Robinson is on the team, but with Rickey's guidance, manager Leo Durocher (Christopher Meloni) tells them in no uncertain terms that either Robinson will play on the team or they won't. ""I don't care if he is yellow or black, or has stripes like a zebra,"" he says. ""If Robinson can help us win and everything I have seen says yes he can, then he is going to play on this ball club."" On opening day at Ebbets field before a large crowd, half of whom were black, Robinson became the first African-American to play in the major leagues since the 1880s.<br/><br/>One of the dramatic highlights of the film is Robinson's barely restrained stoicism in the face of the nonstop slurs delivered by Phillies Manager Ben Chapman using the word ""nigger"" probably more than any other time in the history of cinema (I haven't seen Django Unchained). Also moving is Brooklyn shortstop Pee Wee Reese's public show of support for Jackie by embracing him on the field, a key moment commemorated in a bronze sculpture in Coney Island, Brooklyn. In spite of its shortcomings, 42 is an engaging and highly entertaining sports movie.<br/><br/>Though it largely ignores the fact that the integration of baseball was part of a larger political movement in which progressive unions, civil rights organizations, activists, and other protest groups fought for a decade to eliminate discrimination in housing, jobs, and other sectors of society as well as baseball, the film will help to introduce Jackie Robinson to a new generation. Even if you're not a baseball fan, you cannot help but respect his courage and determination and cheer for him to overcome the barriers placed in his path. Sadly, many of these barriers still remained when Robinson retired from baseball in 1956. No team offered him a position as a coach, manager, or executive."

","If you are a sports fan - a must see. <br/><br/>If you are a movie fan - a very worthwhile evening. <br/><br/>Interested in social issues - another essential. <br/><br/>It seemed a bit light on some drama relative to our modern day over-the-top entertainment world, but I think part of the motive here was to appeal to a wide variety of older movie goers who remember this era to some degree. This was not a bad thing. I do think that it was a different era and seemed to capture that well. So, I thought it did real justice to this and is a great film in large part because the Jackie Robinson story is the greatest story in American Sports history. One of the great stories in American history, period. <br/><br/>You can't walk out of this film without a tear in your eye and a deep, deep respect for the great Jackie Robinson. A story that really needs to continually be honored and re-told - so that all athletes and all people in our culture see this man of deep courage, integrity and grace. An incredible human being. <br/><br/>The film also introduces two young actors who've had some decent roles but this will really bring them into the mainstream: <br/><br/>Chadwick Boseman - who played Jackie. Great role - really seemed to capture the class of Robinson, I believe. <br/><br/>Nicole Beharie - did a fine job. And, she is incredibly beautiful. I mean a knockout! A 10 in the face and not far behind everywhere else. She will be a much more well known name from here on out. <br/><br/>I thought this may have been one of Harrison Ford's best acting roles ever because you didn't think, ""Hey, that's Harrison Ford doing his thing"" as he has so often in the Indiana Jones' series and other films (not a bad thing, mind you, he does well at it), but - instead - you thought, ""that's Branch Rickey."" The actor was lost inside the character. <br/><br/>I would not be surprised and would really love to see Ford get a best supporting Actor nod for this. <br/><br/>A film that really should be seen for the quality and for the story itself. A truly important and great story."
"Turfseer","5","7","13","4 May 2013"," Average biopic ably covers Robinson the legend, but not so much the man
","At what point does a film biography become a hagiography? Yes of course we know that it took tremendous courage to do what Jackie Robinson did. But no matter how hard writer/director Brian Helgeland tries, he ultimately falls into the pit of placing the legendary Mr. Robinson, on a pedestal that he can't get off.<br/><br/>Helgeland does well in introducing us to Jackie the legend but we never get a sense of who Robinson the man, really was. I'm not sure if it could really be done, but perhaps in the hands of a better writer, a lot more interesting facts about Jackie Robinson could have been revealed. I leave the digging up of those facts to those who are privy to the real behind-the-scenes look of Robinson's career and the interactions amongst the players and management of the Brooklyn Dodgers.<br/><br/>Still, Helgeland does touch upon the basic history of what Robinson had to put up with when he entered major league baseball. I found it particularly interesting the whole affair with Ben Chapman, who was perhaps one of the most virulent racists in baseball at that time. It was bad publicity from the press that actually got the front office of the Philadelphia Phillies to force Chapman to publicly act nice toward Robinson. Note that Robinson came up with the idea of taking a picture with Chapman while holding a bat (Robinson justifiably doesn't want to shake his hand because he knows Chapman doesn't really mean what he says—he's just doing it upon orders of his bosses).<br/><br/>Helgeland also has a number of other good scenes, particularly the one in which Robinson must suppress his rage after being taunted by Chapman, and is counseled by Branch Rickey not to let the racist manager, provoke him.<br/><br/>Historically, Robinson's struggle against racism is an epic battle, but dramatically it's difficult to illustrate, since there isn't one antagonist which Robinson must fight until an exciting climax at film's end. Instead, in documentary style, we're treated to a series of end credits, which are designed to explain why we should feel elevated by Robinson's achievement.<br/><br/>Chadwick Boseman does a fine job as Robinson but he's limited by a script that mainly focuses on Robinson's internal struggle to keep a lid on his own justified anger and raw emotions as well as illustrating some of his celebrated moves on the base paths. Robinson's relationship with Branch Rickey is perhaps the most fleshed out of Robinson's relationships with the people who he interacted with, during his life. Helgeland gives Nicole Behaire little to do as Rachel Robinson, Robinson's devoted wife, and one keeps wondering whether Helgeland could have done more with the part.<br/><br/>Bill Madden, the NY Daily News sports columnist, points out that the film is full of factual errors. For example, he argues that Leo Durocher was not suspended for his marital infidelities, but for gambling. He also asks how Robinson could have had a walk-off home run, in the opponent's home park? And the daughter of Pittsburgh Pirate pitcher, Fritz Ostermueller, maintains that her father never hit Robinson in the head with a pitch and that he merely was throwing a 'brush back' pitch. What's more she insisted that, ""My dad, to my knowledge, was not a racist,"" she told TMZ. ""I was not raised in that type of home."" How much research did Helgeland actually do for this film? He has Ralph Branca asking Robinson to join him in the shower and Branca insists that never happened. Sure, a writer can take dramatic license, but at least write something that seems mildly plausible.<br/><br/>If you want a basic history lesson about how Jackie Robinson became major league's baseball's first black ballplayer and if you're also interested in seeing a good performance by Harrison Ford as Branch Rickey, '42' is for you. But 'touching all the bases' does not make a great work of art. This is the film that needed to be a lot more subtle and it's nowhere near that.<br/><br/>Jackie Robinson's early demise must be seen as tragic since he was only 53 when diabetes and heart disease took his life. Maybe that fact also should have been mentioned in the film, a fact equally as important as all of Jackie Robinson's great achievements on and off the baseball field."

I was 11 or so, a white Jewish boy.<br/><br/>Recreation of reality? Branch used to wear a black hat I think but not black in the movie. Jackie had a hitch in his swing that Boseman caught. Jackie ran pigeon-toed which Boseman did not catch, far as I could tell. His taunting steal-and-head-back at third base was switched to first, a dramatic loss. The Reese arm around Jackie was as an inning ended but filmed as an inning began. The ""Oh doctor"" Al Gionfriddo catch was I think in a World Series not a playoff game shown. I wish the Red Barber segments were from original tapes but nice try. So some artistic license. But they did not distort or misrepresent facts<br/><br/>The vulgar taunts were less, I expect, than what Jackie really had to deal with.

"Justin765","4","5","10","28 June 2014"," Wasted Potential
","42 is the story of Jackie Robinson, the first African American to play in the MLB. 42 chronicles the intolerance exemplified towards African Americans in the nineteen forty's and the high level of resentment they faced by the National Baseball League. <br/><br/>Chadwick Boseman plays the lead role of Jackie Robinson and gives a worthy performance, although he does stubble in some of the more serious scenes. Harrison Ford also highlights this film as the general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers at the time, Branch Rickey. He is by far the standout of the film and delivers on the usual Ford talent; if you are able to maneuver past his raspy voice. <br/><br/>42 is written by Brian Helgeland, who wrote the screenplay for L.A. Confidential, but his talent, however does not translate very well over to this film. To be frank, the screenplay is not good. It embodies the premise of mediocrity and exemplifies laziness and the inability to create serious dialogue. A few specs of light show through the seemingly unending cliché lines and useless and poorly written dialogue, but these few instance are not capable of saving the entire movie. Brian Helgeland also directed the film and provides a capable direction, although not memorable. <br/><br/>The biggest problem with 42 is that it is complete waste of its own potential. The film has actors who have proved their talent and a director/writer who has exemplified his own worth. The film ultimately fails because of its lazy and lackluster construction, which is a huge disappointment because it could have been so much more. 42 is not the great film that it should be and does not do justice to the American hero it tries to embody."
"Agrajag_HHG","Null","9","22","12 April 2013"," An Example Of The Worst Type Of Hollywood Reimagining
","The full review of this can be found on slashcomment:<br/><br/>Jackie Robinson's journey from the buses of Negro league baseball to becoming the first black player to play in the all-white Major Leagues is a story on much the same level as that of Neil Armstrong's one giant leap for mankind 22 years later. His is a story filled to the brim with challenges, intrigue, drama, thrills and — ironically — many shades of gray. It's a story that deserves an honest, in-depth analysis and celebration. 42 is not that story.<br/><br/>I would not have been at all surprised to learn that this disgrace found its way out of a time capsule from the early 1970′s. It brings back all the bad elements of what a Disney film of that era tried to pass off as entertainment. This is neither the 1970′s nor a Disney film. Every character's reduced to fundamental caricature magnifying stereotype upon stereotype. History rides in the back of the bus here. <br/><br/>The characters, as presented, are paper-thin. You know every line before it's spoken. At a key game one sunny afternoon Robinson's radiant wife suddenly turns and announces that she's oddly nauseous. I have little doubt the patrons in the next theater knew she was pregnant before she did.<br/><br/>The acting is fine but the casting is a mess. Harrison Ford embodies famed Dodgers owner Branch Rickey. He does a commendable job and it's almost hard to believe it's him but it's so unlike anything he's done before that you can't stop thinking, ""Wow, that's really Harrison Ford in there."" It's a distraction. The Jackie Robinson we experience is played admirably by TV vet Chadwick Boseman. Unfortunately his body type is entirely wrong and diminutive by comparison to the real man. Was that an oversight or just an over slight? Relative newcomer Nicole Beharie fares best of all as Jackie's wife Rachel but has to deal with the shackles of being asked to play a mannequin. Her real life counterpart was a wonderfully normal, down-to-earth woman with real relationship challenges. Here she's just the perfect angelic wife content to live forever without any needs of her own.<br/><br/>I knew this film was doomed the moment I read the early subtitle, ""Based on a true story"". Robinson's story requires no softening or dramatic plot embellishments and yet this script does so with a reckless abandon that's simply unfathomable. It is, dare I say, a complete whitewashing that comes off like a reinvention of events as told by a partially repentant bigot. I don't believe that was Helgeland's intention or perspective but I can't ignore the feelings."

You end up with a succession — a bit jerky — of interesting scenes but that don't form an enough convincing ensemble, which is very prejudicial considering the potential and power of the facts.

"lotus_chief","1","11","30","27 July 2013"," Another white-washed effort that was SUPPOSED to be about a African-American Legend.
","I expected disappointment with this film ever since I saw the trailer....I wasn't going to even bother with it because it was pretty easy to see the direction they were going in, and they didn't even try to mask it. It was plainly obvious that this was going to be more about the white people involved than the actual subject of the film, Jackie Robinson. He's essentially relegated to an extra in the movie. Hollywood couldn't even bring themselves to call the film 'The Jackie Robinson Story'. Actually, that may be a good thing?? because that would've been even MORE misleading.<br/><br/>One would be foolish to not realize that there had to be at least some whites who weren't so full of racist ideologies and bigotry to be willing to entertain the idea of a black man in major league baseball; the crime here is the notion that Jackie was merely a spectator throughout the whole experience. The filmmakers completely castrated the man whose story they're supposedly telling! They reduced him to a little (black) boy amongst (white) men. This movie's view is that Jackie Robinson had absolutely NOTHING to contribute to his legend and the game of baseball other than the color of his skin and ""superhuman"" ability. 'Superhuman'?? REALLY?? They really snuck that in there like people wouldn't realize! <br/><br/>I refuse to believe that Jackie Robinson was nothing more than a toothless, ever-willing black man with an anger problem who just happened to be picked by some quasi-sympathetic, money-hungry white man to make history. We see nothing of Jackie coming up, honing his skills..we get no insight into the MAN. He plays second fiddle to Harrison Ford's character.....whose REAL motivation was only to get the ""nigger-money"". Jackie could do nothing himself, his hand was held and he was patted on the back by the few 'good white folk' who really 'cared' about him. When he was down and out from all the badgering by the racist whites, ol' Harrison Ford comes to the rescue, gives him a pep talk, hugs him, pats him on the back and all is well. GIVE ME A DAMN BREAK!! I truly am sick and tired of the same old racist, half-assed attempts by Hollywood when it comes to Black stories....in the end it's ALWAYS about white people! I rather they just don't even bother trying to tell a Black story at ALL....hell it's not like they tried here? But what else is new in white-controlled Hollywood? <br/><br/>Watching ""42"" only made me respect Spike Lee even more for what he accomplished with ""Malcolm X"" back in '92. He stood up and made a BLACK film about a BLACK hero from the BLACK perspective, regardless of the setbacks and drama he received from the studio....resulting in his best work and one of the greatest films of the 20th century. This is the worst kind of film, COMPLETELY misleading and white-washed to oblivion. One of the worst, most insulting films I've ever seen. I expected to get what I got, I just had no idea HOW bad and bold it could be.....bold in that the didn't even TRY. They put NO EFFORT into telling JACKIE ROBINSON'S story. This movie is nothing more than a slap in the face and another stark reminder to Black People that if we want our stories told, only WE can tell them if we want it told right....or in the case of ""42"", even told at all!<br/><br/>ZERO out of 10."

My favorite line in the movie is when Jackie asks Rickey, ""you want a player who doesn't have the guts to fight back?"" and Rickey responds, ""No,no. I want a player who has the guts not to fight back."" as Rickey explains later, ""Echo a curse with a curse and, uh, they'll hear only yours. Follow a blow with a blow and they'll say, 'The Negro lost his temper.' That 'The Negro does not belong.' Your enemy will be out in force... and you cannot meet him on his own low ground."" During this time a black person could curse at a white person even if the white person started it. It became the black person's fault. When asked what Jackie will do if they throw at his head, his response is simple. ""I'll duck."" he never got angry on the field because of what people were saying about him. he screamed in the tunnel, but that doesn't count. So many black people were only allowed to play in a black only team against other black only teams. I'd seen the movie before watching it In my history through film class so I already knew what would happen. Stupid white people.

There is only one annoying scene, it is when they are playing the Phillies and their manager is very racist, it is just annoying to know that people were actually like that back then. All the other scenes in this movie were very good. I would definitely recommend this movie for other people to watch."

","""Maybe tomorrow, we'll all wear 42, so nobody could tell us apart.""<br/><br/>42 is a wonderful and inspiring sports movie based on the life of Jackie Robinson, the first colored baseball player to make it to the Major Leagues. It is really an inspirational film and a great story despite the fact that it follows pretty much the same clichés and formulas that most sport movies follow. It plays itself pretty safe but thanks to some great lead performances and an emotional story the film managed to draw me in, and I was emotionally involved from the very beginning. 42 kind of follows the same formula that Invictus and Remember the Titans did mixing sports with racism, and they are all based on true stories which remind us of the importance that sports have in society and how they can help break barriers. 42 was directed by Academy Award winner Brian Helgeland who adapted the screenplay for LA Confidential and Mystic River. Helgeland has proved to be a better screenwriter than a director, but I think he did a great job with this movie and has seemed to mature as a director. He also wrote the screenplay for this inspiring film. Despite not being a baseball fan, I do tend to love sports and really appreciated learning more about the life of this great baseball player. It is not as great as Moneyball, but it is still a wonderful movie.<br/><br/>42 takes place shortly after the Second World War as the troops are heading back home and things begin settling down. The athletes are back and all eyes are on the new baseball season that's about to start. Despite criticizing the German foreign government, racism is still very much a part of American life as colored people are forced to be segregated. There are only white players in the Major Leagues and the African Americans are forced to play on a separate Negro League. The Brooklyn Dodgers team executive, Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford), decides its time to shake things up a little and decides to contract Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman), the first African American to sign for the Major Leagues. It won't be easy for Jackie or Rickey as they both have to face opposition and threats from the racist society. Rickey warns Jackie about having to endure the abuse without complaining since the commissioners will be looking for any minor fault as an excuse to expel him from the majors. Jackie finds the fortitude in his wife Rachel (Nicole Beharie) and the rest of the African American community who have their eyes on him. <br/><br/>Harrison Ford gives the best performance of the film, and probably his best performance in the last decade or two. He is great in this movie and fit the role perfectly. Boseman also played Jackie Robinson very well showing the internal conflict he was going through as he tried to keep calm despite all the abuse he was receiving. It was a quiet performance and he was probably out shined by Harrison Ford, but he was still great. Robinson's story is such an extraordinary one that it turns this ordinary film into a much greater one. Despite following pretty much all the general sport genre conventions and clichés it still manages to draw the viewer in because of the great story. Robinson's life was worth telling and that is what makes this film special. There is much more in stake here than simply a game, and once again we see how sports influenced the cultural views of the time. This was a very emotional and inspirational sports drama with some thrilling moments. It's worth your time and money."
"jmoney-2","9","2","3","18 April 2013"," An Important History Lesson
","The historical sports drama, 42, transports the viewer back in time to a different America: An America where discrimination is an accepted fact of life; an America where blacks and whites in the South are forced to use separate bathrooms; an America where a baseball manager could be suspended for sleeping with a Hollywood starlet; an America where 96 wins isn't enough to get a team into the MLB postseason (!). It's the age of Jackie Robinson – the man who changed America's Pastime and changed American attitudes about race.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford plays Branch Rickey, the Brooklyn Dodgers' General Manager who made the bold decision to bring an African American into the Major Leagues in 1947. Ford is tremendous. It's a rare treat to watch one of Hollywood's most famous leading men disappear into a character. At first, it seems odd to see Ford playing an old curmudgeon. But then one comes to the astonishing realization that Ford (at age 70) is actually a few years older than Rickey was when he brought Robinson to Brooklyn. In the movie, Rickey professes that his motives are financial – the Dodgers have lots of African American fans that would pay to see Robinson play. He claims the only color he cares about is green. Ford's commanding and ultimately moving portrayal, however, hints at more decent and high-minded desires driving Rickey's decision. The Academy might as well start engraving Ford's name onto the Best Supporting Actor Oscar. This is his finest performance since The Mosquito Coast.<br/><br/>Little-known actor Chadwick Boseman brings all the necessary elements to the role of Robinson. He looks like a ballplayer and is totally convincing in the baseball scenes. But he also effectively conveys the emotional turmoil inside a man forced to endure racially charged taunts and other various indignities due to the color of his skin. He shows the grace and class with which Robinson handled the onslaught. It took true courage to not fight back. It showed true character to turn the other cheek. One wonders what would have happened had Robinson not taken the high road – or hadn't been such a remarkable ballplayer. Jackie Robinson's success was an important step toward racial equality in the U.S. How much slower would progress have been if he hadn't come along? The rest of the cast consists mainly of TV actors, most notably Christopher Meloni as Leo Durocher, the fiery manager who quashes his players' objections to Robinson's inclusion on the team. The actors mostly look like athletes (1940s athletes anyway) and baseball action has a more realistic look and feel than most baseball films. Computer graphics are also effectively used to recreate long-since-demolished ballparks like Ebbets Field and the Polo Grounds in exact detail.<br/><br/>The script by writer/director Brian Helgeland is straightforward, but unlike most sports movies, there's no ""big game"" at the end. Real life provided no such drama (the 1947 Dodgers lost the Fall Classic to the Yankees). So, Helgeland manufactures a climax by staging a fourth inning at-bat in a mid-September game as if it's the seventh game of the World Series. It's a bit of a cheat, but it works.<br/><br/>Helgeland avoids sanitizing the racial vitriol hurled at Robinson. He plainly shows the ignorance and prejudice that was openly expressed – most infamously by Phillies' manager Ben Chapman. (Philadelphia fans won't find much to be proud of in the movie. Going in, I knew the ugly part the City of Brotherly Love played in Robinson's story, but that doesn't make it any easier to watch. The Phillies were the last National League team to integrate – this movie shows why that was likely the case.) At the same time, the filmmakers present a movie that most families will still find acceptable for young fans that don't know Robinson's story or his significance in American history. You hear lots of n-words, but not nearly as many as your average Tarantino film. And each character that uses them is sternly chastised on screen. (Aside from those scattered slurs, there isn't much that most parents would find objectionable.)"
"StevePulaski","8","2","3","13 April 2013"," Inspiration in a bleak world
","42 is roughly the third baseball movie in the last three years that smartly focuses its storyline on the more interesting element at hand here, and leaves the game of baseball as a backdrop. That element is, of course, the human aspect of the story rather than the game, which I've seen enough of in films to publish an amateur baseball novel. With films like Moneyball and Trouble With the Curve furthering story and characters, the baseball genre in cinema has greatly expanded its horizons from forgettable affairs like The Babe and The Sandlot.<br/><br/>This is the much-needed biopic of Jackie Robinson, the legendary Brooklyn Dodgers baseman who became recognized as the first black man to play in what was known as ""white man's baseball"" in the mid-1940's. Robinson, a controlled and intelligent soul, is played by Chadwick Boseman, a name I bet many would still question even with the films release. Boseman brings the kind of energy and spirit the role of Robinson needs. His character inhabits the mindset of complete subtleness, not overplaying or undermining the charisma and personality Robinson was known to convey. The film follows his humble beginnings in third-rate ""black leagues,"" his marriage to Rachel, his stint with the Dodgers' minor league affiliate the Montreal Royals, and finally, his career with the Dodgers that sparked nationwide controversy and uproar from the public and the opposing team members as well. There's something tragically disheartening and frustrating to see half the stadium cheer and celebrate Robinson's victories, while the other half is condemning him for nothing more than his skin color.<br/><br/>Yet such ignorance and hatred was prominent in America at the time, and director Brian Helgeland doesn't shy away from the ugliness. A scene later in the film shows a father and son discussing the game of baseball in a calm manner until Robinson takes the field. The father begins shouting slurs that would've gave Django the chills and continues to do so when his son - no older than eleven - chimes in and brings the hate in. Helgeland's focus of how racism spreads and feeds, while quiet and relatively unnoticeable, reminds me of how John Singleton's Rosewood portrayed how racism is passed on through generations through the voices of authoritative figures to be intercepted by their young sons.<br/><br/>Moreover, supporting performances are mostly competent and compelling, with the most convincing being Harrison Ford's Branch Rickey, the Brooklyn Dodgers executive. Another sure to go under the radar is Lucas Black, who looks a tad like a younger Anthony Edwards. Black starred in the ho-hum Seven Days in Utopia about two years ago, assuming a likable state but not working much in the favor of a trite, contrived script. Here, Black is given a much wide range in a more interesting picture. He plays Pee Wee Reese, one of the few Dodger ballplayers that didn't object to Robinson's presence on the team solely because of his skin color. His character does something that sadly appears as a novelty back then and still somewhat does today; judges on character.<br/><br/>One of the supporting performances that seems sadly neglected is Nicole Beharie's, as Robinson's long-suffering wife, who must be vocally silenced, like her husband, in the face of discrimination and second-class citizen attitudes. Her struggle as a young mother trying to support her widely-loathed husband in the face of intolerance. Such a subplot could've but etched and drawn to fit germane to the hardships of Robinson, but the film decides to almost completely shortchange her story, even looking at their marriage as an insignificant footnote in his life.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint is the film's tonal personality, which is very bombastic and hits all the notes with a sort of jarring, bombastic attitude. To put it simply, you laugh when you're supposed to laugh, you may tear up when you should, and you are predictably enraged when the racism comes into play. 42 isn't subversive with your emotions, and doesn't allow you to have much of your own opinion or interpretation outside of what it's conveying, but yet it really doesn't need to. As welcomed as that would've been, when you watch a biopic on Jackie Robinson, or another cultural figure, you're sort of taking everything as it comes and you rarely form an opinion outside of what is being shown. If you approach the film with a willingness to indulge in the experience differently than others, this may be a tougher film to do that with. I almost wish that the Helgeland would've made the film more subtle and softer like its lead character.<br/><br/>And yet, 42 must be noted for its meticulous detail, right down to a steam locomotive in the background during one of the baseball games. The bright, scenic cinematography is another welcoming addition for such a story. While the tone may be a bit overblown and the heavy-handedness a bit too strong, it doesn't shortchange the film's impact as an inspirational piece of cinema. After all, sometimes that's why we go to the movies - in a bleak world, we need all the motivation we can get.<br/><br/>NOTE: My video review of 42, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdO4wFUalmI<br/><br/>Starring: Chadwick Boseman, Harrison Ford, Lucas Black, and Nicole Beharie.

","42 42 | Directed by Brian Hegleland | Chadwick Boseman, Harrison Ford<br/><br/>42 is a movie that takes us back into a time when you both feel shame and encouraged. ""I want a player who's got the guts not to fight back."" This is a line in the movie 42, which is said by Branch Rickey, who is played by Harrison Ford, which sets the whole mood of this motion picture, which takes a look at the first season Jackie Robison played in the Major Leagues. Jackie Robinson, played by Chadwick Boseman, was an African American who was the first player to cross the color line of a white only baseball. The movie uses many unique techniques to take a monumental moment and cram it into a 2 hour motion picture. The camera angles used so you could see every emotion of Jackie's face throughout his struggles really tells the story of how challenging it really was to take on the task of ""having guts not fight back."" The editor did an excellent job of cutting us from point A to point B, and focusing in on the highlights that really let you feel the emotions of Jackie Robinson. When you see the battle of what he endured you find it hard to not really invest in what he went through and almost find yourself pulling for that next big hit or stolen base. Branch Rickey's (Ford) character I think added a value to the film that was indispensable. His gusto and sometimes light heartedness helped pull Jackie through allot of the tough times. While the movie I felt could have touched on allot more topics and struggles of his life, I felt it did a good job of showing what the beginning was like. The quickest baseball season ever from the movies standpoint, but it leaves you wondering if 2 hours only captured a few games, then what was the whole season like. So while I felt shame watching this movie, seeing the level of hate that existed, I also feel encouragement that there are people out there like Jackie Robinson who can help us push through issues and change with any situation."

","42 is a movie about one of the most important stories in professional baseball, the breaking of the racial barrier with the first black baseball player. Chapman Bosemann is an incredible lookalike for Jackie Robinson, third baseman for the Brooklyn Dodgers, but his real strength is portraying the character of the man who sucked up his guts and persevered through the harassment, hate letters, and racial epithets that targeted him and aimed to break his spirit. We also get a view of his fellow team players who learnt to accept him and stand by him in his struggle. It was not unanimous. Some were reluctant; the great shortstop Pee Wee Reese, for example, who later became a great ally. <br/><br/>Owner Branch Rickey, a religious man and a man with a strong social conscience, made it clear that he wanted total cooperation or the players would be bounced from the team. Rickey is played by actor Harrison Ford, who was so well made up to look like Rickey that it never struck me who really was the man under the mop of hair, professorial spectacles, bow tie and three piece suit. Christopher Meloni plays coach Leo Durocher, a man of steel who was relieved when Rickey assured him, that Robinson was not a nice guy. ""Nice guys finish last"", he said, repeating his now famous line. I heard about the difficulties Robinson had to face in his mission to be ""the first black man in baseball.""

","It's not a prerequisite to enjoy and understand baseball to appreciate 42, but it probably helps.<br/><br/>The latest offering from writer/director Brian Helgeland, the scribe behind Green Zone and the man in the chair for A Knight's Tale, has a smattering of sufficient ingredients to guarantee it becomes a reasonably popular, moderate hit without being striking enough to make it a spectacular blockbuster. Dealing with racism and class prejudice, a good-triumphs-over-evil element and the feel-good factor of an underdog story, 42 will satisfy most viewers and adequately fill a couple of hours without knocking your day out of kilter.<br/><br/>42 is based on the true story of Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) who, in 1946, became the first African American to play major league baseball when he was recruited by club president and GM of the Brooklyn Dodgers, Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford), and wore, unsurprisingly, the number 42 shirt. It was a remarkable moment in sporting history, a great day for humanity and requires little imagination to see the filmic potential. In terms of cinematic 'beating the odds' films, it ranks above last year's Red Tails, but it doesn't quite have the impact of, say, The Power of One and certainly falls short of the emotional tugging that The Blind Side enjoyed.<br/><br/>But sometimes an 'easy', feel-good tale of moral victories and minor tension is exactly what is required and 42 works perfectly if you're not hoping for Oscar bait.<br/><br/>Central to the film is Boseman, a TV actor (Persons Unknown, Lincoln Heights) who is finding some success on the big screen (Ivan Reitman's Draft Day, with Kevin Costner, and James Brown biopic, Get On Up, are both in post-production). He gives a temperate performance as the feisty sportsman who refuses to be beaten by prejudice but must sit out the fisticuff fights to win the emotional, political war. Boseman has the charisma to carry the film but it is the supporting characters who add depth to 42.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford has entered a new chapter of his career with Rickey. Make-up and padding help, but Ford is in full flow as a baggy, gruff business man with a good heart and a moralistic view bound tightly with his need to make his business (the Dodgers) turn a profit. There is something of Albert Finney in his performance and his Rickey could be a close cousin of Erin Brockovich's Ed Masry. On the basis of this, Ford may just become this generation's Jason Robards. There's no great surprise in his performance but an evolution of the character he has played variations of for much of his career. It's a solid, fun performance that avoids becoming irascible in a Clint Eastwood way.<br/><br/>Yes, 42 is woolly at times and it lacks either impact or surprise, but it avoids becoming twee and is a thoroughly enjoyable film.

","42 was a pretty solid film about the life of Jackie Robinson. The film feels extremely polished, and the retro costumes mirrored the time period precisely, as did the baseball stadiums. They really pulled that off well in creating a retroactive atmosphere. They also told Jackie's story respectfully and accurately as they possibly could for the time period that they chose. I was always fascinated by Jackie Robinson. Even though I was born way after he sadly passed away, I loved what he did for the game. The emotional turmoil and all the tumultuous reactions Jackie garnered for himself was really hard to watch at points, even though I had a general idea of what he went through from reading about him. Life wasn't so simple in those days, and the tenacity and the courage that Jackie had to overcome all the racial hatred towards him just because he sported a different skin color than others is not only inspirational, but admirable. He really changed the game of baseball in so many ways. It wasn't so prejudiced anymore and it was looked at very differently all thanks to Jackie. The baseball action was also rather exciting stuff. Director& Writer Brian Hegland knows how to get your pulse rising. <br/><br/>On the downside of things, I didn't like how some things were underdeveloped, especially the character development. With a movie that is over two hours, you would think that wouldn't be an issue. Well it is.It covered the most important things about Jackie's early years, but it just felt a little rushed. Maybe making the movie a little longer would have actually helped in this case. Chadwick Boesman is certainly not a problem as Jackie. I enjoyed all the subtle nuances of his portrayal as Jackie whilst also having many of the things we liked about Jackie. It was an excellent show for the most part, and his breakdown scene after being heckled relentlessly by the unruly Ben Chapman (fantasticaly played by Alan Tudyk) was chilling. I felt for him. Harrison Ford is absolutely wonderful as Branch Rickey. As a huge Harrison Ford fan, I had forgotten how great of an actor he can be with his some of the duds he's been putting out. His scenes with Chadwick Boesman are joyous to watch. Nicole Beharie is solid as the wife, but she was way underdeveloped for my liking, and her character was rushed a lot of the time, but she did well. The rest of the cast does well, especially Lucas Black as Pee Wee Reese<br/><br/>Final Thoughts: I did have some issues with it, but I enjoyed it for the most part. It was a pretty entertaining biopic with many moving scenes. I don't know how baseball fans, or huge Jackie Robinson fans will feel about it, but I recommend it.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

","Though I'm not even a baseball person, I found ""42"" an utterly compelling and vividly realistic film. The level of empathy the audience attains with Robinson in all the adversity he faces is quite acute. Really fine acting by virtually all of the cast, but most particularly Chadwick Boseman as Robinson, Harrison Ford as the team owner with a most revolutionary idea, and Alan Tudyk as racist Phillies manager Ben Chapman. A fine and convincing script also helps to make this film the success that it is.<br/><br/>Still, the scope of the film has its limitations. ""42"" would have been enhanced by a more all-inclusive biography of Robinson in regard to his earlier life and service in WWII. While in high school and junior college, Robinson excelled at four different sports: Baseball, basketball, football, and track. Some revelation of why he sought to play in the then highly racist--even for that time--Major Leagues would have been a plus. Instead of simply having one of the characters tell us that, while serving as an army officer, he had been court-martialed for refusing to move to the back of a military bus, it would have been nice to actually SEE that happen via flashback. The directors let it be known that Robinson had a fiery temper. More illustration of this quality--and how/why he was forced to restrain it under circumstances that would have tried the most saintly patience--would have made ""42"" even better."

","Everyone knows that Jackie Robinson was the man who broke Major League Baseball's color barrier in 1947, but few know why he was the one that was chosen. Robinson wasn't the best black player out there, he wasn't even a superstar, what he was, was well educated and understood that people attacked him out of fear and ignorance. He never took it personally and knew fighting back would accomplish nothing, and against all odds, no matter what was thrown at him, Robinson was able to brush it off. In 42, he's portrayed by newcomer Chadwick Boseman, who wasn't just fantastic, but also gracious for the opportunity to portray a true American hero. I am a big Jackie Robinson fan and through everything I've seen, Boseman has given the most clear and accurate portrayal of the man to date. His co-star is Harrison Ford, playing the legendary Branch Ricky. Throughout his life, Ricky was outspoken against segregation and didn't just help in breaking baseball's color barrier, eight years later, he broke the Latino barrier as well. What I love about Harrison Ford is that he's so predictable, you know you will always get a tremendous performance out of him and that he will go to extreme lengths to be as real to the story as possible. This film was outstanding, from top to bottom, but my one knock on 42 is that it didn't go beyond the 1947 season. Robinson played for nine years after that and was a key member of the civil rights movement after baseball. I would have liked to have seen how in 1955, at age 36, he led the Dodgers to their only championship in Brooklyn, with an improbably steal of home against the Yankees. I also would have liked to have seen how he became the first black broadcaster, or how he marched with Dr. King in Washington. 42 is one of the clearest, most accurate depiction of two years in the life of Jackie Robinson, and while it was terrific, I would have like to have seen them take it a step further."

","Simply stated, this movie made me remember why I love baseball so very, very much.<br/><br/>I think they should make this a mandatory view for all of the current and up and coming players.<br/><br/>This was not only a baseball movie, it was the definition of courage, commitment and competitiveness.<br/><br/>Playing the game of baseball has been lost because of the financial opportunities.

","This wonderful piece of film truly is something more than just a story about baseball. 42 portrays the struggle of being a dark-skinned person in the post–World War II in the US, and it does so in a very convincing and touching manner. It shows how one man, just doing what he loves, stood up against thousands of others, showing them that he will not back down. He will not get scared, he will not break. He loves to play baseball and he will play baseball regardless of the color of his skin or what other people say. <br/><br/>I think the combination of a well-directed/well-written story by Brian Helgeland and an exceptional performance given by Chadwick Boseman is what makes 42 soar way past your average sports movie. It touched my soul and really made me question some things I take for granted in life. That is a very rare quality amongst movies which 42 possesses. <br/><br/>I give 42 a solid 9 out of 10. This is a film for everyone to be moved and inspired by."

","It's hard to make a movie about racism in the United States. This one works. I'd have to agree with what others have already said: I did not expect this movie to be as good as it was. Sure, the whole reason I walked into the theater was to be inspired. Thankfully, ""42"" did not disappoint. Everyone, from Harrison Ford to the least known among them, delivered high-quality performances. Chadwick Boseman as Jackie Robinson was a revelation. Nicole Beharie is one of the loveliest and most talented young actresses in Hollywood. ... But it's the story that really grabs you, the way the film transports you back to a time in the United States where an airport employee felt it was her God-given right to boot a black couple off an airplane to accommodate white passengers. Scenes like this hit you with a visceral force, and are shocking when you stop to think of all Robinson had to endure to do what he was really good at: baseball. But, then, that's the film's message. It wasn't just his incredible ability to play, but the courage he showed in facing down his own outrage over blatant racism, and the sense of entitlement displayed by so many white Americans. I'd heard of Jackie Robinson all of my life. After watching ""42"" I can finally concur: He was a true American hero."
"PuravidaSlant","8","1","1","7 May 2013"," I was expecting the racial aspect of the story to be handled like the proverbial ""blunt object""
","Last night I saw ""42"", the new bio-pic about the great Dodger ball player Jackie Robinson, who was the first African American to play in Major League Baseball in the modern era.<br/><br/>Usually I don't like sports films because the actors are always not really athletes and their athletic shortcomings distract me from enjoying the film. Not so in ""42""! I grew up in the NYC area in the 40's and 50's. Phil Rizzuto lived about 3 blocks away. I met quite a few of the Dodgers and Yankees as a kid. Every detail of this film was perfect. From the way Jackie used to grip and re-grip the bat while waiting for a pitch to the sets to well, everything.<br/><br/>Before watching the film I was expecting the racial aspect of the story to be handled like the proverbial ""blunt object"" and thus reducing a great Seminole time in my life into a cartoon-like morality play without any shades of gray, just good and bad. Not so ""42""! The ugly bigots were exquisitely portrayed in all their pathetic glory but the film was about Jackie and it was genius. It was the best portrayal of those wonderful beginnings of the first steps toward an enlightenment I welcomed as a kid and am still waiting to come to fruition. It was a great first step in pro-sports and this film did it the justice it so richly deserves."
"blackprojectionist","10","1","1","6 May 2013"," Great To See A Strong Black Hero
","I have to be frank. I've been so disappointed in the cinema, these days, I had to take a break from reviewing films. I'm seeing a host of films at my job as a projectionist, and man... it's been bleak recently. I kind of had to sit back and say, ""let me wait to write a review until I see something I can stand up and celebrate."" That film is ""42.""<br/><br/>Chadwick Boseman is very strong in the role of Jackie Robinson. He plays it with eloquence, sensitivity, and a very tactile smoldering rage at the injustice that plays out from the white people who didn't want to see baseball integrated. As in Django Unchained, writer/director Brian Helgeland is faced with the task of making a film with a strong Black lead where most of the white characters are despicable. He does it by putting the white point of entry character right up front in Harrison Ford's Branch Rickey, who loves the game, and knows that bringing Black athletes into baseball with invigorate the sport and sell more tickets. Ford and Boseman play well together, and Helgaland doesn't fall into the trappings of making Ford's character overly fatherly... it's business, and there's no disputing that fact. <br/><br/>Nicole Beharie is delightful as Rachel Robinson. She didn't have a whole lot to work with, just basically there to support her man. But hey, it's just nice to see a sister supporting her man... period!<br/><br/>Here's where the writer comes into it. I remember reading the tell tale sign that your film isn't pro woman is if the women in the film only speak lines related to the goings on of the male characters. Rachel Robinson has no life outside of her husband, doesn't even really get to be a mother to her son on camera... which was kind of strange. But, then, it's Jackies's story. So I guess where I felt like the film fell short was in establishing a certain intimacy with the characters. It's tough with a film that's supposed to be a sports/action biopic. The other thing that I wasn't crazy about was the use of Andre Holland as Wendell Smith, basically playing the non-threatening black man with glasses who types out news for black papers on his lap at baseball games and he and Robinson take way too long to have any kind of brotherhood?<br/><br/>So ""42"" is the kind of film you can take the kids to, and not feel like you're planting seeds of self hatred in their minds... which in this day and age, is a real relief and breath of fresh air. Could it have been better? Yes. Would Spike Lee have done a better job? Well, I don't think there's a director out there who is more of a sports fanatic. I just have been so disappointed by his films of late, I'm not sure I could say ""yes."" I've heard rumors that he has been trying to make the Joe Louis Jr. story, the Brown Bomber, for years, but with Vin Diesel in the lead as Joe Louis? We'll see. What if a Black writer/director would have done ""42."" Would it have been more intimate? I tend to think it may have."
"classicalsteve","10","1","1","29 April 2013"," Outstanding Docudrama of the Man Who May Have Single-Handedly Ushered in the Civil Rights Movement
","We often associate the Civil Rights Movement in the United States with events such as the Montgomery, Alabama, Bus Boycott of the 1950's, and the marches on Washington D.C. of Dr. Martin Luther King in the 1960's. However, ten years before Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a bus in the segregated south, Jackie Robinson of the Brooklyn Dodgers had to endure the kind of abuse and cruelty most of us today regard as vicious, unconscionable, and even unforgivable. The heroism of Robinson is summed up by the film ""42"" which is also credits the man who decided to allow the first African-American baseball player to don a uniform of a team in the White Major Leagues, Branch Ricky. (The so-called Negro Leagues were as professional and quite profitable prior to Robinson's crossing the racial barrier.) <br/><br/>In the words of George Will as stated in Ken Burns' documentary ""Baseball"" Jackie Robinson, played by Chadwick Boseman in an academy-award caliber performance, was the first heroic figure of what will become the Civil Rights Movement in the United States. Robinson, according to Will, was nearly as important to the movement as Dr. King. This outstanding biopic chronicles the man who challenged current status quo while playing highly competitive athletic competitions amidst jibes, curses, and epithets. To understand what Robinson endured and still be able to compete in professional baseball at the highest levels, is no less than an extraordinary achievement in the human drama of any age of history, according to Wills.<br/><br/>The story is presented from three perspectives: mostly from Jackie Robinson's eyes, occasionally from his wife's (played by Nicole Beharie), and from the perspective of the man who made the controversial move, Branch Rickie, played by Harrison Ford in possibly the finest performance of his career. (My hope is both Boseman and Ford will be nominated for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor Oscars, respectively.) According to the film, Robinson had two gifts, his ability as an outstanding athlete by any standard, and his ability to take the blows of hatred without retaliation. In Ricky's words, Robinson had to be man enough and big enough to turn the other cheek, as Gandhi did in South Africa and India, and as Martin Luther King Jr and the civil rights protesters did shortly thereafter.<br/><br/>On one level the film is a triumph of the human spirit but also a sobering indictment of what America had been prior to the Civil Rights Movement: a racially intolerant nation. Some of the most heroic moments are when Robinson is the target of such vitriolic abuse that he nearly breaks down but finds the courage to rise and take the field again amidst the mockery of opponents and spectators. Nearly as compelling are when his teammates begin to stand up for him and point out the cowardice of his abusers. Even Branch Ricky in one memorable scene, acknowledges that he doesn't know the pain of the abuse thrown at Robinson, and he supports Robinson as if they are both enduring these tests of character together to some degree. In a poignant moment, Ricky reveals why he made the first step towards integrating White Major League Baseball. ""42"" is without question the best offering in film thus far in 2013. Hopefully, the Academy of Motion Pictures will bring deserved nominations to all the leads, and hopefully the film will garner a few wins. Robinson deserves another home run because he made American Baseball truly the ""national"" pastime rather than the segregated sport it had been."

","""You give me a uniform, you give me a number on my back, I'll give you the guts."" For over 50 years baseball (like the rest of the country) was a white man's game. After just missing the world series the previous year Brooklyn Dodger owner Branch Rickey (Ford) decides to shake up his team, as well as the world by signing the best Negro league baseball player to a MLB contract. For Jackie Robinson (Boseman) it just wasn't as easy as putting on a uniform and playing. As many of you know I am a huge baseball fan and I love true stories so I was very much looking forward to seeing this. Even with my high expectations the movie was still better then I was hoping. Besides the movie being one of the best I have seen in a long time Harrison Ford turns in what I think is the best performance of his career and I don't think an Oscar win for him finally is a stretch. The racism shown in this movie is bad but I'm sure it's not even a quarter of what it actually was. That fact alone makes your respect for Robinson leap up from its already high mark. Even if you aren't a huge baseball fan this is a movie you should see. It's more a movie about the human condition and the limits you can reach if you believe in something. Overall, best movie of 2013 so far and best movie I have seen in awhile. I easily give it an A+."
"thewillt08","6","1","1","25 April 2013"," A Good Way to Spend The Day
","Baseball is almost as old as America itself, and like America it has its dark past or racial tension. 42 is about Jackie Robinson and how he broke the color barrier. This movie is less about baseball and more about the life of Jackie himself. A lot of people wanted more baseball and a lot of people thought it was fine the way it is. Me personally I thought the movie was right to focus on Jackie himself because the movie wasn't about baseball. Harrison Ford brings his A-game in playing Branch Rickey, but I can't help thinking that 42 could have been so much better.<br/><br/>When I first heard about this movie and saw the trailer I immediately thought Oscar winner. After seeing it, I see this movie being forgotten because it had so much potential to be a fantastic movie. The acting was good but it could have been better. The writing was good, but it could have been better. The racial tension and discrimination was good but it could have been worse, and by worse I mean it could have pushed the envelope and been more offensive. I'm fine with Harrison Ford and the semi-unknown actor who played Robinson because the man Jackie Robinson is too big of a character to be played by a star. If a big name guy played Jackie Robinson he would be criticized more than any other role because of Jackie's legacy. He did a really good job in his acting but in some scenes he was dull, but in a few scenes his emotion drove the scene and the story forward. His emotional acting made me in the moment and it felt like I was there next to him. The best scene in the entire movie is the scene in Philly. When the Dodgers play the Phillies the manager was getting under Jackie's skin with his racial slurs and you can see how it affected his game. As the frustration builds you could see the tension building as well. You can see the rage in Jackie's face as he wants to bash the manager's face in. Instead, he goes in the dugout, out of sight, and lets it out. He flips out and all the emotion comes out. Then comes in Branch Rickey to calm him down and the conversation they have is the best acting in the entire movie. Branch Rickey is the most important character in the entire movie and this scene proves his importance. We all know Harrison Ford as Han Solo and Indiana Jones, but now he can be referred to as Branch Rickey. He did an amazing job indeed, but come Oscar season he will be forgotten by the movies that will come around next fall. He could have done a little bit better, he was a few steps short of an Oscar performance and the fact that the movie came out in April hurts the entire film. In real life, Rickey wanted to win by any means and he thought the Negro Leagues had the most talent to he pushed to break the color barrier. In a selfish way he was a pioneer in baseball. In his greed for victory and money he became a hero. We even see it in the movie, he didn't care about black people and their right to play baseball, and he only cared about winning and making money. It's brilliant in a way and it worked. I liked seeing how white players slowly came on the side of Jackie and they slowly became friends. It was cliché, but that's really how it happened. Pee Wee Reece was the short stop of that time and he was a major star. I liked how it showed the term protest at first and Rickey shut them down, the one guy got traded, the other guy stands up for Jackie, the awkward moment when the one guy tried to get Jackie to shower with the team, it was all good to see in the movie. The movie focused on the team as much as it was Jackie. The main point of the movie was Jackie but sometimes it also turned and focused on Rickey, or the tram, or white people in general. As a team they overcame the racial tension and that was a good thing to see. Overall, 42 was a good movie. I saw it in theatres and I was generally entertained. I was never bred, the pacing was well done, and I was entertained. I'm glad I saw it, but I'm not sure if I want to see it again. Ford was amazing, Jackie was well played, but I can't escape the feeling that it was missing something. 42 held something back that would have made it a great film. I think that was the racial attitude. T showed white and colored separation but it could have been a lot stronger and we could have sympathized for Jackie more. I expected to hate white people more and I expected more from the movie as a whole. I love Jackie Robinson and his story. I love baseball and the fact that this movie was finally made. I'm glad I saw it and you should go see it too. 42 gets the WillyT Recommendation."
"generationfilm","Null","3","6","13 April 2013"," A Formulaic and Sentimental Sports Drama that Entertains with Competent Filmmaking and Fine Performances
","Baseball icon Jackie Robinson was the true embodiment of a misunderstood Martin Luther King Jr. quote, ""judge me by the content of my character, not the color of my skin."" Though Jackie Robinson became a symbol of desegregation in post-World War II America where racism, Jim Crow, and prejudice were the home battlefronts he actually was a truer symbol for talent unsought due to the blindness of ignorance. Robinson is a figure already ripe for cinematic portrayal not only due to his incredibly inspirational story but also because of his sympathetic yet complex persona. While the new biopic 42 might not be as inspirational as the actual figure of Robinson himself there is a unique balance of baseball technicality, social commentary, and uncomfortable authenticity that makes it a slightly less than typical sports biopic. Director and writer Brian Helgeland—best known for his screen writing abilities for L.A. Confidential and Mystic River—never shines away from the threats and challenges that faced Jackie Robinson on his journey making the more brutally honest portions of his script that highlights the true drama. Though 42 drifts in and out of formulaic inspirational tripe those predictable moments are few and far between and are usually forgotten once you're fully engaged in the fine performances from the actors on the screen, especially relative newcomer Chadwick Boseman. At times charming and often times challenging in its realism, 42 is a relatively admirable biopic worthy of showcasing the man Jackie Robinson was and how he struggled to become the man he needed to be. This is a film case where the more interesting story of overcoming personal flaws is shadowed by the desire to only focus on the legend itself, which is admirable though a slightly wasted opportunity. While it never reaches the classic realm of previous sports films like Rudy or gets caught up in the detailed drama of a sport like Downhill Racer, Brian Helgeland's 42 is definitely a sports film worth pursuing despite the fact that it doesn't ever live up to the towering legacy of an extraordinary man and feels as though it's a tonal replica of The Natural.<br/><br/>Read more: http://wp.me/py8op-xv More reviews: Generationfilm.net"

","42 is more then a baseball movie. In fact a few more sparkling fielding plays would have been welcome. The movie has a great look to it.

Great performances all around. Chadwick Boseman gives a performance equal to Harrison Ford's . Hopefully they will be remembered later in the year.<br/><br/>The movie has an old fashioned Disney feel although it's from Warner Bros. Some may find it a tad long or a bit slow, kinda like baseball. It's a true story of a real hero. It's a well done movie that helps you understand why number 42 is the only number retired from all of baseball. See it."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","3","7","14 May 2013"," Disappointing Look at the Legend
","42 (2013) <br/><br/>** (out of 4)<br/><br/>Leave it to Hollywood to mess up one of the greatest and most known stories in baseball history. The film covers the first year of Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) as he tries to fit into baseball, which is an all white sport and many don't want that to change. 42 tries way too hard to pack a punch and in the end I think it just comes up way too short considering the subject matter and its importance to not only baseball history but history itself. What emotional impact there is mainly comes from knowing that this is based on a true story and today getting to see how ugly of a past that we had. The first hour or so of the film is pretty sugar-coated and beats us over the head with how ""ugly"" the past was. We get all sorts of scenes setting up what the country was like in the late 1940s and all of these scenes don't have much of an impact because of how poorly they're handled by writer-director Brian Helgeland. His screenplay gives us these scenes in such simple ways that they're drained of any impact and even worse is how we get an annoying score to try and give them a bigger punch. That's not to say that every scene like this is bad. There's a terrific sequence in Cincinnati where we see Robinson taking abuse from the crowd and the now historic moment when Louisville kid Pee Wee Reese (Lucas Black) goes to him and puts his arm around him. This scene is beautifully done as is a really ugly sequence where Philadelphia manager Ben Chapman (Alan Tudyk) uses all sorts of racial slurs to get inside the player's head. The one saving grace are the performances with Boseman doing a very good job with the role of Robinson but one wishes we had gotten inside the character's head more. Tudyk is very memorable in his role as Chapman and Black is very good in his role as Reese. Nicole Beharie is also good in the role of the supporting wife. Harrison Ford is making noise in his role as Branch Rickey but I must admit that I found it somewhat hammy. Again, 42 is a well-meaning movie but I think it plays things way too safe at times and at other times things are just too pretty or drained of any power. It's too bad but hopefully this story can be done again at some point."
"ghost_dog86","6","3","7","25 April 2013"," From a Black Man's Perspective.
","""42"" is what you would call ""a fluff piece"" in journalistic terms. A very well written fluff piece, but a fluff piece nonetheless. Written and directed by Brian Helgeland, a white guy who is more known for his script writing abilities than his directorial prowess, ""42"" tells not so much the life story of Jackie Robinson (even though it has the ostentatious runtime of 128 minutes) but more so the story of Robinson's historic breaking of the color barrier in baseball, due to the signing by Branch Rickey, the team executive of the Brooklyn Dodgers at the time.<br/><br/>Even though I am giving this film a recommendation, maybe the best way to describe it would be with the term ""hokey entertainment"". From the initial sappy score, to some cringe inducing dialogue along the way, at first glance ""42"" would seem like something you could see on ABC Family during Black History Month.<br/><br/>Not to say ""42"" isn't entertaining because it is, but do I think a movie about Jackie Robinson should have been this tame? The answer is a resounding no! And therein lies the problem. I'm no historian, but in a movie concerning integration in the 40's, it is nothing less than a distracting inaccuracy (which took me completely out of this film multiple times) when at no point did I fear for Robinson's life. Therefore, I don't think I'm making a grand leap in saying that some of the more graphic material was Disney'd up, in order to make ""42"" a movie for the whole family. In short, the stakes here are disappointingly low for this type of material. On the other hand, I saw a Meet the Press interview with Jackie Robinson's wife, who claimed that she loved the movie because of its ""authenticity"". That said, throughout this overlong film there are flashes of sheer compelling grittiness, which act like shining beacons of a movie I wished this could have been.<br/><br/>The Acting: The acting from the two leads is pretty impressive for different reasons. Virtual unknown Chadwick Boseman (who plays Jackie Robinson) is exceptionally good here, demanding attention whenever he is on screen. I am very excited to see what the future holds for him. As for Harrison Ford, he devours the scenery with his portrayal of Branch Rickey, in his most intriguing performance since ""Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade"". Oh, and I should make mention that John C. McGinley plays Red Barber (the Brooklyn Dodgers radio broadcaster at the time) and is part of undoubtedly one of the funniest comic bits this side of ""Best in Show"".<br/><br/>Helgeland's Direction: There is really nothing special looking in ""42"" when focusing on scenes where characters are sitting around chatting. But EVERY SINGLE scene on the baseball field will have audiences on the edge of their seats. The way the camera follows Boseman as he runs the base path is a technique I've never seen before.<br/><br/>But, when I speak of ""grittiness"", I am definitely speaking of a few scenes in particular. The most prominent being the heckling scene where the Phillies manager, played with gusto by Alan Tudyk, showers Jackie Robinson with ""N-bombs"", as Robinson stands in the batter's box during a game. This is essentially the best sequence of the film, because it is one of the only scenes which transcends the hokeyness; giving audiences a cold dose of realism. Too bad scenes like this were so few and far between.<br/><br/>Final Thought: In the end, I wanted a pre-African American civil rights movement movie with more bite (or maybe one directed by Spike Lee) and instead I got something that while not forgettable, is no ""Malcolm X"". On the other hand, I wasn't bored like I was during ""Red Tails"" or offended like I was throughout ""The Blind Side"".<br/><br/>Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

","42 tells the story of famed baseball player, Jackie Robinson, and his becoming the first major league black ballplayer for the Brooklyn Dodgers. 42 checks all of the boxes expected from a biopic such as this, it's historically fascinating and inspirational, featuring solid performances from its cast. Chadwick Boseman does a fine job as Jackie Robinson, but the real standouts in the cast are Alan Tudyk as racist Philadelphia Phillies' manager Ben Chapman and Harrison Ford as Dodger's owner, Branch Rickey. This is the first performance I have seen Ford do in nearly a decade where I actually enjoyed the choices he made as an actor, though I still can't figure out that growl. While the movie takes a long while in the first hour simply laying out small one minute scenes to give the historical facts necessary for the rest of the movie to work causing the film to have a lack of focus as to who the real main character of the movie is, Robinson or Rickey, once Robinson joins the Dodgers, writer/director Brian Helgeland finally takes the time to take root in scenes and explore them in great detail to create emotion rather than just hammering home a fact like a history book. Even though 42 is not a complete home run, it's an enjoyable movie that is affecting and will win over crowds.<br/><br/>I give 42 a 7 out of 10!"

","The first movie of 13' i've seen, well actually the straight-to-DVD spoof 30 Nights of Paranormal Activity with the Devil Inside the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was but doesn't matter. 42 is exactly what I expected: an uplifting, earnest, well-told with honest emotion, well-acted & often entertaining flick of the legend Jackie Robinson. Chadwick Boseman (I remember him in the underrated The Express) soars as Jackie Robinson with great emotion & intensity, he hits it out of the ballpark. Harrison Ford gives one of his best performances of his career (award-worthy) as General Manager Branch Rickey. Nicole Beharie (who was also in The Express) is rock-solid as Robinson's wife Rachel.<br/><br/>The supporting players are great especially Andre Holland as Wendell the reporter, Alan Tudyk as the very mean-spirited Phillies manager Ben Chapman, Lucas Black as Pee Wee Rose, John G. McGinley as the announcer Red Barber & Christopher Meloni as the Brooklyn Dodgers manager (Robinson's as well). The classic use of music is awesome. 42 is one of the best baseball flicks ever made, it's that good IMO. Star-making performances from Boseman & Beharie, hopefully we'll see more from both in the future. A great movie from Oscar-winning writer/director Brian Helgeland (as writer, L.A. Confidential, Mystic River, Man on Fire). Now, let's make a Roberto Clemente biopic on the big screen please."

","If you're a baseball fan, then no doubt you know, at the very least, the gist of Jackie's story. Chances are, you might have even seen the 1950 classic, ""The Jackie Robinson Story"". So, how does ""42"" fare? Simply put: very well done! The performances are excellent (especially Harrison Ford, who goes above and beyond, even more than usual), and the movie does a good job of telling the story it needs to tell. Is it perfect? Nope...in fact, it misses some important details of his life, and changes a few things around to add drama, but that's to be expected in a Hollywood telling of a true story.<br/><br/>However, what you do see, you will no doubt enjoy. It's powerful, dramatic, and it sticks with you like a great story should. ""42"" doesn't hold back on the racial tension, so watch with caution: if racism is a sensitive issue for you, no matter your race, then it's probably best that you don't watch it, but you will be missing out on a great film.<br/><br/>My rating: 8/10"

","""42"" is a Biography - Drama movie in which we watch the true story of Jackie Robinson one of the most important people of baseball in United States. He was the first African-American to play in Major League Baseball and he was signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers.<br/><br/>A simply inspirational movie that gives you more things to dream of. I really enjoyed this movie and I believe that Brian Helgeland who is both director and writer of this movie did an excellent job and he presented very well the true story behind Jackie Robinson's life and the true obstacles he faced in his way to success.

","There are countless films that tackles the issue of racism in 20th century America, and 42 is one of the more heart-wrenching that I've seen. Some scenes are enough to make you feel physically ill, not to mention angry and devastated. The story is fascinating, heart-warming (eventually) and well-portrayed, although I found Chadwick Boseman's performance a little flat.<br/><br/>The film is prone to excessive sentimentality at times and isn't helped by a very corny supporting performance from Nicole Behari, who is scarcely believable as Rachel Robinson. There are plenty of times when it feels like the underlying message is being forced down your throat, which is completely unnecessary and a little tiresome.<br/><br/>Regardless, this is an interesting movie that serves as a very confronting reminder of how grotesque racism can be. Not a classic but well worth watching."

","'42', which is the answer to the ultimate question in the universe, is also that historic and legendary uniform number held by Jackie Robinson, the first African-American to play major league baseball. Brian Helgeland's biopic film on Robinson tells a polished and engaging version of the baseball hero that changed the nation. With phenomenal performances from Chadwick Boseman as Robinson himself, both fans of baseball and Robinson, along with a younger crowd who has never heard of the baseball player will eat this film up. The box office will draw some decent money, even if the director tries to head us over the head with what we are supposed to be feeling.<br/><br/>We focus on the years 1945-1947 in '42' as we segue into last part of the film, which is Robinson's first year as an actual major league baseball player. Similar to the 1950 'Jackie Robinson Story' (where Robinson played himself), one of the vital scenes is where Dodgers General Manager Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford) asks Robinson if he has what it takes to keep a cool head while his teammates, fans, and opposing teams harass him because of the color of his skin. And that is one of the main reasons Robinson was a hero. Not only did he impress everyone on the baseball field, but he showed great courage and restraint against his aggressors.<br/><br/>Rickey, maybe a man before his time, but certainly wanting to make a difference in the world socially and racially, hires Robinson to the Monteal Royals farm team, where we see Robinson taunted by his manager, teammates, going so far as to make him sleep separately from the team while on the road with a black family in town. But just like a good father, Rickey always says the right things at the right moments and has reminded Robinson to show his anger and voice on the field, rather than sink to the other's levels.<br/><br/>On opening day in Jersey City, Robinson hits a powerful home-run to which his manager says, ""He might be superhuman after all."" Now that piece of dialogue wasn't necessary, but the film is riddled with instances like this. Rather than have the character's actions tell the story on their own, there is always some piece of dialogue to punch in this face to tell us exactly what we need to feel. That is this film's flaw, which isn't a huge problem, but is annoying as it happens too often.<br/><br/>We do get a fair share of the racism that was hurdled towards Robinson throughout the film as we see his own teammates signing petitions to not play with him and specifically an obnoxious manager named Ben Chapman (Alan Tudyk) who pitches the n-word and every other slang term at the ball player. However, all of these terrible moments for Robinson are almost immediately redeemed by some form of just punishment in the form of a victory or great play. On the other end of the spectrum, Robinson has a few supporters of integrating races in sports, such as manager Leo Durocher (Christopher Meloni) and a couple of colleagues, who all try to make it easier and help out Robinson.<br/><br/>With the use of some CG work, some of the baseball fields and stadiums looked amazing as if the cast and crew were really in the 40s making a baseball film. The wardrobe and settings are spot on. Harrison Ford does a good job as Rickey, however his character seems to only go one direction, which is the father figure who doles out good advice. It's a good performance, but not much depth there. Tudyk and Meloni turn in great performances when they are on screen. And I was very happy to see John C. McGinley play Red Barber, the radio announcer. McGinley, mostly known as Dr. Cox on 'Scrubs' does an amazing job of being very animated and a lot of fun.<br/><br/>And Boseman shines as the celebrated Robinson. Not only is he a plausible athlete, but his charm and dramatic sense of keeping his anger at bay, shows off his acting chops, which he has plenty of. Since Robinson had really nobody to talk to about his difficult times during this period in his life other than his wife, I would have though that his spouse would have had a more prominent role in the film, but that's not the case. I would have liked to see a bit more of their relationship, if only to see Robinson's escape from all of the hatred.<br/><br/>'42' is a very good movie and will definitely have an impact on and inspire many people, especially the younger crowd. Robinson's story is a great one to tell, and here, it's told with grace and class. Even if Helgeland wanted to make a lighter film on such a sore and controversial subject, '42' is still a home-run."

","Prior to this film I did not not know much about Jackie Robinson or MLB during the 1940's- 50's. The film provided an outstanding setting of the time period of racial discrimination and segregation that African Americans were dealing with daily, Chadwick Boseman did an amazing job at providing the viewer a full understanding of the life of Jackie Robinson and his career, including the role of the character. Chadwick Boseman also added an enormous amount of emotion and strength for the theme that was being presented from the entire cast. My personal favorite character in the film was Harrison Ford, who's character was Branch Rickey. Branch Rickey(ford) proved to the viewers/fans the importance of breaking segregation throughout baseball. Harrison Fords character as Branch Rickey was also a huge builder for the plot of the movie and development of the theme. Reason being because of his deep interest in MLB and human rights. This movie overall was a great ""feel good"" movie. It was enjoyable to see how Baseball and how Jackie Robinson as a black player was a huge role model for loosing segregation in our society. I hope that the Director Brian Hegeland will release other films similar to this one in the near future for there are not too many available that are similar."

","I do enjoy biopic films and this film is all about Jackie Robinson who is the first black baseball player and how he struggled to succeed in this. To my delight this was a great movie that's hope becomes available to own in the UK. The premise sees a baseball manager want to win the world series so he wants to get the first black baseball player and the film documents the struggles that Jackie Robinson grows through to become a baseball player. Now Chadwick boseman plays Jackie Robinson and he does a great job in bringing this legend to life. He wasn't just a push over and you really felt sorry for him as he was put in these hard to watch scenarios. You really care about Jackie Robinson and you really want to cheer for him to succeed. But probably the best performance in this film is Harrison Ford as his manager and I think there should have been the conversation about whether he deserved an Oscar nomination. He was great and you really felt like he cared about this character and that he really cared about Jackie Robinson becoming a success and it really adds something to the film. Jackie Robinson's wife does a great job as well as all the players and coaches in the film as you truly feel the way Robinson does in all these interactions. The story is really good, it focuses on the most important part of Robinson's life and you truly feel like the baseball field is where he can thrive. There is allot of tension in this film obviously due to the time period and it really works and make you truly root for Jackie Robinson. The script is okay with some well done dramatic dialogue, however, when some of the scenes get heated I think more realistic dialogue and occasional swearing could have made the scene more volatile. The style is alright with the baseball scenes being really interesting and cool but I do think the film could have done with more baseball scenes and really emphasised that the baseball field is where Jackie Robinson thrives. If you are interested in this film at all then you should see it and I hope it comes to the UK so I can get it on blu Ray."

","It would be easy to be cynical about a movie like ""42,"" but the best thing about this biopic of Jackie Robinson is that it's not ashamed to embrace its own squareness. Indeed, it celebrates it, rendering cynicism a not very viable reaction to it or the people who made it.<br/><br/>The movie fits comfortably in the tradition of consciousness-raising social dramas that are often derided by critics as ""Oscar-bait."" Garnering awards may have been the intention of those who made ""42"" and it may not have been, but it really doesn't matter because the movie knows exactly what it's doing - and does it beautifully.<br/><br/>Robinson was, of course, the Negro League shortstop (later first baseman) handpicked by Brooklyn Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey to be the first African-American to play in the major leagues. Though he broke the ""color barrier,"" Robinson never saw himself as a ""hero"" or a historical figure, just a man who wanted to play ball. Like many before him and many since, Robinson never set out to change the world, but he was willing to rise to the challenge when history called upon him to do so.<br/><br/>But it was far from a smooth road to victory for the young man. Robinson had to weather stiff opposition from fans, fellow teammates, Jim Crow laws and the sport itself, and all this is captured effectively in the screenplay by director Brian Helgeland, which neither romanticizes the do-goodism of the action nor overstates the struggle just for dramatic effect (we are shown that there were plenty of people - both intimates and strangers, blacks and whites - who were rooting for Robinson to succeed).<br/><br/>In a star-making turn, Chadwick Boseman delivers the goods as the young Robinson, a man, we are told, with a sizable temper but who manages to rein in his emotions to an almost super-human degree in order to deny his goading detractors just the opportunity they're looking for to bring him down. But amidst a hail of almost nonstop verbal and racist abuse, Robinson retains his dignity by making the bigots look like fools and small-minded bullies in the long run. And it indeed was a long game he was playing, a fact that Rickey consistently reminds Robinson of when things get really bad both on the field and off. And speaking of Rickey, the real scene-stealer of the movie is Harrison Ford playing the gravel-voiced, deeply religious man whose blazing sense of justice and love of baseball converged to alter not only the sport but the world as we would forever after know it.<br/><br/>Helgeland has directed the film with solid conviction, often going for the small, intimate moment over the more obvious dramatic confrontation to impressive effect. Helgeland clearly trusts his material and doesn't feel the need to shout when a whisper will do. Yet even with all this restraint, what's amazing is how shocked we are to realize that all this happened a mere 66 years ago. And to see how far we've come.<br/><br/>And special note should be made of the scenes on the diamond, which beautifully capture the look and feel of the era and the pulse of the game.<br/><br/>To call this movie ""inspirational"" is not to denigrate it. On the contrary, ""42"" honestly earns every single tear, goose-bump and throat lump it elicits from its audience. It is truly a movie worthy of its subject."

","42 is the biopic of Jackie Robinson, who we all know as the first African American to play Major League Baseball. The number 42 is the only jersey number retired by the entire league, so I guess you can tell he's a pretty big deal. There was a lot that Jackie Robinson had to fight through to get to where he was. Racial prejudice was just terrible and this movie chronicles it pretty well.<br/><br/>Jackie Robinson is played by Chadwick Boseman, who's relatively unknown (although he was in one episode of one of my favourite shows: Justified). Having to play the role of such an iconic person in the history of sports (and even civil rights) is a pretty big plate to step up to. Fortunately, he hits a home run with his performance because it was pretty good. You could tell when he was angry but had to hold it in or when there was hope in his eyes. I really liked that. But the show is stolen by Harrison Ford's character of Branch Rickey. Harrison Ford is one of my favourite actors (Indiana Jones, Blade Runner, Star Wars, The Fugitive, etc.) and he doesn't disappoint here. His character is very inspiring and is played amazingly. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if Ford was nominated for an Oscar for this role. Additionally, there was Alan Tudyk (whom I've always loved in Firefly and, most recently, Wreck- It Ralph) as the racist a-hole, Ben Chapman. In this performance, he really puts the ""dick"" in Tudyk because he will make you absolutely hate the Philadelphia Phillies (the Pittsburgh Pirates aren't too likable either). And that's something that was done pretty well in this movie: the level of racism and prejudice. Of course, it's not as great as that of Django Unchained or Roots, but it's still quite believable and can make you wonder why people back then were so cruel. However, nobody really ever flipped out for real in this movie, which I would've wanted to see. Robinson gets mad at one point and breaks his bat and some people throw around names but it doesn't really capture what I'd imagine it should really be like. They keep that sort of PG in this movie; and while I understand why, I don't necessarily like. <br/><br/>The baseball scenes, however, were something I did like. They were dramatic and intense. I just wish there was more of it though. The movie is about 2 hours but I feel like there could've been about half hour more to the movie of baseball. Nonetheless, what baseball there was in the film was still cool even though you already knew what was going to happen. Touching on knowing on what would happen, the movie was very predictable. I found my friends and I calling every scene right before it would happen. And even with it being a true story, it can still be made to keep you on your toes, like Catch Me If You Can or The Fighter. This could probably have been due to the writing. Although the movie was written by the writer of L.A. Confidential and Mystic River (two great films that are mostly based on dialogue), its writing isn't as good as it could be. The script is pretty light at some parts and the dialogue gets a bit sappy sometimes. That's easy to get passed, though, if you're not looking for that; the directing style and level of drama is enough to keep it off your mind anyways.<br/><br/>It's a treat to see Jackie Robinson stealing bases on the field and it's interesting (and a little enraging) to see how he gets butchered by racial prejudice. 42 is quite a memorable baseball movie and could go up there with Field of Dreams and The Sandlot (not exactly on par with Pride of the Yankees though). The baseball scenes are fun, although I did want to see more. The acting is great, which is probably the gem of the film. The showcasing of real events was interesting. Though, it's sometimes unbelievable the way some characters speak or the way some events play out. But, 42 has style and is an enjoyable film with family and/or friends. While it's not an august pinnacle of film achievement, it's still an inspiring and enjoyable experience"
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","0","0","24 November 2013"," You can't feel guilty slurping down this feel-good sports drama
","In telling chapters of history, films have the benefit of hindsight. As obvious as that statement sounds, Oscar-winning screenwriter Brian Helgeland takes advantage of almost 70 years of history in writing/directing ""42,"" to the point where he can set the stage with the perfect emotional tone for telling the story of Jackie Robinson, one of the greatest legends in all of sports, who broke baseball's color barrier in the 1940s. <br/><br/>""You want a player who doesn't have the guts to fight back?"" Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) asks of Brooklyn Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford), the man who dared to put him in a Major League uniform. ""No, I want a player who has the guts not to fight back,"" Rickey says. The exchange is music to our ears, but did it ever happen? Probably not quite like that. You can pull lots of dialogue from ""42"" and make the same argument, but it doesn't matter; Helgeland is telling the folk story of Robinson and that's the story we want to see anyway.<br/><br/>The film opens with Rickey, a shockingly refreshing change of pace for Ford, who never played a non-fiction character in his life, endeavoring to bring in a player from the Negro Leagues. The reason? None given at first, but no matter. Today, it wouldn't be surprising for one person to take a stand on a matter of civil rights, but back then, it was probably hard, assuming Rickey had a care about civil rights. The film hints that he just wanted to win and make money, but it goes on to paint him as an ethical hero too, because — just because. And why not? We want to believe that's the man Rickey was, and his character is totally lovable for it.<br/><br/>""42"" doesn't sugarcoat the discrimination Robinson and other African-Americans faced during this historic time, but we still lap it up. The most memorable instance is when Phillies manager Ben Chapman (Alan Tudyk) shouts slur after slur at Robinson over the course of a game and ultimately makes amends with him as a publicity move. Harsh, brutal and tough to stomach, this discrimination makes us feel for Robinson when he heads into the clubhouse and unleashes his anger because he couldn't do it on the field. How hard it was back then and how terrible people could be, but the movie presents it in this ""my, look what he had to overcome!"" sort of way. Helgeland stirs up our emotional response, even though the reality was probably much uglier.<br/><br/>A perfect example is during one of Robinson's first few big league games presented in the film when a man takes his boy to the ballgame and they look like they're having a great time, until the father shouts slurs at Robinson when he enters the field. The kid, who clearly didn't feel negatively about Robinson to being with, joins in the heckling because that's what the other men were doing. Engrained racism doesn't need to be showed in such a picturesque light, but it adds to the emotional experience of the film.<br/><br/>Boseman's Robinson is both humble and bold. We see him hold back and keep his temper in check and we also see him instigating by showing off his athletic prowess. Boseman makes Robinson every inch as lovable as we imagine the man to have been. He's unafraid to bring on some extra heat, but like most of us, he has a breaking point. Surprisingly, we don't see that breaking point much; the script doesn't care much for that kind of melodrama, just the feel- good kind.<br/><br/>""42"" embodies everything you'd want from a feel-good movie. Helgeland perfectly sets up bad characters or characters with bad attitudes to get served with witty civil rights-affirming dialogue or scenes in which they have to eat crow (or — yes, I'll go there — Jim Crow). The film definitely panders to the obvious inclinations of its audience, who so many decades removed, very clearly stands on the right side of history. I won't be so naive as to believe that everyone who sees ""42"" has no racial prejudice, but what Robinson stood for and how what he did changed society let alone sports has few opposers these days. <br/><br/>In reality, Robinson was and is a hero, but in the minds of a generations removed, he's a legend. The film honors the legend of Robinson in a way that it will feed whatever idealistic notion of Robinson you might have developed in your mind. ""42"" is the comfort food of sports drama, which is the comfort genre of cinema. In other words, it's any food item analogy you wish with lots and lots of butter. But there's butter for the sake of butter, and there's butter applied in perfect, mouth-watering amounts, and ""42"" has the proportions measured out just right.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","I am reviewing the movie ""42"" released in 2013, which was a great film and had me engaged the whole way through. This movie is about the famous baseball player, Jackie Robinson and all that he accomplished as an African American baseball player. Taking place in the late 40's this film reveals how brutal slavery was before and the complications that come with it. Chadwick Boseman does a great job of portraying Jackie Robinson, as do the other actors playing their roles. Most of the actors are young which seems a little risky but they all did a good job. I especially liked the choice to cast Harrison Ford as I haven't seen him in any major films lately, and he still proves to be a good actor. <br/><br/>The only thing that really bugged me about this movie was the ""bad guys"" and how against Jackie they were all the time. For instance, when they are playing one of their biggest game, a championship or something, and as Jackie steps up to bat the other team yells out, ""You don't belong here! This is a white mans game!"" When he is clearly the best player in the league and he is changing the thoughts of others and people start to applaud for him. The bad characters seemed to cliché, and all had the same character."

","If you walk into this movie just thinking it is about Jackie Robinson, your missing the boat. The great television producer Ken Burns has already done that and not very well in his Baseball series. Burns over reached in telling the Robinson story there because his made it seem like there was nobody playing baseball except Robinson which was not the purpose he intended in trying to tell the story of the sport. <br/><br/>This movie does not over reach. The script is about the drama of what Robinson did and the reactions to it. Chadwick Boseman as Robinson is magnificent in the movie. Harrison Ford plays the stuffy Branch Rickey, interested in the almighty green perfectly. The support cast, especially the small role of Leo The Lip Durocher who was still womanizing in 1969 when the Miracle Mets blew apart the Cubs during the first Moon Landing is spot on.<br/><br/>The heart of this movie and the message is how wrong hate is and the guts it takes to overcome hate. It is hate that costs all of us the opportunity to be better. The movie touches on this early on with the references to World War 2 battling hate though it glosses over the sad story of blacks being still segregated from whites in the service during World War 2 that was reality. It took Harry Truman to finally end segregation after the war.<br/><br/>The movie does point out how difficult it was for Robinson to cross a line forbidden until then because of pure hate. It is an accurate portrayal. I saw it happen in real life in the 1960's. That was when I became one of the first boys to play for a woman manager in Little League Baseball.<br/><br/>I saw the fathers on the field and in the stands spew hate at her. The hate became more intense when we went undefeated the first season, won the championship the 2nd season and just barely lost the championship game her third season. The hate never stopped and after 3 seasons she stopped fighting a battle in which their hate never let up because she was years ahead of her time. The sad thing was the fathers did not seem to learn that a woman could coach and manage a team until years later. Her courage in crossing that line is the kind of courage this story highlights about Jackie Robinson.<br/><br/>If only there was a way for this movie to teach how destructive this hate is and reach everybody to eliminate it, this would be the most valuable film ever. I personally witnessed Coaches in the last 10 years hating a player in a port so intensely, that they destroyed that player, bullying them until they literally destroyed their dream of playing anymore. The adults who did this were petty but in no way different than the ones who stood in the way of Jackie Robinson. The world loses every time hate triumphs.<br/><br/>Here is the true story where hate is gloriously defeated and a handbook on how difficult it is to step out against people who are petty. Those people still exist, and the lesson here needs to be taught over and over again until we get it right. Trouble is no matter how hard we battle to fight hate, the victories are too small and for some reason hate always continues to exist."

For in it Helgeland, Boseman and Ford manage to distill the importance of Jackie Robinson as a historic figure while showing him at his most vulnerable. And it is in that moment that all the strengths of the movie come to life because if the rest of the writing, acting and technical achievement hadn't been thought through this moment would ring hollow. But Helgeland and his collaborators have done a fine job in giving this American icon not only a fitting tribute but show him as the one thing all icons start out - a conflicted, strong, passionate and frail human being.<br/><br/>The main critic hurled at ""42"" is that it has played things too safe and by the numbers. But I believe it is this old-fashioned style that actually manages to bring out the most inspirational aspects of Robinson, the things he had to overcome and what his place in US history means.<br/><br/>Yes, this is an old-fashioned movie, but then again, baseball is an old-fashioned and timeless game."

","I loved this movie. Couldn't get enough of it. Would certainly see it again. And here's the thing; I've never seen a baseball fired in anger in my life. I have read several books about baseball, not least Roger Kahn's outstanding chronicle of the 'Jackie Robinson' Dodgers, The Boys Of Summer. Kahn was writing about his own years travelling with the team in his capacity as sports writer and those years were 1951 - 1952, when Robinson had long been integrated and his battles were behind him. He was, however, still playing, as was Pee Wee Reese who also features in the film. By that time, of course, black players were a fixture in baseball largely, but not solely thanks to Robinson. This film is good on relationships not least Jackie and his wife Rachel and so fine are the two actors that it's almost impossible to watch their scenes together without succumbing to tears. Harrison Ford, an actor I can take or leave is equally brilliant as Branch Rickey. A wonderful film."
"TxMike","Null","0","0","9 September 2013"," Jackie Robinson wore number 42 with the Brooklyn Dodgers.
","I really like this movie. I was born in 1945, and became a baseball fan right about the time Jackie Robinson was retiring from baseball in 1957. I happened to be a Brooklyn Dodger fan, and I can't honestly remember why, maybe it was because my dad was a NY Yankees fan. Regardless I never had any consciousness of ""race"" in baseball. I knew the Dodgers had black players and as far as I was concerned it was always that way.<br/><br/>But of course it wasn't. Even 80 years after the Civil War ended and slaves had been freed, there was still deep racial bigotry in sports. The major leagues were essentially all white. The blacks played in ""negro leagues"". This movie tells the true story of the man, Jackie Robinson, who broke the ""color barrier"", it was never easy but Jackie was a superior athlete and a superior human being and made it work. His influence is so highly regarded that every year on ""Jackie Robinson Day"" every major league player wears the number 42 in tribute.<br/><br/>In an excellent role Chadwick Boseman is Jackie Robinson, and the story is squarely about him. But in a real sense it is also about Branch Rickey, President and General Manager for the Dodgers from 1942 to 1950. This role is played by Harrison Ford in what has to be one of his best performances. He doesn't just play Rickey, he virtually becomes Rickey. <br/><br/>When there is a time and need for great change most often there needs to be an energetic driver of that change, and that was Branch Rickey. Yes, in his job he was in the business of winning and making money for the franchise. But deep down he knew the bigotry against blacks in baseball was wrong, and he knew to make the change work he needed to find a first-rate player who would become a team leader. Robinson turned out to be that guy.<br/><br/>Excellent movie, one of the very best sports movies I have seen. And I am still a Dodgers fan after all these years!"

","42 is the inspiring story of Jackie Robinson, the first African American player in the MLB. Chadwick Boseman does an excellent job portraying Robinson as an ordinary man with an extraordinary impact in the civil rights movement. I feel Harrison Ford is a strong candidate for the Best Actor in a Supporting Role Oscar. <br/><br/>Something else I like is that this film doesn't fall into the same traps as other civil rights movies, like portraying the historical figures as saintly, emotionless heroes.

","Up until this film, probably the best film about Jackie Robinson was the one in which the star played himself. This wasn't a bad film, though it seemed very over-idealized. Finally, after all these years, Hollywood has finally put a nice budget into making a lovely tribute to this baseball great. However, and this isn't a complaint, it is NOT a film about the entire life of Robinson--just a tiny portion. Of course, it's clearly the most important part--his career in the minor leagues and his first year in major league baseball. It does not discuss how his career was unfortunately cut short by diabetes--as was his life. But the movie makers clearly couldn't do EVERYTHING--and they were wise to narrow the focus. But as for me, I'd like to see a sequel--and what happened to Robinson AFTER the 1947 season. In fact, when the film ends, you see that Dodgers win the National League pennant--but you don't learn that they lost the World Series to the Yankees (that WOULD have been anticlimactic).<br/><br/>So what did I think of the film? Well, I thought it was terrific--and I really appreciated how the film tried to get the history correct (with a few tiny exceptions). Ben Chapman (the manager of the Phillies) really was a racist jerk. Robinson did, for a time, live in Sanford, Florida (that's a bit ironic). And, the film tried very hard to get the look right. I also appreciated seeing Harrison Ford try to stretch his range--uglying himself up and changing his voice so much to try to adequately portray Branch Rickey. All in all, a very, very inspiring and touching film--one even non-baseball players could love."

","This Warner Brothers production, written and produced by Brian Hedgeland, recounts well the story of the first black man in pro baseball, who entered it in 1946. For those who remember the names of not only Jackie Robinson, but also Pee Wee Reese and Leo Durocher, (and as a boy who grew up in the 50's and 60's I remember those names well) then the movie might provide some enjoyment and meaning. Since most of the movie was filmed in Chattanooga and Alabama, the Deep South was pictured well. It is an inspiring story about a man who underwent a lot of mistreatment, not only from southern bigots but from some of Robinson's teammates as well. Chadwick Boseman assumed this role well, as did Nicole Beharie as his wife Rachel. Harrison Ford fell very well into the role of Branch Rickey. Christopher Meloni depicted Leo Durocher well, hot-headed all the way through this cinematic work. (Was there ever a time when the real Leo Durocher was not hot-headed?) As for Alan Tydyk, in the role he played as the very mean, bigoted Ben Chapman, he was very convincing. Again, the South of the 40's and 50's was depicted well, as were the bigots in the South then, and there were exciting parts of baseball games in the movie. Last but not least, it is a warm story of a man who defied all odds against him and kept going."

Superb acting, particularly from Harrison Ford, makes this film one of the best i've seen this year. This film will make you laugh, cry and also feel anger for what Jackie Robinson and all afro-Americans had to endure.

His Indiana Jones isn't all that distinguishable from his Jack Ryan. But his portrayal of Branch Rickey was nothing short of awesome. He really lost himself in the role. I don't know how much of the story was true, or how closely the filmmakers kept to character portrayals but Ford really made me like Branch Rickey. This was definitely Oscar worthy. <br/><br/>Casting Chadwick Boseman was a masterstroke. Looking at his IMDb page it looks like he has a string of minor TV roles. What a shame.

","My first reaction to sports films is how realistic sports action is. If you are a long time fan, it's easy to spot inaccuracies and lame moments. This one does a nice job of making the on-field events believable. They did a nice job of showing how Robinson was quite a remarkable player. I don't know what Branch Rickey was really like. Harrison Ford certainly made him a crusty, driven person who has decided to leave a legacy. What may be missing are the more subtle aspects of race discrimination. We are used to the white- only restrooms and the hotels. Those were visible things that most would be aware of. What could have strengthened this movie would be the edgy treatment blacks would have received, less blatant, but every bit as destructive. Except for Pee Wee Reese and the guy who got traded because of his hostility, we don't have a whole lot of interaction among the Dodger players. I remember Reese as a kind, friendly person who used to do the Game of the Week with Dizzy Dean on Saturdays. Sometimes his character is too good; we don't really get to know him very well. He must have had a price to pay as well, coming from Kentucky. These are things that would turn a good, fairly inspirational movie into a really serious study of segregation and how it affected America."

","I had no idea that Jackie Robinson was the man he was, or that baseball after World War II was right up there with Jackson, Mississippi as a racist stronghold of segregation. Shame on me. And kudos to yet another movie that brings to light our sorry history of anger and hatred—a history that seems to continue to this very day. So this review is more about the history lesson than about the movie per se, and that alone should tell you that it's worth your time. When you want to write more about the issues raised by a movie than about the actors and the directing, you know the movie has legs.<br/><br/>""Your enemy will be out in force,"" Harrison Ford tells Jackie Robinson, ""but you cannot meet him on his own low ground."" That kind of dialogue means that there are life lessons in this movie that will show up on Facebook in quotes against setting-sun backgrounds. And Harrison Ford delivers them with brilliant timing—brilliant I tell you—and twitching that cements the moment in our memory. This is one of Ford's finest performances, and while he leaves his sexy somewhere off the screen for this one, his portrayal of Branch Rickey is compelling and worthy of an Oscar nod. Want another one? ""Sympathy is the Greek word for suffer. To sympathize with Jackie is to suffer with him."" And we do suffer with him. But the movie also tells us he felt very alone. I'm sorry for that.<br/><br/>Jackie Robinson died a young man, frail and tired, in his early fifties. It takes a lot out of a man who has much to be angry about to constantly turn the other cheek and never respond when publicly humiliated, especially when that man is expected to perform a job as difficult as baseball, which calls for total concentration. The fact that he was able to do both—turn the other cheek and play like a champion—was a mark of his greatness. And I have to believe it led to his early demise. Quite a price to pay.<br/><br/>I guess I should mention the love story between Jackie and his wife, Rachel, but it was too perfect for the likes of twice-divorced me. I don't believe in that kind of perfect love, and I cannot believe there was no discord through it all. I cannot believe he was so gentle all the time, this man who had every reason to be filled with rage at the injustice of the way he was treated. Nope, call me a cynic, but I think his marital history was rewritten here, and I'm sticking with that opinion. But either way, he seemed to love being a family man, and another kudo to him for that.<br/><br/>There are a lot of heroes in this movie; it's one of the things that makes it unique. Normally in movies, there is one hero against the world; but it took a village of heroes to make Robinson a baseball game changer, and they had a village. Rickey. Robinson. Pee Wee Reese. There was a moment when Reese walked over to Robinson amid the boos and put his arm around him, just to let everyone in the world know exactly what he thought, and that moment brought tears to everyone in the theater. Andre Holland also stands out as Wendell Smith, the black writer who sits in the stadium with a typewriter on his lap because colored writers are not allowed in the press box. And the list goes on. <br/><br/>This movie was written and directed by Brian Helgeland, who is best known for movies like Robin Hood, The Green Zone, Man on Fire, Conspiracy Theory, and other guy films with violence and rough guy stuff. The soft underbelly of his writing style comes out in 42, and it's a good thing. He clearly has the versatility to write minimalist dialogue that matters. Robinson doesn't say much, so when he does speak it is important that the words work, and they do. Well done. Not since Mystic River has your work resonated with such depth. The other thing is that I usually am furious that directors choose to write as well; there is no Jack of all Trades in movie making, but Brian is the exception to the rule. You can write and direct anytime Mr. Helgeland. <br/><br/>You must see this movie. You must make sure young people in your life see this movie. And call a friend after seeing it and ask them what they thought. I wish it were no longer relevant to our lives today, but sadly, it still is. So see the movie, and take its lesson home with you. And on April 15 each year—Jackie Robinson Day, the day when everyone in the league wears the retired number 42 on the field—say a silent thank you to Jackie Robinson, and to those around him as well. We owe them a lot"

Jackie Robinson was the first black to break the color line in baseball. He definitely had guts because abuse was heaped upon him from all sides.

","Beyond the particular Jackie Robinson story, 42 is about the gap between the law and the code. As Dodgers owner Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford) is warned early, breaking the law can earn you respect and admiration; violate the unwritten law and you're ostracized. That's what makes this film reflect upon current America, Obama's America as much as Robinson's. The America that defeated fascism and that professes all citizens' equality is contradicted by the various codes of prejudice, whether based on race, on religion, on geography, or on class.<br/><br/>America has come a long way since those redneck 40s. But as the opponent manager who taunts the black man mercilessly, then asks to pose for a picture with him demonstrates, some profound changes remain shallow. The pool of prejudice, hatred and fear runs deep. This is a film made in supposedly post-racial America that reminds us how the prejudice persists.

","Directed by Brian Helgeland, 42 depicts the hardships that Jackie Robinson had to overcome as he became the first black player in Major League Baseball. Although Abraham Lincoln had signed the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, 82 years before 1945, segregation still separated blacks and whites in large areas of the country. This segregation was also evident in professional sports. White baseball players competed in Major League Baseball, whereas black players were demoted to the Negro League. These two worlds never crossed paths. This all changed when Branch Rickey, the Brooklyn Dodgers owner, decided to put an end to segregation in baseball. Rickey's bold decision to recruit Jackie Robinson would change the world of baseball forever.<br/><br/>The theme of turning the other cheek fills this movie. A defining moment that highlights this theme is when Rickey tells Robinson, ""I want a player who's got the guts not to fight back."" These are not easy shoes to fill, considering retaliation is part of human nature. Robinson had to deal with prejudice every single day from players and fans. He had baseballs thrown at his head, was called the n-word numerous times, received threatening letters, etc. Determined to turn the other cheek, Robinson displayed an incredible amount of courage. <br/><br/>42 is a very inspirational movie that displays the perseverance and faith of Jackie Robinson. He showed love to those who hated him, which is something we should all strive to do. There are many great benefits of loving our enemies, some of which were evident in this movie. Because Robinson refused to retaliate, he became well-respected by many and changed the game of baseball forever. In doing so, he also challenged racism in the rest of the country. It was also remarkable to watch Rickey as he stood beside Robinson and encouraged him to persevere. Pee Wee Reese, a teammate, puts his arm across Robinson's shoulders in public as a declaration of unity. <br/><br/>The movie did a great job of portraying the reality of humanity's flaws. However, some parts of the movie were unnecessary, such as casual profanity and small amounts of suggestive sexual material. Though these things are also inherent in life, they did nothing to add to the story of Jackie Robinson. If anything, they only served to distract viewers from the real issues of the movie. Overall, this was a great movie, and comes highly recommended."

And although some would like you to believe that there is no more hate or discrimination in the U.S.A., one only needs to remember that these evils are like persistent garden weeds that need constant digging out. They are not completely eradicable. They manifest themselves in a variety of ways.

You live with him through the pain he had to endure – and granted, this movie only shows a tiny portion of how difficult it must have been for him to display the strength and determination it took to change the world of American baseball - to be allowed to do what he loved and was so good at without restrictions. If you're like me, you will cringe to see the ignorance and hatefulness many people exhibited toward fellow human beings, and you will rejoice in watching as this nation was helped to begin the slow – too slow, but without people like Rickey and Robinson, it could have been so much slower – turn into becoming real, tolerant-of-each-other Americans.

And I say these things as a White person who doesn't particularly like baseball; never been to game.<br/><br/>In terms of being nigh-on perfect, I doubt that there is such a thing as a perfect film, and this is not a ""greatest"" film, because I, at least, reserve plaudits of that sort for spectacle films. But where is a significant flaw here? I just don't find one. Oh, I would have liked Max Gail's role as the old manager filled out a bit more...but that's a personal preference, and it probably wouldn't have made the film any better. I thought I might want to have seen a longer full-life bio-pic, but later I changed my mind. This was about being the first, and took us through that phase of Robinson's story. I've also heard people say that Spike Lee should have directed. Why? Because he's Black and would have pounded the injustices into our heads more? No thanks.<br/><br/>The performances here are remarkable. Chadwick Boseman, as Robinson, plays it just right...perfect. He makes Robinson a hero, but not always a perfect man. And, there is a slight facial resemblance to Robinson. But what he most importantly brings to the film is respect. I hope to see a lot more of Boseman on the silver screen in the future.<br/><br/>While this is not Harrison Ford's greatest role, it may be his best. What I mean by that is that usually -- like most actors -- Ford plays Ford. That's what we go to see. Here, however, he becomes immersed in the role of Branch Rickey and truly plays the character, instead of himself. We're talking best supporting actor nominee here, I think...and it may be an honor long overdue.<br/><br/>Nicole Beharie, as Robinson's wife, is excellent as well. Hamish Linklater as player Ralph Branca, was also very good. And it was nice to see Max Gail again...maybe his role could have been upgraded just a tad. Of course, director Brian Helgeland deserves a lot of credit here. When I looked at a list of his projects over the years, it was interesting to see no real type of film that he concentrates on.<br/><br/>A remarkable film which I recommend very, very highly. You'll feel like you know these interesting human beings."

","I was moved by the bravery of Robinson and by the heroism of Branch Rickey. I was disgusted by the racism in America though I already knew it was there. Someone remarked (it may have been MSNBC's Chris Mathews)that if you're the first, you have to have extra strength and courage to withstand the vitriolic insults and bitter hatred. Mathews mentioned Jackie Robinson's strength in that area when talking about President Obama and the tough road he has had. That is why I wanted to see the film and I was not disappointed in that regard--it took superhuman strength not to fight back. <br/><br/>But I was disappointed that Robinson's personality wasn't more complex, more interesting. He liked baseball and liked winning and that was about it. He wasn't funny or profound. He was simply brave. Maybe he had a nurturing, loving background, a happy childhood and it left his mind clear to chart out his goals with little or no conflict or self-sabotage. Humor often comes from a recipe containing some conflict and neurosis. I missed that complexity due, perhaps, to my own background. But you can't write in lines that just weren't there. Like the film ""Lincoln,"" it was the historical moment that made the film almost easy to make."

","Often feeling like a made-for-cable biopic, 42, named after Jackie Robinson's number with the Brooklyn Dodgers – the first African American to play in the big leagues – is an entertaining film wherein the best moments take you out of the history lesson and right into the ballpark. Each game is pieced together with suspenseful precision, especially a pivotal scene where Robinson shuffles his way around the diamond: stealing every base and eventually making it home. While some of the weaker moments are still pretty decent Scenes with Jackie and his wife are a little corny and yet both actors have genuine heartfelt chemistry.<br/><br/>But the real connection is between Robinson and Dodger's team executive Branch Rickey. Most of us grew up with Harrison Ford playing larger than life heroes, and he's hardly been deemed a ""character actor."" Well his performance is hit and miss: In one aspect he seems to be doing an imitation of an endearing old codger (especially when more believable old guys, like Max Gail, are on the screen). And although we never really learn why he got the sudden daring vision to allow blacks to play a ""white man's game,"" his scenes with Jackie really make the moments on the field count. Also, it's fun watching Rickey manipulate other coaches to do things his way.<br/><br/>The film's star, Chadwick Boseman, is believable as Robinson, especially when he's rounding the bases or trying hard not to fight (holding back against) his unruly adversaries: whether on the opposing team or his own. Although there's a bit of a ""Time Travel"" aspect as Boseman's performance often feels like a modern man knowing he'll prevail over such a horribly banal thing as racism. Sure, standing tall with cocky pride is a worthy aspect of a legend, but too much determined realization takes away from a character, albeit a true life one, that could have used more of an arc for that struggle to seem more actual than celebrated."

","42 is one of the greatest sports films I've ever seen and it's about time there was one made about the legend Jackie Robinson!!! The actor who portrayed him did very well and Harrison Ford did excellent as Branch Rickey. Watching the movie made me think of how hard it was for Jackie to overcome the criticism by his enemies, most notably the other teams they were facing and the fact the races were separate in almost everything. Still, this movie is definitely one to see if you're a fan of sports and/or history. I am of both and I knew when I first saw this as a preview I wanted to see it. The scenes in the movie are very believable too: it's almost as though you're in the middle of it all. You're witnessing history being made when a black player comes into the game of baseball totally surrounded by white players. Jackie Robinson was going the perfect candidate for that. Great film, great acting and great storyline!"

","I have to say I was very impressed with this film and it's FAR better than what I expected. It plays with more heart and better balance than most other films that tackle this well covered subject. It's sentimental but in a very good way. Some people may label that as cheese but it works perfectly here.<br/><br/>As expected, Jackie's perspective and his trials were covered but the film offers a glimpse of the era and other character motivations are touched upon. It was great to see that not every white guy was portrayed as an ignorant redneck fool. There's a fair share of them in the film but there were a fair share of them back then as well. This is almost as much Branch Rickey's (Harrison Ford) movie as it is Jackie's. The supporting characters are wonderful. The baseball itself is sound and shot very well. I was pleasantly surprised to see the faith aspect was actually quite strong. A great line from the film said to Jackie by Rickey: ""You need to be like our Savior and have the guts to turn the other cheek."" It seems both Rickey and Robinson were devote Christians and the story did not shy away from that factor. Like everything, they played it right without too heavy a hand."

","You know, before I saw 42, me and my dad caught one of the trailers for the movie a few months before it came out. His reaction was something like this: ""Let me guess, it's gonna about racism and how bad it is or some bull, isn't it?"" I walked into 42 with these words in mind. I walked out of 42 having learned that that's not what the film is about (I'll explain later on).<br/><br/>42 is a well-written, well-directed biopic on Jackie Robinson, one of America's greatest sports heroes (and the movie does a great job at proving why he is just that). Before I talk about Jackie himself, I MUST bring up Harrison Ford as the owner(?) of the Brooklyn Dodgers, Branch Rickey, who is the best character in the movie. Ford turns in his best performance in a long while and he makes the character passionate, determined, and wise, but he's kind-hearted as well. But what makes Rickey such a great character is why he signs on Jackie Robinson in the first place. As he says a few times in the movie, Rickey is doing this for the money, and he knows that if he signs on Jackie, the Dodgers will go to the World Series, which will get Rickey more money. On the surface, money seems to be his motive. But what if he had a different goal in mind? I believe his real goal is to put an end to racism, and the film hints at this a number of times. To me, this goes to show what a great man Rickey is, fighting the good fight against 40's prejudice.<br/><br/>As for Jackie Robinson himself, he too is a great man, caring about his wife and respecting his teammates through and through, and Chadwick Boseman does a decent job at portraying this. The story itself is also great, and it's enhanced further by a lot of little details, like how some white people cheer on Jackie, or seeing one of Jackie's teammates using his technique of leading-off the base. Little details like these just make the story all the better.<br/><br/>One of the problems that some critics had with 42 was that, as a movie that deals with racism, it didn't do a very good job of doing so. However, as I said I don't think 42 is actually about racism. I feel that it's more about prejudice against those who are different from you, and I can think of 2 scenes that point to this: The very first scene and the scene where one of Jackie's teammates put his arm around him, showing that they're good buddies, which riles up the white people in the stands.<br/><br/>Now then, with all of that said, I have to say that the movie does have a few flaws, though most of them are minor. Another one of the problems that some critics have with the movie was that it felt a little safe. Before I saw the movie, I didn't know what they meant by that, but now, I believe they mean that the film was safe when it came to the hate towards Jackie Robinson. And I have to say, I do kind of agree with them, since the worst we see are a Phillies player continually insulting Jackie and some hate mail and death threats. I also feel that the romance between Jackie and Rachel Robinson could've used more development. All of the right elements are there, I just think that more screen time would've allowed their relationship to become really good. Speaking of relationships, I think that the relationship between Jackie and the rest of his teammates could've been developed more. There are a few scenes that explore the dynamic between the team and Jackie, but I think at least 1 more scene would've made it complete.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a must-see for everyone, regardless of your skin color or your opinion on baseball. 42 gets a 9 out of 10 from me."

Yes, 42 plays it safe, a biopic about Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) during 1945-47 when he broke the color barrier of major league baseball, the first black player in the majors since 1884. <br/><br/>Director/writer Brian Helgeland stays with the outlines of Robinson's remarkable odyssey from minor to a major leaguer whose number 42 was retired for all baseball in his honor. Unfortunately, as with many sports stories about its heroes, even horses, the music swells to obtrusive heights to make sure we feel the right sense of awe at these august proceedings.<br/><br/>The formula goes also into Robinson's domestic life, where scenes with his lovely wife, Rachel (Nicole Behane), are boilerplate sweet but adding almost nothing to the drama of the racism surrounding Rickey's decision to hire Robinson for the Brooklyn Dodgers. <br/><br/>As the above quote signifies, Rickey is a font of wisdom. He has about all the best lines, such as this one, for another example, to Robinson: ""Your enemy will be out in force. But you cannot meet him on his own low ground.""<br/><br/>In addition to having the best lines, Rickey also has too many with a gravitas that threatens to sink the film in solemnity. However, the action scenes in the games bring a reality that hints to me an updated documentary would be even more valuable than this docudrama. In fact, all the period pieces from Ebbets Field to the buses are exquisitely rendered, with clothes just a bit too crisp and cars a bit too clean.<br/><br/>But no matter—the game's the thing, and 42 is an old-fashioned sports movie with plenty of sentiment and history to make an enjoyable few hours at the game."

","I write as someone born and bred in the UK who has never seen a live game of baseball even on tv but who loves the baseball played in the thirties, forties, and fifties, who has read many books on baseball in that period including arguably the greatest title of all Roger Kahn's The Boys Of Summer which features what became known as The Jackie Robinson Dodgers both in the 1951 season, when Kahn travelled with the team as a journalist and filed reports on every game, and, in the second half of the book, interviewed the iconic players - Preacher Roe, Duke Sneider, Pee Wee Reese, Roy Campanella, George Shuba, Gil Hodges etc - some twenty years later. By then, of course, Robinson was both loved and respected and his life was light years away from that depicted here - although Kahn has covered those early years elsewhere. It's not easy for me to find shortcomings as some - presumably US citizens - have done here, because I am so grateful to have access to a great movie like this - even then I had to buy it in Paris and with French subtitles. To me it was brilliant and I enjoyed the fact that I knew so many of the real people who weren't fully introduced - Red Barber, Happy Chandler - etc. I'm glad to own it and place it alongside Eight Men Out in my dvd collection, two fine films of great events in baseball."

","The above is really all I can say about this film. Amazing from start to finish. <br/><br/>I saw this in the theater not expecting what I got. I was so moved by Jackie's story and what he ( and so many others) faced during the time it's set in. Living in the South, I fully understand the prejudices that still exist, and it's hard knowing that people were, and still are treated in astounding ways, just because of the color of their skin. <br/><br/>It's a little slow at times, but any movie that builds characters and history usually is at times, which is my only reason for 9/10. <br/><br/>Chadwick Boseman is spectacular! I could feel the tension he felt and could almost hear him gritting his teeth to keep back what he wanted to say. Harrison Ford makes me want to cry; if only everyone would look at the heart of the person, and not their skin, and be just and fair in a society of people who aren't, the world would be so much different. I also was thrilled to see Lucas Black- I try to watch everything that he's in because I have several friends who went to school with him, I know he's a down to earth guy as well as a great actor, and you won't be disappointed by a single person in the cast. <br/><br/>Well.... except for the people who taunt and ridicule Jackie. You will find yourself getting really angry over what's said. There really is a brashness that you don't see with many films, unless they're to do with race. If you can make it through without yelling at the screen and the idiots who try to defeat Jackie, I can bet you'll be moved to tears in a very good way. <br/><br/>This is very much like The Blind Side, so if you liked that, you will like this for sure!

","'42': Four Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>This inspiring biographical baseball drama centers on Jackie Robinson (who's jersey number was 42) and the 1947 Brooklyn Dodgers season when Robinson became the first black Major League baseball player since 1884. It also focuses on his relationship with team executive Branch Rickey, who signed Robinson to the team (making history). Chadwick Boseman (a mostly unknown TV actor ) stars as Robinson and Harrison Ford co-stars as Rickey. It's written and directed by Brian Helgeland (who also wrote and directed one of my favorite films 'PAYBACK' as well as wrote other hits like 'MYSTIC RIVER', 'MAN ON FIRE' and 'GREEN ZONE'). The film is a good old fashioned baseball drama that's both emotional and packed with exciting sports action. The strongest element of the film though is how it deals with racism.<br/><br/>The story begins in 1946 when Branch Rickey signed Jackie Robinson to the minor league baseball team the Montreal Royals. Rickey makes Robinson promise that he'll control his temper and never let racist bigots get the better of him, which becomes the main component of the entire film. It then shifts to 1947 when Robinson plays for the Brooklyn Dodgers. It's here that Robinson faces his greatest challenge as he's opposed by almost everyone, including most of his teammates. Nevertheless Robinson triumphs and makes baseball history becoming Rookie of the Year (and later the Baseball Hall of Fame) and leading his team to the World Series.<br/><br/>Some say the film plays it a little too safe and family friendly but I was never bored. The baseball scenes are exciting and the emotional drama is always very moving. I think Helgeland does an excellent job brining the material to the big screen, thanks in large part to good performances by Boseman and especially Ford (who's almost unrecognizable in the role). The way the film tackles racism is it's greatest accomplishment though and shows it as something everyone can sympathize and or relate to. It reminds me of the problems our President faces being the first black man in his job (the world hasn't really changed all that much in that way).<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ge23zs5RPrM"

","Nobody's ever been a more devout Brooklyn fan than yours truly. I used to cut school, hop a bus to the Port Authority and then a subway to Ebbets Field. And when my ""Bums"" used to visit the hated NY Giants' Polo Grounds, I'd be out there wearing my blue Dodger cap while looking for a black eye. Yes indeed, Jackie was a terrific player and the REAL beginning of the Civil Rights Movement, years before Rosa Parks ever sat on that bus.<br/><br/>Before I critique ""42,"" I must say that Harrison Ford as Branch Rickey does an astounding job, steals the movie and will be a nominee for the Best Actor Oscar come Jan.'14. No kidding--he is something else.<br/><br/>I rated this movie as a 7, even if I was gung-ho Brooklyn. It contains too many errors to my liking. For example, the re-creation of Ebbets Field was not spot on and where was the Abe Stark ""hit the sign and win a free suit"" sign? However the recreation of the Reds' Crosley Field indeed was spot on. The recreation of the Polo Grounds was BAAAAAD except for the Chesterfield sign in deep center. What I saw was Ebbets posing as the Polo except for the sign. How about Jackie getting beaned by Fritz Ostermueller of the Pirates? Jackie rubbed his head and got back in the batter's box. Totally absurd. That ball came in at 98 mph and had it hit Jack, it would have ended his career because plastic helmets were yet to be used. However the guy who portrayed Fritz looked exactly like the Pitt. pitcher. And what's with the Pirate uniforms? They never had a cursive P on their caps nor did their home uniforms sport a cursive ""Pirates."" The Pirate uniform then as now presented block lettering. The depiction of Forbes Field was the same as Ebbets and the Polo Grounds and I failed to see ""Greenberg Gardens"" behind the scoreboard. I don't think I'm being picky either. ""42"" had a big opening and I expected to see baseball facts, not fiction.<br/><br/>The fellow playing Phillies' manager Ben Chapman was perfect to hate.And the truth is that he certainly was a stinking racist. The same for the Dodgers' Dixie Walker who was a Brooklyn premier player, hated people of color, made it tough for Jackie and Branch Rickey told him to shut up or be traded. In '48 Dixie became a Pirate while in '47, Jackie became MVP and took the Dodgers to the World Series against the Yankees who won. (The Yankees always won). <br/><br/>Branch Rickey was determined to bring a Negro into Major League baseball and as the picture describes, a lot of his determination was based on money. He saw the financial potential of drawing more and more black fans into Ebbets because of Jackie and by God, it worked. However Branch's humanitarianism was very visible. He refused to let Jackie quit amid the ugly catcalls and other demeaning occurrences. Branch was a visionary who knew if Jackie stayed, in would come the great Roy Camanella (my favorite Dodger) as well as hurler Don Newcombe who became the backbone of the staff. Good Lord, when I think back to those days of the perfect blend of white and black Dodgers and how they dominated the NL from 1947-1956, I get a warm and fuzzy feeling despite a guy named Bobby Thomson.<br/><br/>I miss Jackie. Man did he have guts and you'll see his indomnible spirit in the film. God rest his soul. ""None of youse guys know nuthin' 'bout baseball if you didn't root for ""Dem Bums."" Back in those days, the Yankees bought everybody who gave them trouble and the NY Giants were stuffy except for one black player who was the best player I ever saw. Willie Mays. Thanks to Jackie, we all thrilled to Willie. After Mo Rivera retires, no player in the Major Leagues will ever wear #42 again. It's the least baseball can do to honor the legend of Brooklyn Dodger #42. That man was pure class!"

","Although I had hoped that a movie called '42' was a sequel to a fantastic film called Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (if you don't get the reference, you should probably read the book and thank me later), a sports movie about racism is a good second prize. <br/><br/>Doing a race movie can be hard and there are so few that have done it well, which is why I think there aren't more of them (I've often wondered why there hasn't been a biopic of Martin Luther King Jr.). I will always love Remember the Titans, despite it being one of the more emotionally manipulative films I've ever seen. Also, Invictus remains one of my favorite Eastwood films. As a result, and as with most films this year, I was cautiously optimistic. <br/><br/>The Bad <br/><br/>The first 10 minutes felt way too heavy-handed for my tastes. The setup is really in your face and emotionally manipulative. <br/><br/>Harrison Ford's character (not his acting, mind you) seems to be the only non-racist white man at the beginning of the movie, and that's the extent of him. He seems to be one-trick pony, having conviction for conviction's sake. He came across more as a plot element than an actual character. That being said, Ford did do a good job in what direction he was given.<br/><br/>Most of the support players are not going to win any awards for their acting capabilities, either. They were as one-dimensional as Harrison Ford's character, playing plot devices rather than characters. I suspect this is the result of bad directing more than anything (although the director was also the writer). <br/><br/>The Good<br/><br/>The film did a great job helping the audience feel what it must have been like to be a black person pre-civil-rights in America, which I think is what they were trying to accomplish. There were many times that I teared up because of the cruel realities that African-Americans had to deal with. I also got emotional when certain characters experienced changes of heart. <br/><br/>I liked the cinematography more than most, and probably the best I've seen this year (although the competition is far from stiff). The dugout is a good example of expressionism in film if you'll ever find one in mainstream cinema. <br/><br/>The fellow that plays Jackie is really versatile and believable. Also, the main antagonists were really good; they made me believe that they were sincerely racist and had malice in their hearts. <br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>Overall I quite enjoyed this movie and I recommend it heartily to ALL. Is it going to win any awards? No. But it does remove you from the present and teaches the lessons of history in an effective and enjoyable way. 3.75/5 stars. <br/><br/>Parents Guide<br/><br/>I can see why the MPAA gave this a PG-13, because it is disturbing to watch the racial cruelty. However, it is the lightest PG-13 I've come across in a long time. I would consider this to be a family movie, except for small children. No nudity, no violence. Just tense scenes."

","Jackie Robinson is arguably the single most important sports figure of the 20th century. Robinson's story is historically extraordinary and utterly captivating. In sharing Robinson's inspirational story, some risks could have been taken in the approach to the filmmaking as well. Regrettably, you can't shake the feeling that writer/director Brian Helgeland is playing it safe, and not swinging for the fences. ""42"" is a warm-hearted, highly respectable film, but it fails to enrich or heighten Jackie Robinson's legacy.<br/><br/>""42"" tells the story of how Jackie Robinson broke the Major League color barrier in 1947, becoming the first black player to appear in a Major League baseball game since 1884. In 1946, Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) is a Negro League baseball player who never takes racism lying down. Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford) is a Major League team executive with a bold idea. Rickey recruits Robinson to break the unspoken color line as the first modern African American Major League baseball player. As both anticipate, this proves a pivotal challenge for Robinson and his family as they endure unrelenting racist hostility on and off the field, from player and fan alike. As Jackie struggles against his nature to endure such abuse without complaint, he finds allies and hope where he least expects it. <br/><br/>The performances are generally solid and highly believable. For his first major theatrical role, Chadwick Boseman turns in an impressive performance, and quite possibly the highlight of the film. While Robinson's story is worthy of the utmost respect and admiration, Helgeland plainly illustrates that in film making even a great man's life can get a bit bland. ""42"" effectively tells of Robinson's year in the minors and his first season with the Brooklyn Dodgers, while not doing a very good job of capturing Robinson's personality. He's portrayed more as a historical icon than a fully developed character. ""42"" feels like an overly sincere history lesson more so than a biography, but it's a history lesson of which we regularly need to be reminded."

"srkelley-01816","10","1","2","22 March 2019"," This is an AMAZING Movie
","The story of 42 The Story of Jackie Robinson is an AMAZING film. There is amazing acting in this film done by all characters. The main characters are Jackie Robinson played by Chadwick Boseman, Branch Rickey played By Harrison Ford, Rachel Robinson played by Nicole Benhaire and Ben Chapman played by Alan Tudyk. In 1946 there was 400 white baseball players in 1947 there was 399 white baseball players and 1 African American baseball players in the major league baseball. This movie is the story and struggle of how we went from 400 to 399.
The Movie starts off showing the negro baseball league and its super star Jackie Robinson. Then we go to the owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers, Mr. Ricky is looking for an African American to play on his team. This is where the theme of the movie comes in as with persistence and the right attitude anything is possible. There are several themes to this film, but I think the one above sums up all of them well.
As you can imagine this was not any easy thing for Jackie to do. Jackie and Rachel received many threats of their lives and their child's lives. The battle of hope we will call it starts right off the bat when Rachel and Jackie try to fly to Florida for spring training this is where Rachel sees an all-white bathroom for the first time, and they get bumped from their flight for a white couple. They get run out of the first town in Florida by a mob that they were told was coming for Jackie. Then in the second city Jackie was told to get off the field or be arrested.
Jackie spends his first year in the minor leagues. They go to Panama City for the second year of spring training and the major league players sign a petition to not allow Jackie to play on the team. This doesn't work for them. This dose not work for them in fact after returning to New York from Panama City Jackie is offered a position on the Brooklyn Dodgers. This is when Jackie gets tested as to how bad he wants this.
Jackie is tested by the Phillies manager Ben Chapman, because when Jackie is up to bat Ben yells all kinds of racial slurs. Ben also yells to one of the other Dodgers players to tell them that Jackie is sleeping with his wife, which of course is false. This causes Jackie to almost lose it but he received a pep talk from Mr. Ricky who explained to him his greater purpose. He said he provided hope for all children in America including white children. Jackie finally gets his team to believe in him and they come together. A player purposely steps on Jackie's leg and cuts him. The team wants to hit the next player in the head, but Jackie knows how important it is to him and everyone in the country for him to not blow this opportunity of a lifetime to change the world.
I think this movie can be very inspirational to anybody that watches it. The story shows how if a person is determined they can get thru anything. If you think about the things Jackie went through for the greater good of all-American people including African Americans, we can go thru any struggle that comes our way, because I think we would be hard pressed to find anything remotely close to what Jackie went thru. I think the movie showed that he was one of the greatest Americans of all time."

","This is my favorite baseball and historical movie. My dad took me to see this when I was 12 years old and it showed me the horrors of racism. Chadwick Boseman who plays Jackie Robinson does an amazing job portraying one of my heroes. Branch Rickey, played by Harrison Ford, is funny and the acting is very well done. It is crazy that one man started to change the entire sport of baseball for the better. I liked the baseball parts when it showed Jackie Robinson's skill and I think as long as someone is good at something it doesn't matter what they look like. Obviously the racism was awful but I am glad they empathized it to show how horrible it was (and still is in some places). I didn't like the part when the white child was yelling the n-word because everyone else was but I guess the directors and writers meant for that to hurt. I think the movie was historically accurate but I don't know a lot about what it was like back then. I think this movie is really good and would recommend it to anyone."
"Benjamin-M-Weilert","9","1","2","8 March 2019"," A fantastic film about courage, determination, and family.
","In today's charged racial climate, it seems that we haven't come that far from the 1940's. All the barriers that have been broken to allow equal opportunities to everyone don't seem to matter if the heart of the people has not been changed. Needless to say, several films have been made in the last few years which have highlighted the racial struggles of the pioneers in their respective professions. Initially, I was skeptical that 42 (2013) would devolve into your standard ""fight against racism"" story, but the expert camerawork, peppy pacing, and superb casting really made this movie for me.<br/><br/>Having played baseball myself up through my senior year in high school, the appeal of a story about the game is what initially piqued my interest. The fact that this is a story about one of the most recognizable names in baseball was merely icing on the cake. There have been a number of baseball films over the years, and I feel this one is probably one of the better ones because it focused on the skill of the player. After all, the whole reason Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) was given a shot was because he could win games with his talents, not because he was white.<br/><br/>Yes, this film does focus heavily on the struggle of being the first to break through the race barrier, but it's done in such a way that you can feel the strength of Robinson's character each time he is insulted. Not to mention the fact that this movie also highlights the fact that he was a loving husband and father, which helps make this quite the uplifting film. The other side of the uplifting coin is the superb acting talent of Harrison Ford (it took me almost half the movie to recognize him under those bushy eyebrows the first time I saw this film). His character's homespun, faith-based approach to life left me feeling quite inspired.<br/><br/>A fantastic film about courage, determination, and family, I give 42 4.5 stars out of 5."

","I really enjoyed watching 42. Chadwick Boseman did an excellent job at playing Jackie Robinson. He really shows the ups and downs of the character. I like how they got all the props, it gave the movie a great feel of living in that era. It was a really inpiring movie of never giving up even when more then half a country dislike you for something that was out of your control. My favorite seen was when Jackie was getting his calf stitched and Branch rickie comes and tells Jackie why he is on the team."
"tdb-22133","8","1","2","21 February 2019"," Beyond the Game
","The movie 42 is biographical recap of the life of famed baseball player Jackie Robinson. With Robinson being the first African American player to play in the major leagues, the movie revolves around his struggle to break the color barrier. The movie thus captures the national struggle of accepting and looking beyond skin color. Beyond the movie's deep rooted baseball origins, 42 appeals to a broader audience as it highlights Robinson's story of personal struggle with racism and how he managed to triumph despite all the naysayers.
Late in the movie, Robinson and the Brooklyn Dodgers warm up on the field for a game in Cincinnati. Meanwhile, a white father and his roughly seven or eight year old son are discussing what they wish to see from this game. While they both exhibit clear excitement to see fellow Brooklyn Dodger Pee Wee Reese, Robinson proceeds to walk on to the field. Calm in demeanor and minding his own business, Robinson is showered with racial slurs right when he steps foot on the field. Despite being in the presence of his child, even the white father proceeds to shout racial slurs at Robinson. Hearing the constant heckling and out pour of hateful slurs, the young child feels pressured to also join the crowd in hating on Robinson. So, the child then chimes in his own racially insensitive attempt to fit in with the then social norm. The camera then cuts to the field where Robinson and Pee Wee are warming up. Much to Robinson's surprise, Pee Wee suddenly interrupts the back and forth warm up to come over to Robinson and offer some of his thanks. Despite starting the conversation with a tricky and accidental slip up of a race related insult, Pee Wee quickly recovers, throwing his arm around Jackie in consolation, and delivering the line, ""Thank you Jackie... I got family up there from Louisville and I need them to know. I need them to know who I am."" The camera then quickly cuts right back to the child as the sound of reluctant applause begins to slowly fill the stadium. Seeing his idol Pee Wee making it publicly known of not only his acceptance but his good friendship with Robinson, the child proceeds to question his own actions. The manner in which the child looks down in shame makes it clear that he too even questions why do African American people get this hatred. Above all else, the scene accomplishes the movie's purpose: to highlight the personal struggle that Robinson seamlessly endured and that racism is learned rather than born with.
The movie's closing scene takes place against the Pittsburgh Pirates in which the Brooklyn Dodgers needed the win in order to clinch the National League pennant. Robinson, flourishing in his role as a rookie, steps up to bat but is met by the same pitcher, Austin Muller, that nailed him in the head earlier in the season. The pitcher proceeds to throw three balls before Robinson calls to him, ""give me something I can hit."" The pitcher, insistent on claiming that Robinson doesn't belong here both from a playability and racial standpoint, gives him a formidable pitch but is unsuccessful as Robinson hits the ball right out of the park. Robinson is then greeted with applause and a heartwarming welcome from his fellow teammates at home plate. In the mean time, Muller hung his head in shame after allowing Robinson to score the game and pennant clinching hit, disappointed to have to eat his own words. While appealing to the baseball junkies of the world, 42 allures even those who aren't as fond of baseball. Robinson's courage to perform under immense pressure and high scrutiny to defy all odds as the first African American baseball player is what makes this movie all the more powerful.
42 managed to perfectly capture the sheer amount of hatred Robinson had to face while first playing in the Major Leagues. Robinson's courage to overcome those obstacles, face life threats, and encounter tremendous amounts of hatred nearly without flinching makes him an American hero. In doing so, 42 manages to bring to light a message that goes beyond baseball: that hatred is learned and is not a part of human nature. Moreover, from start to end, the movie offers another message through Robinson's slow and steady way of wooing over a hostile audience through his scrappy and eye catching gameplay: believing in yourself during times of adversity makes you a winner in your own right. Thus, 42's inspirational story telling of Robinson's venture into the unknown makes a captivating experience that every person should get to enjoy."

","This was a fabulous movie that makes a very engaging interpretation out of a truly historic moment, both in sports and in the entirety of America. Boseman's portrayal of Robinson enables us to connect with his struggles. Laugh with him, cry with him, and cheer with him. The dynamics of the actors and the subject of the movie will keep you engaged until the end of the credits. Apart from the great movie writing, but the influence this man had on the United States is portrayed incredibly well with the contention and the development of the new ideas of equality that were in their infancy at this time and this inspires people to make changes...

","I loved this movie. I have this this movie before and have just decided to watch it and it is fantastic. It is in of the better colored movies i have. The emotion in it was great. I loved how it captured the reality of the colored. Today people are treated as equal, well sometimes. Its unfortunate for those who do not get treated as an equal. I loved how Jackie overcame all the name calling and played a thing he loved. He did get put down yes but i think it was the key point of it all because if it wasn't for him things might not have changed and the perspective of colored would not have changed."
"torijohn33","10","1","2","8 February 2019"," Jackie Robinson
","My favorite scene is towards the end when they kind of accept him into baseball. I really love the Dodgers. The filmmaker is telling us to keep pushing even when times get hard. The filmmaker is also telling us no to give up even when everyone is against you. I knew that they were going though a racial dispute. Yes I have because that's all we watch in your class. But I have seen this movie before. The lack of respect that people had towards him made me question historical accuracy. No I have not seen any movies by this director. One of the characters plays in Grey's Anatomy. Another one of my favorite scenes is when they won and went to nationals. Things I liked was it showed Robinson and his amazing years though baseball. I didn't like the racism in this movie. I would recommend this movie and I would watch it outside of school."
"fanny92","10","1","2","6 February 2019"," 100% On My Movie Meter
","I always remember learning about Jackie Robinson in elementary and how he was the first African American man to play in major league baseball, but that is about it. We never learned about what he really went through. My first experience watching 42 was at school. I loved it and it became one of my favorite movies. I immediately had my family watch it and it became a favorite for all of us. I have watched it several more times and love it every time. One of the greatest scenes in this movie reminds me of when I was in elementary school learning about Pee Wee Reese putting his arm around Jackie Robinson. Learning about that as a young kid, I never really understood why he did that, and I never really understood racism, but watching that scene when I was older, I understood.
The movie follows Jackie Robinson as he makes it onto the Montreal Royals baseball team and then goes on to be the first African American in major league baseball as a Brooklyn Dodger. It also follows Branch Rickey as he breaks the color barrier in baseball.
Like I said before, I already knew that Jackie Robinson was the first African American to play in major league baseball before watching this movie, but that's all I really knew about him. After I watched this movie I was able to see what he really had to go through and the courage that he had to have to not fight back. I love the history in this movie and always find it amazing to learn about very courageous people. With every historical movie, I always question the accuracy because you never know if everything portrayed in the movie will be right or not. With this movie, I didn't ever really question the accuracy. I would still need to read up on Jackie Robinson's story more to see if this movie is really accurate, but what I have read of his story, the movie follows. I really love that this movie can be applied today. Racism is still going on around us and this movie helps to fight against that. There are also many people in today's world that have to be courageous like Jackie Robinson because of discrimination whether they are in a group being discriminated or whether they are being discriminated against personally.
The director of this movie is Brian Helgeland. I have never heard of him before, and haven't seen any of the movies he's directed besides this one, but I am familiar with some of them. He did an amazing job directing this movie. The main actors in this movie are Chadwick Boseman, Harrison Ford, Nicole Beharie. I love Harrison Ford and Chadwick Boseman as actors. I have never seen Nicole Beharie in another movie, but she was a great actress in this movie. My favorite scene in this movie was after Ben Chapman had been bad mouthing Jackie on the field. Jackie almost couldn't take it, but he kept on going and fighting for what was right.
I really loved the acting in this movie and I loved the message that was given to keep fighting for the right thing. I could watch this movie a million more times and not get sick of it. I love learning about the history of civil rights and the civil rights issues and I love this movie because it shows how those issues were fought against, but in a different setting than a lot of other civil rights movies I have seen. I recommend this movie for those who love history, specifically the history of the civil rights era, and for those who just love baseball."
"karlgarc","10","1","2","6 February 2019"," Amazing!!
","I'm not really a fan of baseball, but 42 was easily one of the best films i've ever watched. One really great scene in the movie was when Ben Chapman was calling Jackie names to make him mad and distract him from winning the game for his team. I think this scene was great because Jackie controlled his temper in such a good way. As heartbreaking as it was to watch him have to take that without being able to do anything about it, it was nice to watch him win and see Ben Chapman and his team lose.
The plot of this movie was that racism was huge in the baseball community. When Ricky hired Jackie to play for the Dodgers it showed that Jackie, a black man, was just as capable, even better at baseball than so many of the white men also playing baseball at the time.
I knew that racism was very big and so real, I just never knew it was a huge problem in sports as well. I thought white men would be happy to win tournaments without the color of one's skin bothering them in any way. Boy was I wrong. Racism isn't too big of a problem anymore. Don't get me wrong, it still very much exists, but it's not as bad as it was years ago.
Brian Helgeland is the director of 42. Other movies directed by Brian Helgeland are: Payback, A knight's tale, The order, and Legend; I have not watched any of those other movies directed by him. I have watched movies he's been in though, such as highway to hell, and A nightmare on elm street (I think 4). I think he's a great actor. Chadwick Boseman did an amazing job, acting wise, as Jackie Robinson.
I liked the acting of most characters in the movie. I loved how much Ricky supported and pushed Jackie to help him succeed in his baseball career. I would have definitely watched this movie on my own time outside of school. I would 10/10 recommend this movie to friends."
"dianmart","8","1","2","6 February 2019"," Greatest team .
","Director of 42 is Brian Helgeland . Main characters Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman), Branch Rickey(Harrison Ford), Rachael Robinson( Nicole Beharie). This movie shows this historic background of baseball and was it was like and what was the reaction of people when a colored person was introduced to a white baseball team. My favorite part of the movie was when pee wee hugged Jackie for the whole stadium to see, and he did it without people telling him to do it for fame . I didn't like when they treated Jackie unfairly and said nasty things to him. It's sad that this is reality. And it's still seen to this day . Overall I enjoyed this movie a lot . And I would watch it again."

","""I'm just here to play ball"" -Jackie Robinson<br/><br/>This movie is about the famous ball player Jackie Robinson. And all the obstacles he went through when playing baseball. It starts off right after the civil war and people were still really racist and bigotry.
I didn't know much about Jackie Robinson but I found interesting that his coming up with also the beginning of many other peoples. I think this movie was pretty accurate.
The director is Brian Helgeland. Some main actos are Chadwick Boseman #wakanda4life, Harrison Ford, Lucas Black, and Nicole Beharie.
I really like the entire movie. I think that it gives viewers the point of view that not many get to see. You can really experience the pain and tension through the entire movie. I would totally recommend this movie to a friend and even watch it on my own time. Overall this movie is a great movie with a good life lesson."

","I thought that you his movie was amazing to not just watch, but learn from. A scene that was small but powerful was when a white boy yelled profanities only because his dad was. It showed that the environment can create a less desireable character. The movie was about a baseball player named Jack ""Jackie"" Robison. It showed his experience both on and off the field. As well as how deep the ignorance some people can stoop to. I didn't know anything about Jackie Robison other than he was a great ball player. I'm glad that I watched this to see how great of a person he was. Robison was able to turn the other cheek, despite attempts from couches and players trying to get a reaction. It makes me happy that at least a few of his teammates defended him when this happened. One of my favorite scenes from the movie is when one of the reporters said ""they have a longer heel bone, so that gives him an unfair speed advantage"". The second he said that, Robison hit a home run and the other reporters laughed at his statement. I have seen the main actor (Chadwick Boseman) in one other film called Black Panther and Harrison Ford in many others. I think both are very fine actors and can make a connection with the audience. I completely loved this movie and would watch it again if I had the chance. I really like the fact that they didn't sugar coat anything, they showed the reality of what was happening. I completely recommend it to all of my friends and any one who is thinks about watching it."

","This was a good history and baseball movie. It portrays both worlds of how African Americans were living and how baseball played a roll in Americans lives. This movie is a about the first black man to join a professional baseball team Jackie Robinson. He goes through a lot of trials of multiple individuals and even his teammates being racist towards him. The history part of this movie is very interesting, you get to see how racist people were even when it came down to a sport. It's interesting to see now that most out sports are mainly African Americans. Chadwick Bozeman plays Jackie Robinson and he does a great job at doing so. He also plays in another great film black panther. Another actor that was great was Harrison Ford, I've never seen him in other movies by I've heard he's in Star Wars. My favorite scene from this movie would have to be when his teammates start to stand up for Jackie and begin to accept him. I would watch this movie again, I always saw previews of it I just never watched it. I would recommend it to friends and friend and overall thought they did a good job."

","I personally love this movie because one of our family friends played for the dodgers. My favorite scene from this movie is when he gets stepped on but he just gets back up and tells his team to keep going. In this movie I feel like the filmmaker is telling the world that they need to treat everyone equally. This movie shows a god example of pushing your self even when things don't work out they way you want them to. In this part of history I knew that this was a big problem.This pat of history is one of the most interesting to me. I know that still to this day people call others the N word. I have not seen other movies by this director. The baseball manager for the Dodgers also plays as a doctor in Grey' Anatomy. I do love them as actors. I really liked that he didn't let what other people were saying bring him down or stop him from doing what he loves. I didn't like how much they used the N word in this movie. I also didn't like how they were always trying to bring him down. If I were to recommend this movie I would probably recommend it to my cousin who plays baseball. Yes I would watch this movie outside of school."
"dimafaro","7","1","2","5 February 2019"," Amazing acting, very inspirational and heartfelt
","Jackie Robinson was the first black baseball player in the Dodgers, and in taking on that role he faced tremendous challenges with racist America. Segregation was the norm, in EVERYTHING, and only the white baseball players got to be accredited. Robinson is portrayed (rightfully so) as a very emotionally strong character who fought racism by controlling his anger (although he had a right to be angry). He did not fight anyone or give them a chance to accuse him of anything, he simply out-played them.<br/><br/>I love almost everything about this movie, but the thing that stands out is the quality of the acting. It must be very awkward to yell out racial slurs, and even more awkward to take it, but the execution was flawless and lifelike.<br/><br/>The one criticism I have is specific to me and my knowledge of baseball (or lack thereof). I do not usually enjoy sports movies because I do not know much, and this movie did a good job of balancing the sports and social commentary, but I got tremendously bored during the first half of the movie because it was primarily sports-talk.<br/><br/>Overall, really good movie. I would recommend this to a friend who enjoyed sports movies. 0 explosions, but still good."

","""Break an unwritten law and you will be an out cast.""<br/><br/>Facing an uphill battle Branch Ricky (Harrison Ford) finds the right African-American ballplayer to break the color barrier in baseball. Rickey's reasons are diverse being both altruistic, having a sense of justice, old guilty feelings, and the desire to win and make money. Chadwick Boseman portrays the Jackie Robinson of legend, an overly talented, silent, and classy individual. While the film is about him, it shows things that go on behind the scenes.<br/><br/>The film starts with a quick background and goes into Jackie's minor league trials and tribulations on and off the field. Ricky supported Robinson off the field anyway he could, but on the field Jackie was alone. It shows the break through of his teammates to overcome the prejudicial urges they grew up with. Minds winning over emotions to do what was right.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, it shows whites behaving badly and makes Philadelphia look bad. It gives us a glimpse of the ugly side of baseball, one we really don't want to see. In spite of the heavy and historical use of the N-word, it is a film that makes audiences stand up and applaud.<br/><br/>What the film doesn't tell you about is all the children that were named Jack or Jackie because of this man.<br/><br/>Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.

","As a family movie about sports, history, and civil rights, this film works. It is hard NOT to be compelling with this story, after all. Almost every single powerful moment or conversation actually happened. Jackie Robinson's journey was indeed epic. But there are some pretty serious flaws too. Flaw 1: Harrison Ford's attempted impersonation of Branch Rickey is super-distracting, especially because the director seems to agree with Ford that this movie is about him. Flaw 2: this feels like a Disney-fied version of history at points...too many touching changes of heart and a hero that feels a bit too perfect. So you end up with a great story and a just ok movie. Too bad, but not bad either."
"troyhoch","9","1","2","11 November 2017"," A Tip of the Cap
","""42"", the story of Jackie Robinson, hits the ball just right. Aided by a clever script and great performances from actors across the board, this film doesn't lose itself in the game of baseball. <br/><br/>Paying homage to the 40s in terms of decor, the setting is carefully thought out. It takes just the right balance from off the diamond to on the diamond. In addition, ""42"" speaks for itself by its deep expedition through racial tensions. <br/><br/>I personally wouldn't call it just a baseball movie for baseball fans. Non-sports fans can also enjoy its representation of the hero Jackie Robinson. One of the strengths of this film comes from its acting, with the entire cast pulling off terrific performances. Definitely the most prominent was Harrison Ford (Branch Rickey). Ford wasn't just acting as Branch Rickey, he IS Branch Rickey. As for Chadwick Boseman (Jackie Robinson), he takes on the commanding lead role and never backs down. <br/><br/>Finally, not drawing itself too far from its source material or being told just by the book, ""42"" deserves an earnest tip of the cap for its superb adaptation."
"Red-125","9","1","2","30 August 2017"," Solid film biopic of a truly great man
","42 (2013) was written and directed by Brian Helgeland. It tells the story of Jackie Robinson, the first Black baseball player to play on a major league team.<br/><br/>I grew up in Brooklyn, and we kids thought of the Dodgers almost as members of our family. I watched Jackie Robinson play in Ebbets Field many times. Chadwick Boseman, the actor who portrays Jackie Robinson, looks like Robinson, and has imitated his style on the base paths perfectly. This is the film to see if you want to know what the game of baseball looked like in the late 1940's into the mid 1950's. (Of course, it looked predominantly White, although other Black players soon followed Robinson into the majors.) <br/><br/>Both Harrison Ford as Branch Rickey, and Nicole Beharie as Rachel Robinson give solid acting performances. However, a movie like this rises or falls on the abilities of the star. Boseman has great abilities, and he makes the movie work.<br/><br/>This is an excellent movie to watch with your children or grandchildren. They will find it hard to believe that African-Americans weren't allowed to play major league baseball. It's a great way to bring the segregated universe of the mid-20th Century to their attention. It's also a great way to show them that the right person, at the right time, can bring about a true change in society.<br/><br/>P.S. We kids had no problem at all with a Black player on the Dodgers. All we cared about was winning the pennant and the World Series. We knew that Robinson could help the Dodgers win, and winning was what we wanted!"
"CinematicInceptions","5","1","2","4 September 2016"," Feel-good, but not inspiring.
","I don't want to say that this isn't a story worth telling, but it wasn't a story that needed to be told. Jackie Robinson had a huge impact on baseball for sure, and it took guts and everything to do what he did. However, the only valid reason to talk about the past is if it affects what we are going to do in the present, and I don't think this qualifies. You may feel differently, and if you enjoyed this movie or think that you will enjoy it, stop reading now so that you can remain motivated by whatever you find in this movie. And don't think that I can't ruin your view of this movie because I can. So do yourself a favor and keep loving this movie and all that it means to you.<br/><br/>Now that we have that out of the way, I can start talking. I liked this movie when I first saw it in theaters. But three years later, it just annoys me. As I watched it for the third time, I realized that it's really just two hours of the same scene being repeated thirty times over. We do feel for him after seeing the emotional abuse that he goes through, but they could have done more with the time that they had. Very likely, the people behind this movie made it because they wanted to make a difference to the lives of their audience, which is perfectly admirable. However, they confused inspiring with feel-good, as many people tend to do. This is a *feel-good* movie much more than it is an inspirational one. It's only inspirational if it makes you want to do something about what you see, and there isn't that much potential for that.<br/><br/>Also, Jackie Robinson helped end segregation, which is not the form that racism takes anymore in America. So it mostly serves as a pat on the back to Americans showing how far we've come in 70 odd years. Now, I know why no major studio has come out with a movie that deals with modern racism or Black Lives Matter or anything like that: they want to avoid public disapproval for whatever points or portrayals they make. It's understandable but sad. However, if you want a movie that is going to actually give insight about how to solve the problems of modern race issues, this isn't the one. <br/><br/>I'm not saying that you shouldn't watch it, but you might just want to rethink what you're looking for in your black history month movie. I wouldn't say that it's a bad movie. It has good intentions, but its heart is also stuck in the past and less capable of changing the present. Overall Rating: 6.3/10."
"MacTheMovieguy","7","1","2","23 July 2014"," ""A great breakthrough performance.""
","If you believe in uplifting sports dramas, you'll believe in 42. Is it groundbreaking, or the best sports drama ever? Will it live eternally in the pantheon alongside movies like Eight Men Out, Bull Durham, Field of Dreams, and The Natural? Possibly. Time will tell.<br/><br/>42 is the true life story of Jackie Robinson, the groundbreaking black baseball player who changed the way we play baseball. Not only did he bring his color to the game, but he also brought his own style to the game. He stole more bases his season than any other player. Jackie (Boseman) is plucked from obscurity in the negro leagues by Branch Rickey (Ford). Rickey believes it's time to desegregate baseball, and he's picked Jackie as the one to do it. He's a good player, and more importantly, Jackie understands that fighting off the field isn't the way to win, being the best player on the field is. Jackie brings along his wife (Beharie) for the ride, and a writer (Holland). Together, they all change the minds of the players on the field, and inspire generations to come.<br/><br/>Boseman is great as Jackie. It's a great breakthrough performance, and I hope we see a lot more from him. Beharie is solid as his wife, though I could see her being forgotten coming out of this. Alan Tudyk has a showy role as the guy you're gonna hate, no matter what. The rest of the supporting cast is solid in their roles. And then there's Harrison Ford...<br/><br/>Just before watching 42, I was watching a trailer of Emperor, and I was thinking to myself how Tommy Lee Jones is basically Tommy Lee Jones in every movie he does. He especially doesn't try and change his speech patterns. I was annoyed by this idea, then I watched Harrison Ford in 42. Now I'm OK with certain actors not being asked to change their style. Harrison Ford should never change his acting style... ever. He's so over-the-top, so inexplicably out of place in this drama, it actually causes me to not enjoy the movie as much when he's on screen. I love Harrison Ford as an actor, but this is probably the worst acting he's ever done.<br/><br/>Had someone else been in the role, or if Ford had been told to just play the role straight, I might have been able to give 42 an A. It's a pretty solid film, dragging only a little in the middle. Brian Helgeland could have used a bit more focus. There are times when you don't know if he's focusing on the team, or on Jackie's story. There are scenes in the movie that work better if the movie is like Miracle, where you're rooting for the whole team to win the season, not just one player to break down barriers. That, coupled with Ford's acting, makes for a good, but slightly uneven film."

","The story of Jackie Robinson stands as an inspiration to anyone who knows about him. In reading about this man, it was said that he wasn't the best African American player and there was another player, much better, who should have been the first to break the color barrier in baseball. But Robinson's story is about so much more than baseball. I don't know anything about the person mentioned, and I'm sure he was an excellent player. But someone has to go first, and in this case, it was a young man who was able to withstand everything that was thrown at him - literally.<br/><br/>There were some surprises for me in the movie, one of which was Harrison Ford. Ford is what I call an old-fashioned movie star. Unlike someone like Johnny Depp or Meryl Streep who change their looks and voices and immerse themselves in a character, Ford is more like Gable or one of the Golden Era stars: He's a solid leading man, he does drama and comedy, and projects a strong image. This was all blown out of the water. As Branch Rickey, the man who introduced Robinson to baseball, he moves into another league as an actor as he inhabits Rickey in stance and voice and attitude.<br/><br/>The other surprises were more shocks - it's hard to grasp that a soldier who refused to move to the back of the bus would have been court-martialed. It's truly disgusting. And how he could play ball with players who were trying to injure him, people screaming at him from the stands, I have no idea.<br/><br/>Chadwick Boseman was fantastic as Jackie - you could see Jackie's thought process on his face as he struggled with his emotions. He portrays a gentle demeanor, though Robinson had a spine of steel and wasn't afraid to speak up. Boseman had good chemistry with the lovely Nicole Beharie, who played Jackie's wife. Chris Meloni captured the spirit of Leo Durocher perfectly; Andre Holland, Lucas Black, Alan Tudyk, T.R. Knight were all terrific.<br/><br/>Robinson died from diabetes and heart complications at 53, shortly after the death of his oldest son, who died in a car accident at 25 and had a long struggle with drugs after serving in Vietnam.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Robinson was the right man for the job at hand. He is one of our great heroes. He might have not been able to withstand the pressure and dropped out, but he kept fighting and winning."

","From director Brian Helgeland comes a wonderful biopic on the life and career of baseball icon Jackie Robinson. Named after his signature number, the film chronicles his rise to stardom after being chosen by baseball manager Branch Rickey to become the first African American to play on the Brooklyn Dodgers. Chadwick Boseman as Robinson is great. He portrays Robinson with the utmost sincerity. The confidence and determination he displays along with his willingness to succeed despite facing prejudice and discrimination is more than admirable. Harrison Ford is a joy to watch as Branch Rickey, the manager who chose not to conform to societal standards or fall victim to racism. Nicole Beharie also gives a blissful performance as wife Rachel Robinson. In addition, the movie dives deep into the times as it focuses on the extreme hate and racism that occurred. The racism that's depicted is brutal and sometimes difficult to watch. Overall, ""42"" is a must see. Two thumbs up !"
"KineticSeoul","8","1","2","19 July 2013"," One of the best biographical sports movie I have ever seen!
","This is one of the best biographical sports movie I have ever seen. And has just about all right elements and balance to make one of the greatest sports legend come alive. And after watching this movie I just wanted to research and know more about the guy. Jackie Robinson is portrayed in this movie as this charismatic, tough(physically and emotionally), talented and respectable person. Who had flare and knew how to stand up for himself in a rightful and courageous manner, with morals I could agree with. A person just about anyone can look up to as a role model. And it shows the obstacles and challenges he had to overcome and thus being a part of breaking the color line. And this movie is inspirational, it had my attention because of the heart and soul elements of it all. Which lead me to care and attach myself to some of these historical figures. The actor that played Jackie Robinson was great at bringing out the charisma/presence and the pain Jackie was going through because of prejudice issues during that time. But Harrison Ford was great as well as Branch Rickey, he played one of the top supporting actors with this role. I am kinda bummed out that I didn't first see this movie in theater. In my opinion it's better than ""Remember the Titans"" which is another great movie that touches upon racism. By the end I wanted to applaud.<br/><br/>8.4/10"
"Robert_duder","10","1","2","13 July 2013"," Pass me my Oscar ballot...I need to make some checks
","Maybe I'm getting soft or maybe I was just hoping to find some better films in 2013 than I did in 2012. I didn't hand out a single 10/10 in 2012...no kidding. Closest I came was Les Miserables and Life of Pi. Now this year this will already be my second 10/10 and I'm proud to give it to them both. My first was Evil Dead...a vastly different movie than this. I suspected I would enjoy 42, what I didn't expect was to be completely and utterly blown away by it. How many times have we seen this type of film? How many times have we seen films that fought racism and showed us a time in history when people struggled to be equal? For that matter, how many times have we seen an uplifted baseball film? Well it doesn't matter because this one is so beyond inspirational, it is brilliant and breathtaking and gives us at least two of the best performances I have seen in months if not years. 42 had me in tears at every turn, it had me cheering and laughing and crying and feeling every gambit of emotion. It is impeccably created and made with such heart that it just reeks of film greatness. It is so incredibly entertaining but this film is so much more than that. This is the type of brilliantly made film making that teaches us, inspires us and reminds us of history.<br/><br/>There are two performances in this film that if they don't get Oscar recognition I'll be thoroughly surprised but then the Academy doesn't much care for this type of mainstream film no matter how good it is. Chadwick Boseman in basically his big screen debut is astounding and mind blowing as the one and only Jackie Robinson. Boseman is passionate and real and just gets to you in every way and he just comes across as a baseball hero. He looks the part, plays the part and is brilliant in the role. There is no justice if he doesn't get recognized for this role in Award season somewhere. Second only to his performance is the amazing Harrison Ford. I've loved Ford for years as many of us have but this was something I did not expect. Lately, in his films he's seemed to show his age and not have the same heart he once had but this was stunning. He is riveting as Branch Rickey. This is his big opportunity to win an Oscar because he just nails this role in every which way. The chemistry with him and Boseman is perfection and both men bring history to life and knock it out of the park (pun intended.) The supporting cast were also excellent. Some of the best performances to watch for are Nicole Beharie as Jackie's devoted wife, Christopher Meloni was really good as Leo Durocher, Ryan Merriman, and Lucas Black are worth mentioning in small but pivotal roles as Jackie's team mates. Andre Holland is really good but sort of underused as Wendell Smith. I suspect that a historical figure like Smith could almost handle his own film and they didn't want him to over power Jackie Robinson's story. Holland still did a great job in a small role. Alan Tudyk had a fairly small role in the film but man...if small roles make an impact, this guy made it HUGE!! Tudyk is infuriating and captivating as Ben Chapman. Easily the best scene in the film (and the most eye-opening and disturbing) is the scene with Tudyk's Chapman mercilessly taunting Boseman's Robinson.<br/><br/>Brian Helgeland wrote the script and helm-ed the film and he is a talented guy as a write. He has written some of the best horror/Sci-fi and drama and he clearly knows how to exact emotion from his audience. His directing shows less experience but 42 proved he knows how to translate his skill as a writer onto the big screen. I was annoyed by the trailers of this film because of the inexplicable and unnecessary rap music playing over the clips of 1940's Baseball. Much to my relief, that was strictly to bring in the mainstream crowds. The film stays true to its time period and will immerse you in the good, bad and ugly of the 1940's sports world. I'm not an overly emotional movie watcher but when a movie really pushes my emotions to the limits, I have great respect for it and 42 did that and more. It is a baseball movie of course but there is so much more to it than that. This is about pioneering civil rights and what a player like Jackie Robinson meant to people. I encourage you to see this and tell others to see it because this is a powerhouse of a movie that was not given its just rewards when it was released. Yes it did ""well"" but this is beyond just good. Bravo. 10/10"
"RogerCampbell","10","1","2","21 April 2013"," 42 is not just a movie about baseball, it's about courage.
","This is a movie that is not just about baseball, it's more about the courage of men. Special men like Jackie Robinson, Branch Rickey and Pee Wee Reese not only helped change the game of baseball, they helped change humanity and civil rights by showing the courage that they did in accepting Jackie Robinson not only as a baseball player, but as a man, a human being with equal rights the same as anybody else.<br/><br/>Chadwick Boseman does an outstanding job playing the great Jackie Robinson, while Harrison Ford is superb as Branch Rickey. This has to be one of Ford's finest performances as the GM of the Dodgers who has a ""great experiment"" that he wants to try that will ultimately change baseball forever. An excellent supporting cast is highlighted by Lucas Black as Pee Wee Reese, the great ball player from Kentucky who was one of the first of the Brooklyn Dodgers to really accept Jackie Robinson not only as a player and a teammate, but as a man and a friend. Other fine performances were from Nicole Beharie as Rachel Robinson, Christopher Meloni as Leo Durocher, Hamish Linklater as Ralph Branca and a memorable performance by Alan Tudyk as the racist, overbearing and ignorant Manager of the Philadelphia Phillies who pushes Robinson to the brink of breaking with his racial insensitivity and ignorance.<br/><br/>42 is an excellent movie. In my opinion it is a must see movie, not just for baseball for fans, but for everybody. And if you are a history buff you will appreciate the attention to detail with the sets, costumes other miscellaneous items of the time period. It is clearly one of the best movies of 2013 so far."
"aharmas","Null","1","2","13 April 2013"," Class and Dignity
","Jackie Robinson is a special individual. The first time I read about his story and experiences, I was extremely moved by his courage and talent. It was especially touching when I learned about Pee Wee Reese offered his support, and both taught the world to see beyond ignorance and prejudice. In fact, for such a powerful film, one of the scenes that impacts the most has him on the field, and we see Pee Wee, two members of his family, and Jackie register every possible emotion, from frustration, to shame, to relief in a few minutes. ""42"" is full of those moments, when powerful source material is treated with respect and care. It is hard not to be moved by the world as seen through the eyes of baseball players and audiences. It is time to face an ugly time in American history, but it's great to see how this leads to more possible hope and understanding.<br/><br/>Jackie is trail blazer. He puts his dignity and faith to the test as he confronts the wrath of those who see him as less than deserving of the place he takes in their world. There are some painful scenes to watch as he endures verbal and physical abuse. It's horrible to see supposedly educated people who are there to protect him turn their backs on him, and it is even worse to watch how he can't defend himself because that could set the little progress he has made back. Others come through and offer support, and things end up getting better, but it's sad to witness how one human being humiliates another because of the color of their skin.<br/><br/>Mercifully, there are moments of peace and beauty to show us we are not all alone. It is great to see him and his wife love each other, the support of the team's owner, and how little by little his team members learn to accept change. The film doesn't hold back with the corrosive language. It is meant to be there to show us that this really happened, and that racism is harmful and painful.<br/><br/>""42"" is a classic from the beginning and deserves to be recognized for its many qualities. It's beautifully acted and directed, with great sets, costumes, and the recreation of a period that is not as old as we would like to believe. It's one of the best films of its type, and it teaches a clear and powerful lesson.<br/><br/>It's a home run!!"

","When I entered the theater I noticed a vast variety of folks coming to see this film; from the very old to the very young. There was even a coach that brought what seemed like his whole little league team. As you know I am not a huge fan of bio-pics, but I wanted to see this story just because of the amazing achievement of this man. I remember how hard things were in the 1960s, so I can't imagine how tough times were in 1947. The fact that Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) not only had to be a great ball player, but he also had to have the willpower to tame his temper. I am not sure that I know many men who would stand down to the abuse that he suffered. The verbal abuse that was lashed out by Ben Chapman (Alan Tudyk) was really disturbing, but it did shed a lot of light on what Jackie had to deal with. Luckily Jackie had his wife Rachel (Nicole Beharie) to lean on. It was surprising that Rachel was a bit of a rebel herself, which made her very endearing. General Manager Leo Durocher (Christopher Meloni) was also a bit of a rebel; just a different kind. Leo was rambunctious and seemingly did whatever he wanted. He turned out to be a color-blind manager and he did not care what anyone else thought. Wendell Smith (Andre Holland) was the reporter tasked to chronicle this historic event. He would sit on the 3rd base line with his typewriter in his lap and capture all of Jackie's great moments as well as the intentional injuries that he incurred. Although Jackie is definitely a hero in this film, he is not the only one. Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford) was a hero as well. You had to be a special kind of person to change the policies of an entire league. There were many reasons why he wanted to sign the first black player to the Brooklyn Dodgers, but I think that the one that he gave at the end of the film was the one that tugged at my heart. This is one film that I think everyone should see because there are so many lessons that can be learned and taught to the next generation. The one thing that I did not know was that during one game of every season, all the Brooklyn Dodgers wear number 42. Very cool. I give this film a green light."

","Jackie Robinson is one of the most important African American athletes, if not the most important. This movie perfectly demonstrates all the injustices Jackie had to deal with. Whether it is being denied a hotel room, or having to deal with opposing managers or even teammates. However, this movie shows the good along with the bad. It shows that, while there were plenty of people who were out to prevent Jackie from laying, the people who were their to help him were doing the right thing. I also enjoyed it because it was not your typical sports movie. The Dodgers do not win the World Series, and we do not get to see Robinson play out the rest of his career. The movie does not sugarcoat to much, it portrays what really happens, and how Jackie was really treated. It may be a movie, but it does a very good job at showing a very important piece of sports history. This movie perfectly blends sports and culture, and that is what makes it such a good movie."

At the beginning of the film they show you Robinson's determination to break apart from segregation and become something better with himself. His determination to make something happen for himself and loved ones is what kept him striving to make it even when no one in the mlb wanted him there. His teammates were came to accept him sooner or later and they also defended him when they knew he couldn't retaliate.

","42 is not just a film about the life of baseball player Jackie Robinson, it is a film about the era and culture of life in the mid 1940's. America had just emerged from WWII which had focused on the elimination of fascism in the world only to walk right into it's own war with racism. Nothing in American history can really show that better than the story about Jackie Robinson and his major league baseball journey. <br/><br/>The movie is not just a baseball movie - but it does have some spectacular baseball scenes. It is a movie about the times, how racism permeated the fabric of America at that time. The open racism portrayed in the movie is both overwhelming and uncomfortable - which is it's design. I turned to my husband during one particular scene and said ""I wish I could just reach through the screen and slap him upside the head"". It really made me appreciate the choice of Jackie Robinson as the first African American to be picked to play in the majors. The person could not just have been a good ball player, he had to also be an upstanding citizen, and a man who would be able to take everything that was going to come his way. And Chadwick Boseman is perfect as Jackie Robinson delivering a heartfelt, gutsy and emotional performance of the man. He shows the many sides of Robinson - the love he had for his wife, the courage to stand, the anger at the constant racism, and, most important, the boldness to not fight back, holding his head high. He is a true American hero.<br/><br/>The story isn't just about Robinson though - it is also about his teammates, all cast splendidly, and how they went from wanting to walk away, to supporting and then accepting him. Some poignant scenes are portrayed throughout the movie. It is about his relationship with his wife, played fantastically by Nicole Beharie, a strong woman in her own right, eventually crossing her own barrier lines. It's about the very courageous Branch Rickey played with perfection by Harrison Ford, who has the guts, and a wonderful reason reveled in the film, for bringing in an African American player to begin with. It's about the beginning of a civil rights movement here in America, which begins, rightfully so, with the most American of all pastimes - baseball."

","Y'know there is a real danger in doing this sort of movie. If it was made 40 years ago they would overplay (if that's possible) the crap that Jackie had to put up with coming to the MLB. But I checked and it appears that while some liberties may have been taken in a general sense, like in any movie about real events, it looks like the stuff that happens in the movie happened in real life and this is pretty accurate. Truth is Rickey just happened to pick the right guy at the right time. Jackie's ballfield credentials for the Hall of Fame are there even though he started in the majors at age 28, if he had started at say age 22 they might be talking about him among the greatest players of all time. BTW, I started watching this and said to my son that guy playing Branch Rickey is really good without knowing it was Harrison Ford. Great movie and a good lesson for kids (and adults) everywhere."

","This was the perfect baseball movie for anyone interested in baseball history and the exploits of one man-the one and only Jackie Robinson. It starts off with the narration of blacks being excluded from Major League Baseball in the first part of the 20th century and having to form the ""Negro Leagues"" and then switching to Branch Richey looking for one of those players to be the first black player in the Majors. He settles on Robinson-""a player with a future."" Robinson agrees and is subjected to horrible treatment (from fellow and opposing players, other people such as customer service people who are also bad to the team in general) prejudice, fans shouting racial epithets at him, and other bad treatments. He endures and eventually wins everyone's respect. It would be interesting to watch this and the original Jackie Robinson Story movie back-to-back (in which Robinson played himself) to see how they compare.

","42 is the inspirational tale of Jackie Robinson and how he made history in the great game of baseball by becoming the first colored man to play ball in the Major League. But this film goes beyond Jackie, it talks about the color barrier and how racism was prevalent everywhere those days. This is a story about how a special group of people rose to the challenge to overcome racism. This was a very moving film, perhaps a little too sentimental to a fault. But as biopics go, this is one of the better ones.<br/><br/>Brian Helgeland's film is about none other than number 42, Jackie Robinson. The Dodgers owner, Branch Rickey has come up with a risky idea and that is to break the color barrier and he chooses Jackie. But Jackie doesn't stand down to racism, and if he wants to play in the bigs, instead of fighting racism with words and fights, he fights it with baseball.<br/><br/>The acting is tremendous. Chadwick Boseman came out of nowhere it seems to take the lead role and he was amazing. I felt like I was actually watching the legendary Jackie Robinson. Harrison Ford as Branch Rickey likewise was amazing and Harrison's trademark gruffiness was perfect for this role. I also must mention Alan Tudyk as the racist Phillies manager. Obviously, it's nothing to celebrate but his role is how people acted back then and he perfectly captured that.<br/><br/>Overall, 42 is an excellent biopic that tells all the hardships Jackie Robinson had to endure on his way to greatness. Jackie being here paved the way for future foreign players and showed baseball that it was not an all-white male sport. This is an excellent, though a bit too sentimental tribute to one of the greatest heroes of all time, Jackie Robinson. I rate this film 9/10."

","Brian Helgeland's 42 is not only about a black man who overcame racism just so he can make it to the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947, it is the true life story of Jackie Robinson (played by Chadwick Boseman)and Branch Rickey (played by Harrison Ford) who supported him the whole way through. I was disappointed to find out that this film didn't garner any Oscar nominations when it had all of the ingredients to an Oscar fora baseball movie. Director Brian Helgeland has crafted the best baseball movie since Sam Wood's 1942 baseball biopic about the life of Lou Gehrig The Pride of the Yankees. I really think that this is one of the best movies of 2013 because of the inspiration and the message that the film tries to send to us and that no matter what skin color you have all men will always be equal no matter what the difference."
"drqshadow-reviews","6","1","3","11 February 2014"," In Baseball Terms, This Would Be an Infield Single
","Jackie Robinson as a superhuman archetype, standing up to fierce racism and intentional beanballs with the same level of quiet resolve and solemn dignity. It's the sort of movie that writes itself, for better and (more commonly) for worse: one dramatic figure stands against the perils of an acidic hive mind and slowly turns the tide. On the very few occasions where we see cracks in Robinson's veneer, the film is intensely interesting. That's the real draw, to me, how a fiery man struggled to tame his very loud emotions in the pursuit of an insurmountably lofty, important ideal. 42 only gives us a brief taste, sadly, choosing instead to invest its time in tired, overplayed vignettes (hey, it turns out southerners were resistant to integration) and a thin, after-school-special grade performance from its cast. Harrison Ford is a lot of fun as the brash, cocksure executive Branch Rickey, who chose to integrate MLB on his own volition, but he's so makeup caked and under-inspected that it's tough to see the role as more than just a particularly eccentric joyride. Mildly effective, with a few dashes of quality spice, it whiffed on the potential to be so much more."

It's something about team spirit, courage and acceptance that is a winner! When I think about the courage of Branch Rickey and Jackie Robinson, I'm reassured that for all the evil in the world, there is good, equally operating somewhere!<br/><br/>I'm gonna take mom to see this one. She was born in 1942 and I think it would be a great ""Bday gift"". Jackie and Branch Rickey birthed something good for their sport and this country and it should be celebrated!"

","The opening disclaimer in any movie that states it is 'based' on true events makes me question how much creative license was taken in crafting the story. I believe that 42, which is the story of Jackie Robinson's (Chadwick Boseman) journey through breaking the color barrier in American baseball took much of its creative license in toning down the racism that Mr. Robinson must have faced. This story was told with so much heart and sensitivity that I didn't leave angered by the large scale intolerance that was pervasive at that time in our history but feeling proud that this man who was once a fatherless child could make such an impact on my history. This wasn't just the story of how Mr. Robinson's talent played a part in bringing about tolerance in baseball but also told the tale of how instrumental Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford) was in making this moment in time take place. The fact that there was a scene in which Mr. Rickey speaks on his motivation just makes the tale all the more endearing. I know that the story is based on true events but not all true stories are engaging. His character and strength were portrayed with clarity and conviction by Mr. Ford, I am forever and always a Han Solo fan. This is a story that needed to be told for someone like me who had heard about Jackie Robinson but had not given a great deal of thought to the depth of his triumph. He was before my time, in fact when the story takes off my mother was only six. This is the type of film that makes everyone feel a little better when exiting the theater and the pre credits statements that informed the audience of where some key character's lives carried them was a testament to who was on the right or wrong side of history. The film did a phenomenal job of recreating the era from the location shots, to the automobiles and the attire, everything and everyone looked authentic. I barely noticed the 2 plus hours running time because this story was so very entertaining. The only time that I felt really uncomfortable was when Ben Chapman (Alan Tudyk) taunted Jackie during a game which was much like the chorus of the Trinidad James song All Gold Everything, which also makes me uncomfortable. This film gets a glaring green light."

","WHEN WE BECAME highly ""Baseball Aware"", it was 1956 and it was a great year for a 10 year old to be in such a state. It was a time of great symmetry and balance in the Major Leagues. There were no Divisions, no Playoffs, No ""Wild Card"" teams. The Pennant Races were confined to 2 eight team leagues; with a winner take all policy for the 1st Place team. Then it was on to the World Series.<br/><br/>SO THIS MADE it possible for us to have seen Jackie Robinson play; albeit only on televised games.* At a tender age, such as we were, there was no way for us to understand the significance of his place in the History of the Game, and for that matter, our History in general.<br/><br/>THE FILM'S PRODUCTION team had striven to weave as much true historical fact into a tightly knit storyline; that never seems to slow down or become excessively preachy or sentimental. To its credit, the screenplay reads like a slice of life.<br/><br/>WHEREAS IT WOULD be easy for this story to become too grim or too ""Pollyanna"", accurate replication of well known, real life incidents allow it to maintain an even keel throughout.<br/><br/>BY WAY OF example, we choose the following examples:<br/><br/>First of all, Brooklyn Dodger General Manager, Branch Rickey <br/><br/>(Harrison Ford)says that Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) is his <br/><br/>choice to break the color line because, like Rickey, Robinson is a<br/><br/>Methodist!<br/><br/>Rickey also admits to having ulterior motives; when he states that<br/><br/>he wasn't undertaking such a move just in the name of doing the <br/><br/>right thing. He states that there is a lot of talent in the <br/><br/>Negro Leagues that would hence become available.<br/><br/>Lastly, in an early scene, Robinson is being insulted in the <br/><br/>worst possible way. The racial slurs finally get on the nerves <br/><br/>of Dodger 2nd Baseman, Eddie Stanky, who intervenes on <br/><br/>Robinson's behalf. Stanky, who was ""a Good Ol' Boy"" from <br/><br/>Alabama, did not like the idea of Robinson's being on the <br/><br/>team; but he thought that it was cowardly that any opposition <br/><br/>player would behave so, knowing that Jackie had pledged to <br/><br/>remain silent and never retaliate.<br/><br/>GETTING BACK TO real life, Robinson played in that 1956 Season, including the loss to they Yankees in 7 games of the World Series. That was his last hurrah in the Big leagues.<br/><br/>IN VERY SHORT order, his hair turned from black to silver. Jackie Robinson died in 1972 at age 53. We can only surmise why he left Planet Earth with maybe 2 decades or more of a possibility. Our guess is all of that internalization of the great tension greatly shortened his life span.<br/><br/>Small Wonder!<br/><br/>NOTE: * In Chicago, we had the opportunity to see all Major League players; but being a devout White Sox fan, we wouldn't go to Wrigley Field and the Cubs!"

","Whether you are a big fan of baseball movies, the Jackie Robinson story, or just a good movie, 42 is a good watch. This is the story of not just a hero in the game of baseball, but a hero in society and a major contributor to the civil rights movement. This movie focuses mainly on Robinson's path through the end of his career in the Negro leagues through his first year making, and playing for the Brooklyn Dodgers. Chadwick Boseman not only has a strong physical resemblance to Jackie Robinson, but he does a great job of portraying him as the man he was, one of good character and that took much abuse by only turning the other cheek and playing hard on the field. Harrison Ford lives up to the expectations that one would have for a role from him. He is a fantastic Branch Rickey, a Methodist executive for the Dodgers who masterminded the signing of Robinson as a means of breaking the color barrier, and bringing in more fans to the ballpark. Overall, 42 is a great movie that I would recommend to anybody."
"kosmasp","7","0","2","19 May 2014"," Another sports movie?
","Obviously there is more here, breaking down a racial past too. Harrison Ford in an unusual role, but still more than charismatic. And while it does a very good job in general, it might not be everyones cup of tea. The movie is acted out very well, but some people might not have the patience to sit through another sports movie. Another thing you have to think about: Baseball is big in the US, but not so much in Europe or other parts of the World.<br/><br/>Having said that, the story is more than worthy looking for, because it does concentrate on things happening outside the ""field"", which is sometimes devastating and sometimes life ensuring (depending on what is happening). There is no doubt where this is heading, but the road to it's final goal is not an easy one ... The movie is packed, but still easy to follow though"

","Review: I quite enjoyed this true story about a the first black layer to hit the major leagues. We have seen this type of movie many times before, were a person does good against all the odds in sports, Rocky comes to mind, but this is a true story about a period which changed the whole of Baseball. Personally I don't no anything about Baseball and I can't see how the game is enjoyable, but it does have its audience and I'm sure that there are names that come up during the movie which people will recognise. As a black person, I did find some of the scenes quite offensive but that was how it was in the 1940's in America. All of the performances are believable and well acted, especially Harrison Ford who must have been out of his comfort zone.in all it's a movie that will touch the heart and make you feel emotional. Watchable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: This movie really does prove that Harrison Ford can't pull all audiences anymore. It's not his acting skills or his ability to pull out a good performance, it's the fact that his name doesn't really carry any clout anymore. He will always be a bankable actor, and I do think that his name on top of this movie made a massive difference, but Hollywood isn't going mad when he's starring in a movie anymore, which is a shame because I personally think that he's a great actor. Since the last Indiana Jones, I haven't seen him do anything extra ordinary but is always good to see him on the big screen. I haven't heard of the other actors in this movie so I can't really comment on there acting skills, but I'm sure that we will see the guy who played the leading role in something soon because he was a great choice by the director.<br/><br/>Budget: $40million Worldwide Gross: $95million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into there sport biopics about a black baseball player trying to make a name for himself in the 1940's. 7/10"

","The film takes place in 1947 when Dodger General Manager Branche Rickey takes a big gamble by signing Jackie Robinson to a Dodger contract in major league baseball.<br/><br/>While this is a very good film, I was somewhat disappointed by the performance of Chadwick Bosnan as Robinson. When the real Jackie Robinson spoke, it was as if pearls of wisdom descended from that mouth. His speech clearly showed the intellectual capacity he had amassed from graduating from UCLA. Bosnan shows none of that.<br/><br/>As Rickey, Harrison Ford was outstanding and it is truly surprising that he doesn't appear on this year's Oscar nominee list for best supporting actor.<br/><br/>The film is excellent because it shows how the Dodger players went from signing a petition against Robinson to where they coalesced around him. <br/><br/>The shocking behavior of fans in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Cincinnati are shown, and Philadelphia manager Ben Chapman comes off as a disgusting racist.<br/><br/>A wonderful film depicting social upheaval in the United States."

","Last night I watched the movie 42. My interest had been piqued ever since I finished reading 7 Men: And the Secret to Their Greatness. Obviously, one of the featured ""7 men"" was Jackie Robinson. I had always known of Jackie Roosevelt Robinson's (little known fact: he was named after Teddy Roosevelt, a president who liked black people most of the time) life story, at least at the surface level. However, I never fully understood the magnitude of his sacrifice and tenacity.<br/><br/>The film begins with a brief narrative of the state of baseball and society in 1945. 42 's first memorable scene occurs when Mr. Rickey tells some of his associates that he is going to bring a negro into the major leagues. One of them openly states that it would be a failure while the other just slyly smirked, which could've been interpreted as a silent approval or, conversely, a sarcastic bidding of good luck. Essentially, this is the scenario of the entire movie: Branch Rickey wants to integrate African-Americans into major league baseball, meeting dissidents at every turn while Jackie Robinson fearlessly takes on the insults of a thousand lifetimes.<br/><br/>(Do not let my over-simplification fool you; I thought it was a good movie. To me, it is always difficult to create a ground-breaking biographical movie since, if one is attempting to stick to the facts, there really aren't any surprises – except for the ones that occurred naturally, of course. Lincoln is certainly an exception to this.)<br/><br/>I have an unorthodox way in which I write movie reviews. This one will be no different. Because of the biographical nature of the film, I am simply going to discuss some positive aspects of the film, my thoughts for improvement, and my take-away.<br/><br/>Positive: The best aspect of the movie, which to most will seem ridiculous to even mention, is the story. It is difficult to hear the story of Branch Rickey and Jackie Robinson in this day-and-age and not be impressed and inspired. Within that, I appreciated how the movie did stick to the facts. I was surprised that the film mentioned the faith of both Branch Rickey and Jackie Robinson. Near the beginning of the film, Rickey decides on Robinson. ""He's a Methodist. I'm a Methodist. God's a Methodist,"" Rickey says. Also adding humor in the statement, Mr. Rickey started the film by identifying the centrality of faith in both of their lives, as is factually correct. Building off of that: Harrison Ford was great in his role as Branch Rickey. They did a great job in transforming Ford into a hardened Methodist. The cigar permanently lodged between Rickey's pointer and middle fingers seemed natural for the veteran actor and I loved it. Also it was nice to see Billy Riggins (Derek Phillips) from Friday Night Lights in something else.<br/><br/>Negative: Acting. While Harrison Ford did an excellent job as Branch Rickey, Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) was not up to par, in my opinion. However, I will not criticize him too much since it was his first movie as the leading role. There were many instances where my ""cheese-o-meter"" went off the charts. i.e. When Robinson proposes to Rachel. Time was also an issue. At times, the movie really dragged, making it seems much longer than the 2 hours and 9 minutes that it was.<br/><br/>Take-away: 42 was a good sports movie. However, it was not a great sports movie. There were a lot of fun parts but room for improvement. 3.75/5"

","This is docudrama based on Jackie Robinson's entry into Major League Baseball. It starts in the spring of 1945 when owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford) decides to bring in the first negro into the league. Jackie (Chadwick Boseman) would be the one, and this movie tells the story up to the end of his rookie season.<br/><br/>This is unabashed sentimentalism. Some subjects deserves and warrants such a treatment. Jackie Robinson is one. His squeaky clean image is maintained here. I like that they used a relative unknown in Boseman. At no time was I thinking that it's Will Smith up there playing Jackie Robinson. Boseman embodied the legendary player. Same can't be said of Branch Rickey. Every time I kept thinking Harrison Ford is playing that character. In the end, he does the job well, and I don't want to complain about that. It's a movie that deserves all the tears and all the cheers. It's a movie that should be seen."
"slicedbread117","9","0","1","18 December 2013"," A movie that captures one of the greatest sports stories of all-time.
","As the years have gone by, the sports industry has become more and more of an emotional attachment to so many people across the globe. Stories in the sports world have a bigger impact on people than they ever have before, and sometimes these stories or events are ones that can change a country. In the case of 42, the movie brings one of the greatest sports stories ever to life, a story that certainly changed America in many ways.<br/><br/>This story is the one of Jackie Robinson, the first African-American man to ever play in Major League Baseball. The movie does a terrific job in giving back story to Jackie's road to the MLB, squeezing in every detail about his life in the 128 minute run time. There are some ways that his story could have been expanded even more, but this doesn't hurt the movie in any major way. We see Jackie work his way up, and some of his life's greatest and most inspiring moments come off the baseball field, giving the movie a sense of depth that extends further than just his heroics on the diamond. The screenplay is written wonderfully, and director/writer Brian Helgeland deserves much credit for his work on this film, including the smooth direction and smart screenplay. <br/><br/>Where this movie hits hardest are during the scenes where Jackie has to face some of the largest adversities a man can face. Being targeted by white men who are threatening to kill Jackie, his first minor league game, and his arrival in the MLB are just a few. One true standout moment was during a game against the Philadelphia Phillies, were Phillies manager Ben Chapman unleashes a whirlwind a racial slurs towards Jackie, who fights with every ounce of his body to resist attacking Chapman. We later see Jackie retreat to the dugout where he smashes his bat against the wall and letting out screams of agony. Some scenes such as these are so powerful, they make you sit back and just think about the past and how some of these adversities could ever exist in the first place. 42 captures Jackie's darkest moments on his path the the big leagues, and it's those moments that move you in so many different ways.<br/><br/>Now a movie with this much emotional weight couldn't be done without the right actors. Chadwick Boseman proudly and respectively portrays one of the most prominent African-American figures in America's history, and down to a tee I might add. Boseman is spot on in evoking so many different emotions. Whether it's anger, sadness, laughter or happiness, Boseman's performance was one that will be remembered for a long time, and a role that I'm sure was a tremendous honor for him to play. Harrison Ford also joins the cast as Branch Rickey, President and General Manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers. A man with integrity and innovation, Rickey is played wonderfully by the legendary Ford. Nicole Beharie plays Rachel Robinson, wife of Jackie, and also gives the movie a shining performance as Jackie's love life and the woman that he was motivated by.<br/><br/>42 is truly a sight to behold. From his start in the Negro League to his eventual time with the Brooklyn Dodgers, the story of Jackie Robinson's life is one that moved mountains and the film does a excellent job in capturing just what is what like for number 42 to overcome the obstacles that he did. With a screenplay written to near perfection and acting that brought the movie to life and then some, 42 will forever be a movie that was able to take one of sports' greatest stories ever, and present it in a way that will leave a lasting memory in all its viewers.<br/><br/>9/10"

","I am struggling to decide if my vote of ""10"" is for the movie itself or the amazing cast. Wait! Why not both?!?! '42' is a fantastic movie because it tells the endearing story of a great baseball player, Jackie Robinson. Though baseball is at the heart of the story, this movie has little to do with baseball and much to do with humankind. Mr. Robinson certainly proved his greatness on the playing field but also showed the strength that was necessary for a black athlete to endure (quite horrendous) racism and bigotry, in post-WWII America. It was wonderful to watch more and more people around Mr. Robinson understand and accept that he was a great baseball player and human being regardless of the color of his skin. Now...the cast. Chadwick Boseman and Nicole Beharie are sensational as Mr. and Mrs. Robinson. And perhaps there is another Oscar nomination being considered for Harrison Ford. His portrayal of Dodgers owner Branch Rickey was quite possibly Mr. Ford's best performance in many years. Add great scenes with Andre Holland, Christopher Meloni, Lucas Black, Hamish Linklater, and many others to make '42' a keeper for sure!"

","The is the true story of Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) who broke the color barrier in Major League Baseball in 1947 when General Manager Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford) hired him to play for the Brooklyn Dodgers. <br/><br/>Nowadays we see Blacks in all major sporting events and no one blinks an eye because these people are very good athletes, help make the owners a lot of money and the fans very happy. <br/><br/>But, back in Robinson's time there was more than hell to pay for playing on a team of all-whites. The movie goes into some things regarding racism and very hurtful verbal taunts, but you must come to realize and believe that things were actually much worse than what we see on the screen. Branch Rickey's famous comment about finding someone who has the guts NOT to fight back proved to be the winning formula. And, if truth be told, the taunts, barbs and other verbal threats, in time, actually brought the all-white Dodger baseball team together and supportive of Jackie Robinson. One player even said ""maybe we should all wear the number 42.""<br/><br/>In many respects this is not an easy movie to watch because of the racism involved. We don't think now like they did back in that day, but it was what it was and it's a part of a history we wish didn't happen that way. We cringed when things went against Robinson enduring the racial taunts, but we also became quite weepy and proud when things looked up for him and went his way personally and on the field. <br/><br/>We get a pretty good overview of Jackie Robinson with some of his early baseball life in the minor leagues with the Montreal Royals, his personal life, negotiating with Dodger management thru Branch Rickey, and his interacting with players on his team and other teams. For more on Jackie Robinson check out Wikipedia and you will discover a lot more about him. A lot more.<br/><br/>Chadwick Boseman was a good choice to play Jackie Robinson and he did a very good job. Harrison Ford must have loved every minute playing Branch Rickey and from that performance we come to realize that Rickey was indeed a great man. Great job. The rest of the cast performed well. <br/><br/>This biography went by so quick it was over before you could say ""Jackie Robinson."" HA! That's how good this was. Kudos.

","This movie is one of the best 'biographical' films I've seen in a very long time. Set in the 1940's when things were completely different, literally 'black & white'.<br/><br/>If you liked Men Of Honor, Remember The Titans, and The Blindside... you will definitely enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>You don't need to know much about baseball to love this movie... baseball is the back-drop to the story it tells. The actors do a wonderful job, the story line is superb, and it's visually appealing from scene to scene.<br/><br/>I WILL BE PURCHASING THIS MOVIE!"
"Ackermana-675-630566","7","0","1","2 May 2013"," Branch Rickey, Dodgers GM wants to shock the baseball world, and Jackie Robinson is the key.
","Perhaps the biggest act in the civil rights movement happened on the baseball field, and it was all thanks to Branch Rickey, and Jackie Robinson.<br/><br/>Harrinson Ford turns in an amazing performance with his portrayal of Branch Rickey. Ford is nearly invisible as he disappears into his role. I felt as if I was watching Branch play himself. I cannot say the same for the performance by Chadwick Boseman.<br/><br/>Perhaps he was simply overshadowed by Ford, but I was never blown away by Boseman as an actor, he did not make me feel for Robinson. I wanted Robinson to succeed due to the situation he and his people were in, but not because of the portrayal by Boseman.<br/><br/>This film is worth seeing, but not as spectacular as some are saying it is. A must see for those who had no knowledge of Jackie Robinson and what he did for both sports and society."

","This movie was wonderful and great. It bases mostly the baseball career of Jackie Robinson, not his life story thou it would add more color to the movie but not fully necessary to put in the movie. The script, cinematography, and direction was great. The reason I gave it a nine because I thought they should have added more baseball to the movie. I felt that it should have shown most of his high-points in his career but not every game he did. The movie was very inspirational and educating. I wouldn't be surprise for more awards heading its way.<br/><br/>My wife's rating: 9/10<br/><br/>Critical: Inspirational, and reminder of how we should treat people as equals. Beautifully developed and great casting."

I felt inside something was bad wrong. <br/><br/>Chadwick Boseman gave an excellent portrayal of the true life struggle that Jackie Robinson took and endured during his steps into white baseball. <br/><br/>During the scene when Jackie walked in the tunnel towards Ebbets Field for the first time, and as the music swelled, it put you right in his shoes feeling his anxiety, and a mixture of other thoughts he may have felt at that moment about his future and life. This is a great cinematic production. <br/><br/>Harrison Ford gave an excellent performance as the no non sense owner of the Brooklyn Dodge's. His power with words at the right moments, when he first badgered Jackie about what he may experience, and when the Philly's coach said they would not take the field if Jackie came there, was like Chuck Norris and a well placed karate' kick. <br/><br/>One of the great moments in the film was in warm up before the game in Cincinnati, and everyone was heckling Jackie with the usual racial slurs. Pee Wee Reese came over and put his arm over Jackie's shoulder saying "" I have got some family here that need to know this"".<br/><br/>I have never been to a movie where there was so much audience applause, and you do not realize you have seen a 2+ hour production.<br/><br/>The real life photos at the end of the movie really brought the film home.<br/><br/>This movie tops my list of MUST SEE movies of all times giving you the ' feel good ' emotions that will have you returning to see it again."
"ethschulze","6","0","1","20 April 2013"," Best sports movie yet?
","If you are looking to watch this movie to get information about Jackie Robinson for the book report you should have started two weeks ago, this is not the movie for you. It states almost no real facts about Jackie other than he was the first black member of Major League Baseball, and he played for the Dodgers. Now if you are looking for a compelling movie that can hold your attention for two hours and eight minutes, this is a good place to start.<br/><br/>This goes without saying but the acting in this film was phenomenal, but going beyond that, they did a fantastic job of recreating the time era and making the film flow. They also had a great balance between humor and serious moments which made the characters more real and helped you invest in them. <br/><br/>Keep in mind, while in some ways it is an almost biographical movie, there are still many scenes where they are just playing a sport (ironically my least favorite part of sports movies) but even these are cultivating and interesting. They did a great job of emulating the feeling of isolation that would come with being the only black baseball player while keeping it light hearted or disturbing as the case may be. <br/><br/>Overall it is absolutely a movie worth seeing especially at the moment where there aren't too many good movies in theaters."
"PWNYCNY","7","0","2","17 April 2013"," This movie actually is more about Branch Rickey.
","As this movie is a remake of a remake of a remake of a remake, and is recounting a story that is so well known as to become a part of American culture and folklore, the director was confronted with the formidable challenge of reworking the story into something new. The results are mixed. The movie can be divided into two parts - a sports movie about an athlete who bucks the odds to become a hero, and a soap opera about a man's personal life off the field. The former works; the latter fizzles out. That Jackie Robinson grew up in California, served in the United States army, was already known as an athlete, and was a star in the Negro leagues is glossed over in favor of playing up Robinson's relationship with his wife, which is done in a way that can be described in one word - hokey. And it is this hokeyness that takes this movie down several notches. When Jackie has to endure being publicly humiliated by Ben Chapman, that is dramatic. When Jackie is making googly-eyes at his wife, that is cheap dramatics of the most transparent variety. Harrison Ford's performance as Branch Rickey at times approaches that of a caricature of the bombastic businessman - gruff on the outside but really warm and cuddly on the inside, which does not help improve the movie. In addition, it seems that the movie is more about Branch Rickey than about Jackie Robinson, evident by the fact that the star cast member is playing Rickey, not Robinson, who is played by a relative unknown. If any movie required a major star in the the title role, this is was the movie. The story is about the guy on the field, not the guy in the front office. The movie would have been stronger if it would have had the Robinson-Chapman relationship as the main point of the story to drive home the theme of racism, which is what drives this story. It's not about people, it's about social problem - racial injustice - as manifested in sports, and through sports, in society . Basically this movie is based on a true story but as the movie itself disclaims parts of the story have been re-worked for dramatic purposes. The movie may have worked better if the story had not been re-worked and told ""as-is"" because the facts themselves unembellished tell the whole story. To find out about Jackie Robinson, it might be better to watch a documentary instead."
"DarkVulcan29","10","0","1","16 April 2013"," Well told story of a baseball legend
","Jackie Robinson(Chadwick Bosman)is recruited by Branch Rickey(Harrison Ford)to play Major League Baseball, this will make him the African American to do so. But Jackie is gonna have to play it cool when some bigots are looking to start something with him, let's remember this is the 1940's.<br/><br/>A well told story of not just being a sports film, but a film about fighting impossible odds. We have a deep understanding of what Jackie Robinson went through to make it big, it's a prime example that getting to the top is not always an easy ride. I liked the way the filmmakers captured the 1940's. Chadwick Boseman was excellent has Jackie Robinson, showing all the emotions of him, I'm sure he spent a lot of time with his family. Harrison Ford is alright as Branch Rickey, some scenes he's great and other parts he's over the top. And the other supporting cast don't disappoint. A great film you don't want to miss."
"stevendbeard","7","0","1","16 April 2013"," Good Sport's Movie
","This is a true story , based on the life of Jackie Robinson . Chadwick plays Jackie , a baseball player in the late 1940's, right after WWII . During that time period , there was still racial prejudice and segregation-Whites & Blacks were in separate baseball leagues and did not mix . Harrison/Branch Rickey plays the Brooklyn Dodgers' team executive that hired Chadwick to play for his all white team. FYI: Harrison is pretty unrecognizable in his role . Christopher/Leo Durocher plays the team manager and Nicole/Rachel is Chadwick's wife . I'm not a big sports fan but it was a good story and sports fans will probably like it more than I did . The title of the movie, 42, is the jersey number Jackie wore . It's rated ""PG-13"" for language-the N word is used a lot as well as other racist terms and has a running time of 2 hours & 8 minutes . It's not one that I would buy on DVD but it would make a good rental ."

","This is such a powerful story and it is powerfully told. Young people should see this film to understand our history. I took my 13 year old and he was riveted, outraged, saddened and uplifted. The movie doesn't get into the glory days....it tells the story of the beginning...how unthinkable it was, what he had to face. I thought there were some truly brilliant moments where I couldn't speak. Powerful lessons here. Brilliant acting by all involved. Great to see Harrison tackle such a crusty, older character and he does a great job. Chadwick Boseman and Nicole Behari are stellar and pitch perfect. TR Knight is unrecognizable and hilarious. Chris Meloni fantastic....and John McGinley just superb as the baseball announcer. No one took you ""out"" of the period....they all did a great job and I highly recommend this movie."
"richard-1787","8","0","1","14 April 2013"," Not a great movie, but a thoroughly engaging and very fine one
","100 years from now, or 50, or perhaps even 25, film courses that cover great American movies from the first part of the 21st century probably will not talk about ""42."" There is no innovative photography or methods of telling the story - it's pretty much ""first A, then B, then C, then..."" in chronological order, etc. The acting ranges from good - Harrison Ford makes Branch Rickey into a stereotypical old codger - to very good: Chadwick Boseman is very moving as Robinson, and makes him a very real individual, unlike Ford's caricature Rickey. But there is nothing really innovative about the movie-making.<br/><br/>There are times when the dialogue is too obvious, usually in the noble moments, and the music wells up as it does in noble moments in a thousand movies, TV programs, and television ads.<br/><br/>But all that said and granted, this is still one very enjoyable movie, especially the scenes on the field. The baseball games come alive, especially because Boseman is so engaging as Robinson on the field. Extremely talented, and very engaging. You don't have to be a baseball fan, or indeed know much about the game, to enjoy them, especially when Robinson is taunting the pitcher stealing bases.<br/><br/>There are other moments in the movie when a little outside knowledge would add to the impact, such as knowing who ""Happy,"" the baseball commissioner, was (Happy Chandler, a former governor of Kentucky), but you can still have a great time without it.<br/><br/>Definitely a movie to see in the theater, so you can hear the sound of others laughing at some of the great humor.<br/><br/>A movie doesn't have to be a timeless example of film making in order to be a very enjoyable one.<br/><br/>---------------------------------------<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie in the theater when it was first released. Now that it has been released on DVD and I was able to rent it at my local Redbox, I got to see it again, and enjoyed it even more than the first time.<br/><br/>Chadwick Boseman's performance as Robinson is truly first-rate. But the script is not far behind him: this very intelligent and very effective script really makes you feel something of what Robinson must have gone through at the time. Terrible stuff, but it makes you feel it, to at least a degree of what he must have felt. (The scenes with the Philadelphia manager will make your skin crawl, but you'll rejoice at the end of the movie when you learn that that hateful Phily manager never went any further in baseball.) <br/><br/>This is not a ""feel good"" movie. It's much better than that. It's a remarkable testament to two very strong and strong-willed individuals who took a lot of s**t to do what they felt was right.<br/><br/>And it makes one hell of a good story."
"Morgan_Moreno","Null","0","1","13 April 2013"," Very Pleased!!
","So inspired by Jackie and what he did for the African-American community, I played softball in my undergraduate career. I am happy that 42 is being met with nice critical reception and commercial success and the actors did a superb job. I only wish the film were a bit longer so as to focus on Jackie's childhood, career at UCLA and time in the military, where he proved himself brave in the face of discrimination. Nonetheless, I will certainly see 42 again before it leaves theaters and will support the DVD/Blu-Ray release. Boseman, Beharie and Ford are near dead ringers for their characters and, in the case of the Boseman and Beharie, it is encouraging to see young, black talent on the rise. Thank you, Mr. Robinson. God Bless & RIP."
