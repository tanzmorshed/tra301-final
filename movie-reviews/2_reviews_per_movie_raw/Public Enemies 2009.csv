"MR_Heraclius","9","49","56","23 February 2020"," EXCELLENT HISTORICAL MOVIE!!
","This movie is one of Johnny Depp's best. Regarding content, this movie definitely flows at a high pace, but it lacks the violence that is characteristic of so many other American criminal movies. However, this fact does not bother me at all, and I actually really loved this movie, but I think that the lack of violence may be why so many other people rated this movie with a low score. In addition, I noticed something funky going on with Depp's hairstyle: it's reminiscent of 21 Jump Street! The way his hair is combed in this movie very much reminds me of his bad-boy hairstyle midway through the television sitcom. As a result, Depp appears to be much younger in this movie than in many of his other movies from this time era."

","This movie tells the later stages of the crime career of John Dillinger, famous bank robber. What's good: Johnny Depp and Christian bale are good, the pacing is good, the sets and period detail are perfect. The score is quite good too.<br/><br/>What's bad: a shootout sequence is obviously shot on a video camera looks cheap and has a major discontinuity in it. Other scenes the camera is shaky.<br/><br/>Also for a movie that prides itself on historical detail, it plays fast and loose with the facts about the Dillinger gang. For instance the death of ""Baby Face"" Nelson is complete fiction. You are duped into thinking the director cares about historical details with all the period sets, cars, news stories on the radio etc, but actually major parts of the plot are just made up. Of course the reason that historical movies rarely follow history exactly is that real events don't naturally follow standard narrative.<br/><br/>So it is not a documentary, which is fine, so it must be a character movie right? This brings me to its biggest flaw. An important goal of a movie like this is to build an emotional connection with the central character. This ought to be easy with a character like Dillinger, because he actually built a huge public fan base as a latter day ""Robin Hood"", despite being a murderous bank robbing crook. It tries hard and it does get close, particularly with the scenes involving Billie, one of Dillinger's many girlfriends. In the end, though, I just did not care all that much about him..<br/><br/>It is competent, but ultimately it fails to match up in comparison with other movies of this genre. Right now the IMDb rating for this movie is higher than ""The Untouchables"", ""Once Upon a Time in America"" or ""Goodfellas"", which is a testament to the cinematic ignorance of the majority of IMDb voters. No doubt the same people will rate this comment down, probably without even reading it, simply because I did not give the movie a 9 or 10."
"Eschete","5","470","713","3 July 2009"," Well-Made Cinematically, But Shallow
","Who was John Dillinger? We all know he was a flamboyant criminal who robbed banks, but who WAS he? The question of who Dillinger WAS is far more interesting than the question of what Dillinger DID, but this film, sadly, chose only to concentrate seriously on the latter and gave up almost immediately on the former.<br/><br/>This film goes out of its way--with a poor grasp of history's time-line, by the way--to show us what Dillinger did and who he hung around with, but it does next to nothing to explore who Dillinger was as a person or even as a criminal. It hints that Dillinger might be a passionate lover and loyal friend, but shows us little evidence aside from a few thrown-together seduction scenes (which make his girlfriend/heroine look like a dim-witted pushover) and an awkward love scene.<br/><br/>Even Dillinger's foil, Melvin Purvis, is a mystery in Mann's hands. Did he care about justice at all, or was he just a fascist on a personal crusade? Was he competent in the least or was he just a bumbling idiot? Squinty-eyed stares can only convey so much, after all.<br/><br/>Michael Mann seems to be in a terrible hurry to tell this story, as he is stuck between the rock of having to relate a relatively complete ""crime-ography"" of a notorious American gangster and the hard place of keeping the movie shorter than 2 1/2 hours.<br/><br/>As a result, a beautifully shot and edited movie that had a lot of promise ends up little more than a dumb, shoot-'em-up action movie wearing the fedora of ""historical romance."" Good for a date, but not a serious film.<br/><br/>Grade: C+. Things to look for: Mann's ham-handed and laughably obvious political commentary on the use of torture about 2/3 of the way through the movie; psychotically trigger-happy Baby Face Nelson well-played by Stephen Graham; cool old products (Zenth radio); great fashion sense."
"Reef-Shark","7","145","211","6 July 2009"," Overview of a criminal mastermind
","Public Enemies is an alright docu-crime-thriller that, thought well-made, ends up coming out dry. Many of the scenes are well paced, but in its running time the film feels like a very rushed overview of the final years of John Dillinger. What I mean to say is that this is a good movie, but you probably won't leave the theater feeling like you've learned anything about John Dillinger, other than trivial facts. The movie never really gives Johnny Depp a chance to shape the character into a believable icon because as I previously stated this film feels more like a dramatized overview of Dillinger's career instead of focusing on the man himself.<br/><br/>Now, Johnny Depp is a fine actor, and he reminds us in this movie that he isn't only a go-to man for quirky, weird, whimsical, and bizarre characters. In Public Enemies Depp reminds us that he is talented as a traditional actor and that he is still one of the best in Hollywood today. The problem is the script he is given for Public Enemies never lets him expand on anything regarding John Dellinger as a person. In Ridley Scott's 'American Gangster' Denzel Washington was given a chance to really emphasize the qualities he felt reflected his view of Frank Lucas. Public enemies, Johnny Depp never truly gets to define what he feels are the most important aspects of his portrayal of Dellinger because often the film gets too caught up in the action and events instead of its characters.<br/><br/>Christian Bale bounces back after a sub-par performance in 'Terminator: Salvation' and it's good to see him working his voice manipulation ability again, because I for one was beginning to think he'd gotten stuck on his Batman-style growl. Playing the FBI agent pursuing Dillinger he is an interesting character due to his dedication and could have been a really interesting character, but like Depp, Bale never really gets a chance to try and expand on his character.<br/><br/>The music isn't anything you haven't heard before in previous crime films of this sort, but for the most part it works. I wouldn't buy the soundtrack to this film, but it certainly didn't take away from the experience. Also, songs from the 30s are played throughout, and most of the time they manage to fit into the story's many montage scenes very well.<br/><br/>Director Michael Mann seems a tad bit off when compared to some of his previous films. He often goes for a look that makes the audience feel that they're in the middle of everything, and that's good in small stretches, but I felt he used this technique too often and I found myself growing a tad bit dizzy at times, and had a desire to see what was going on in the shootouts. I found it strange, that with his recent films such as 'Collateral', where the characters had been the center-focus of the entire film, he could then make a movie about one of the most infamous criminal minds and have it be more about the history than the characters who lived it.<br/><br/>The thing that is most fascinating about this film is the costumes and sets. The men and women behind these really outdid themselves and created a very authentic view of 1930s Chicago. This aspect of the film alone makes it worth seeing! Every costume and set seems to have been made with the utmost attention to detail, and the final result is very pleasing to the eye.<br/><br/>The final product in an okay docu-drama on the life of one of America's most infamous criminals, but in the end you really don't discover anything about John Dillinger that you couldn't have found out by looking him up on Wikipedia. So this is a pretty film to look at, and with Depp and Bale it's a good way to introduce those unfamiliar with Dillinger to the criminal, but if you were looking for a character study on the bank robber you may find yourself a tad-bit disappointed.<br/><br/>I wouldn't come close to calling Public Enemies one of the best movies of the summer, or of the year, but when compared to several other films that are currently being screened I would still highly recommend it. With movies like 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen' out there your money is best spent on Michael Mann's Public Enemies."
"Sundance89","4","149","218","2 July 2009"," Mediocre at Best, but so very flawed!
","This film is mediocre at best. I saw it last night, and was hoping that I'd get the rant over with before this morning, but sadly I find that I cannot find many things that were right with this film!! <br/><br/>1. Death Sequences: These were all mixed up and, as a bit of a history buff, I didn't like that! Dillinger was not the last of his gang to die, I believe it was Baby Face Nelson (who was not killed with Homer Van Meter either). And, Pretty Boy Floyd (although no real link with Dillinger) was killed after Dillinger and his boys.<br/><br/>2. Character Development: This was very, very poor for what was rumoured to be a big hit of Summer 09! Too much time was definitely spent on the whole Dillinger/Billie relationship, and on Purvis. Sure, they were the big name stars, but it should've been about characters not star pulling power!! ""Handsome"" Harry Pierpont, Baby Face Nelson, Pretty Boy Floyd, etc. deserved more screen time! The scene with Pretty Boy Floyd; I had no idea who he was meant to be at first! I thought it was some random chase through an orchard! Pierpont disappears about halfway through, never to be heard from again. Then, Dillinger's going round with some more guys, who shortly end up dead. Half the time, I was lost as to who was who except the big-name stars and the characters I'd learnt a bit about.<br/><br/>3. Action sequences: Way too long in my opinion, and could've been cut down to make way for more character development. The sound effects weren't even that effective, as to me they sounded more like fireworks at some points or were too loud.<br/><br/>The good points are few in number. The acting was good, camera work was sub-standard, lighting was good, angles were okay if not a little dodgy in places, etc. There is, however, nothing that I can really stick to as a fantastic feature of this film."
"Chris Knipp","8","40","55","5 July 2009"," The devil is in the details
","It's as hard to get a grip on Mann's impressive but vaguely off-putting new movie about John Dillinger's last thirteen months as it is to project yourself into the coldly beautiful digital images. The title itself provides a clue to the problem: it doesn't focus on the star criminal embodied by the charismatic and -- here -- coolly dashing Johnny Depp, whose quips and provocations in the trailer draw us into the theater to see him, only him, and his bold exploits. It points instead to the wider focus of Mann's book source -- 'Vanity Fair' writer Bryan Burroughs' 600 pages of meticulous research, 'Public Enemies: America's Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI, 1933-34.' Relentless G-man Purvis (a convincing but bloodless Christian Bale) and his rising boss FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup, both droll and period) are part of another story as important as the bank robber's final wide ride, the story of the growing cruelty and relentlessness of the forces of American law.<br/><br/>Look at another title of a movie about a doomed but spectacular crime spree: Arthur Penn's 'Bonnie and Clyde.' That 1967 classic works so well because it's character-driven. Even in the sketchy but powerful scenes that outline John Dillinger's romance with French-Native American hatcheck girl Billie Frechette (Marion Cottillard, working wonders with limited material), character is subsidiary to function: ""I rob banks,"" Johnny says. And then: ""What else you need to know?"" Well, quite a lot, actually, for a rounded character to emerge. Mann's movie is meticulous as to period look, to facade, but not to essence. Its street scenes are full of detail, its clothes immaculate and accurate. Taking place in 1933-34, however, it provides too few overt signs of the Great Depression. The film is also misleading in showing the Dillinger gang only robbing grand, marble-hall-and-column banks, when in fact they mostly robbed small and middling sized ones.<br/><br/>The overall result is a collection of contradictions. There is romance, but the effect isn't romantic. There's precise realism, but the overall effect isn't realistic. Perhaps the only unmitigated pleasure that remains is the images, the digital with its cold precision, its crisp edges even when many of the cameras are jiggly and hand-held, the depth of detail in darkness, the color that is neither bright nor faded, the sheer satisfying crispness of everything and everybody. And in this one aspect, a sublimely heightened vérité whose look is something quite new, 'Public Enemies' matches 'Bonnie and Clyde:' it makes us feel we're seeing period scenes with contemporary eyes. The best and most memorable images are the complex ones you won't see in stills where many actors are running back and forth in front of the camera, the gunshots are popping realistically in every direction, and there is no hint of the usual film chiaroscuro or highlighting, but the light is somehow beautiful. The cameras move too much, but they do rub your face in the action. What's gong on you may figure out later.<br/><br/>Maybe you can't avoid mythologizing when you shoot a movie about a famous Thirties bank robber and shouldn't try to, but Mann does. He's working, with great accomplishment, from that meticulous historical account, involving dozens of players on both the cop and the crook sides. Dillinger (and alternatively the totally unappealing Purvis) stay in the foreground. But there too is a contradiction, because the way Depp plays his part, witty, cold, and focused rather than warm and down-to-earth, his character ends up being impressive, but ultimately absent. (Contrast Warren Beatty's impotence and blinking charm as Clyde Barrow, an absence you yet want to cuddle.) Even when the characters are strong in Public Enemies, they don't get enough chance to interact. Dillinger is rarely with Frechette. His chance to confront Purivs is too brief, the moment when Purvis tells him he's to be extradited to Indiana and he quips, ""There's absolutely nothing I want to do in Indiana."" He's not facing off Purvis; he's playing to the audience.<br/><br/>This should have been one of the showpieces of the season, and it is indeed a blockbuster with class in a world of junk. Its virtuoso look and complexly orchestrated scenes will hold up with time, but despite a freshness in approaching familiar genre material, it's missing that certain 'je ne sais quoi.' Even though it's different, it lacks style, movie-making panache, playfulness, suspense, the ability to push a climax, the capacity to take a breather so the momentum builds up again. There's an impressive twittering machine functioning here on all its Ford V8 cylinders. But the light touch is missing, the capacity to make you say ""Yeah!"", to simultaneously stand apart and admire while utterly caught up in it all."
"IndependentThoughtAlarm","6","93","139","4 July 2009"," Overlong and ultimately disappointing.
","I'll spare you any suspense, here. Simply put, Public Enemies is a major disappointment. There is one aspect that the film has going for it, though, and that is the performances. Johnny Depp is great but, as I've read in other reviews, not exactly irreplaceable. Marion Cotillard is fantastic, but underused. Christian Bale is solid, but pretty forgettable. Unfortunately, everything else about the film proved disappointing.<br/><br/>This is the story of John Dillinger, who robbed banks, broke out of prisons, shot a lot of guns, loved a woman he met and didn't spend much time with, and...not much else. At least, that's what Public Enemies would have you believe. So little actually happens in this film it's a marvel they managed to stretch the running time past an hour and a bit.<br/><br/>A short run through: John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) escapes from a prison. Then he robs a bank. Then he meets Billie (Marion Cotillard), and they fall in love. He robs another bank. Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) wants to catch him. Shootout. Bank robbery. Repeat. He gets shot. How long did that take me, 30 seconds? I'm not saying the film was unnecessary, it was just unnecessarily long. So many scenes could have been cut down or just taken away altogether. The shootout near the middle of the film took so long to get through, that about halfway through it I had completely forgotten what it was they were doing. From that point on, it was nothing but bullets, blood, yelling and a lot of flashes from the guns that nearly blinded me.<br/><br/>The film wasn't exactly a treat for the eyes, either. The look of the film was horribly uneven, split evenly three ways between beautiful, crystal clear shots, amateur student film hand-held, and security camera footage. Either one wouldn't have been awful on its own, but it was just so wildly inconsistent that a good chunk of the time I was too distracted, wondering what had happened to the camera (sometimes between shots in the same scene), to worry about the story.<br/><br/>And like I said above, there's not much story to tell here. I'm sure the man had a very interesting life, but there was no real point to the film. It didn't seem like there was any specific story to tell. Quite simply put, it was merely about John Dillinger. ""Well, just what about John Dillinger?"", you ask. And I don't have an answer for you. Sorry. Either way, the film didn't highlight Dillinger as a hero or as a villain, and while I don't mind the impartial nature of the film in itself, I had a hard time really caring about what happened to him.<br/><br/>The love story was easily the most entertaining part of the film. Too bad it didn't show up much. My favorite parts of the film involved Marion Cotillard, and they didn't last long. What a shame. If they had cut down the major shootout or cut out one or two of the bank robbery scenes that were mostly all the same, they could have focused more on that story and I wouldn't have minded the runtime as much.<br/><br/>So, aside from the good performances from just about everyone involved, there's not much to get excited about here. It was overlong, pretty low on plot, and filled to the brim with unnecessary scenes that had left my mind before I had even left the theater. Such a disappointment. It could have been something great, and it just...wasn't.<br/><br/>6/10"
"anhedonia","1","99","149","11 July 2009"," A muddled mess
","Why is it that anyone who is critical of Michael Mann's ""Public Enemies"" is promptly branded as a ""hater"" on this Web site? I don't hate this film or the filmmaker, I just believe it's not a very good film.<br/><br/>I've enjoyed some of Mann's films in the past. I am a fan of ""Thief"" (1981), ""Manhunter"" (1986) and ""Heat"" (1995) and thought ""The Insider"" (1999) and ""Ali"" (2001) were interesting. But, as far as I am concerned, ""The Last of the Mohicans"" (1992) was over-blown - it is not, as one poster claimed, one of the five best films ever made; it's not even one of the 5,000 best films ever made - ""Collateral"" (2004) started off intriguingly before turning into an utterly conventional thriller, and ""Miami Vice"" (2006) was rubbish.<br/><br/>But I went into ""Public Enemies"" with much optimism, given that it stars Johnny Depp and Marion Cotillard. And the subject seemed thoroughly suited for Mann.<br/><br/>What a tremendous disappointment ""Public Enemies"" turned out to be.<br/><br/>There is absolutely nothing special about this film. The best it can be called is middling. It is hum-drum, run-of-the-mill and certainly not something I expected from someone of Mann's caliber.<br/><br/>For starters, this film is not about public enemies; it's about a public enemy. Blink and you will miss Pretty Boy Floyd. And you have no idea who Baby Face Nelson is until someone in the film points him out.<br/><br/>The film began promisingly with the exciting breakout from an Indiana penitentiary. The cinematography looked terrific in that opening shot and there was something delightfully visceral about that sequence.<br/><br/>But then came the rest of the film.<br/><br/>The story moved from one tedious set piece to another. Roger Ebert, whose criticism I respect, lauded Mann for his ""meticulous"" research for this film. I wonder if Mann's meticulousness included killing off Pretty Boy Floyd, Baby Face Nelson and Homer Van Meter *before* Dillinger when, in real life, they all outlived Dillinger. And Van Meter was *not* gunned down along with Baby Face Nelson.<br/><br/>I realize Mann's fans claim this is a movie and Mann was taking artistic license to enhance his story, as is his wont. But I wonder whether these fans would have echoed similar sentiments if Mann, say, had Muhammad Ali fight Joe Frazier in the Rumble in the Jungle in ""Ali"" or had Ali lose the fight to Foreman in that film.<br/><br/>Historical inaccuracies aside, ""Public Enemies"" is just dull. Mann wants us to believe that Dillinger and Billie Frechette were soul mates. But the only word to described their relationship - as Mann shows it - is bland. Which is a shame considering he had two fine actors in Depp and Cotillard and completely wastes them. They are given very little to work with and their dialogue is, at times, downright embarrassing.<br/><br/>Depp has oodles of charm and charisma, but he plays Dillinger solely as cool. There's nothing more to his persona, and when Depp has to be mean on a few occasions, it just doesn't work. Christian Bale, on the other hand, is entirely forgettable as Purvis. It's a nothing character and Bale plays him exactly as he has all his other recent roles. This is a somnambulist Batman and John Connor playing Purvis, mumbling his lines and showing next to no emotion. You learn nothing about Purvis throughout the entire film.<br/><br/>I felt sorry for the wonderful Cotillard because her relatively minor role is made even more minute because her character has no depth and she gets little help from a wanting script. In fact, none of the characters has much depth, if any, and so Mann wastes a talented cast of supporting players that includes Stephen Dorff, Stephen Lang, David Wenham, Matt Craven, Giovanni Ribisi, Jason Clarke, Leelee Sobieski and James Russo.<br/><br/>Then there's the cinematography and I really don't know if one can blame Dante Spinotti for this. I realize Mann is in love with digital technology and while that might have worked on ""Collateral"" and ""Miami Vice,"" it does not here. With the exception of a few lovely shots, the rest of the film looks like it was shot on someone's cheap holiday camera. I have seen home movies that looked crisper, brighter. The night-time scenes look thoroughly washed out and sans any contrast and the infamous shoot-out in Little Bohemia - which is terribly choreographed - looks like a lousy video game.<br/><br/>I am not averse to shooting in digital. There are countless films that look terrific shot on high-definition digital. Take a peek at ""The Lookout"" (2007), for instance. It looks spectacular shot on high-def. I personally believe that period pieces should be shot on film, but even granting Mann's decision to shoot digital, why on earth didn't he use, say, Panavision's Genesis or the Red One cameras? He certainly wasn't constrained by the budget.<br/><br/>I realize Mann could take a crap at Hollywood and Vine and his fans would consider it a masterpiece. But it's still crap and just because it came from Mann doesn't turn it into gold.<br/><br/>""Public Enemies"" is simply a disappointing movie. It lacks any depth, the characters are boring at best, insipid at worst. The film ambles along without any sense of how to tell a story or put that story into the context of American history and, after a while, all I could think of was how much better Arthur Penn fared with ""Bonnie and Clyde"" (1967), how much more I wanted to see that film instead and could we please get to The Biograph already.<br/><br/>But Mann even managed to screw up the grand finale by adding an unnecessarily hokey and sentimental coda."
"Hunt2546","5","218","346","1 July 2009"," Ambitious, expensive but crippled with dud characters, dim ideas.
","Very disappointing retelling of the 13-month John Dillinger crime spree across the Midwest in 1933-34. Here's why without any BS: 1.) No personality. Gang members remain ciphers throughout. (When Red Hamilton (Jason Clark) dies after being in EVERY OTHER SCENE you think: Who the hell is he. None of the subsidiary people pop, unlike the vast number of vivid unique individuals in HEAT. 2.) Depp miscast badly. Read about Dillinger: he was ebullient, charming, commanding. With NO experience he commandeered the best pro bank robbers in the Midwest to follow his lead and led them on a 13-month blaze of glory and infamy. Depp instead is pensive, moody, brooding, internalized: he never displays the charisma and guile that the historic Dillinger did. He was chosen for his romantic chops, not his gangster chops, because of . . . 3.) Misemphasis on romantic. Mann pays too much attention to Dillinger's least interesting thing, that is, his affair with Billy Freschette. This was clearly NOT a love-unto-death deal like Bonnie and Clyde. Before Billy, Dillinger had girlfriends, after Billy Dillinger had girlfriends and during Billy, Dillinger had girlfriends. The guy had been in stir 9 years; he had a lot of catching up to do. Mann emphasizes this affair, ignores Dillinger's unique connection to his family in Indiana (very interesting), his leadership skills, his courage. Very odd and unfortunate (and disappointing) choice. 4.) Accuracy, as in, lack thereof. Mann really doesn't progress beyond Milius's 1973 truncated take; he starts out with lies (Dillinger at escape from state pen by his cohorts, Purvis singlehandedly bringing down Pretty Boy Floyd) in the first two scenes and it never gets better. In fact most of the men we watch die in the film died AFTER, not before, Dillinger, including Floyd and Babyface Nelson and Homer Van Meter and Harry Pierpont. Why did Mann buy rights to Burroughs' ""Public Enemies"" if he was going to make stuff up? Also (SPOILER): a major meme in the film is that the syndicate, under Frank Nitti, ""got"" Dillinger because his kind of spectacular showboat caper was screwing things up for the big money boys; in the literature, I can find NO evidence of this being the case. 5.) Introduced, then abandoned, themes: Mann intros at least four major ideas about Dillinger and his fate which could serve as a kind of structure for the movie; then he abandons all of them, leaving them as pointless curiosities. The first I've mentioned: that the mob got Dillinger. No. 2 (from Burroughs): Hoover used the Road Warrior bandits crime spree as a methodology to grow his Bureau and cement his own control of it and his place in popular culture. No. 3: the coming of western gunman. Indeed, at a certain point, the Bureau did bring in experienced gunfighters as Mann shows, but he never really dramatizes or builds on their contribution to the take-down of the bad guys. He seems to set up, then walk away from the idea of cowboys vs. bank robbers. Very disappointing. 4. The inexperience of Hoover. He includes a scene (it actually took place in 1936, not '33) where a Senator derides Hoover and makes a big deal over the fact that Hoover's never made an arrest. Then of course Mann doesn't bring that issue to conclusion, showing Hoover arresting Alvin Karpis, who is a kind of mystery guest (he's played by Giovonni Ribisi) who appears and disappears from the film without explanation. Which leads to: 6.) Editing woes. Ribisi is just one such mystery guest; other big name, well-known people appear in meaningless, undeveloped characters, suggesting that whole subplots of the film were left out and what we're seeing in a hasty, shortened edit (like the version of ""Once Upon a Time in America"" that was initially released). You can fairly ask: what the hell are Ribisi, Leelee Sobieski, Matt Craven and Steven Lang even doing here when they have so little to do; Craven doesn't even have any lines! I am looking forward to a director's cut sometime in the future. On the plus side, yes: great clothes, great cars, great location shots, superb editing and beast of all great gunfights. But the guns demonstrate some astonishing marginal attention to detail while much large issues of history are deliberately misstated. Why does Mann get the fact the Babyface had a Colt .38 Super converted to a machine pistol with a Thompson vertical fore-grip mounted on the dustcover (look fast or you'll miss it) at the Little Bohemia shootout but insist, after John Milius, (SPOILER) that the Babyface was slain there. Nelson didn't die until October and he went down hard, taking two FBIers with him. Ultimate judgment: such a squandered opportunity! There's probably never going to be another big Dillinger movie and it sickens me that Mann willfully made so many dubious decisions. These people lived and died and fought and bled for and against us, gave us their lives; they deserved SO MUCH BETTER."

","Public Enemies, this film has been built up for quite a while, why not? It stars Johnny Depp as one of history's most famous bank robbers. Also the city of Chicago has been excited to see this, in some strange way we considered Dillinger to be a Robin Hood as he never took money from the common man, just from the banks. He also was clever enough to escape jail by making a fake gun out of a soap bar, I lived in Indiana for a year and people are incredibly proud that Crown Point was where Dillinger had fooled everyone, lol. So naturally I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, especially with Johnny Depp as John Dillinger, it's a can't miss. Unfortunately for me, the film fell short of our expectations as the way it was made and how there is lack of material for Depp and Bale to work with to give these characters any depth. Mann makes a film that is using a digital camera for a film set in the 1930's and doesn't really bring his A game to the film as it's more like ""Here's Dillinger's story enjoy"".<br/><br/>Set in 1933 John Dillinger is brought to a penitentiary, but is there to break out the rest of his gang. After loosing a few of his friends, he's headed to Chicago to make his mark on the banks. Melvin Purvis is upgraded by J. Edgar Hoover, who is protecting the FBI from scrutiny by politicians, to lead the hunt for John. John later meets Billie Frechette, whom he takes to dinner. He states plainly what he will do for her and how he will treat her if they are to have a relationship. After a shoot out gone horribly wrong and making the police look more incompetent, Purvis demands that Hoover bring in professional lawmen who know how to catch criminals dead or alive. Though Hoover had hoped for more pristine agents, he agrees. While John and Billie are enjoying the luxuries across the States, the police finally find Dillinger and arrest him and his gang in Miami. However, Dillinger and a few inmates escape from prison using a fake gun. He is goaded into a bank robbery job by an acquaintance, Dillinger agrees. The robbery goes fine until Nelson impulsively kills a nearby police officer, alerting more of the robbery, making Dillinger Public Enemy Number 1.<br/><br/>Now Public Enemies is by no means a bad film, some of the actors were terrific and the sets were perfect as well as the whole feel of the film. But it just won't stop with the ""Run! Chase! Run! Chase! Shoot! Shoot!"" scenes that seem to dull down after a while. The love story between Dillinger and his gal, Billie didn't seem too necessary, it added to the story but for me felt a little out of place at times. I have to tell you that I'm feeling so incredibly bad for Christian Bale this year as it seems like he's been given characters who are not well written, but I'm starting to wonder if the Batman voice is his new trademark because he was starting to use that voice again in a few sentences. Depp does the best he can, but once again with the lack of material; he's made out completely as the hero of the film, instead of maybe having more of a documentary feel to it and being biased on how cool Dillinger was. Maybe he's Mann's personal hero, who knows. But over all the film is decent enough for the watch, I'd just say if you want to see it, go for a matinée or a rental, it wasn't worth the full price.<br/><br/>7/10"
"Billy_Costigan","Null","282","470","1 July 2009"," John Dillinger- Public Enemy #1
","The year is 1933, it's the Great Depression. A time for the desperate to do the unthinkable. Crime was on the rise and people were suffering. For John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) it was a time of infinite possibilities and opportunities. To combat the sharp incline in rampant criminal activity, J. Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup) forms the FBI, led by Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale). Together they target Dillinger as public enemy number one. Relying on new methods of intelligence gathering (such as tracking the purchase location of a coat or recording phone conversations), the firepower of trained gunmen, and his own relentless nature, Purvis gets closer and closer to Dillinger and company.<br/><br/>""I like baseball, movies, good clothes, fast cars... and you. What else do you need to know?"" - John Dillinger. Johnny Depp IS John Dillinger. He's perfect for the role. The cool, confident and almost cocky nature of the character is really portrayed on screen (such as bragging to reporters about his bank jobs and teasing Purvis and agents who are after him). It's a look of how a man lived and succeeded in a hard time. Dillinger was a man that lived in the moment as only a man in the depression could. From the worlds on John Dillinger, ""I'm to busy having fun today to even think about tomorrow."" Who knows what tomorrow might bring? Bale also succeeds in his role and is a solid counterpart against Depp. It works well having two top, well known actors opposing each other on screen. <br/><br/>The film is directed by Michael Mann who brought us such films as Heat, The Insider, and Collateral and he adds another good film to his resume with this one. The action sequences, bank heists, and shootouts in this film are probably the biggest highlights. After all, this is from the same guy who gave us one of the most famous and arguably the best shootout of all time in Heat. The sequences are cool, slick, and gritty. Excellence at it's best. (I have to throw in a note of praise for the superb shootout at the Little Bohemia lodge, which was an extremely impressive scene)<br/><br/>The cat and mouse aspect makes it intriguing, but I think more could have been added to it. It just feels as if something was missing. Much of the film focuses on the love story between Dillinger and Billie Frechette (Marion Cottillard) It's also interesting to see the other gangsters of this time and how they relate to Dillinger and the criminal world.<br/><br/>Much has been made of Public Enemies being filmed on HD video, mostly complaints. I must say that at times, the picture looked amazing. The night sequences, especially looked beautifully slick and realistic. I loved the cinematography here. The cars, headlights, street lights, and everything looked fantastic. Other times, it doesn't look as good. It just felt as if something didn't look right. I'm not sure what to think about this. <br/><br/>One problem I had with this film would have to be the lack of character depth in many of the characters. At times, it seems as if we are expected to know and understand the characters before going to see the film because it is a real life story. But as a film, it could have developed the characters more to help us (and those who know nothing about Dillinger, his life, or Purvis and the FBI) understand them better. Another problem was some of the historical inaccuracies. Many things portrayed in the film, do not happen as they did in real life. Many sequences are just out of order. I know the filmmakers had to know about this and just tried to work it in as best as they could. It's not a documentary, it's a movie.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed Public Enemies. It's a solid crime drama and a good summer film. I understand expectations were through the roof, but that's a little hard to ask for. It's a really good film, but not quite a great one... The action is fun, the story is interesting. Maybe instead of being a very good film, it could have became a really great film if more was put into the characters? I'm not sure. It just felt as if something were missing. But who can knock a film for still being good?"
"Hawley_Griffin","8","25","35","20 August 2009"," Back to the '30s with Mann
","My grandpa's first reaction when he heard this movie was being released was -why? Why yet another movie about Dillinger? What can it add? My grandpa's question triggered my thinking. Movies and Hollywood filmmakers don't seem to care anymore about adding something to history or the medium. They just seem to compulsively adapt other movies, toy lines or videogames into modern reworkings. It's a culture of thoughtless recycling. Fortunately, and although I haven't seen the '30s or '70s biopics, Michael Mann does have something to show.<br/><br/>The first surprise is how the movie is shot. As one of the most vocal followers of digital video, Mann seems to exploit its handicaps instead of trying to convince us it can look as good as film. Throughout the movie we're treated to 3D video feel, artificial grain and close-ups which show up every pore on the actors skins. It's like someone sent a documentary crew back in time. However, this incongruous approach also made me experience the 1930s in a way I'd never done before, as a reality instead of a postcard. Almost all movie depictions of the ""public enemies"" era (even the gritty ones, like Bonnie and Clyde) are stylish and sophisticated. Instead, Mann's compulsive attention to prop and costume detail combined with the hand-held camera-work are immediately urging and attention-grabbing.<br/><br/>Mann, as a filmmaker, always seemed to me more interested in technique than depth or story. This is arguably the same film he has made twice before (I'm talking about Thief and Heat), only this time history-based. As I read on about Dillinger and Melvin Purvis after watching the film, I realized the movie's script is very unusual in that it almost seems to strip the juicy bits out of the story. Where is the scene with the people soaking their handkerchiefs on Dillinger's blood, or the '30s era depression portrait? Like you guys were saying, Little Bohemia was in fact an embarrassment to the FBI in which civilians got shot and the criminal walked away unharmed. Except for a weird scene in which Dillinger walks into the Chicago police station and wanders around, there's a very down-to-earth approach to the character, taking away his more mythical elements and leaving us with a career robber who, like James Caan's character in Thief, seems to abstractly decide to fall in love to make up for lost time.<br/><br/>The movie focuses obsessively on this relationship, instead of the more obvious paths it could have taken. Hoover's incompetence and his closet homosexuality are brief side notes. So is Melvin Purvis. The movie strips him of a personality, showing only the professional side of the policeman. This is so evident that when the title card near the end informs us that he later shot himself, I had to laugh it was so random. I seem to be speaking against all of this, but in fact what I'm doing is pointing out how unusual all of these directorial choices are. In fact, I celebrate them. Public Enemies is a movie that might seem frustrating to many, but to me, it was a refreshing, exciting journey into a world too often depicted and too easily neutralized. It's a great thing to see a copmen-and-robbers film without feeling like I've seen it all before. And make no mistake, the film's action scenes are intense.<br/><br/>I'd like to finish by pointing out that the movie has a hell of a cast. Johnny Depp is a revelation in a time when it looked like his awesomeness was exhausting itself. Christian Bale is not given much to do as Purvis, but he's competent, mostly the Bale serious face we see too much of all the time. Billy Crudup's Hoover is great, he deserves his own flick. Marion Cotillard is a great foil to Depp. There are a lot of very famous faces on the film (in fact, maybe too many), and some of them are only in for very brief seconds - Lily Tomlin, Giovanni Ribisi and Leelee Sobieski enter and leave the screen and they're all very good, but none have any big scenes. This might be the artsiest blockbuster I've ever seen. Which, in my mind, is a compliment."
"hollyfairbanks-usa","7","140","243","2 July 2009"," Johnny Dillinger and other characters
","Digital is the world of Michael Man with all its drawbacks. It works up to a point, if you don't mind being distracted by the make up on the actors faces, pimples and blemishes. The final adventures on John Dillinger's life look and feel like a work of fiction and I suspect that in ""Public Enemies"" they are, 50/50, fact and fiction. Johnny Depp is marvelous no matter what and his is a star performance. There is only a vague approach to a real characterization, but I didn't care because I go wherever Johnny Depp wants to take me. It was like that with Gary Cooper too, wasn't it? Part of the sneaky narrative is to have Dillinger the criminal played by the angelic Depp and Purvis the noble FBI guy played by Christian Bale that emanates evil without even trying. If you're interested in performances, like I am, Billy Crudup is the thing in a sensational turn as J Edgar Hoover in spite of the digital thing, that makes him look as if Hoover suffered from some rare skin condition, damn shame if you ask me. Marion Cottillard is absolutely lovely but we knew that already and the rest of the characters remain an enigma, they enter and leave the scene without us ever having a clue who they are. Giovanni Ribisi, Stephen Dorff, Jason Clark, who were they and Lelee Sobieski? It was startling to see her appear on the third act. Who was she suppose to be? In any case, the film has a Michael Mann feel and it's technically great. The shootings are extraordinary and Johnny Depp totally beautiful. I suppose that should be enough to applaud and recommend ""Public Enemies"". I did and I will even if, I must confess, I expected more or maybe less."
"praveen77","7","58","97","13 August 2009"," Not one of Mann's best, but still...
","Whenever a Michael Mann movie comes out, I am besieged by expectations. This is one director whose style I seem to consistently like. The Insider, Heat, Collateral, The Last of the Mohicans, and yes.. I LOVED Miami Vice the movie (despite the many negative reviews it seemed to have got). So, when Public Enemies came out, and seeing Mann team up with Johnny Depp and Christian Bale, I knew I could not miss this. However, probably because of the high standards he has set for himself, I was a little disappointed with this. <br/><br/>The story is about a gangster bank robber, John Dillinger(Johnny Depp), back in the '30's, who pulled off a couple of daring heists and prison breaks. He was generally considered a hero among the public, as this was during the years of the great depression and Dillinger was seen as someone who steals from the rich man. A fledging FBI, led by the peerless J. Edgar Hoover, decide to hunt him down so that they can grow the organization, and name him Public Enemy Number 1. Melvin Purvis(Christian Bale) is assigned the task of leading this group of agents.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is as usual great, but you get a feeling he would have been even better if the script had given enough scope to explore the character of Dillinger. The same goes with his love interest, played by Marillon Cotillard. Again, a wonderful actress, but at times the love story seemed forced into the story. Despite this, they have great chemistry. <br/><br/>Which brings me to Christian Bale. This is an actor who has so much more to offer than the half baked roles he has been getting this year. You get a feeling this year that he is being offered big movies which don't give him a character he can bite his teeth into. First there was Terminator Salvation, and now this. In both, his character never really seemed into the movie as compared to the others. I'm waiting to see a movie again where he will assert himself.<br/><br/>Despite the flaws, this is still a good movie from Mann. Just don't go in expecting it to out do his best."
"thechrisclarkblog","4","6","7","10 December 2009"," America's Most Mediocre
","With Michael Mann directing and a variety of A-list actors starring, ""Public Enemies"" should have been one of the top contenders for the 2010 Academy Awards, arriving next March. On top of the credentials belonging to the talent in front of and behind the camera, its source material, the last year of notorious bank robber John Dillinger's life, should have been enough to clench a nomination for ""Best Picture."" Unfortunately, its likelihood of garnering such attention has been diminished by its undeniable mediocrity. Johnny Depp, portraying Dillinger, is very good in this role, and Marion Cotillard simply steals the show as his lover, Billie Frechette; but the rest is flat and surprisingly lifeless. For a film that had the fuel to come out swinging and deliver a showstopper of a gangster drama, it instead limps out with a mild whimper and never gains the momentum necessary to keep us interested and involved. We are left feeling like we are stuck in the doldrums."
"talewright","1","64","111","3 July 2009"," Dull and Uninteresting
","I remember how I felt when I finally realized that Santa Claus did not exist, and I had that same feeling after viewing ""Public Enemies"" with Johnny Depp and Christian Bale. I never thought I'd see a day when these two fine actors would star in such a dull and uninteresting movie.<br/><br/>Their fine acting aside, this movie has as much in common with other excellent biopics as Michael Moore does with presenting untainted and unedited truth.<br/><br/>It's as though Michael Mann wrote too much, shot too much, had too much money to spend, and edited too little.<br/><br/>I kept waiting for that magical moment when the movie would pick up and the excitement would grow, finally exploding in a dramatic climax that movie aficionados such as myself love. Never happened. Depp and Bale are at their best, but the tedious of the story-telling, the lack of character sympathy, and the over all cut-and-run of the editing created 140 minutes of boredom.<br/><br/>""Public Enemies"" is a 90 minute movie crammed into 140 minutes.<br/><br/>Want to see a good Dillinger movie? Try ""Dillinger"" with Lawrence Tierney from 1945. Shorter, to the point, and unpretentious."
"Rafacus","8","140","259","1 July 2009"," It is an entertaining backseat ride into the life of a country boy turned bank robber
","With Billie Holiday singing her heart out and the subtle details of cracked nail polish and $3 dresses, Public Enemies brings you into the era of the Great Depression without boring you with back stories and explanations.<br/><br/>It is an honest bio-pic with little factual variations outside of John Dillinger's romantic ambitions. It is an entertaining backseat ride into the life of a country boy turned bank robber in a time where America hated money-makers and banks. A time when people were starving and in need of a gun-toting, charismatic mid-western boy to stir things up a bit, one bank robbery at a time.<br/><br/>A Cast of Winning Players Director Michael Mann is known best for Heat, Collateral and Miami Vice. His attention to detail is known and it is said that he went above the call of duty in his research for this movie. Obviously he deemed it important to depict a true version of the Dillinger story with a bit of Hollywood sprinkled in to keep our attention. Johnny Depp is solid as the charismatic bank robber, adopting his mannerisms, speech and swagger and even the trademark smirk that is seen on all of Dillinger's photos. Christian Bale is perfect as Melvin Purvis, looking similar to the ""G man"" and confidently playing the role convincingly.<br/><br/>Digital Camera and No true sense of good and Bad The camera threw me off a bit switching from an old sepia toned look to a digital one during fights. At times it made you feel as if you were an observant on the street while other times it felt just like a movie. I wasn't sure why this was but I concluded that Mann wanted us to be there with Dillinger most of the time and at other times we are to observe from a distance. There was no great love felt for any of the dark heroes, the charismatic Dillinger was likable but I never felt concern for his well-being. The FBI agent in Purvis (Christian Bale) was the typical white knight archetype and was given little personality outside of this so I felt nothing for him either. The romance between Dillinger and Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard) was interesting but felt clichéd (gangsters always have THAT chick in these movies) and just like real life that political blowhard J.Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup) is the only real ""bad guy"" in the entire film.<br/><br/>Final Thoughts It felt like a different time period and the choreography of the gunfights were done well enough to keep me interested. With as colorful a crew as the boys who ran with John Dillinger, it would have been hard to direct a movie like this while keeping everyone relative. Men like Alvin Karpis (Giovanni Ribisi), Pretty Boy Floyd (Channing Tatum) and Baby Face Nelson (Stephen Graham) are given screen time, as well as Capone's number one do-boy Frank Nitti (Bill Camp). Still there was so much shown that you tend to lose your familiarity with Dillinger's quest for whatever it is he wanted and the hopelessness of his situation settles in after awhile. It is a good movie with no real emotional weight, just a ""this is what happened"" gloss to the entire thing with a sprinkling of charisma to top it off. If anything, you will go researching Dillinger and gang after the movie has piqued your interest.<br/><br/>www.SpicyMovieDogs.com"
"iampaulinnyc","1","67","120","25 June 2009"," Incomprehensible and nearly unwatchable
","I like Michael Mann's work -- the man is a true talent...which makes it all the more incomprehensible that he could create such a baffling piece of cinema. I saw the film at a preview in NYC a couple of nights ago and my brain still hurts trying to catalog all the places this film went so very wrong.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the film's problems emanate from the script which does little to illuminate the characters in any visceral way, save for a sliver of Dillinger. We, the audience, really don't know who anyone is or why we should care...until very late in the game but by then we are simply praying, fervently, for it to be over. I'm not saying we need to like Mr. Depp's character in any way; we simply long to understand him, or just enjoy his foibles. As laid out by Mr. Mann we never do, a maddening experience.<br/><br/>And why in sweet heaven's name is it called ""Public Enemies""? We never, ever, focus on the the plural in that title; the other ""enemies"" are barely seen or known. If the film needed to be cut, virtually eliminating the other ""enemies,"" then change the title to Public Enemy No 1. The title they went with has nothing to do with this movie.<br/><br/>Then there's the look of the film, muddy and indistinct. How is it possible to take a woman as lovely as Marion Cotillard and make her look anything less than beguiling? Mr. Mann's choice of lighting and camera lens gives the film an unnecessarily shadowy and grimy look -- and that keeps us at arm's length from the characters in a very frustrating way.<br/><br/>And why was the sound so muddled, rendering many lines difficult to hear? I don't think it was the theater we were in, an excellent UWS venue.<br/><br/>The story of Dillinger presents a wonderful chance to show the fascinating, historically accurate tension between the characters of Dillinger, J Edgar Hoover, Purvis against the backdrop of an American public who were ""fans"" of the outlaws. These perfectly juxtaposing circumstances are never exploited for us to enjoy.<br/><br/>Normally I'd RACE to see a film with Depp, Bale, Crudup, Cotillard -- I love them all. In this case, I raced FROM the theater...murmuring ""why why why."""
"gary-444","8","102","193","3 July 2009"," 1930's Chicago Revisited in Style
","Eighty years after the events, Michael Mann takes on the Period Chicago Gangster genre, and wins, with this entertaining story. Do not be put off by some churlish carping from the critics, much of which is generated by the very high standards that Mann's films are now judged. The lengthy 140 minute running time flies by leaving the audience wondering about what could have been added to the story, not what should have been omitted.<br/><br/>Essentially this is the story of the life, in his heyday, and death of Gangster John Dillinger. It bounces along, leaving little room for back story or leisurely character development, like Dillinger,it lives for the moment. Johhny Depp is superb as Dillinger, Christian Bale a thoroughly convincing Melvin Purvis, his taciturn but determined G-Man nemesis.<br/><br/>A plot curio is that some time is given over to J Edgar Hoover's fight to establish an FBI with Purvis operating as his local enforcer.But the role is under developed, it could be dropped with no impact on the plot, making you wonder how much extra footage was left on the cutting room floor, hopefully set for an appearance on the DVD.<br/><br/>Marion Cotillard, a native Frenchwoman, plays the part of the leading lady, and Dillingers love interest, well enough. In a role which offers infrequent appearances, she conforms to the genre requirements of being easily bedded, hit, and cries on demand.<br/><br/>Critics have queried the way that the digital film is shot.There is none of the lushness of ""last of the Mohicans"", nor the grittiness of ""Collateral"", but the compelling plot leaves little time to worry about that.Review audiences also complained of poor sound quality and mumbled dialogue, not faults that I could identify with on this showing.<br/><br/>The ""showdown"" between Dillinger and Purvis happens early on, in a scene which is played straight and without lingering fanfare, it is certainly no re-run of De Niro v Pacino in ""Heat"".If the film lacks anything it is a sense of Tragedy, so wonderfully apparent in De Palma's ""Carlitos Way"". Depp and Purvis are played so ruthlessly and efficiently by Depp and Bale that pathos and emotional attachment are on pretty short display.<br/><br/>The period is lovingly recreated by Mann and the action sequences, unsurprisingly, never fail to disappoint, indeed when Dillinger is first shown robbing a bank his vault over the counter is seen in graceful slow motion. Diana Krall has a pleasing cameo as a nightclub torch singer performing ""Bye Bye Blackbird"" and the costumes are a consistent delight.<br/><br/>Punchy, light on its feet and offering weighty roles for Depp and Bale, this will be enjoyed by ardent fans and the curious alike."
"shannon macgregor","1","67","125","1 July 2009"," This Film Is Junk
","""Public Enemies"" is poorly directed, poorly acted, poorly shot, and especially, poorly written.<br/><br/>At no point was I convinced by any of the performances. Depp walks around looking smug throughout the film. That's not acting. I can look smug, anybody can look smug. All of the other performances were also two-dimensional (as in flat), but that has as much to do with the way the characters were written and the way the cast members were directed in their performances as it does with the actors' own abilities.<br/><br/>So far as the screenplay is concerned, when you take a real-life bank robber who did in fact shoot and kill innocent people and make him look heroic, that is disgusting. I live in Zion, Illinois, halfway between Chicago and Milwaukee. Much of Dillinger's life of crime is within an hour's drive from my home. His crimes and actions are well-known around here. He was a disgusting criminal, and it was a great day when he was gunned down outside the Biograph Theater.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp tried to justify Dillinger's life of crime by stating that he didn't rob people, but banks, in his promotional appearances. What does he think a bank is? When you rob a bank, you rob everyone who does business with that bank. If I have an account at a bank, whether it be a savings account, a checking account, a CD, or whatever, I am robbed, too, if that bank is robbed, because it is my money that is being taken, not the bank's money. Depp's words are nonsense. He bought into the legend instead of the facts.<br/><br/>Another awful thing about this film is the camera-work and cinematography. The camera moves and moves and moves, hardly sitting still and focusing on anything. Hold the camera still! Let's see a shot that lasts for more than a few seconds!<br/><br/>This film is offensive and it's the worst film I have seen at the theater so far this year."
"SpotMonkee","8","3","3","3 March 2019"," One of Mann's most underappreciated and effective works
","Michael Mann vehicles always take a while to grow on you. The first time I saw it I didn't think it was anything too remarkable, just a period gangster flick with a lot of stylistic flourishes. Having re-watched recently as part of an ongoing Michael Mann kick, I can safely say it's one of the most thoughtful and achingly beautiful ""Very Serious™"" tentpole movies of the past decades. Mann knows how to take a script that in the hands of a lesser director would just be average and elevate it to something indescribable and, for lack of a better word, cosmic. Everything from the acting (including fine turns from Johnny Depp, Marion Cotillard, Christian Bale, and a tragically underutilized Billy Crudup), gritty but beautiful cinematography, gorgeous production and costume design, to Elliot Goldenthal's delicate and varied score give the impression of a period in history playing out before the audience's eyes and ears in a way few films I've seen have accomplished. John Dillinger's mythic crime spree is depicted simultaneously as romantic & tragic and gritty & brutal. Those unaccustomed to Mann's particular mode of low-shutterspeed, gritty handheld digital photography may find the presentation off-putting. But to those who know and appreciate it for what it is, Public Enemies is one of the director's most underappreciated works to date and ought to be reappraised as such."

","Johnny Depp was brilliant as Dillinger. You could really tell he loved his line of work, but also struggled with not completely becoming a thug. It was so nice to see him play such a different role for a change. It was real acting, not is normal eccentric character roles (don't get me wrong I love those as well) Christian Bale was also fantastic; you can see his conflict he was having with the job he was tasked to do vs. his own convictions.<br/><br/>Marion Cotillard was stunning and Channing Tatum was such a psycho as Pretty Boy Floyd you hated him and loved him at the same time.<br/><br/>One of the highlights for me was the music. The old nostalgic feeling and the narrator on the radio was one of my favorite bits that was used through out the film.<br/><br/>Over all the movie was excellent, my only issue is with the title.

"Igenlode Wordsmith","5","5","6","8 July 2009"," I'd rather have seen ""Manhattan Melodrama""
","I've been watching a series of genuine 1930s gangster films -- ""Little Caesar"", ""Scarface"" and their ilk. Perhaps that's not the best preparation for viewing a shiny new re-creation of that era, using modern film idiom and equipment; and perhaps I was subconsciously influenced by the decidedly mediocre newspaper reviews. Perhaps I have simply become too far disjointed from the cinema of my own era, due to an overdose of pre-1950s movies. Or perhaps ""Public Enemies"" just isn't that good a film...<br/><br/>For whatever reason, I felt that the gulf between this picture and those earlier productions epitomised a lot of what I find most off-putting about modern cinema: the film was too long, too loud and too violent (those pre-Code films didn't exactly pull their punches when it came to characters beating each other up or hosing each other down with bullets, but somehow they avoided the sense of gratuitous gun/torture porn), the characters insufficiently differentiated (to the degree that I found it often very confusing as to who exactly they were), the dialogue mumbled or slurred, plus a pointless sex scene that contributes nothing to the plot. The film appears to lack any central moral idea; and by that I don't mean some kind of lecturing, finger-waving message about the evils of gangsterism, but the sort of simple central concept that one takes for granted in films of an earlier era, whether it be ""He who lives by the sword, dies by the sword"", ""Friendship is stronger than the law"" or even ""Flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!"" Perhaps this is more true to real life, in that things do just randomly happen or not happen without fitting into any particular pattern -- but I find the result disturbingly empty in some way.<br/><br/>Having seen a number of genuine 30s productions literally days before watching this film, I also found the period setting unconvincing; presumably they went to some trouble to get appropriate props, costumes, etc, but somehow it rarely felt natural. I'm used to seeing this era in black and white and not in processed colour, of course (the rather odd palette must have been a conscious choice), but the characters didn't look at home in their costumes, the hair and moustache styles didn't have the familiar 30s air, and the vehicles seemed museum pieces rather than everyday parts of the scenery...<br/><br/>But far more seriously, ""Public Enemies"" is no ""Bonnie & Clyde"", ""Butch & Sundance"" or even ""Thelma & Louise"", because frankly we just don't care that much about the characters. Depp's performance as Dillinger is particularly odd, because the way that this central character is presented by the script seems to be at odds with the way that either Depp and/or director Michael Mann have chosen to play him: we are, from time to jarring time, told about a charismatic, chivalrous, laughing crook who tweaks the tail of the law and is seen by a large section of the public as a folk hero, yet what we actually see is a dour, withdrawn, almost drab individual whose chief selling point appears to be the nonentity that enables him to go unrecognised on at least two occasions. Maybe Johnny Depp is trying hard to shake off the mantle of Captain Jack Sparrow; but the part is crying out for some of that larger-than-life attraction and charm, and without it the character not only falls flat, but rings false.<br/><br/>Maybe, again, this is intentional, as an attempt to deglamorise the gangster myth. But what cannot be intentional is the way that Dillinger manages to come across as not caring very much about any of the things that are supposed to be prime movers in the plot: we are told that he never lets anyone down, yet he doesn't come across as particularly engaged with any of his friends, we are given to understand that he is passionately attached to Billie to the exclusion of his own safety (although, inconveniently, he gets himself killed when he is betrayed by the madam who provides him with one of her 'girls'), yet the affair between them fails to convince, and he doesn't even seem particularly interested either in money or in the abstract thrill of lawbreaking itself. In fact he comes over as a dull cold fish, and the result, I'm afraid, is a lacuna at the heart of the film that has to be laid at Depp's door. He has more than enough acting clout these days to pick and choose his projects and performances, so he must have deliberately set out to present this interpretation, but I have to say I can't see what it gains the film.<br/><br/>I found this picture distasteful, incoherent, and -- despite or even because of the extended firefights -- tedious. Oddly enough the film that I was specifically reminded of was the remake of ""Last of the Mohicans""; I was fascinated to discover that the latter was in fact directed by Michael Mann, making the resemblance presumably very far from coincidental!<br/><br/>The real killer for me, however, was the scene at the end where Dillinger is watching the contemporary gangster picture ""Manhattan Melodrama"" starring a newly-famous Clark Gable with William Powell and Myrna Loy. On the screen we have crisply-characterised actors and a fast-moving plot (we only see a few snippets of the story, but it's clear what's happening: Gable and Powell are old friends now on opposite sides of the law), clear lighting, attractive camera-work and, even in so short a space of screen time, actual emotional impact. In the auditorium we have muddy colours, an unattractive Dillinger peering obscurely from under his smoked glasses, and a turgid lack of tension in what ought to be the climax of the picture -- I really didn't care that much about him by this stage.<br/><br/>It was at this point, I'm afraid, that I realised that on the evidence, I'd really rather have been watching ""Manhattan Melodrama"" itself..."
"StarkTech","Null","45","84","3 July 2009"," Horrid and Shaky Camera Work + Dullness = Huge Disappointment
","I can't believe a director as accomplished as Michael Mann would produce a movie with this poor of a presentation. More than half the film consists of ultra zoom close ups. Are Johnny Depp's nose hairs really that camera worthy? Maybe they spent the entire budget on gathering this cast and had to hide their period piece shooting behind ultra zooms on two 1930's cars? The horrid and shaky camera work is far too distracting and often pulls the viewer right out of the film. Add to that a rather poor pace and a story that never allows you to connect with either lead and maybe this rating is too kind. For the most part, Dillinger's charm and savvy are lost as we never see what made him a competent bank robber or really why he was an infamous scoundrel. Bale's performance is monotone drab as is most of the running time of this very disappointing movie."

","What a fine collection of talent in Public Enemies. I had so much doubt in anticipation of this movie. I was told that the camera quality was low, Bale's acting was bad and that the plot was confusing and did not explain anything. After Miami Vice, I was willing to believe this might be another let down. Right in the first act, I knew that this movie was the one I have been waiting for.<br/><br/>The last wave of decent crime films was in the first half of the 90's with Heat, Fargo, Pulp Fiction, Goodfellas and Casino. Since then, I have been waiting for more cinematically well- crafted crime dramas. The ones that were expected to be comparable to the older films I think did not reach that level, such as American Gangster. I would say Eastern Promises, Gangs of New York, Road to Perdition, Collateral and The Departed came close, but they are more just good movies of their own.<br/><br/>Public Enemies is the first film in my opinion to have captured the essence of crime drama in a long time. It jumps right into the era, without the explanation that some people wished to have had. We enter right into the world, learning quickly the interactions between Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson, Frank Nitty, and much more of the criminal society of the Depression. I've always loved seeing these characters portrayed in the other movies they are featured in, but this film really had them right.<br/><br/>Michael Mann really exercised himself as an auteur on this outing. Many can criticize his style and decision to shoot HD. Still, artists can paint the crucifixion of Christ in many different ways, so Mann should have the right to explore the story in his own fashion as well. I personally thought the imagery was fantastic, most especially the opening act.<br/><br/>Depp, Bale and Cotillard were all great. So was the rest of the cast. Great balance between tragedy and humor. Go see this movie in theaters or you will regret it. It's quite simply the coolest movie of 2009."
"tedg","Null","16","26","13 July 2009"," Robbery
","One of the things we miss in our gangster movies is the sense of the time. We (Americans) came very, very close to a socialist state because of widespread frustration at the undeserving aristocracy. It had only been 15 years since a similar frustration in Russia exploded. In the depression, the rich got richer and everyone else suffered, some profoundly so. Robbing banks was simply a small payback and Dillinger was among several folk heroes.<br/><br/>The FBI then and to some extent now, were seen as thugs hired to protect the moneyed interests. They would be brutal, using intimidation, violence and extralegal means at will. The film captures little of this context, instead focuses on fine tailoring and reflections in perfectly polished getaway cars. I think Mann was constrained by the script and had only two ways of building a film. One was simply to apply style, which is done here well enough if in ordinary ways.<br/><br/>The other makes the experience worthwhile for me. For many filmmakers, it is not whether your film engages from beginning to end, because largely your audience is stuck. So long as you keep then busy, you can concentrate all your film-making in the end. Few films end competently anyway, so if you have your audience pleased as they walk out, you've won.<br/><br/>The last three scenes matter. They affected me.<br/><br/>The first has our hero sitting in a theater watching a gangster movie, pleased, using it to design and reinforce his own story. Previously, we had him and gang in a similar moviehouse where an on screen FBI spokesmen tells the audience that Dillinger and gang are likely in the audience. This was an very effective setup for this later scene. Depp, who has merely walked through the thing until this point, gives us a powerful internal dynamic.<br/><br/>The next scene is him leaving the theater and being killed. First he stares down a spineless FBI thug, who we had previous seen brutalize Dillingers girlfriend. Then, the killing. This one scene is cinematically perfect, I think. It will likely be something I will recall for a long time, everything effectively and unexpectedly choreographed — unexpectedly because all until then had been ordinary. The final scene is a sort of epilogue, the honorable FBI agent reporting to the now imprisoned girlfriend fictional words from the dying gangster that bore into her heart. <br/><br/>This also works. Quiet. Effective. Direct, with no apparent cinematic devices. It erases the flash we had seen only seconds before, carrying the emotion into something so human it hurts to even recall. And isn't that fine film-making?<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

Even ignoring the historical problems, the film is boring. Even the action sequences are not very exciting. Also, the simplistic view of the crooks are the real good guys and the FBI are all scum is so idiotic. Not every Fed was a complete stupid brute.

","Oh boy was I looking forward to this! I love gangster movies, I think Christian Bale is one of the best actors around, I think Johnny Depp is always decent, and I think Michael Mann is a great director. It seems a sure bet, a thing that could not go wrong.<br/><br/>Well. It did. Sort of. While ""Public Enemies"" is not a total disaster, it's not the new ""Heat"" that it should have been.<br/><br/>It seems that Micheal Mann has finally succumbed to the style over substance virus, turning Public Enemies into a movie that is almost entirely about atmosphere and fancy visuals. It worked in Collateral and Miami Vice, but this time Mann goes overboard and fails to provide a compelling narrative or characters to care about.<br/><br/>Instead, what we get is a fairly tiresome collection of one shoot-out and bank robbery after the other. A lot of people get shot, a lot of people die, but you very rarely have any idea who is being shot since none of the characters are introduced properly and they all look the same anyway. To make things worse, the editing is all over the place as well, with frequent jumps in time and space that are poorly explained, and whole sections of narrative apparently missing.<br/><br/>Depp and Bale are probably doing the best they can with what they are given, but they manage to be almost totally forgettable, a first for Depp and the second time for Bale (Terminator Salvation being the first). And Depp and Bale are the lucky ones, since the excellent supporting cast really has nothing of any interest to do, and the love story, which is given a prominent place in the marketing campaign, taking up a very minor part and being unconvincing to boot.<br/><br/>As much as I wanted to like this movie, I just couldn't. It's basically a collection of nicely choreographed and elaborate but very hard to follow gunfights after each other, with very little in terms of story or characters to tie them together.

"meeza","9","60","119","18 July 2009"," My public record shows that ""Public Enemies"" is a cinematic hit!
","John Dillinger was a gangster legend who was adored, loathed, chased, admired, and detested by many. There are mixed elements to how people judged John Dillinger, and that was one the most admirable & authentic qualities to Director Michael Mann's John Dillinger gangster flick ""Public Enemies"". Mann wisely does not evolve into the entire biography of the Dillinger tale; there is no childhood chronology and no catastrophic life scarring moment. It is basically about a man choosing a life of crime in order to live fast and play hard, subconsciously aware to the fact that is will be not be infinite. Mann starts the film with Dillinger already at his height of his gangster popularity orchestrating another one of his ""great escape from prison"" schemes. Then once again, Johnny D. and his bad boy entourage are robbing banks and living the retro thug life. Dillinger then checks out and romances the lovely checkout coat girl Billie Frechette. Apparently, Johnny's fresh ways were successful in luring Ms. Freshette. During that era of the 1930's crime hike, many Americans were rooting for these public enemies to rob banks in order to show their dislike of American banks for their mismanagement which eventually was the catastrophic factor which caused The Great Depression. Not to undermine the fact that many were against the dreadfulness that Dillinger and his men caused by their heinous crimes. J. Edgar Hoover was during that time trying to formalize his Bureau of Investigation into a national police force which later became known as the FBI. But Hoover had to find ways to vacuum the U.S. Government into this political formalization. Therefore, he exploited the capture of outlaws as a way to elevate his Bureau of Investigations. He then delegated the task of capturing Public Enemy Number 1, Dillinger himself, to top agent Melvin Purvis. The central plot line shootout of ""Public Enemies"" which Mann exhibits is the relentless pursuit of Purvis and Co. in capturing the charismatic Dillinger and his men. Johnny Depp was a real straight-shooter with his enigmatic but bulls-eye performance as Dillinger. Christian Bale's acting pursuit as one of the elite in the biz took another leap higher with his driven work here as Purvis. Marion Cotillard proved that she suffered no acting letdown, after her Best Actress Oscar, with her strong supportive work here as the Dillinger gal Billie. Speaking of Billies, Billy Crudup crudely transformed himself into J. Edgar Hoover with authentic prowess. Maybe I was hit too hard with Ronan Bennett's complex screenplay, but at times I was lost with ""Public Enemies"" verbose rounds. Nevertheless, it was Mann who captures his audience by Mannly displaying the Dillinger crime life and his ultimate demise in sheer entertainment fashion. ""Public Enemies"" might not be the #1 film in my ""most wanted"" 2009 film list at years end, but most probably will be gunned up as one of the best of the year. ***** Excellent"
"VinceRocca","1","39","74","5 July 2009"," This isn't a story, at best this is a reenactment.
","This is an unremarkable story and I have no idea why it was told. There's no clever sleuthing and no exciting robberies. Dillinger is killed at the end so it's not even how the underdog bad guy (who is really a good guy) gets away. At best this is a reenactment. Too many characters are introduced with no character development and they are all dressed the same making it impossible to keep track of who's who and who the good guys are .vs the bad. There isn't even any subplots to hold your interest. All I can figure is this wasn't good enough to be released around awards time, but the studio still needed to recoup so they sold it as an action shoot 'em up and went after the Independence popcorn crowd. However this movie won't have legs as an action flick, it'll have a 50% drop off in week two and probably disappear from the top 10 by week 3. Not even worth your time on video unless you are writing an essay on Dillenger or are a fan of confusing shaky unmotivated camera work."

","Alfred Hitchcock once said something along the lines of ""To make a great film you need three things- the script, the script and the script."" Public Enemies did not have ""the script""- or anything else worthy of merit. The writing was clumsy and shallow at best- god help the actors- and the story itself was full of anti- climactic climaxes received about every 20 minutes. The film was far too long (almost 2.5 hours) and when it came down to it, very boring. The best dramatic scene of the whole movie (and the only one which was remotely compelling for any reason) occurred when Billie (Dillenger's girlfriend) was beaten by the police and then rescued by Melvin Pervis. Even in this scene the scripted words sounded ""written"" and clumsy.<br/><br/>Someone please shoot the camera man! The entirety of the film was shot in a ""shaky"" documentary style making the film look unfinished and the viewer seasick and confused. This style is tolerable during action scenes (of which there were an overwhelming quantity) but during dialog it becomes distracting in the most negative way. <br/><br/>My friend drug me to see this movie( which I knew nothing about at the time) after raving about Michael Mann's ""Heat""- which I still have not seen, but if it's anything like this movie, I would rather have teeth pulled. At least the anesthesia is fun."
"walter_gilmore","1","23","41","23 July 2009"," ""Public Enemies"" is inappropriately shot, directed, and edited
","""Public Enemies"" explores the antics of the 1930's bank robber John Dillinger. Although set during the 1930's Mann chooses to shoot the film in primarily HD and with what appears to be mostly zoom lenses. The fishbowl like hyper-clean HD look and video like color timing of the film is inappropriate and off-putting. Furthermore the choice of the Wide-Angled Zoom lens (used mostly in documentaries) distorts the picture (look for ugly distorted hands in the foreground of the frame when Dillinger dances with his ""girl"" in the first act of the film) and seems student film like. The picture edit lacks a consistent timing and appears rushed and the sound editorial is full of silent holes for no main stream or art house reason that I can think of. It appears that HD, or the way Mann uses and color times HD in this particular film, was not the way to go for a 1930's gangster film. 35mm or perhaps even Super 16mm with some prime lenses may have worked out better for Mann's ""Public Enemies"". Fincher's DP in ""Benjamin Button"" was able to appropriately capture beautiful HD images for him but Mann's camera department seems, quite simply, ""off"", in this film. Why some critics call ""Public Enemies"" a work of art is befuddling to me. The direction of the film is poor as well and lacks a consistent style and a poor revelation of information. Mann's ""Heat"", ""Insider"" and ""Ali"" all were more beautifully shot, edited, and directed than ""Public Enemies"". Even the usually handsome Depp looks old and tired because of the nature of the optics and HD acquisition. Sitting in the theater I saw at least 10 people walk out after about 45 min. into the film and the rest appeared bored and confused. Too bad, I was looking forward to a good gangster movie."
"InvictaSemper","4","40","77","2 July 2009"," Some style or substance or anything
","If the motives of the depression era gangsters were indeed as murky as the lighting and editing of ""Public Enemies"" then there may have been a better story to be told. In reality, they were thrill-seeking predators who lived as long as time permitted. Michael Mann sees no need to limit the time it takes him to tell his stories, and he certainly has little care for his audience's time.<br/><br/>The film feels under lit, often out of focus, and scenes play with little sense of dramatic or cinematic structure. Characters become difficult to distinguish from each other and often it is hard to figure out really what is at stake other than the inevitable capture of Dillinger. The editing in the first half of the film is particularly gratuitous and confusing when coupled with the hand held camera work and dour, flat lighting; the viewer's eye can make no sense of the composition or relationship of shot to shot and is instead presented with a scramble of action.<br/><br/>There have been so many well told depression era gangster stories over the years, but ""Public Enemies"" will not rank among them, as in general, the amount of talent that is ultimately squandered in this film, from the cast, Director of Photography, and Editors, to the score and Sound Mixing, illustrates that Michael Mann is a man not unlike Dillinger in his own way: it is inevitable that he will continue to go on until someone stops him."

","Let me just start out by saying: This is a very, very good movie. If you're going to the movies this weekend, this is the one to see.<br/><br/>The performances are really the highlight. Depp is perfectly nuanced as Dillinger. It's his most mature role to date. I don't really understand the flack he's giving for playing him as ""empty"". Subtle would be a better word. He's playing someone who always lives in the moment, and has accepted that he won't be around for a while. I think he captured this perfectly. Marion Cotillard is also perfectly fragile as Billie, his love interest. It's Bale, however, who really steals the movie. His portrayal is absolutely brilliant. He plays Melvin Purvis as professional, intimidating, and broken. Anyone who has seen his work should realize that his accent is spot on. He's also very subtle in his expressions, and this is one of his best performances, right up there with ""Hard Times"" and ""American Psycho.""<br/><br/>The shoot out scenes are fantastic. I actually enjoyed the digital shooting much more than I thought I would. It really had voyeuristic feel that just can't be obtained with traditional 35mm. The visuals are across the board fantastic. The authentic places really stand out.<br/><br/>I think the ending will really split viewers. I, for one, loved it. The last line is killer, and left me with a good impression of the film.<br/><br/>Now the cons:<br/><br/>The story spends too many scenes on Dillinger and Billie. The love story ends up feeling a bit contrived. I understand that Mann was going for an old gangster movie type of love dialogue, but it just didn't fit in. The movie had too much to say, and it leaves some subplots completely open. It almost seems sloppy. It should have been 30 minutes longer, with more of a focus on Purvis and J. Edgar Hoover (absolutely brilliantly played by Billy Crudup).<br/><br/>Overall, go see this movie. This and Up are the best blockbusters of the summer so far."

It's actually boring, which is not what's expected of a gangster film. Without that attention to detail, it ends up simplistic but busy, a bad combination.<br/><br/>The director of photography also did LA Confidential, so it's difficult to blame him for the uninteresting look of the movie. There are two chase scenes which echo each other, one through an orchard during the day and one through the woods at night, which were done well. Most of the action scenes are just bullets spraying everywhere while people run around, with only rare attention paid to constructing a coherent sequence of events. The camera is far too jerky, far too often. Michael Mann is probably to blame for all of this, as the director.<br/><br/>Weak story, uninteresting flow, and visuals without enough punch add up to make this one a waste of time."

Except for the occasional brilliant moment, there was still a feeling that something was missing. Maybe it's to do with the fact that there was to little insight into the characters, or perhaps the slightly unoriginal shooting style.

"Hint523","5","33","66","3 July 2009"," Offers Nothing New
","Movies about cops and robbers are as old as movies themselves. We've seen hundreds of versions of bank robberies and yet somehow we're still drawn to the very nature of breaking the law. So in that sense, Public Enemies offers nothing new. It is as formulaic as movies get in this world of crime. Formulaic is not always bad – but movies require something new as well to keep me entertained.<br/><br/>Set in 1933 during the Depression, John Dillinger is Public Enemy #1 and we see him on many accounts robbing banks, escaping the seemingly useless lawmen, and murdering people who get in his way. Johnny Depp plays Dillinger the same way he plays Jack Sparrow (and many others) only without the make-up: he is an upbeat and likable bad guy. And in this one he somehow manages to be chewing gum throughout it all. He squares off against a countless number of ugly cops in suits, led by none other than Christian Bale. Bale doesn't add anything to the film. It is truly unfortunate that Mr. Bale hasn't really done much good lately; he seems to be dead weight in all of his recent films (Terminator Salvation comes to mind). In fact the last movie where I thought Bale was good was Rescue Dawn (2007). Billy Cudrup has a small role as J. Edgar Hoover, the head of this war on crime, but he doesn't do anything either, besides give us a good accent. And Marion Cotilliard, who recently won the Best Actress Oscar, has a very important role as Dillinger's girl. While she is good in scenes without Depp, she doesn't hold her own when she's with him. Giovanni Ribisi, David Wenham, Jason Clarke, and Stephen Graham (as Baby Face Nelson) round out this bloated cast. In terms of acting, this film isn't going to get any Oscar nominations.<br/><br/>Director Michael Mann is a master of crime movies. His movie Collateral is one of my all time favorites. Since Collateral, Mann has used Digital Video –the same thing I use, and not Film, to shoot all his movies, creating a look as if it is a movie made by a very good amateur. This was great in Collateral, adding some realism to the LA modern-day film, but does it work in a 1933 Crime movie? I think it's fine, but it doesn't add anything to it. And once more we see another director using the ""Paul Greengrass Effect"" – shooting the action sequences so close up and with hand-held cameras that we sometimes don't get what is going on. While I respect Mann for bringing something new to this period piece, I don't think it is justified, and I don't find it impressive.<br/><br/>There are two scenes that I really enjoyed – I loved the scene where Dillinger walks into the police department, and I loved the last scene of the film. Other than that, a large amount of the movie was predictable, too long, and most of all generic. The screenplay itself feels like it is stealing parts from other great ones – on a couple occasions I heard movie lines that were straight out of Bonnie and Clyde, which this film seems to rip off of in plot as well. Here's a movie with a dream cast and director, and yet still we get a mediocre picture. Public Enemies will not be remembered as one of the great heist films, and in fact, I don't think Public Enemies will really be remembered for anything at all. My Rating: 5/10"
"omfgitsrohit","6","4","5","24 November 2009"," THE average summer commercial -.-
","The director of Public Enemies had directed Heat and The Insider? Unbelievable. Oh wait, on second thought there were quite a few similarities between public enemies and heat. So perhaps, Michael Mann is an auteur? No. I don't think so. Similarities are merely- attractive costumes,guns and cars. Visually, the movie is inviting. But it stops with that. A few good shots do exist but the rest of them simply increase the rate at which your eyes blink. <br/><br/>A grand opening and a memorable ending indicates that the writer had only them in mind and just wrote bullshit in between to finish the script.<br/><br/>There're so many parts in the movie that are preposterous and unacceptable. John Dillinger walking into the police headquarters made me wanna ""ALT+F4"" but I decided to stay on considering that there were just a couple of minutes left to get done with it. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp and Christian Bale are both woody as wood. John Dilinger doesn't scare me one bit. Marion Cotillard actually does a little bit of observable acting. <br/><br/>A few things were left unexplained and had been poorly dealt with. The romance between John and Billie was built up poorly. I felt as though I had missed a prequel to the movie. What does John do with all the money he robs from similar looking banks? There is hardly any insight given into the character.<br/><br/>If there're any nominations it can possibly get in the coming awards season, it would be for the art direction. Yes, Michael Mann does triumphantly manage to simulate the prohibition era.<br/><br/>If your aim is to get entertained you might as well go ahead and watch it. It isn't the most entertaining movie but Well. If you're looking for some real art,please do me a favour and skip it."

But Mann's return with PUBLIC ENEMIES doesn't disappoint. When I got to meet him briefly at a screening, I knew I was in the presence of somebody's just downright awesome. You can tell from PUBLIC ENEMIES that he's brought back his signature marks, signs where you can easily tell it's a Mann's movie. He doesn't try to come up with CG backdrop to give us a sight of an old 1930s city, he puts the camera on a tight leash and just focus on the characters and the art deco buildings. And just like his other action/thriller movies in the past, it always ends in the evening or there'll be a massive showdown between two opposing parties in the middle of the dead night. Mann knows what the audiences would be rooting for in this type of movie, he makes sure that when Dillinger and his men make their getaway after a robbing a bank, they'd do it in style. Cinematographer Dante Spinottie who's worked with Mann before knows what the master filmmaker wants and what we get are shots that give that reality impression and definitely heavy emphasis on the well-choreographed violence. I enjoy how the movie likes to keep using Otis Taylor's catchy song 'Ten Million Slaves', somehow it fits perfectly in the presentation.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is the epitome of cool, he knows it and uses it to the fullest for this role. His character John Dillinger's got enough charm and confidence to spare but only has eyes for one lady. If you thought the way Jack Sparrow carried himself was infectious, wait til you see how Johnny Depp plays John Dillinger, he's a bad guy who loves being infamous. The unlikely Robin Hood in a time of Great Depression when people could care less about the banks he robs. Christian Bale who plays special Agent Melvin Purvis assigned to hunt down Dillinger, is as excellent as Depp. It's like having 2 heavyweight fighters in a ring and the match is long overdue. They both keep each other on their toes. Bale has been known as an actor who can listen well and mimic any accent. He puts down a great effort to sound like he wasn't born in Wales. Great star-studded cast overall, Michael Mann's lucky enough to have excellent actors signing up from left and right to play both members of the gang and members of the FBI including Billy Crudup who captures young Edgar Hoover's insecure, arrogant and stubborn personality down pat. Marion Cotillard gives a great supporting performance as the girlfriend who's willing to risk everything for a man she barely knows. She's not an easy woman for Dillinger to conquer.<br/><br/>What really will get you hooked, once again, is the cat and mouse game. Purvis catches Dillinger but Dillinger gets away, Purvis closing in on Dillinger but Dillinger is one step ahead of all of them. You see many different ways it's done throughout the entire movie and you'll get entertained every single time. Just when you thought the bad guy's captured and the good guy gets all the gory, the game begins again.<br/><br/>I'm glad Mann decided to take the story up a notch by not just making it about Dillinger Vs. Purvis, it's about what would happen when a man is pushed to the point of desperation. You never work with or never ever trust a desperate man, that's the theme that you see in the character development. Both Dillinger and Purvis are good at what they do, but then circumstances happen that would turn them into desperate men. Alienated by his business partners, Dillinger starts to lose what makes him hard to catch in the first place. Without realizing it he starts to create predictable patterns and habits that would eventually get him easily fooled, he becomes unaware of unwanted surprises . Pressured by Edgar Hoover, Melvin Purvis finds himself allowing certain methods to get Dillinger, the ends justify the means is the result. Some say that Michael Mann's endings rarely hit the level of satisfactory, I say PUBLIC ENEMIES' ending won't let you down, without being too extravagant, it concludes itself just the right way. <br/><br/>--Rama's SCREEN--"

","This is top Five worst movies i have ever seen! Terrible. there was no details, no going into stories about any of the characters. A person knowing nothing about the story would have no idea what is going on. The movie was two and a half hours of nothing. It could have ended seven times and you would still know the same thing you did before it kept dragging on. Could have made it a hour and a half and known the same amount. The camera work was terrible. There were two decent shooting parts but thats it. The big shoot out scene was really bad. 7 out of 10 people looked like the same character so you have no idea what is going on. They randomly bring in Baby Face and don't explain him at all. Why would he walk into a police station thats just dumb. Why did he drop his girl off when shes gets taken by the cops. Just waisted $10.50 and two and a half hours of my life a garbage."
"great_cinema","1","13","23","11 August 2009"," Definitely below par
","This movie just got released in my town and I was eager to see the movie which portrays the criminal acts of the famous 'John Dillinger'. Instead I felt like watching another documentary from Discovery. AND YES it felt like watching TV because the print shown in the cinema was indeed 35mm. The intention of using 35mm although was justified as the content came from an era when 35mm was gaining popularity but definitely did not justify using it to capture some of the histories most notorious criminal acts. This particular parameter resulted in very poor camera handling, which at times was below par when compared to an amateur. Also, the editor definitely proved that he simply does not like to edit any movie made in 35mm and he has made this fact very clear for the entire length of the movie. And the length of the movie made no difference in enriching the content given such methods of delivery.<br/><br/>This movie disappointed me on the script front as well. Being a big fan of bank robbing genre, this movie did very little to make anyone believe that robbing a bank would be as simple as shown here. The characters had very little to talk, I could even see the frustration on the faces of the actors who wanted to speak something but just simply could not because it is not in the script. The violent nature of John Dillinger was very poorly depicted in the movie. John was more often shown as the smart one and not the violent one, which I believe is opposite in real life. If you want to show a documentary, let the audience know about it from the beginning and not let them wondering/guessing what they have been watching for over two hours. Many a times throughout the movie, it seemed to have been made in a hurry, from which I infer that this movie was never suppose to have been made but was finally made just for the sake of making a movie on John Dillinger.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this movie had strong characters but the script simply did not capture them well enough to be worthy of a good review and hence such a review."

","Ever look forward to something only to find out that it blows in ways you never thought it could? Did the producers think that all they had to do was stick a tommy gun in Johnny Depp's hands and they'd have a gangster movie? Depp gives an adequate performance as Dillinger but it is a selfish and self enclosed one. Christian Bale is at his most insufferable playing Melvin Purvis as dour dolt. And everybody else, particularly Giovanni Ribisi and Billy Crudup, is simply hung out to dry. If you're interested in Dillinger then track down ""Dillinger "" with Warren Oates and Ben Johnson. If you want Depression era gangsters then it's ""Bonnie and Clyde"" or even ""Road to Perdition"".

","I should first say that Michael Mann is quite the master when it comes to shootouts. In Heat, he orchestrated what I consider to be one of the best gun battles ever filmed. And in Public Enemies, there's a pretty darn good one too, albeit, not as good as Heat's. Unfortunately, it was after the gun battle that Public Enemies went from being a great movie, to just a decent one. It's from that point on, that the slick cinematography, the good acting (which is mostly why I give the film a 7/10 instead of a 6/10), and the authentic look and feel seem to be great parts that, for some reason, don't add up to a great whole. I guess I'll blame it on the screenplay. The dialogue, at times, just doesn't seem believable after a while. I guess it was somewhere around the 1 hour and 45 minute mark that things started to drag a bit. It's then that Depp's Dillinger is, for all intents and purposes, on his own. It's then that there really doesn't seem to be a whole lot left to say. And it's from that point on that there were only glimpses of the brilliance that came before it. Indeed, I must admit that my mind wandered somewhat until the very end, where I was reeled back in for a pretty good, tense finish. Impressive, considering I knew what was to come. But also not enough. It was not enough to elevate this film back up into the ranks of some of the best gangster movies ever made."

There is no build up, no reason to care about any of the characters. Dillenger lives the high life for about five minutes, and then everything stars to fall apart, but, I had a hard time caring. Then they put Baby Face in the movie, but he has three lines, and when he is gunned down I could not care less. Don't get me started on Mr. Bail, that guy can't act, he could never act, and will never be able to act WHY IS HE FAMOUS???? The love story in the movie is the worst I have seen in years.

"TheFinalAlias","8","9","15","20 July 2009"," Extraordinary entertainment, but don't expect historical accuracy.
","If there's one thing I'm sick of, it's unwarranted hatred of the US. and it's art. But for once, I have to agree with the country's detractors overseas; for there is one accusation they often level at American cinema that is entirely true; and that is the American media's torrid, passionate, on & off love affair with Crime and the People who Commit It.<br/><br/>It's true. We turn our criminals into celebrities, and our lawmen likewise. The film I am now reviewing 'Public Enemies' is just one in a long line of films focusing on the lives of criminals, and I suspect, is going to be one of the most hotly debated in years to come.<br/><br/>A common accusation that is made against this film is that it glorifies crime; but surprisingly, that is only half-true. Yes, it is clear that the criminals are the 'heroes' of the story, and that our sympathies should lie with them. This is apparent in the very first scene; when the camera zeros in on prison inmates marching solemnly like men in a concentration camp, with very gestapo like guards standing around menacingly. It could easily be a scene from a Holocaust flick. The subsequent escape is certainly made out to be thrilling, heroic and to look ingenious in it's execution.<br/><br/>Yet, the film doesn't make the actual ROBBERIES of protagonist John Dillinger(Johnny Depp) out to be heroic, they are not stylized, and a scene where Dillinger threatens a clerk with ending up either a 'Live coward or a Dead hero' if he does not withdraw the money from a vault could just as easily be taken from a film where Dillinger was portrayed as the villain. So, to put it mildly, the film may glamorize criminals, but it does not do the same for their crimes. And thankfully, it doesn't make the police hunting Dillinger any more sympathetic. That approach is a sign that the film has one thing, guts: Criminals or Law Enforcers; the film emphasizes that both 'jobs' are a brutal and bloody business, this comes out best in a comparison between the ruthless George 'Baby Face' Nelson, and a brutal officer who beats Dillinger's woman.<br/><br/>As a film itself, the film makes up for it's historical inaccuracy(which still is enough to make me detract 2 stars since this is based off of real occurrences where real people died)by being easily the most entertaining film in years. Now I may have seen the film with only two men in the audience(One of them an apparent Bum who also shows up in my 'Delgo' review), but we all thoroughly, visibly enjoyed it. The film doesn't rely on any crap like sepia tones to make the film look 'old', and most of the performances are great. It goes without saying that Depp gives the best performance in the film, but I'd also like to point out that it's easily his best performance in years. Dillinger has to be the most likable criminal in a film I've seen since the days of Cagney.<br/><br/>The most controversial performance, however, is from Christian Bale as Melvin Purviss. For as much flack as Bale takes; he gives what could be the most meticulously crafted performance of his career when Purviss could have been a pale imitation of Bruce Wayne. He genuinely is so convincing that I did not see Bale in the role at all; I saw Purviss. His performance is the embodiment of brilliant understatement. He successfully imitates every aspect of Purviss from existing footage so well that Purviss's FAMILY has even praised him for the role(Which should be the final word on the performance, period.). His imitation of Purviss's faltering, stilted accent may not seem as entertaining as Depp's velvet voice, but it is a PERFORMANCE, no question. And the limited screen time he and Depp have together, is nothing short of electric. I mentioned how everyone in the theater made their enjoyment clear, but everyone was in dead silence during the brief confrontation. Such a pity they did not have more screen time. Those small scenes have me convinced that Depp is the only choice for playing the Joker in a future Batman film. The ability for a scene to have such power with such little dialog just demands it. And as with all great performances of lawmen who are the antagonists in a film with criminal heroes(Tommy Lee Jones in 'the Fugitive', Patrick Allen in 'Captain Clegg'), one would not mind seeing him as the protagonist in his own film.<br/><br/>All of the other actors range from good to decent, and are all convincing, and even if much of the dialog delivery is bad, it's delivered with force, which shows that at least everyone involved TRIED, and that's more than I can say for a lot of films these days.<br/><br/>So disregard the historical inaccuracy, bad reviews, and go and enjoy a highly entertaining, if flawed film. It's certainly the best crime epic in recent years.~"
"Benedict_Cumberbatch","Null","8","13","7 July 2009"," Michael Mann plays with the gangster genre and HD technology with mixed results
","""Public Enemies"", Michael Mann's account of John Dillinger's (Johnny Depp) crime wave and his romantic involvement with a young beauty (Marion Cotillard), has technical pros (the film vs. digital video controversy is a matter of personal taste, in my opinion, but that deserves to be discussed), but lacks character development.<br/><br/>Shot in HD (high definition video), with some interesting hand-held camera movements and unorthodox angles, the movie shows how HD video has developed. Take a look at last year's magnificent ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"", one of the most visually stunning films I've ever seen, which was shot on video as well. Sometimes, it's hard to tell the difference. Some people argue that video should only be employed for independent, low budget films, and its use in big budget productions like this just for the sake of stylization is unwelcome. Naturally, the cameras and general equipment used in a production like ""Public Enemies"" are much more advanced than the ones used in, say, ""Frozen River"". However, lots of people think the video look doesn't fit a gangster flick. Film has that special look that video doesn't have, and film still produces the most beautiful images you can see on a big screen. Digital, however, has a special texture to itself as well, and whether it works for this or that genre is just a matter of personal taste. I wasn't turned off by the use of HD in ""Public Enemies"" and actually think it gave the movie an interesting, unusual look – you could see the pores, wrinkles on Depp's and Christian Bale's faces like never before.<br/><br/>My main problem with the film is the lack of character development and, why not say, soul to the whole package (So let me end the technical discussion here). By character development, I don't necessarily mean to give a longer background story to the main characters; however, the relationship between Dillinger and his girlfriend seems cold and contrived. Depp is charismatic, and Cotillard, who delivered one of my favourite screen performances of all time in ""La Vie en Rose"" (and earned an Oscar for it), isn't bad, but is not given much to do (and unlike the likes of a Juliette Binoche, she doesn't sound very convincing in English yet; she seems much more comfortable in her own language, which doesn't mean I'm bashing her efforts because I believe she will have a wonderful international career, and I'm looking forward to seeing her with Daniel Day-Lewis in the musical ""Nine"" later this year). They lack chemistry, and while the movie spends more time on Dillinger's escapades from the law, it never finds a balance with the ""love story""; and long, choreographed killings get old after a while – especially when you don't care that much for any of the characters. The movie lacks tension and believability on both sides. It doesn't always work as a gangster film, and the love story at the core doesn't ring true.<br/><br/>I think it was Billy Wilder who once said ""Nobody is gonna remember after a movie: what a great shot! What about the story?"" Unfortunately, nowadays, Hollywood movies (and some supposedly artsy indie films, too) rely way too much on unusual camera angles and forget about telling a story. And these experiments and ""cool shots"" turn out to be the only things people remember as specific to such movies. Being experimental is fine, but sometimes when you try too hard you lose every and any focus. Mann succeeded with his digital experiments in the great ""Collateral"" (2004), failed miserably with the dreadful ""Miami Vice"" (2006), and had mixed results with this ""Public Enemies"". This is NO ""Bonnie and Clyde"", and as cool as Mann's camera angles and visual approach can be, they're not half as groundbreaking as Dede Allen's daring editing job in Arthur Penn's masterpiece (back in 1967, and still as compelling over four decades later).<br/><br/>The way it is, ""Public Enemies"" has good moments and technical achievements, but seems more like a curious exercise in style than a really good movie.<br/><br/>6.5/10."

","This film is about a criminal mastermind who is elusive to the American authorities back in 1930's.<br/><br/>I cannot believe how boring ""Public Enemy"" is. I already felt thoroughly bored after twenty minutes, and after one more hour it does not get better at all. There are many problems with the movie. Slow pacing is the obvious problem, as the filmmakers spend too much effort trying to make the film atmospheric. They have simply forgotten that as an crime thriller, we need more action to engage viewers. Instead, most of the film is just talking and talking. When it does show an occasional gun fight, it is unbelievably detached with no intensity or thrill. It is as if the gun shots are played on tape, and are not from the supposed fights. Another problem is that 90% of the scenes are far too dark. It is not fun to look at silhouettes or shadows continuously. When we do get to see faces, most of the time their eyes are hidden under the shadow of their hat. Without this eye contact, I feel disengaged and disconnected from all the characters.<br/><br/>""Public Enemies"" is a very boring movie for me. I struggled so hard to keep my eyes open, and I have to say I lost the fight."
"ditka_fan","1","13","24","20 July 2009"," Lowest Common Denominator
","This film is terrible from start to finish and I am convinced that Ebert is being paid by the studios to give good ratings to the trash that is being spewed from Hollywood. This film is a prime example of what Hollywood has been doing for the past decade or so. Assign a hack of a director (Michael Mann), hire A-list actors (Bale & Depp), half-ass a story, offer little to no editing and expect the masses to accept this crap as a masterpiece! People need to wake up and realize that if they support this nonsense Hollywood will continue to make this trash. This is the lowest common denominator that has infiltrated our films, TV shows and music. People stop thinking for themselves expecting someone else to think for them and tell them what is good and what is not.<br/><br/>Still not convinced? Well let's see if I can help a little more since a lot of people on this site apparently liked this film, which is very sad really. OK, let's start with the script. There was not a single actor in this film that could deliver these lines in a believable way. It was as if the actors already knew that this movie wasn't working and they were there for a pay check. Editing, pretty sure if I had edited this movie I would want my name removed from the credits. This movie should have been 90 minutes long, not a minute longer. So many scenes should have been cut out completely or shorted by at least half. This leads me into the terribly underdeveloped plot. How many actors in this film looked, talked and acted in exactly the same way? I was confused by all of them b/c not a single one of them were developed in the story in anyway other than Depp, Bale and Cotillard. And if you were wondering why there were so many overly drawn out dramatic close-ups, its b/c there wasn't enough of a story written and Michael Mann can NOT make a movie less than 2 1/2 hours! It's like he wants to be Scorsese, but he just doesn't have the talent to be him.<br/><br/>The time has come to stop accepting this crap as filet mignon and calling it what it is, crap. Start thinking for yourselves and have a higher expectation for films, otherwise we'll only have Bruno to go see!"
"SquirePM","1","12","22","5 July 2009"," The modern, unwatchable, movie...
","What a shame. Of all directors, Michael Mann, who has proved that he can make good films again and again, goes off the deep end. Maybe he feels he's getting old and wanted to prove he can use the hippest, grooviest new style just like the young people do.<br/><br/>Whatever his reasons, he has rendered an unwatchable movie, coalescing all the worst techniques into one long aggravating disaster. Shaky-cam, jerky-cam, bumpy-cam, jitter- cam. Long, lingering ultra-closeups obscuring high tension action sequences. Disgustingly self-indulgent directing in which Mann as much as says, yeah, there's a lot going on back there but I'm not showing it to you. I'm showing this part of a guy's face, and that's all you get to see.<br/><br/>The movie hardly tells any story at all. There are long, elaborate sequences of events that NEVER HAPPENED IN DILLINGER'S LIFE. Important characters in Dillinger's life go unnamed in the movie, events are shown and not explained so today's audience misses their significance. And so little story is told, that it's as if Mann thinks he's made a film for a new generation audience who don't care to know anything about the people and events, all they want is the barest thread leading from action sequence to action sequence.<br/><br/>And maybe he's right. This may be the wave of the future, unwatchable movies that don't tell a story about famous names from our past, names everybody recognizes but nobody remembers much about, so writers can be free to make up anything at all and not be tied down to actual events. Wonderful.<br/><br/>I spent about a third of this abomination with my eyes actually closed, trying to avoid a headache. Most of the rest was marginally viewable and deadly dull. I actually reviewed all the teams in the NFL for a while trying to think of the answer to a TV game show question, ""Name two of the 5 NFL teams named for birds."" The contestant got the Cardinals and the Eagles so the show didn't show the other 3. I got the Falcons and Seahawks right away, but not number 5. Two days later, during this movie, I took the time to review all the teams geographically starting in New England and going counterclockwise through the northern states, down the west coast, across to Florida and finally up the east coast to the Baltimore Ravens. That's almost the whole NFL, and it provided a nice vacation from the dreck on the screen."

","When contemporary songstress Diana Krall sings ""Bye Bye Blackbird"" -- as Johnny Dillinger (Johnny Depp) and Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard) have their first dance -- it becomes the theme song for Public Enemies. It's a bolt from the blues.<br/><br/>Michael Mann's brilliant and deceptive new film is full of such themes lurking in its shadows. That's what makes it provocative, challenging, and rewarding.<br/><br/>Mann takes a well-recognized historical figure in a well-known time in a well-worn genre and gives them revitalized life. But one has to be alert to see beyond the past.<br/><br/>Mann is sly, inventive, and sometimes subtle amidst the familiar goings-on. He remints the fabled career of John Dillinger in the 1930s.<br/><br/>One expects Mann to make some pungent social criticism in his mise en scene and plot machinations. And he does, with panache.<br/><br/>One especially provocative sequence in Public Enemies is a torture scene in which the brutality only gains misinformation. It is a compelling mirror of today's interrogation techniques.<br/><br/>Mann also introduces the concept of burgeoning surveillance which is a telling harbinger of what is to come.<br/><br/>But Mann doesn't state the obvious; he lets the actions speak louder than words. Mann lets history -- and its meaning -- speak for itself.<br/><br/>A revelatory example is the infamous ""lady in red,"" whom many people know as the woman who betrayed and who was with Dillinger at the Biograph theater in Chicago.<br/><br/>In actuality the woman was not in red. In Mann's movie, as in actuality, she wore an orange skirt, which some people mistook as red. And so the legend. Mann doesn't explain that he's bringing actuality to myth. It's there for us to discover.<br/><br/>John Dillinger as portrayed by Mann and Johnny Depp (another JD) is a glamorized figure, who seems nearly flawless His fundamental attribute is loyalty. He is charming, cool, and smart. He's Robin Hoodlum.<br/><br/>Besides Depp, another fortuitous casting is Marion Cotillard as Billie Frechette, the coat check girl who becomes the soul mate of Dillinger. Cotillard won an Oscar as another bird -- Edith Piaf in La Vie en Rose (2007).<br/><br/>Public Enemies is very much a romance.<br/><br/>Christian Bale gives humanity to the stolid but earnest agent Melvin Purvis, whom J. Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup) picks to head his special force to catch Dillinger. Hoover is in the process of developing the FBI and names Dillinger as the first Public Enemy #1.<br/><br/>Stephen Lang is memorable as the Texas lawman who assists Purvis. He adds substance to the luminous, fictional denouement.<br/><br/>Mann and writers Ronan Bennett and Ann Biderman have created a canny script. Public Enemies may remind one of the scope and vision of Altman's Thieves Like Us (1974).<br/><br/>Mann has created an evocative, beautiful movie in Public Enemies. Cinematographer Dante Spinotti -- in their fifth collaboration -- creates breathtaking tableaux from a palette with strokes of mesmerizing light.<br/><br/>Mann employs scenes and shots that remind us of Hitchcock. There's suspense at a stoplight. There's a shot in a movie theater that reminds us of the tennis match in Strangers on a Train (1951).<br/><br/>Mann also uses techniques that may remind us of graphic novels -- flashes of light from tommy guns. There's a surrealistic night scene in the woods around Little Bohemia lodge in Wisconsin.<br/><br/>But perhaps the most effective use of past movies is the sequence in the Biograph theater before Dillinger meets his fate. Mann uses clips from Manhattan Melodrama (1934) starring Clark Gable as Blackie (more fortuity), which actually was playing at the Biograph.<br/><br/>One of the fundamental themes in Mann's work is about men who hold to their personal codes against society and institutions. It's in all Mann's movies -- Thief (1981), The Insider (1999).<br/><br/>Blackie in Manhattan Melodrama has a code; he refuses the governor's (William Powell) offer of commutation and accepts death. In Manhattan Melodrama he says, ""If I can't live the way I want, at least let me die when I want."" Blackie is true to his principles and character -- like Mann's Dillinger.<br/><br/>Dillinger watches the movie and obviously relates to what is on screen. Talk about irony.<br/><br/>Movies make strange bedfellows -- Gable and Dillinger. Life is image.<br/><br/>Mann espouses individuality, but realizes it comes with a heavy price. The individual always winds up the target of the group Business wins out.<br/><br/>In Public Enemies Mann has several shots of the group. One of his early shots is of prisoners trudging in a line in a gray-walled prison.<br/><br/>Another is a group of pasty-faced feds.<br/><br/>Another is a roomful of men sitting before phones taking bets. Dillinger's exploits threaten the crime mob because they bring attention to them. One mobster tells Dillinger he is ""bad for business."" The group is out to destroy the outsider.<br/><br/>Mann's Dillinger is a descendant of the cowboy. He sings, ""Get along little doggies."" He lies in bed beneath a picture of a man riding a bucking bronco.<br/><br/>Clocks and watches punctuate Public Enemies. Time is running out.<br/><br/>But what a countdown! Public Enemies is a delicious feast for an interpretive viewer.<br/><br/>Blackbird under glass. A rare treat.<br/><br/>Tony Macklin<br/><br/>http://tonymacklin.net/"

The acting is largely flawless, but the cast is let down by a script that delivers shockingly bad lines at times. The cinematography sits in an uncomfortable space between traditional movie and docu-drama with disjointed use of traditional film flow and handy-cam scenes. The soundtrack went largely unnoticed. Filming in digital video for such a complex movie was also a mistake as it killed the atmosphere of some critical scenes.<br/><br/>You never really get absorbed into the movie because at every step you are working hard to fall in step with it, but its stochastic storytelling and distracting mistakes/errors of judgment leave a plethora of questions and a headache.<br/><br/>Overall watching the movie was a very frustrating experience. As I followed it I willed the movie to pull through and succeed, instead it flatfootedly dragged me through it for over two hours.<br/><br/>My three stars are for the obvious effort the cast and crew put into it, not for the final product.

","""Public Enemies"" is like one of its anti-hero's robberies. It's dazzling, occasionally stylish, violent and straight to the point. The characters zip in and out leaving mayhem in their wake, and you can barely tell them apart. You don't get to know them, and you don't know if you should feel blessed for that, or not.<br/><br/>The movie is star studded. Perhaps the two greatest chameleons currently in movies, Johnny Depp and Christian Bale, both appear, on opposite sides of the law. There's also Billy Crudup, Marion Cotillard, Giovanni Ribisi, and a brilliantly cast Stephen Graham... who is unfortunately underused.<br/><br/>Quite a lot happens in the movie but you don't feel invested in it. I've seen it twice now, and not one sequence sticks in my mind. Michael Mann made the risky decision to go with the gritty, hand-held camera approach to the movie, which seems incongruous with the trappings of a historical movie. The steadicam thing makes you think what you're seeing is really happening. It can't do that when everyone is dressed like the 1930's, and driving vintage cars.<br/><br/>This isn't the first time Mann has fallen on the sword of style: remember the weird, ponderous approach to ""Ali""? This isn't as much a failure as that; it's still fairly enjoyable. It's just forgettable."

","Public Enemies is a crime drama based on the true story of the infamous bank robber of the 1930's, John Dillinger. Johnny Depp does an outstanding job playing the main character, but I don't feel that this is his best performance. Perhaps it is a lacking script that causes the unimpressive characterization. Christian Bale plays the FBI agent chasing Dillinger with fervor. His betrayal seems a bit dry and lackluster. The story is interesting and well paced, but there is slightly too much time put into the setup and not enough in the execution of the plot. The action sequences are quick and the machine gun shoot-outs are mind blowing. Overall, I left the theater feeling that this was a decent film with room for improvement. It is worth a watch, especially if you like the period portrayed. I give this movie 7 stars for a just-above mediocre production. I hope this review was helpful. -MovieJuice"
"Jona1988","6","2","2","12 December 2016"," What should have been thrilling is boring
","Michael Mann has made some really great movies. Heat and Collateral are amazing. But he has made some weaker ones as well. Unfortunately Public Enemies belongs to his weaker. I had high hopes for this when it was upcoming. The poster of Johnny Depp clad in a trench coat and fedora hat and holding a Tommy Gun looked so cool. I imagined this as being like Heat but set in the 1930s. In several ways the setup is kind of similar. Johnny Depp and Christian Bale two actors at top of their game felt perfect as the leads. The criminal vs. detective thriller with both being the main character. Unfortunately it fails in all the things that Heat did so brilliantly. I've seen Public Enemies again after my first disappointed reaction but even when I tried to ignore my expectations on the director being Michael Mann and not to compare it to Heat Public Enemies is still a dull movie. The movie looks stunning I feel they have totally succeeded in recreating the 1930s Depression-era USA. But while the outside looks great it is on the inside that it is lacking. The story that is based on reality is actually a good one but the movie somehow still makes it feel uninteresting and completely devoid of any real substance . A major problem for the story is that we never feel anything for the characters. The actors do well overall but the writing is the problem also here. Johnny Depp fits well as John Dillinger. He looks the part and I can't say anything bad about his acting. It's just that his character lacks any real personality. I feel it's not really clear how the viewer should relate to Dillinger should we root for or against him. And this can be said about all characters in the movie there is no substance or development for any of them. I could not care less relation between Dillinger and Marion Cotillard's character. Christian Bale does well with what he's got but his character is less the focus of the story than Depp's. However I do feel that his attempts at an accent is very inconsistent. Unfortunate is that the action is just as bland as the rest of the movie. Michael Mann can or could direct tense edge of your seat action scenes. But the gun fights here are short and stale. It's just men shooting at each other but there is nothing creative about the action scenes. I'm not expecting these massive action set pieces and I know it's based on true events which seldom are as exciting as we like to see on screen. That doesn't matter. I think of Mann's Collateral which no is not based on reality but my point is that a skilled director can create thrill and suspense without that much spectacular action happening. Public Enemies is a well made movie only technically but lacking creatively. What should have been thrilling is boring. Actors struggling due to lack of characterisation. In the end this is not really a bad movie but it's not good either. Disappointing and forgettable I am sad to conclude."
"CinemaClown","Null","2","2","15 October 2013"," Watch It Only For Johnny Depp
","A missed opportunity of sorts, Public Enemies begins strongly but it slows down in the middle and then is never able to catch up or reignite the level of interest that was present earlier in the movie. Made at the time when Johnny Depp was still one of Hollywood's finest & most bankable stars, it's a well-conceived project that was poorly executed in the end.<br/><br/>Set during the Great Depression, the story of Public Enemies chronicles the last years of notorious bank robber John Dillinger & his associates, who flourished during a booming crime wave in 1930s Chicago. The plot covers their numerous heists while also focusing on Dillinger's own personal life as they are being pursued by an agent of FBI, which was still in its early years.<br/><br/>Co-written & directed by Michael Mann (best known for Heat), Public Enemies recreates the early 1930 era in fine detail and employs the right props & setting to add more authenticity to its overall surroundings. The film opens on an impressive note but the process of juggling different subplots needed a bit more refinement in the script to provide a more compact structure to the narrative.<br/><br/>Technical aspects are always on the plus side in a Michael Mann film and Public Enemies isn't any different. There is an incredible amount of detail in every image, which look very crisp by the way, but the pacing issues really hurt it down the line, and improper editing, which allows few moments to run longer than necessary, doesn't help either. The background score works fine but it sure isn't memorable.<br/><br/>Coming to the acting department, Public Enemies features a marvellous ensemble in Johnny Depp, Christian Bale, Marion Cotillard, Billy Crudup, Stephen Lang & others, with Depp stealing the show. Outshining everyone with his compelling input & charismatic screen presence, Depp decimates all as John Dillinger and is nicely supported by Cotillard, Crudup & Lang while Bale contributes with a surprisingly wooden performance.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Public Enemies has flashes of brilliance but they are few & far in between. Its 140 minutes runtime feels longer than it should, and it falls pretty short of expectations when it's all over. Capturing its era in a detailed fashion, helmed by an esteemed auteur, and blessed with a stellar cast, it really is a shame because Public Enemies had the ingredients to finish as one of the better crime dramas but instead, it ends up being a forgettable example of its genre. Watch it only for Johnny Depp's outstanding showcase."
"Leofwine_draca","6","2","2","10 September 2013"," Fun but flawed
","I liked PUBLIC ENEMIES but I didn't love it. It comes close to feeling like an epic at times, detailing the cat-and-mouse games between infamous bank robber John Dillinger and the G-man on his tail. Unfortunately the screenplay feels a little bloated at times and the truth is that while Michael Mann is a consummate professional as director, his films always possess a certain coldness that makes it hard to get close to the characters.<br/><br/>And that's the case here. Superficially, the movie looks good and the characters go through the motions with aplomb, but you never really care about what happens to them. Bale's protagonist is totally unmemorable, leaving Depp to hold the fort as the anti-hero of the piece, but whenever the film moves away from a complex action set-piece it falters. Depp's romance with Marion Cotillard is particularly gruelling and heel-dragging.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the drama and excitement when it comes is very well handled, with the shoot-out in the woods particularly fine and the bank robberies all staged very well. As ever, Mann has a steely eye for the action so the film zips along when concentrating on them; it's everything else that's a bit lacklustre. In addition, the cast is so big that the supporting players, like Stephen Dorff, James Russo, Billy Crudup, David Wenham and Stephen Lang get lost in the mass, each lacking truly memorable scenes. The ending, when it comes, seems almost arbitrary."

","Public Enemies was a movie I had high hopes for, considering it starred two of my favorites, in Johnny Depp and Christian Bale. The biggest problem Public Enemies has, is it's pacing and incorrect factuality. It showed stuff that John Dillinger didn't even do, and padded it with pretty pointless stuff. The reason I couldn't finish this movie though, was due to the pure boredom I went through. I'm not one of those Movie buffs, who Crave constant action, but I do like the movie to be interesting, and this just didn't cut it for me.

Johnny Depp is very good from what I saw. He has the charisma and the desire, to play Dillinger, but he's stuck with a terrible film in my opinion. Christian Bale is disappointingly wooden. He looks uncomfortable, and I didn't blame him. Channing Tatum shows up long enough to get a check.<br/><br/>Bottom line. An hour of this mess was enough for me.

"raphmetz","6","2","2","20 July 2009"," unofficial REVIEW complete analysis
","PLOT:<br/><br/>John Dillinger was a famous American bank robber of the 1930s whose crime spree made front page news at the time. The film focuses on the year 1933, when between two robberies Dillinger (Depp) falls for Billie Frechette (Cotillard), while FBI agent Melvin Purvis (Bale) has been dispatched to stop the brilliant criminal.<br/><br/>REVIEW:<br/><br/>Even with its real-life-story aspect, this all sounds like your average crime movie, but there is more to it than that. What sets this film apart from its predecessors in the crime/gangster genre (defined by The Godfather, Goodfellas, The Departed) is its feeling of immersion into what is in the frame of the camera. Mann and his cinematographer Dante Spinotti decided to shoot on a high resolution format which gives the picture unprecedented neatness and clarity, and the shaky documentary style recalls Paul Greengrass' The Bourne Ultimatum or United 93, with the movements of the camera giving real urgency and raw adrenaline to the action. Such cinematography is quite revolutionary for the genre, and even if the shaky camera effects are sometimes too much to handle, director Michael Mann succeeds in using this technique to produce a movie that feels very real. Add to that the loud guns, the stylish cars and the authentic period set pieces, and you can feel like you're in the thirties.<br/><br/>It is Johnny Depp's effortless but powerful performance that carries the film. The actor may be most famous for his interpretation of crazy captain Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean, but he proves that he is definitely up there ranked as one of the most charismatic actors of this decade. Public Enemies is a crime movie, and it has its share of gun fights, but it doesn't fall into the dumb-entertainment-blockbuster category. It has an unexpected emotional core in the relationship between Dillinger and French girl Billie Frechette, beautifully interpreted by Marion Cotillard (Oscar winner 2008 for best actress in La Mome). The chemistry between her and Depp makes the viewer care about their doomed romance, in a way that elevates the film to an emotional level.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Public Enemies somehow disappoints by its lack of character development. The story line is nicely classical and there are some good scenes (best of all when Dillinger wanders in the police department), but the screenplay is rather weak. The focus of the film is not all on Dillinger's side of things, it is often diverted to top FBI agent Melvin Purvis (played with typical style by Christian Bale), who has been sent out to stop the criminal by any means. The structure of the film apparently aims at a two-way movement in the same style as Heat, where we follow both the gangster and the cop's stories, but ultimately it does not achieve this. We never get to know Purvis or anybody else, and sadly Dillinger turns out a bit shallow. It would not be fair to say that Depp's character doesn't have enough screen time, but by the end of the film we are left wondering who John Dillinger really was, behind the public figure we follow throughout the film.<br/><br/>VERDICT:<br/><br/>It's a slightly superficial effort, but Michael Mann has tried to show us a new way of filming gangsters. Once you get passed the typical crime movie tag, Public Enemies makes for some stylish entertainment, with a pure charismatic turn by Johnny Depp."
"Irie212","7","2","2","16 July 2009"," What exactly would a ""spoiler"" be for this film?
","Okay, I clicked the ""spoiler"" box because I don't want to be blacklisted, but honestly, if you don't know the fate of John Dillinger, you should be reading, not watching movies. <br/><br/>There. That's off my chest. <br/><br/>Now then, in spite of its predictability, Public Enemies has worthy performances from a strong cast. Depp, Cotillard, Crudup, and Steven Lang are standouts, but the cast is big-- new cops and gangsters seem to crop up in ever sequence. The screenplay is well-crafted, and notably fine art direction is sensitively set in the original Midwestern (Wisconsin and Illinois) locations. The only real disappointment is the music. (News flash: Billie Holiday was not the only jazz singer in the 1930s; in fact, she didn't even start recording until a year before Dillinger was killed, so three songs by her is a bit much. Why not Bessie Smith, Ethel Waters, Ma Rainey?). <br/><br/>The fact that it's impossible to issue a spoiler for a movie about Dillinger becomes one of the fundamental problems with a gangster movie like this-- unlike, say, The Godfather, which was fictional. It's very difficult to deliver suspense. For the most part, we get action instead-- chase scenes, shoot-outs-- because the question is never, What will happen?, but How will they show it? Michael Mann does succeed in keeping the story moving, and the visuals very engaging, even though the plot is a series of bank robberies, jail escapes, gun battles, and of course a little sex."

"Cinemadharma","4","13","25","11 July 2009"," Technically poor. Creatively worse.
","I carried knowledge of the real story into the theater. Therefore, I feel that because I was well versed in the story of Dillinger I really felt what was missing.<br/><br/>What was missing? The mood of the country: It was the Great Depression and people were poor and out of work - they looked at the banks (wall street) and the govt as the real 'public enemies'. Thus the elevation of fame: John Dillinger came along and stole from the banks, but refused to steal from ordinary hard working people. He did this while constantly humiliating the burgeoning FBI, thus the Govt. He was seen as a modern Robin Hood. A hero. He was media savvy and knew what to do to bolster his image. He became more famous than any movie star or other public figure of his day. None of this was really in the film. It was only alluded to. Character development/motivation: Who was Dillinger and why was he a bank robber? We don't know. What drove him? Never even hinted at. How did he change/grow/fall from the beginning of the film to the end? He didn't. Who was Purvis and what drives his sense of justice and the law? Don't know. Why is Dillinger so important to him, in particular? Never addressed. How did he change/grow/fall from the beginning to the end of the film? He didn't. It ended exactly as it began for him. What is the counterpoint between these two characters? Not played upon. Melvin Purvis much later eventually killed himself, as is stated in the end tag... but nothing we've seen in the film has shown us even the slightest bit of what character flaw or events might lead to this.<br/><br/>In addition, the technical flaws in this film were far too many to overlook. <br/><br/>Sound: The sound flaws were UNFORGIVABLE. Many times throughout the film, the three of us watching the movie turned to each other to ask what the actor on screen just said. We thought the theatre was shitty or something, until it became obvious that it was the design or lack-there-of. Director Michael Mann made one of the biggest mistakes I ALWAYS see amateur filmmakers get reamed for at film festivals, which is underestimating the power and IMPORTANCE of SOUND. It is 50% of the film experience and he treated it like it didn't matter in the slightest.<br/><br/>Lighting: There is no consistency between shots even WITHIN THE SAME SCENE. The color palette of the film is all over the place (and changes from scene to scene and even within the same scene). And there never seems to be a reason for it - no storytelling reason at least. I would understand warm tones to tell a certain tale or cool for the same - but it would be warm to cool for no reason whatsoever. Night shots looked like giant spot lights through the trees. In fact, there are at least three shots where you actually SEE the giant spot lights, dead on. They didn't try to diffuse the lights at all or hide the fact that they were there. It was just giant harsh flood lights raining unnatural super-bright light on the scene. I am aware this is how most films shoot at night - but most of the time they are disguised and diffused enough to at least PASS for FULL MOON light. But these were coming in at the wrong (90 degree) angle to-boot! And the exterior night shots right in front of the cabin, where you might it expect it to be slightly brighter, were appropriately dark (well lit), and only seconds later when deep in the woods, it is bright as daylight - from a source you can actually see just behind a tree. Ridiculous.<br/><br/>In summary, I learned what I know of the Dillinger/Purvis story by watching a 2 hr History channel documentary reenactment of this story, which was far more engaging & technically competent than this film."
"maxblinkwednesday","3","18","37","1 July 2009"," an honest review of Public Enemies
","Public Enemies is a good idea in theory, especially with the phenomenal Johnny Depp as John Dillinger. John Dillinger was a legendary bank robber in the 30s. He was a symbol of hope to society in a time when the government was unjust and greedy. He was known for his many bank heists along with his many romantic conquests. This movie does not show that at all. Public Enemies is far longer than it needs to be and it just drags on and on. The only thing keeping me from walking out was Johnny Depp's fantastic performance. Christian Bale is an amazing actor and he could have been in this movie too, if he didn't keep switching from about 5 different accents. Which was extremely distracting and annoying. The camera work and directing is disgraceful and headache inducing. It was obvious that Michael Mann (the director) was going for a realistic, almost documentary-like movie. All it did was make things confusing and frustrating. It was extremely hard to tell what was going on throughout the entire movie (and this is a long movie) and most of the movie was spent wondering what the heck is going on. Then there was the ""romance."" It didn't seem believable and just dragged on while seeming utterly pointless. I have no idea why Hollywood seems to think that it MUST have a romance as part of the main plot. Dillinger and Frechette's romance was greatly dramatized in the movie. If this entire romance had been thrown out the movie would be much shorter and there could have been room for an actual plot and some action. I mean, seriously, only 3 bank heists, seriously?<br/><br/>There are so many things wrong with this movie's plot. First off, nothing is explained. Ever. Why does John Dillinger rob banks? Why were the people on the streets cheering him on? Who are pretty-boy Floyd and baby-face nelson? The writers of a movie cannot just assume the audience knows the movie's background. Second off, they really needed to mention the other things going on in this time. Like, you know a little thing called the Great Depression and the other Public Enemies, such as Bonnie and Clyde. Third, why the hell was this rated R? The reason given is ""gangster violence and some language."" For what was in this movie, it could easily have been rated PG-13. Fourth, Why was Billy Crudup's accent so ridiculous and yet no one else's was? All of the accents in this movie were ridiculous, except that of Johnny Depp. Billy Crudup really should have had more screen time and maybe the movie would have made some sense. Marion Cotillard's screen time needed to be cut in half, at the least. Another irksome thing about this movie was that it didn't show a single one of Dillinger's jackrabbit-like moves he was famous for. Public Enemies also did not show John Dillinger in a positive light. He was known as a sort of Robin Hood and that was not apparent in this movie.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp's acting is the only redeemable part of this movie and the only reason I did not walk out, but this is not enough to see a movie. Do not see this movie, unless you enjoy having your brain raped."

","Public Enemies {dir. Michael Mann, 2009} <br/><br/>***/****<br/><br/>In telling the story of John Dillinger, it would seem that director Michael Mann had found the perfect fit for his personal aesthetic. Dillinger was a man of copious charm, and a taste for fine clothes,yet he was suitably cold blooded and violent when the situation called for it. Mann as a director who has always explored the lives of violent men, from Thief to Collateral, and his films have always looked impeccable However,in the end his new film Public Enemies is not the film it could have been. It ends up a middling Mann film, lacking the urgency of The Insider and the power of Heat (Mann's two best films.) <br/><br/>The picture opens auspiciously in 1933, with a thrilling jailbreak by Dillinger, who is introduced in glorious close up, and Johnny Depp playing Dillinger holds that shot like few other actors working. Mann utilizes the closeup to great effect throughout the movie. He and cinematographer Dante Spinotti make great use of the HD technology at their disposal, and they have much of the film resting on the power supplied by those closeups, fortunately Johnny Depp provides an alluring, menacing attractive quality. Later, we meet Dillinger's flame, Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard, very good in what is a poorly developed role) along with the two men in charge of capturing Dillinger, J. Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup in a very solid, multi-faceted performance) and Melvin Purvis (Christan Bale, in another one of the film's underwritten roles.) However, the most intriguing of the G-Men is Stphen Lang's Charles Winstead, the man who would eventually be the one to shoot Dillinger. Mann also name drops Baby Face Nelson and Pretty Boy Floyd, yet none of the peripheral characters are really given enough time or work to be more than quick walk-ons.<br/><br/>While this is a film with a number of startling and powerful scenes, it doesn't hang together as a cohesive whole. The audience observes, admires and moves on. I can't think of a film with so many great scenes that left me feeling so cold. <br/><br/>But, this is ultimately a good film. It contains strong work by the actors and Cotillard and Depp have add a sexual chemistry to their relationship. I would add the look to the list of things that work in the film. Obviously the costumes were quite excellent and the sets looked wonderful, but the cinematography was stunning. I was entertained by the film, at times enamored purely by the keen visual style on display. Mann seems to bring a new, almost documentarian, approach to the period piece. I only wish he and his fellow writers took those leaps with the script.<br/><br/>Although it features a fantastic lead performance from Johnny Depp and stunning HD photography (both of which are the best so far this year), the script needed some serious work. Some characters seem undefined and others (like Christan Bale's Melvin Purvis) are bland clichés. Mann and his fellow screenwriters don't even seem to know what they want to say about Dillinger the man. As a result the film is a vaguely satisfying, at times intoxicating. However, in the end it provides only a sketch of a man who deserves a full, fleshed out portrait."
"dtucker86","Null","9","16","3 July 2009"," A first class shoot 'em up!
","Someone once said that Johnny Depp never met a weird part he didn't like. He has done so well at playing oddballs like Edward Scissorhands, the cross dressing director Ed Wood and even Willie Wonka. Its so nice to know that he can play a normal part well as he sure does in this film. Michael Mann is one of the most brilliant directors of our time, he has directed such classics as Thief, Manhunter and Heat. He triumphs once again in this brilliant film that runs circles around any other shoot em up. It is 1934 and the FBI declares war on public enemy #1 John Dillinger. They pointed out in the ""goofs"" section of the IMDb entry on this film that Mann carelessly made many errors with history. For example, the movie opens with Pretty Boy Floyd being killed by FBI agents. Floyd actually wasn't killed until several months after Dillinger (he took Dillinger's place as Public Enemy #1). They have Baby Face Nelson doing a Jimmy Cagney impression from Angels With Dirty Faces which wasn't made until 1938! However, this is such a fine film these are just minor quibbles. Depp gives a fine performance and makes John D. out as a lovable rogue. Yes he is a bank robber, but you sort of root for him. For example, there's a scene where he tells a bank customer during a robbery not to give him his money that he just wants the banks and another where he is tenderly polite to a lady he took hostage. I wouldn't be surprised if Depp gets an Oscar nod for his work. I hope Mann gets one as best director for it is long overdue. The only trouble I have with this film is Christian Bail as Melvin Purvis. I wanted Purvis to be played just as charismatically as they played Dillinger. After all your supposed to be rooting for him. Simply put, Depp acts circles around Bail. This man is just so bland and boring its almost as if he is sleepwalking thru his part."

","In the words of John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) spoken to his love interest Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard, A Good Year), ""I like baseball, movies, good clothes, fast cars... and you. What else do you need to know?"" Like a one legged pirate, ""Public Enemies"", helmed by Hollywood's very own HD CAM junkie Michael Mann (Collateral, Miami Vice) limps along to the two hour and twenty minute mark and has, as Ricky Ricardo would say, ""A lot of S'plainin' to do"". In a world of well staged shootouts, fun and cocky dialogue and heartthrob's Johnny Depp (Sweeney Todd) and Christian Bale (American Psycho), the words ""story development"" may or may not really make much of a difference, but let's not kid ourselves here, they really do. <br/><br/>It is the 1930's and America has just declared their first war on crime, targeting some of the country's most notorious dangers to the well being of society. John Dillinger is one such criminal, claiming bragging rights to the fact that he can clear out a safe in ""one minute and forty secondsflat."" With the help of Baby Face Nelson and Pretty Boy Floyd there really isn't any bank they can't knock over or any jail cell secure enough to hold them in, that is until they are matched by the likes of FBI agent Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale). Purvis pulls all the stops to remain hot on Dillingers tail in attempts to capture him ""Dead or Dead"". Along the way Dillinger falls for Billie, a coat check girl who you'd more than likely expect to catch wearing a three dollar dress in a room full of Mink. Their love is tested when Dillinger is pursued and eventually restrained and locked away, only to escape once more through clever tom foolery in an attempt to fall back into Billies arms once more while staying alive long enough to do it.<br/><br/>To its credit, ""Public Enemies"" lives up to its expectations as a first rate gangster flick, steadily filling the screen with a barrage of machine gun bullets, almost to the point that you can smell the gunpowder from the fifth row. There's enough blood, gore and suspense to keep any action fan at bay, and if you don't squirm in your seat during end of the second to last scene you may need to check your pulse at the door. Unless you've experienced a shootout in person, there is a particularly notable one between the FBI and Dillinger in a motel at the pictures halfway point that should leave you breathless. In fact, if I were to rate Public Enemies on a scale for action alone, id happily award it with a five star honor, but this isn't meant to be just some run of the mile Schwarzenegger popcorn flick, this is meant to be a fine slice of cinema, and cinema has certain prerequisites. <br/><br/>As I stared up at a crisp digital print of the film, I couldn't help but wonder why a big budget movie of this caliber was decidedly shot, in Michael Mann fashion, in HD. At times, the image looked beautifully gritty and realistic, while at others as degrading and false as home video This makes me seriously contemplate why Mann still insists on shooting on cheap digital cameras like the F-23 which he used for this particular project instead of actual film or even a Red One. My question may never be answered, but ultimately it's the film's quality that suffers, which in turn managed to remove me on more than one occasion from the fantasy world of the picture. I wish I could say this was the only aspect that distracted me from my viewing experience.<br/><br/>It seems as if in a stirring turn of events, which occurs somewhere between the main titles and the end credits, Michael Mann has failed to include even a stitch of character or story development. With the exception of her basic introduction at a dingy city bar, Billie has absolutely no back story what-so-ever. This never allows us the opportunity to connect with her on even the most elementary of levels neither emotionally nor physically. The same goes for agent Purvis, whose character is flatter than a dollar flapjack off the sunrise special, making this one of Bale's most forgettable performances to date. There is absolutely no chemistry between Depp and Cotillard, which is a shame when you consider how dynamic both of these top notch actors are individually. To his credit, Depp does manage to deliver another stunning, hardnosed performance as John Dillinger and proves to once again be a complete joy to marvel at on screen. If only the story had as much pizazz. <br/><br/>As a whole, we are presented with bits and pieces of celluloid that never quite seem to join together to make an actual movie, but rather come off as a series of disjointed, yet entertaining vignettes. You would think that by the third film in Mann's powerful resume, he would have learned by now how to pace and execute a motion picture instead disproving his validity as a serious director by making these easy to avoid errors that stand out on screen like a bad spelling mistake. When you mix everything up in an over-sized pot and stir, the ultimate result is an undercooked, emotionless and disconnected final product. <br/><br/>If you're expecting to walk into Public Enemies thinking it's going to be the next ""Godfather"" or ""Scarface"", you may find yourself severely disillusioned at the films conclusion. Then again, if you walk into the movie expecting to be thrilled by impeccably staged action sequences and a few downright impressive shootouts you may find yourself satisfied with your ten dollar ticket purchase. Either way, discerning audiences will demand explanation for why studio execs failed to wellexplain anything. Someone tell Mr. Ricardo that it's time for his close up."
"jgibbzy","2","19","40","2 July 2009"," another film cursed by the dreaded wobbly camera
","What is Michael Mann's obsession with digital camera's in all there grainy glory? For me all it does is take me out of the film and remind me I'm in a dark room with a hundred strangers. It makes the film look amateurish and slapped together at a moment's notice. This has an effect on the sound depending on where the camera is some guns sounds like they'll blow a tree in half while others sound like firecrackers. The acting varies widely and while depp is fine as Dillinger the character's a bit one dimensional. The same could be said of bale character but for once he doesn't feel the need to growl his way through a film. The most interesting characters are the side ones J E Hoover, Depp's girlfriend and the Texas lawmen but none really get fleshed out there are area's there of great potential particularly for the Texas lawmen who get brought in half way through the film as the saviours of the investigation but no reason is given as to why there suited for the job, i've just got to take it on faith. As mentioned before though the biggest problem for me is the wobbly camera, so many film these days think that it's OK in action scenes to have things moving about so fast that you can't see what's going on, make the audience dizzy and they'll believe they've just seen an awesome action scene but the with no frame of reference to where the players are it's just a swirling mess. it's the same problem which effects the bourne films, greatest action scenes ever i hear you cry! oh behave I retort you wanna watch a great film about gangsters with action go watch heat and remember what Mann use to be like. in fact compare the shoot out scene in heat to the shoot out in the cabin from this film, there's no comparison. Michael Mann use to be a great director but he seems to have lot form completely. I thought Miami vice was terrible but it had a great trailer and likewise upon leaving the cinema last night Public Enemies had the same effect on me."

"MOOVYZ","7","8","14","2 July 2009"," I had hoped for so much more!
","My wife and I saw it last night and we both agree that it was less than we had hoped for. I got into a disagreement with another poster here about the use of HD. He said it automatically made the film substandard. I argued that there was basically no difference (in fact, I have never even thought to look at which is which). I still say, that for the most part, HD video is equal to film... most viewers would never see the difference. But I will now agree that this film would have been better if shot on film. Why? Because it could actually have benefited by a bit of grain. It would have helped it fit into the period. So much attention was paid to costumes, etc. The film should have looked ""gritty"" which it didn't. The real problem, IMHO, about the use of HD video was the guerrilla (sp?)style of hand held cameras. I hate this technique. I think that hurt the film tremendously. And when you shake a camera, especially an HD one, you really see the shake. Had the film been shot more with steady cam and perhaps a bit of sepia tinting, the HD part would have been fine.<br/><br/>Now to the movie... it was not well defined in any aspect. They didn't go deep enough into any character to more fully understand the motives they expressed. There was little connection with the viewer and the characters. I could see that Dillenger loved Billie but she was the only one who showed any real emotion in that regard. We didn't see them falling in love, just hearing him say that he did. Pervis looked angry all the time, but we don't know why. We suspect it might be because the gangsters killed (F)BI men, but that's only a guess. J. Edgar Hoover will go down in history for being a real strange character and that fact was touched on in the film, but very little.<br/><br/>In general, it seemed that no part of the story was carried deep enough. I expect that Mann likely shot several hundred hours of video and I also suspect that a 4 hour Director's cut might be a better film but in it's current form, this films lacks depth and definition. There were excessive bullets flying (well filmed) but even these action sequences seemed flat. The most emotional scene in the film **spoiler** was when the ***hole cop was hitting Billie to get info. That scene carried a lot of punch (no pun intended). But then it deflated since no dialog followed up on his behavior. Even the final scene where Billie is told what John said as he was dying was flawed by the character saying ""I think that's what I heard"". I realize it was probably done that way to assure accuracy but it left the audience wondering ""is that what he really said or is that just a guess?"". And if were are trying to stay accurate, do we really know that **spoiler** Dillinger walked through the Bureau's ""Dillinger Division""? That seemed a bit far fetched. But if it's true, how do we know it? I had hoped for so much more. The acting was great. There were a lot of great performances, but actually too many. Who were all these people? Too many cops and robbers but we don't learn who most of them are. ""Baby Face"" Nelson's portrayal was a bit silly and even here, we don't learn enough about how those 2 infamous bank robbers hooked up or how they felt about each other. There was a lead up to the train robbery that looked promising, but then John got shot and that storyline went bye bye. Who was that guy? How often did Dillenger work with him. It was said in the film that all Dillinger's associations were dead. But this looked like his most important cohort. I don't think I ever heard his name mentioned.<br/><br/>The story was ""murky"", like a muddy pond. We know there are ""big fish"" in there, but we don't really know who they are, how many, where they came from, what they like to eat or why they swim the way they do. I feel unfulfilled.<br/><br/>I am a fan of Mann's work. I had hoped for and expected so much more. It might actually exist but on the cutting room floor. But overall, I am less that impressed with this year's most promising movie. Hopefully, Scorsese will fill in the void with ""Shutter Island"". 7/10 ""I think that boy's cheese slid off his cracker"" The Green Mile"
"ccthemovieman-1","9","11","21","9 December 2009"," Familiar Territory, But Still Pretty Good Stuff
","This is a solid crime movie; not fantastic, but good. For older viewers, the story of John Dillinger is familiar territory. Most everyone knows about the famous and where and how he died.....so isn't easy making a film where a sizable part of the audience knows the ending. Yet, thanks to the acting, directing and photography, I found it an interesting film.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp isn't just some actor who likes to play weird roles; he's simply a good actor who can be convincing whether he's ""Edward Scissorhands,"" Willie Wonka"" or ""Public Enemy No. 1 (Dillinger)."" It also was interesting to see Marion Cotillard, the star who played singer Edith Piaf in ""La Vie En Rose,"" playing Dillinger's girl ""Billie Freschette."" Wow, it seems like very strange casting, but it works. The same goes for the always-fascinating Christopher Bale who portrays FBI agent ""Melvin Purvis."" The film has no lulls, despite it being two hours and 20 minutes and not overdoing the action scenes. <br/><br/>Kudos to Director Michael Mann for another fine job, too. The one extended action part - the shootout in Wisconsin - is reminiscent of Mann's dramatic shootout in the streets of Los Angeles in the 1995 movie, ""Heat."" It is an eye-opener.<br/><br/>Yet as much as I enjoyed the movie, somehow I kept thinking the film could be more involving because none of the characters is someone who is endearing, even though that probably is a pretty accurate picture of the real people. In the early '30s, neither gangsters or the police were particularly likable although Dillinger was seen as a folk hero to many as if he was a modern-day Robin Hood. The film, I thought, made him somewhat neutral. The same goes for Frechette and Purvis. I admire the restraint on the part of the screenwriters but I didn't feel they did a good job giving a good character study of anyone.<br/><br/>Regardless, if you like good acting, a good period piece with cool 1930s cars and machine guns a-blazing, you should enjoy this. See it on HD, too; it looks terrific."
"MastrSithLord","3","9","17","1 July 2009"," Disappointment
","This movie failed in many aspects. I'll list a few.<br/><br/>1) Plot. The main problem with this movie is a lack of story arc. Great movies have development over time. In this one, the scenes could have been ultimately randomly rearranged with the same effect. The characters didn't develop much. The plot was essentially a collection of repetitive shoot outs and robberies. There was no crucial or interesting theme bonding these events to each other.<br/><br/>2) Christian Bale's terrible acting job.<br/><br/>3) Way too long. The film was at times, at most times, boring. There were clear instances where the film could have been cut (perhaps the scene where Depp is watching a film near the end).<br/><br/>There are many others, but these alone made the movie a drag."
"Tecun_Uman","1","13","27","1 July 2009"," So historically inaccurate that I cannot recommend it
","I have no problem with Hollywood movies. However, when you pretend that you are making a biopic or reenacting history, well, you need to be kind of realistic. This movie is one lie after another. It opens up right from the start with lie #1, Pretty Boy Floyd being killed by Melvin Purvis. Not only did Purvis not kill him, but Floyd would not die for several years later, well after Dillinger. Later we see Baby Face Nelson being shot and killed after the shoot-out and Little Bohemia. Uhh, nope, that is a lie as well. Nelson would die over a year later in another incident, well after Dillinger. Then Mann makes up this bogus relationship between Dillinger and Billie. Nope, did not happen that way either. I thought filmmakers had evolved into a position where they were able to make entertaining movies while sticking to the truth. Apparently Mann does not regard truth as being important. I mean, why even bother calling the movie Dillinger if you are going to lie about so many historical events, why not just make it a complete work of fiction? And the romanticizing of Dillinger was also ridiculous, the man was popular, but he was not nearly as ""saintly"" as Mann tries to make you believe. Dillinger had a lot of blood on his hands and many dark things in his past."
"C-Younkin","8","5","8","13 July 2009"," Wow!
","There isn't much character development here but Johnny Depp scores as the self-assured, fly-by-the-seat-of-his pants, Robin Hood-esquire Dillinger who spat in the face of Johnny Law at every turn. As a member of Hoover's ""take off the white gloves and hit hard"" FBI, Melvin Purvis, Bale does more than just be a stuffed shirt. The cat and mouse game between the two is suspenseful and the bullets crackle and explode in intense shoot-outs and the prison escapes and bank robberies couldn't be more daring. The production values (the classic cars, night-clubs, costume design, the old movie theaters, etc) look fantastic and bring the 1930's to life and the tight close-ups of characters faces adds to the grit of Michael Mann's outstanding looking film. Cottillard is a classic beauty, a strong presence, and her scenes with Depp are some of the best romance you'll see this year. But it's Depp, layering on the cool, that has us rooting for the bad guy. This all leads to one of the best and most powerful endings of the year."

","OK I admit it. I am tougher on a Johnny Depp movie because I expect Academy award greatness type of film, every time. This movie did entertain. Depp was great as was Christian Bale and Marian Cotillard. No issues with the acting . The movie though , had more of a Spoofy, Film Noire feel to it , rather than tell an in depth story of Johnny Dillinger. I googled Dillinger and I have to admit their was a strong resemblance between Johnny Dillinger and Johnny Depp. Definitely excellent casting. The film though would have been better had it focused on Dillingers complete life story, not just the last year or 2 of his life. Plenty of gratuitous action, but some of it seemed forced and unrealistic. At times this resembled more of a Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzenegger, bad*ss movie. It was based on a true story but became hard to take seriously. It came across to me that the writer of this movie , was more concerned about having nonstop action than relaying a true story. Perhaps this was in the insecurity of the writer himself. I do not know , I am not a psychologist. I do recommend this film. It was a guys film to be sure . My advice.... Do not go in to this thinking its an elite , award film, as I did, because it clearly is not."

His motives, morales simply could not be fed to us as simply with '...daddy beat the hell out of me' sentence.Heat was a true epic with compromising all the casts individualities but Public Enemies does not even give a hunch about who they are, not to mention Purvis, the fonder of FBI, his girl.Over all Mann captures very well made, raw, realistic, non-glamorous actions sequences in his movie one should admire. Fun to watch, to lack too big in characters and what was going on at that time in USA."
"charlytully","9","5","8","3 July 2009"," J. Edgar Hoover was willing to liquidate the Midwest to ""get"" Dillinger
","J. Edgar Hoover (played by Billy Crudup in PUBLIC ENEMIES) was the John Ashcroft of his time, willing to tear up the U.S. Constitution at the drop of a hat to satisfy his personal whims and prejudices. ENEMIES writer\director Michael Mann makes this clear in his film, based on Bryan Burrough's book of the same name. This movie is not for the faint of heart, or J. Edgar fans. Here's the basic story line (SPOILERS): Hoover's machine-gun slinging ""G-men,"" working initially outside their jurisdiction, took an exceptional dislike to Dillinger (Johnny Depp), whom the public perceived as someone who was spreading the ill-gotten loot from voracious banks among ordinary folks during the depths of the Great Depression in the American Midwest. Because Hoover had declared Dillinger as the country's first official ""public enemy #1"" in a failed PR move to milk more money from Congress, Dillinger sent J. Edgar a courtesy Christmas card in December, 1933. Hoover responded by having all known men, women and children connected to Dillinger tortured for ""leads,"" which he followed up by sending an army of FBI special agents to a Wisconsin vacation resort, where they machine-gunned to death three young workers on break from President Roosevelt's Civilian Conservation Corps, while letting Dillinger slip through their fingers. Unperturbed by this ""collateral damage,"" the G-men quickly ambushed their #1 target again in front of a crowded Chicago movie theater, putting three bullets in his back and two bullets into the backs of women happening by. Of course, the movie does not reveal Hoover for the cross-dressing eccentric he was, a ""bachelor"" employing his life-long male companion in one of the highest-paid FBI positions, or that there are reams of proof that Hoover personally blackmailed six U.S. presidents, and that he devoted even more resources to destroying Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., than he did to doing in Dillinger, because these are beyond the scope of Michael Mann's expose. But the fact that Hoover was REWARDED, rather than fired, for his reckless lynching of his self-proclaimed ""public enemy #1"" insured a level of vicious mob-rule mentality at the highest levels of the U.S. government for 38 years beyond John Herbert Dillinger's public assassination July 22, 1934.<br/><br/>The only criticism to be made of Mann's movie is that it is too ""fair and balanced."" While Hoover clearly is portrayed as the man ""pulling the strings"" behind the scenes, FBI special agent Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) has his real-life role in the Dillinger case inflated, with the help of numerous anachronisms (some of which are detailed here in the ""Goofs"" section), making it look like Purvis ""got"" Dillinger virtually single-handed, as opposed to a corrupt Jabba-the-Hutt type venal bureaucrat wreaking havoc indiscriminately against Midwest civilians like some Captain Ahab run amok, all in a drive for his own personal glory. And, of course, being a Hollywood movie, Dillinger's relationship with Evelyn ""Billie"" Frechette (Marion Cotillard) becomes one of the greatest love stories of all time in PUBLIC ENEMIES, whereas the real life bank robber reputedly had a ""special gift,"" which makes one lady hogging him for herself a ludicrous proposition."

","Public Enemies was everything I thought that it would be, Johnny Depp in an action movie. However it was not everything that I really wanted it to be. It felt to me like the film was rushed, as if Michael Mann was falling behind schedule and assigned a hand-held shot for everything that hadn't been filmed yet. The audio was also pretty sketchy, which took away from the experience. These elements along with the HD Video made it feel like I was watching a student film at times. In a way the HD Video adds to the fact that the story being shown is true, seeing as the film's look doesn't have that Hollywood feel to it, though I feel that its not as appealing when movies don't have that professional touch to it.<br/><br/>As for the screenplay, I was also a bit disappointed. It felt like the only goal was to make Dillinger look like a badass, and just forget about the rest of the character. This is proved when Dillinger says, ""I like baseball, movies, good clothes, fast cars... and you. What else you need to know?"" I feel that there would be more than that to the real John Dillinger, but maybe I'm wrong.<br/><br/>It might sound contradicting to what I've just said, but overall I enjoyed Public Enemies. It was a great film with a great cast, and it kept me interested for the majority of the film. Though long, I didn't ""feel"" the 2.5 hours like I did during movies such as Transformers 2 and Benjamin Button. It moves along beautifully, not spending much time dragging anything on for longer than it should. Even if you already know what ends up happening to Dillinger, seeing the movie is definitely worth it. Visually the film is amazing, particularly a shoot out scene which stands high above the rest of the film. And Johnny Depp kicks some ass, reason enough to go see it."

","How can a big-budget movie about a real-life bank-robber, starring Johnny Depp and Christian Bale be this bland and boring? It's surprising how little I cared about the characters and the plot. I read the actual history of John Dillinger after seeing this movie and I found that to be much more interesting."
"seymourblack-1","8","3","4","13 August 2017"," The John Dillinger Story
","The American Depression-era gangsters seemed larger than life, often had colourful names and through their exploits, became a huge source of fascination for both the press and the population at large. Inevitably, the movie industry was quick to cater for the public's appetite for films about these characters and over the decades since the 1930s, the appeal of such movies has remained remarkably strong.<br/><br/>Michael Mann's ""Public Enemies"" distinguishes itself from most of the gangster movies of the past by putting the emphasis firmly on realism and authenticity rather than thrills and excitement and the result is a crime drama that's presented in a more serious, detached and unglamorous style than most moviegoers might expect. Its main focus is on the period during 1933-34 in which the notorious bank robber, John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) was being pursued by an extremely determined FBI Agent called Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) and the differences between the charismatic criminal and the grim lawman could hardly have been more pronounced.<br/><br/>After having been released on parole from an Indiana prison, Dillinger promptly leads his gang in a daring prison escape before embarking on a series of profitable bank heists. One night, at a Chicago nightclub, he's instantly attracted to a hat-check girl called Billie Frenchette (Marion Cotillard) and despite a tentative start to their relationship during which she's unsure what to make of him, Billie gradually warms to Dillinger's very direct style of courtship.<br/><br/>J Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup), the young director of the organisation which would soon become the FBI, makes Dillinger the country's first ""Public Enemy No 1"" and assigns Agent Melvin Purvis to the task of bringing the gangster's crime spree to a rapid end. Having recently gunned down Pretty Boy Floyd (Channing Tatum), Purvis is put in charge of the Bureau's Chicago office where he sets about his mission with some enthusiasm. He's a firm believer in the use of the newer, more scientific methods of crime fighting (e.g. phone tapping etc.) and uses these in his pursuit of Dillinger. He soon discovers however, that these measures alone won't be sufficient to enable him to catch his prey and so has to arrange for some more experienced Arizona lawmen to be brought in to augment his team.<br/><br/>Despite this, Dillinger continues to cleverly outwit his pursuers until, through the use of some pretty unsavoury methods, Purvis is eventually able to achieve his goal.<br/><br/>""Public Enemies"" has an almost documentary style with frequent use being made of the real locations where the events actually took place and the Depression era being recreated in a way that's both beautiful and convincing. The action is presented in a very well thought out order that contributes greatly to the smooth and logical progress of the story and it's also particularly successful in showing how the manhunt for Dillinger became so important to the development of the FBI as a national entity.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp does a marvellous job of portraying Dillinger's unusual combination of charm, ruthlessness and confidence in a very well balanced performance that captures the very essence of what made Dillinger such a popular figure with the public of his day. Christian Bale shows the cold tenacity that made Purvis so strongly focused and Marion Cotillard is extraordinarily good as the beautiful woman who was made to suffer greatly for falling in love with Dillinger."
"midas-jacobs","6","3","4","31 December 2016"," An emotionless film, with good action scenes and acting!
","""Public Enemies"" is a biopic about the robbing-life of John Dillinger told from his perspective and from that of the police.<br/><br/>Michael Mann, the director of among others ""Last of the Mohicans"", was also the director of this movie. In the previous named film he did a good job, in this one however, I found that it didn't live up to my expectations. He made some bold choices, whereby the movie suffered. He sometimes made it look like they were filming a documentary, which may sound logical, because it's based on a true story, but it really wasn't integrated nicely into the film and didn't fit well with what the movie had set up as a theme. He also let the camera shake a lot, which also didn't always work. Sometimes it did, like in the beginning sequence, which I by the way very much enjoyed. In that beginning sequence he used good soundtrack and changed the camera viewpoint often, whereby he has created an interesting and tense scene. Unfortunately the rest of the film wasn't as good as that first scene. Mann also used close- ups very often in this film, which gave a claustrophobic feel to the movie. That didn't fit with the movie as well. But he interchanged them at times with long shots, and due to this you weren't always caught in a claustrophobic feel. He also overused shadow and that sometimes created a nice shot, but other times it didn't work out that well. But overall this wasn't really annoying and it worked most of the times. It helped to create a dark atmosphere, and I believe that that was what Mann was trying to reach. <br/><br/>The cinematography wasn't the greatest too: it was not a good looking movie. Which is by the way surprising, because the cinematographer had previously worked with Mann in other movies, that did look good. Michael Mann did however capture the action scenes very good. Those were tense and exciting to watch. Those scenes were actually the one that saved the movie, unfortunately. The soundtrack, though, I found to be pretty good, just like the costume design. This really helped to create the atmosphere the movie was going for. The sets too looked realistic and helped with the previous named thing. The sound design was good as well. The gunshots and all sounded realistic to me. The editing of movies is always done in a special way with Michael Mann, and in this film that was again the case. Sometimes I was a fan of it sometimes I wasn't, because at times scenes were edited in a clever way, like with placing the head of the character in one corner and switching between two characters at different places having a telephone conversation, but their head is always at the same paces, if that was any clear. So it was a hit or miss with the editing. But I found the pacing to be good. Hence this is a two hour plus film, I was expecting dull, boring parts, but there were none, due to the good pacing.<br/><br/>The acting was very good. I had my doubts with Johnny Depp, because there are only two ways he performs: absolutely fantastic, or absolutely horrible. An example of an absolutely horrible performance of him can be found in the terrible, atrocious film called ""Mortdecai"". What a bad film. But in this movie I had a bit of hope it would lean to the fantastic side – ""Edward Scissorhands"" for example - , because Michael Mann was behind the camera, and it did in fact lean to the fantastic side. I very much liked his performance. Christian Bale, who played the detective trying to capture John Dillinger, too had a good acting achievement. His accent was consistent and sounded good to me. Marion Cotillard played the new girlfriend of John Dillinger. She gave a very good performance. I thought that she was the best out of the cast.<br/><br/>The writing was lesser good. The story was interesting and told in a good way, but it was emotionless. The characters didn't get any development, whereby you didn't care what happened to them or what would happen to them: it just felt flat. The only really emotion we see from John Dillinger is when he says what happened in his youth in a quick fashion to Marion Cotillard. And that's about it, which is kind of sad actually, because we see Jason Clarke's character in a lot of scenes with Johnny's, but yet I can't even recall his name. So when he died it just felt like another disposable cast-member died, even though this wasn't what they were going for. The dialogue, however, was well written and realistic. Some of the lines were very good, but I think that they focused a bit too much on that aspect of the script, and less on the charactorial part of it. <br/><br/>In the end this wasn't Michael Mann's best films, but it wasn't his worst either. The acting was good and so was the beginning sequence. The script was lacking in character development, but it succeeded at the dialogues. Nonetheless, even though the characters weren't good, Michael Mann managed to create good action sequences that held up the movie together with the acting. That's why this film gets a 6.2/10 from me."

","This is so awful to stand. And director Michael Mann is the main Public Enemy here!<br/><br/>The script, which Mann co-wrote, is deadly flat. It has a cat and mouse chase, only. And forget about the rest, any rest!<br/><br/>Who's the movie's John Dillinger? He's a bank robber, in love, hates killing, AND THAT'S IT. Now imagine that that is considered a character compared to everybody else; like J. Edgar Hoover, Baby Face Nelson,.. etc. Look at FBI agent Melvin Purvis; it's the worst written character in history. He's so empty, with no past, family, or mark. What in God's name was written in the script? ""He looks, He orders, He walks, He runs, He shoots""?? Neither the police squad officers, nor Dillinger's gang members, were distinct. The 2 teams were similar guys, who talk blandly; which added bore and unsolved muddle. So, clearly the script's method was: Don't make a good character, or a character in the first place!<br/><br/>Moreover, Dillinger used to be beaten by his father (so he became a criminal?!). Purvis kills himself after capturing Dillinger (because he hated police brutality?!!). Well, the movie is too slack to answer. However, even if, why to mention the matter of Purvis's suicide?? To admit that you're too slack?! Grrrrrr!!<br/><br/>Question: Dillinger, Purvis, Hoover.. what did transform in them between the start and the end?! The answer: NOTHING. Knowing the hatred that this movie planted in me, and aggrandized during the viewing, I had more character development than them!<br/><br/>The people love Dillinger as a public hero, so why is that? The movie answers us: ""Go read history you morons, or watch better movies about the same era!"". Dillinger stays at the home of 2 Romanian girls, so who are they?! The movie answers us: ""Get lost, I don't care!"". One of Dillinger's shooters, hears his final words, but doesn't tell them to Purvis, so why is that? The movie answers us: ""Guess it yourself, I have no time!"". Again, this script doesn't want to be a script!<br/><br/>So after ruining the characters, motives, character development, explanations, why not the dialogue too; which was uninspired and useless. Even the script's attempt to make a magical cinematic moment aborts; since Dillinger's visit to the Dillinger Squad offices seems like a fantasy, especially when no one looks at him, asks him for identity, and - in inordinate move - delays in telling him the running match's score!<br/><br/>Instead of repairing that stale script, Mann cared about shooting the movie not on traditional 35mm film, but on HD video, to be ALL digital. OK, give the man a break. He wanted to be new and revolutionary. But after watching the final result, please, you Mr. Mann, give us a break!<br/><br/>The image is incredibly primitive; I don't recall a TV image that bad. The lights' reflection on the actors' faces is disastrous. You'll be deeply sad for the good reactions of Johnny Deep. That technique has such a cold effect which freezes the expressions. However, the way it was used enhanced the catastrophe. OH GOD, I have never ever watched a director who was so fancy of shooting only the actors' faces like this before! Mann overused the close-ups, which were unexpressive already, as if the plan was ""Go to the eye, the nose, the ear!!!"". It gets boring and provocative with 140 minutes long. And as if that wasn't enough, he shook the camera non-stop, in a tipsy manner which assured that the cameraman was incurable sot!, and created the ugliest, most random, cadres, overstepping realism to amateurishness. The colors were between pale and dark, but I was sick by painting nearly everything with yellow. Whether to represent how the movie's time was old, or how the title characters' life was ailing; that was adolescent. And to make it perfectly adolescent, just watch the camera's shadow, so visible on- screen, too many times to count!<br/><br/>Is that your achievement Mr. Mann?! Making an artistically poor, faces maniac, unceasingly tottering, sterilely expressive, idiotically yellow, and utterly amateurish image?!! At one moment, Hoover talks to Purvis about the importance of arresting Dillinger, while Purvis looks way taller than Hoover. So what was the point of view, knowing that Hoover was the one in control? But I would be the stupidest man alive if thought that the cinematography here could utter a thing. And to die out of rage, you find critics who say: ""The picture was beautifully slick and realistic. The cinematography made the cars, headlights, street lights look marvelous""!! My only remark is: Who left the mental hospital's doors opened?!!<br/><br/>Only during the sequence of Dillinger waving to his fans while transporting him to prison, and the scene where he was watching (Manhattan Melodrama - 1934), I felt I was watching something close to a movie. Still, Deep was the sole interesting factor in this who's-the-worst marathon. But, regrettably, all of his performance was violently wronged by that pedant cinematography, and horrid directing.<br/><br/>With that script, (Public Enemas) could have been a vapid Hollywood movie, but with that directing, it turned into worse: a vapid home movie, yet produced with truly wasted 100 million dollars! Mann has the right to renew, and we have the right to tell him: You Failed. After watching the horrible (Miami Vice - 2006), I said maybe Mann hates his job. Now I'll say it frankly: he's vain or dumb.. namely awful both ways!"

","When Johnny Depp isn't overdoing he's underplaying. The Tim Burton films has his characters flitting and frolicking on the screen like animated puppets wired on ten gallons of caffeine, while in roles like THE RUM DIARY he's as subdued as a guy on the corner.<br/><br/>But when playing John Dillinger, the single most famous bank robber in American history – who became (and remains) a folk hero during the depression – some of that hyperactive spark might have helped.<br/><br/>But the failure of the overlong PUBLIC ENEMIES can't be blamed on the immensely popular A-list celebrity. Depp, being much too pretty for the role, and whose narrow shoulders in the big black coat resembles a high school kid in a mob-themed prom, does achieve brief bouts of slowburn cool, especially when toying with the head of FBI hunter Melvin Purvis, played with monotone breeze by Christian Bale – yet another talented actor wasted in this expensive suit with no pockets.<br/><br/>Director Michael Mann spends so much energy on the frantic action Dillinger and his boys on the run one minute and quickly robbing banks the next that the characters are completely wasted. There's not one clear shot of Baby Face Nelson's nefarious mug – he could have been a essential antagonist that'd allow Dillinger to deliver more strength to the proceedings.<br/><br/>Depp, in filling the shoes of genuine tough guys Lawrence Tierney and Warren Oates (who's turn in the 1973 John Milius biopic is still the best), is lost in the milieu of grainy cinematography and shaky nighttime shootouts. And the sappy love story between Dillinger and his half Indian gun moll seems a mere romantic device.<br/><br/>But the biggest tragedy are the two historic keynotes to the story – Dillinger's prison break using a gun-shaped soap bar and his eventual demise outside the movie theater thanks to the Lady in Red, are rushed along with a soundtrack more befitting a majestic biopic than a kickass one.

"Lechuguilla","Null","3","4","30 March 2010"," Blurry And Dark
","Chicago's Biograph Theater and immediate surroundings in the film's final fifteen minutes look authentically 1930s. And the accompanying sense of impending climax captures a growing drama. The ending of ""Public Enemies"" thus makes for absorbing viewing, helped along by the realization that these events actually happened.<br/><br/>That said, I find little of interest in this mostly factual account of public enemy number one, John Dillinger (Johnny Depp), and attempts by Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) to catch him, under the watchful eye of J. Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup). Though the period-piece sets and era music are fine, the film suffers from two big flaws.<br/><br/>First, despite the focus on Dillinger, the script overwhelms the audience with too many background characters, all of whom seem nondescript and confusingly intrusive. I counted 43 characters significant enough to earn a ""biography"". The total list of characters exceeds a hundred. The film purports to be a biography of ""public enemies"", namely Dillinger, Pretty Boy Floyd, Baby Face Nelson, and their sidekicks. But all these added people blur the story, and render a very impersonal account.<br/><br/>Second, the film's lighting trends dark, and as unhelpful as the script. Faces merge together. There's lots of hubbub and ""action"". I can barely remember any of it, apart from those final fifteen minutes, and one other segment wherein Dillinger walks nonchalantly into a police station room devoted to his capture. But, in general, the lighting compounds the confusion with regard to characters and plot.<br/><br/>Overall performances trend dull and wooden. Depp is a terrific actor. But he's dull here. Christian Bale gives as wooden a performance as I have ever seen. Other actors leave little or no impression.<br/><br/>Sound effects are good, especially the sounds of gunfire.<br/><br/>One gets the impression that the film's director aimed for a particular style of storytelling. If so, the results don't work, at least for me. There are many good true-life gangster films out there. ""Public Enemies"" isn't one of them."

This could be excused if we were presented with solid writing, acting, direction and some drama. But we get nothing. A complete waste of over two hours of my life. Johnny Depp's ability seems to be confined to Burtonesque fantasy tales. Here he is seriously miscast, lamely going through the motions.

I rarely review but I'm hoping that these few words spare at least one other fellow human being the ordeal."

","Let's start with the highlights Pros – Johnny Depp – Absolutely Awesome Sound (especially the gunfights) – Good plot – Gets credit for being something somewhat original out of Hollywood<br/><br/>Cons – Some slow parts<br/><br/>First off, I'd like to give Michael Mann credit for sticking to his guns and making movies the way he wants and not like some of the processed junk that has been forced fed to the public in recent history. Also, I don't have a problem with the digital film recording that Mann used it didn't distract me from the contents of the movie. As for Bale's performance, I didn't think anything of it because it wasn't a big role given most of the movie focused on Dillinger. On a side note, I really like the secondary portrayal of Baby Face Nelson. If you get bored easily when there isn't something blowing up every 3 minutes you will not like this movie because there are long stretches of dialog and plot development. When there were action scenes I found them realistic and gritty; I especially loved the gunfire sound effects. The main thing I found was a bit weak was the love story part of the plot, but it didn't take too much away from the overall Cops-Robbers theme. Granted this isn't Mann's best film but as for 2009 it a breath of fresh air given the saturation of comic books, cut and paste comedies/chick flicks, and never ending sequels.

","If anyone watched Michael Mann's ""HEAT"" starring Al Pacino , Robert DeNiro and Val Kilmer then you know what I am talking about. Seriously the parallels between HEAT also a Mann production and Public Enemies are several....A charismatic , even sympathetic bank robber with a code of conduct and honor , an obsessed law enforcement worker trying to catch him , robber getting closer to flame and his demise after a series of unfortunate events , death of his friends in a stylish gunfight and losing his girl ( played suberply by Marion Cotillard ) because of circumstances he found himself at the end.... <br/><br/>Johnny Depp continues to amaze me...His versatility in characters he chose to play is incredible...From a 19th century detective to 17th century pirate to Willy Wonka and now this...John Dilinger....Bank robber a common criminal in Great Depression era but also some kind of Robin Hood or Jesse James like public hero figure....Isn't there any role he can not handle ? Christian Bale unfortunately is overshadowed by Depp's character but this is hardly Bale's fault...Even the best actors can only perform as well as the material given to them...So Bale's character Mevin Purvis seems only a stoic stereotype cop , a one dimensional character. Although writing for Bale's character suffered he did his best and pulled that accent thing fairly well.<br/><br/>Unfortunately film begins with a fairly uninteresting and uneven pacing after initial scenes of a jail breakout. I don't know if that's due to Mann's choice of confusing editing , or mediocre writing of script adaptation. We don not know anything or more precisely see anything about Dilinger's life prior to initial prison break out or his earlier exploits...So the movie begins with an assumption that audience has enough historical information about characters..That is a bad introduction..After a while we see Dilinger's robberies after break out his other escapes from law etc.. And then we get partly familiar with him... After night firefight in farmhouse and to the end of movie things get interesting...We see a fairly dramatic ending to main character John Dilinger with Eroll Flynn's ""Manhattan Melodrama"" accompanying him..<br/><br/>While Dilinger is shown as sympathetic to audience lawmen of that era are mostly not...J.E. Hoover FBI Director is a bureaucrat , a media relations obsessed public servant who has never been in field. He proposes to use the methods of Fascist Italy to catch Dilinger's gang...Melvin Purvis as I mentioned is very one dimensional except he is a crack shot and he gives in under the pressure of Hoover and ""takes out white gloves"" as Mussolini said....He turns a blind eye as a wounded suspect is tortured while he was in hospital bed and in pain....He then blackmails someone to set a final trap for Dilinger...Another detective brutalizes Dilinger's girlfriend....Meanwhile Dilinger continues to evade them until the end of movie...Only decent looking law enforcement officer was Special Agent Charles Winstead ( Stephen Lang ) who shot Dilinger at the end and delivered his final worlds to his girlfriend Billie in prison..<br/><br/>1930'ies settings are nice and well produced from clothing to cars and weapons...Firefight in farmhouse at night was cool looking , stylish , with fast moving camera. I think that kind of firefight scene is Mann's trademark.. Summary : A decent movie. Worth seeing.."
"blanbrn","8","3","4","4 July 2009"," Well done telling of a historic crime figure. It entertains and holds interest with good support by blasts and blazing gunfire.
","Michael Mann who is one of the best film directors around as by evidenced with his crime genre films, really scores big here with his latest as ""Public Enemies"" is an informative and historical blasting and blazing gunfire thrill ride from start to finish. This film is blended with enough action and your traditional bad guy against good theme to make it a must see for any film fan and the acting and chemistry between the characters which features some of the best working in film today like Depp, Cotillard and Bale make it even much more of a treat.<br/><br/>Set in the 1930's Midwest during the great depression the film starts off rather heavy as criminal John Dillinger(played wonderful by Johny Depp)burst out of an Indiana jail and right away becomes a dangerous and brazen bank robber of the 1930's depression era as one by one he's robbing banks and breaking out of jails. This sparks the justice system and federal law enforcement to create new methods and ways to fight crime as their jurisdiction will reach from state to state and a new most wanted list is created from the agency head J. Edgar Hoover. You guessed it the most wanted enemy number one is John Dillinger. Now enter some drama and conflict as the film was good to show during the bureau's early days not all was agreed on in legal methods and searches plus even arranging chase teams were debated. All this would come from hotshot and by the book special agent Melvin Purvis(Christian Bale)who would come to final terms with Dillinger in Chicago in 1934.<br/><br/>As you see from bank robbery to bank robbery including jail escapes John Dillinger is cool, calm, calculated, and cocky the movie shows him as such an interesting character which is helped by Depp's elegant and effortlessly cut performance. As many of these gunfires scenes are so well liked for the way Mann shot them still thru it all this film celebrates the criminal as a pop culture phenomenon for the way it shows him in many scenes. Along the way as with any bad guy Dillinger meets a love interest really the wild card of the film that being a lady named Billie(Marion Cotillard who's sexy)and they romance along the chase path when not busy taking money yet it still leads to unexpected crazy love.<br/><br/>Really this is a measured film that entertains in such a traditional way of the classic good guy against bad guy with plenty of support from blazing gunfire it's such a traditional feel good film. As the setting of the 1930's and it's actual taking of place helps. Still the way director Mann made this crime drama makes it an interesting watch not only is it a fun action drama to watch it's a good historical film that shows the early FBI roots and it profiles one of the first and earliest criminals the country ever had. You as a viewer really would cheer for the Dillinger character as it showcases and shows him in such a stylish way. Seriously ""Public Enemies"" is one of the better action crime dramas that's been made in a long time a real winner due to it's direction and for the fact that it showed a lot of historical information to many that didn't know. And most of all Johhnny floats and sails above everyone with his memorable and very good performance as a legendary American criminal figure."

"fosterino","8","3","4","3 July 2009"," Nothing too special for Michael Mann...
","... but still a good time at the movies.<br/><br/>Being generally very similar to Heat, it follows a similar story arc and theme, so if you know Michael Mann you won't be in for many surprises.<br/><br/>Depp was really good as Dillinger, and Christian Bale shook of the clinging stench of Terminator Salvation and redeemed himself for this summer with his work as Melvin Purvis. Marion Cotilliard was pretty good too, although she was an afterthought for much of the movie and only really figured into things towards the very end.<br/><br/>I really liked the soundtrack because it evoked the proper time and place and attitude, but i felt that the score was sometimes a bit over the top - especially at the end with a totally predictable ""cue the waterworks"" moment with Marion.<br/><br/>The only major criticism I have about the film in terms of the way that it plays out is in the fact that it is very difficult to identify/distinguish many of the members of Depp's crew. Some of them have maybe one or two lines in the whole movie, and the rest just exist in the background until they are called upon by the script to show up at a certain spot and make a brief appearance. If these were just minor roles then it wouldn't be a very big problem. The problem is that the film asks the viewer to keep track of all these characters that the main players are talking about without really having any idea who they are referring to.<br/><br/>The film appears to have been shot digitally, mostly with hand-held cameras. When it is most obvious, the motion on screen really pops, and it looks much faster than normal but can sometimes look kind of like a TV show. Sometimes the lighting really doesn't make any sense at all (like when Johnny and Marion and sitting on a beach at 4:00 am and there is a blinding white light coming from.. somewhere .. that just seems out of place). When this odd lighting and the very fast frame rate combine it can sometimes look a bit slapdash. This phenomenon also makes it look like the actors are on a stage at a theater, and this may be the intended effect. Sometimes it looks awesome though - there is a chase/battle in the woods at night that is very well done and the lighting and cinematography capture it very well.<br/><br/>Overall it was a good movie. It was sort of like Heat, just redone as a period piece. It doesn't reach the same level of scale and significance as that great film, but I don't think Public Enemies was reaching for that level."

Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) is the FBI agent who heads the operation to catch Dillinger.<br/><br/>Dillinger introduces himself to Marion Cotillard magnificently. He tells about his childhood & that he loves fast cars & HER! That was actually very romantic, in a weird way..! Christian Bale does what he's best at, simply staring intensely & barking orders. The fact that this was a true story made it all the more exciting. Christian Bale brings his Batman tone to some of the scenes. Some may like it, some may not. I didn't like it. I half expected Depp to get by on swagger & charm like in the Pirates Of Caribbean, but he does so much more than that. Marion Cotillard gives one of her best performances. The camera-work used in the film makes the whole setting look authentic & gives a gritty feeling to the film. You gotta love Johnny Depp's style..:) Watch this film because it is not only a gallant tale about honour & loyalty, but also because it's one hell of a thrilling ride.<br/><br/>8/10 <br/><br/>-Girish, 20"
"jimandjennie-1","2","4","6","9 October 2009"," A very ordinary film
","This film was a very big disappointment, especially coming from a director of Michael Mann's reputation. There was little in Dillinger's character to empathise with and Johnnny Depp did nothing to make the role interesting. The self indulgent directing and photography made it a difficult film to focus on at times. Also the way most of the players mumbled their way through their lines made it tedious to listen to. The American gangster has been portrayed so brilliantly by such giants as Cagney, Bogart, and George Raft, that I am surprised that Mr Mann decided to make this film. Especially as it told us nothing new about Dillinger. In fact it seemed to be trying to turn a cold blooded killer into a sympathetic character. A film which did succeed in arousing sympathy for murderous thieves was 'Bonny and Clyde.' But then it would be very easy to make a list of gangster films that stand the test of time and head and shoulders above this long and boring offering. I am sure that it will soon be forgotten."
"seaview1","7","4","6","30 August 2009"," PUBLIC ENEMIES Rekindles Gangster Era
","Johnny Depp is hitting his stride in recent years with his Pirates of the Caribbean films and character roles. Director/writer Michael Mann has been a respected stylist of the crime genre with such notables as Heat, Thief, and TV's Miami Vice. The union of these two super talents results in a more than satisfactory retelling of the legendary bank robber, John Dillinger, in Public Enemies. This violent tale focuses on the free spirit of Dillinger and his infamous robberies in the Midwest at the height of the Great Depression.<br/><br/>In 1933, the country is in the midst of the Great Depression and bank robber John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) captures the public's fascination and even folk hero worship. Having helped to break his friends out of prison, he continues his robberies in and around Chicago. As the crime wave sweeps the Midwest, the FBI's J. Edgar Hoover enlists up and coming agent, Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale), (who has just nailed Pretty Boy Floyd,) to capture Dillinger, Public Enemy Number One. Purvis employs a variety of sophisticated listening devices and police work to track him. Dillinger thinks he is invincible and executes even more daring bank robberies. He dates hat check girl Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard) and travels with her to Florida for horse races and then to Arizona, where lawmen recognize and arrest him. Transported to Indiana State Penitentiary, an easier place to breakout than a federal prison thanks to his mob lawyer, he uses a fake gun to engineer an escape. He is joined by notorious hothead robber, Baby Faced Nelson, and they score more violent robberies. Purvis insists on recruiting a crack force of Texas lawmen who assist him in closing in on the Dillinger gang leading to a memorable shootout in Little Bohemia. As Dillinger crosses the state line, he violates federal laws and brings pressure on organized criminals, who turn on the fugitive. Billie's fear that John will be caught or killed is tempered by her love for him, and when she is captured by local law enforcement, Purvis intercedes. When a call girl comes forward with information about Dillinger, Purvis sets up a fateful ambush at The Biograph Theater where the FBI will be waiting.<br/><br/>It is interesting that Dillinger's relationship with organized crime syndicates helped him with a legal infrastructure that disappeared once the mob deemed him a risk to their lucrative business. Further, Hoover's political agenda was desperate to make headlines and build the FBI into a future powerhouse of law. It is also fascinating how technically proficient the FBI was on its use of wire taps and eavesdropping devices while being relatively incompetent in conducting a simple arrest or taking part in a shootout.<br/><br/>What is refreshing is the core romance between Dillinger and Billie Frechette. Dillinger is presented as bold, charismatic and at times ruthless. It is his bravado that attracts fellow criminals and Billie to him. Cotillard gets a strong role that is considerably more than window dressing. Her performance is convincing, and her chemistry with Depp's Dillinger makes this romance believable and heartbreaking thus lending an emotion subtext to the typical gangster movie. Bales's Purvis is portrayed as an obsessed, determined lawman who is dry and dull in sharp contrast to the devil may care attitude of the freewheeling Dillinger. Billy Crudup registers effectively as the young Hoover. Mann favorite Stephen Lang, barely recognizable, registers a solid performance as a hardened Texas lawman who is critical to the end of the film.<br/><br/>Besides the usual set designs and costumes to mimic the depression era, heavy use is made of period music. The Little Bohemia shootout is a major set piece with heavy use of hand-held cameras. Although a detailed montage of action, it still does not have the visceral impact of John Milius' Dillinger or even the classic, G-Men. There is also an extended bank heist reminiscent of Mann's Heat in its boldness and precision of execution. The climactic ambush at the Biograph Theater is depicted in excruciating detail and still carries a great deal of tension.<br/><br/>The last scene at a women's prison may never actually have happened, and it is curious that Lang's lawman and not Purvis serves as the catalyst for this key moment. The subsequent, final shot of Cotillard after getting a special message is quite memorable. It almost raises this film to another level.<br/><br/>Public Enemies is not the best of Michael Mann, but it is a solid entry in his canon of crime films. What is notable is another star turn by Depp, an actor at his creative peak."
"rsa5387","7","4","6","11 August 2009"," Ultimately Underwhelming
","On one end of the spectrum, Public Enemies is embellished with great performances by its cast, especially Johnny Depp and Billy Crudup. It's also immensely mounted, with an extremely well designed 1930's era Chicago. The clothing, cars, weapons, and accents are all very accurate, as is to be expected with a big-budget period film. The narrative is also captivatingly woven, showing Dillinger's latter crime career, including his relationship with Billie Frechette, and eventual downfall including his eventual capture by the FBI.<br/><br/>So, while the film certainly had an adequate cast, budget, and script at hand, in the end a lot of it felt underdeveloped. Dillinger and Billie's relationship could have been fleshed out a bit more, and there should have been a few more scenes between Dillinger and Purvis. Both of these were needed in order to create more emotional depth for these characters, particularly to rationalize the actions of both Dillinger and Purvis, in order to make them viable for the audience to care about. As it stands, Public Enemies wasn't lacking in depth for Dillinger, as the majority of the film focuses on him, but Purvis was seriously under-written. His character was under-developed to such an extent that Bale's performance appeared to flounder in comparison to Depp, as Purvis wasn't lended a personality that made the audience empathize with his intentions. Puvis's lack of character development also left much suspense out the picture, an aspect that worked to nerve-wracking results in Mann's Heat, as both DeNiro and Pacino were very well-developed, and possessed far more dialogue exchange than the solitary scene Depp and Bale share in this film. Other faults that hurt the film was the uneven editing and the use of digital cameras instead of traditional 35mm film. The editing for Public Enemies disrupted the flow of the film, as certain scenes were either extended too long or cut so suddenly that pacing felt awkward at some points. Moreover, the use of digital film was not a good choice in shooting a period film. A few scenes, the shootouts especially, are 'cheap' looking, meaning that the realistic shooting style made much of this big-budget film look like it was shot for television or as a documentary, removing much of the scale it would have had on 35mm.<br/><br/>In the end, Public Enemies is a well-acted, stylishly mounted, enjoyable biopic that falters a little due to its underdeveloped characters, uneven editing, and awkward shooting style. But, in essence, its positives far outweigh its negatives, with some outstanding sequences, especially the climax, well-written dialogue, strong performances, and authentic art direction."

","After ten years and a strong cult following, Michael Mann has decided to try to recreate the basis that underpinned ""Heat"". That film saw a cop and a bank robber play off each other whilst being two sides of the same coin.<br/><br/>There are parallels with that film and ""Public Enemies"" (the gangster's girl, the brotherhood between some of the gangsters and the gunfights etc) but also some major differences. Firstly the gist of the film revolves mostly round gangster John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) whilst law enforcer Melvin Purvess (Christian Bale) is really second billing (Heat was split equally). Next this is based on a true story so creates limitations. Anyhow, best to just take this film on its own.<br/><br/>So how does it all go? Personally, I enjoyed it. The settings are very evocative of the period (1920s) without falling into cliché whilst the actors all fit in very well into their roles. Johnny Depp holds out very well in his part as John Dillenger and gives him a full character. There are many great quotable lines in the film and the film moves at a fair pace.<br/><br/>However, it wasn't as gripping as I'd have hoped. The story was well written but didn't grab me partly as it's a very long movie. Maybe my expectations were too high. Despite that, these are really sparse criticism, and overall it's a very good film and enjoyable, just be warned that it is a long film."

But it's more than that, more than a love story snuck between the bank heists, more than a glimpse at the roots of the FBI (with a slightly unconvincing J. Edgar getting started). It manages to create a pulse and a mood that sustains even the occasional slow moments. It makes the life of Dillinger, in the form of Johnny Depp, a little fantastic and romantic in a filmic way--creating another Hollywood icon. The bio is the vehicle for a larger aura, which is the movie.<br/><br/>After all, we know the facts. It's how they are told and how they are seen that matters. Public Enemies, with all its clichés, is dynamic and sweet, disturbing and even a little bit funny. There are redundant moments (one too many bank robberies for me) and some acting that falls a little flat (including, unfortunately, Dillinger's love interest). But the cinematography by Dante Spinotti is really superb and varied, playing with foreground and background, often with a single element shown very close, and using a huge range of interesting light--the long chase scenes in the Wisconsin woods struck me as original and beautiful.<br/><br/>So I wouldn't think of this as a film about plot but about getting absorbed, which you can really do well. And about Depp in a superb performance, filled with charm and confidence and unrecognized doom."
"DarkVulcan29","9","4","6","16 July 2009"," Johnny Depp and Marion Cottilard pretty much make the film
","The story of John Dillinger, the infamous bank robber and his gang, trying to stay a step ahead of the law. And Melvin Purvis the FBI agent trying to stay ahead of him, in hopes of catching him. But how is this gonna play out, in this game of cat and mouse.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp once again steals the movie, his cool style of acting seems to upstage the other actors, except for Marion Cottilard who plays Billie the woman Dillinger falls in love with, she gave quite a strong performance, and held her own with Depp. But Christian Bale as FBI agent Melvin Purvis, was annoyingly stiff in his role, and brings no interest. But the rest of the cast is alright, and there some action scenes also. And it was brilliantly directed by Michael Mann. If you loved The Untouchables(1987), then you'll love Public Enemies."
"stonemountainproductions","8","4","6","13 July 2009"," Good film. Great Actors.
","Public Enemies is a good film. My only complaint is that the film is way too long. If the film was cut down to about 2 hrs it would have been perfect. Just when I thought the film was over it kept going. Some of the scenes were to dark. I couldn't tell what was going on. Johnny Depp was excellent in the film. It seems that whatever movie Johnny Depp is in, good or bad, he is always good in it. Another surprise was the performance of Billy Crudup. I just wish he got more parts in films. More lead roles. He's a terrific actor. Christian Bale did a much better job in this film then Terminator Salvation. At least he didn't mumble his way through this film and I could understand his dialogue. I love early 1900's gangster films and this film sits right next to the untouchables. Go see it."
"SophomoreSlump","7","4","6","11 July 2009"," An epic story told in a slow pace.
","Public Enemies tells the story of John Dillinger, the 1930's public enemy number one and how the Feds tried to take him down along with his friends. Or better yet, it just tells the story of how Dillinger was taken down. The story didn't start at the beginning nor did it tells us about John Dillinger, it just skipped to the middle of his 'career' and showed us how he escaped from prison and went on a bank-robbery-spree. So, in a way, the story was not in depth and, of course, it didn't really follow the real history with some changes made. But the storyline is gripping nonetheless.<br/><br/>The acting is brilliant. You can expect nothing less from the casts of Johnny Depp, who played public enemy number one convincingly; Christian Bale, who is obsessed to take Dillinger down; and of course the lovely Marion Cotillard, who played Dillinger's girlfriends. Cotillard however didn't get a very long screen time but she used every second of it to give us her best, and one of the best stand out scene is the interrogation scene.<br/><br/>The movie is shot with a shaky ""hand-held"" camera. It feels like we are chasing the action as it happens. And the tone of the movie is bright making it look like a documentary without the use of CGI or such. Everything about this movie looks realistic from the costumes to the buildings and cars in the background.<br/><br/>The soundtrack really fits the movie and I love the shooting scene, which most of the time is just silence with only gunshot ringing in the theatre hall. The gunshot sounds realistic and not surprising coming from Michael Mann, the director of Heat (1995).<br/><br/>All in all, Public Enemies is not for everyone and the 140 minutes long run does not help either. But if you want realistic drama and sweet shooting scene, plus great acting from a cast of brilliant actors and maybe a light history lesson, then this movie is for you."
"Beginthebeguine","Null","4","6","10 July 2009"," Too much for Mann to handle
","I thought it was o.k., that's all. Now that Pacino, De Niro and Jack Nicholson seem to only be playing parodies of themselves Johnny Depp seems to be the only actor left who can be counted on for an interesting performance. Jimmy Russo and Lili Taylor show up in small roles and it's always good to see them. Russo can really sell that desperate, lonely and pain filled look that cries out for mercy like a cornered dog.<br/><br/>It drags at times, the films pace is off, but Mann isn't Marty Scorsese. The best scene is the night time shoot out between the Gansters and the Fed's at the lodge. In real life Baby Face Nelson didn't die there, so the films not high on reality and disregards truth for drama.<br/><br/>The thing I don't understand is why Christian Bale keeps getting jobs. He doesn't act, and I feel embarrassed for him as he keeps trying to find a facial expression or a voice characterization. In the beginning of the film I thought he was trying to do President Obama's speech phrasing. That's alright though I don't understand why Matthew McConaughey and Nicolas Cage keep getting work either. It's a good thing that there is little interaction between Bale and Depp, when they are in the same scene Bale becomes invisible as Depp acts him into oblivion.<br/><br/>If you love Depp see it, if you like him go see another one of his films. If it's John Dillinger you crave go see the 1973 Warren Oats film Dillinger, he even looks more like Dillinger."
"come2whereimfrom","9","4","6","5 July 2009"," Mann restores my faith.
","It was really weird, I walked out of the cinema feeling something I hadn't felt for ages, there was no crushing disappointment or bitter hatred, there was just 'yes I've just witnessed a great film'. After a slew of bad summer movies at last one that made me believe in cinema again. Michael Mann's 'Public Enemies' is a classic. Think 'Heat' meets 'The Untouchables' it's a brilliant gangster film about John Dillinger, played expertly by Johnny Depp, America's public enemy number one. Straight away we launched into a prison break in 1933 and it's the devil in the details that makes the viewer really believe it is 1933, the costumes, the cars, the settings, the guns, and it's perfect. Depp plays Dillinger just right and even Christian Bale as his G-man nemesis is the best he's been since 'The Machinist'. Shot in typical Mann style we follow Dillinger from small time crook to big time celebrity as he lives fast, for the moment, on the edge, always outwitting J.Edgar Hoover's crack crime force. The pacing, as always, means that the over two hours doesn't feel like it, the score a mixture of orchestral, blues and jazz fits the mood perfectly. There's romance, drama, action and the shoot outs, no one does a shoot out like Michael Mann its as if every bullet counts, each one a punch, you can hear the bullet leave the gun and arrive at its destination, its gun play choreography at its best. Marion Cotillard fresh from her Oscar winning portrayal of Edith Piaf is great as Dillinger's love interest and despite very little screen time Billy Crudup is amazing as the callous and determined Hoover. All in all this is what you want from a film, engaging, thought provoking, amazing attention to detail, multi-layered, a solid story and expert direction. They don't make them like this anymore, but thankfully one person still does."

","I've seen it yesterday (4th July) on the 'Wilkinson American Movie Day' in Antwerp, Belgium.<br/><br/>It was fun to see Johnny Depp (Dillinger) act along Christian Bale (Purvis). Dillinger is praised for being public enemy nr.1 and being an anti-hero. Agent Purvis get's the opportunity to make career in an upcoming FBI. It's also a movie about unconditional friendship (dietrich, Red, etc.) and love (Billie Frechette).<br/><br/>The story could have been written today because of the recession and the people being angry at the banks in the 1930's. Hopefully nobody get's the idea to be the next John Dillinger.<br/><br/>Great movie!"
"chris_clogg","8","4","6","4 July 2009"," Enoyable film but just not there...
","Public Enemies is a tremendously interesting film, holding your attention for the 140 minutes. In fact, when it ended, I was quite surprised... I expected at least another 30 minutes. It is likely that this is due to the script & character problems with the movie (I'll discuss this later).<br/><br/>Each scene is very captivating. The movie draws you in and keeps you invested, mostly because John Dillinger is such an interesting man. Every time he is on screen we desire to know what he will say, and how he will react. Johnny Depp (unsurprisingly) fits the role perfectly, and plays it perfectly too.<br/><br/>(SPOILERS BEGIN) But alas, he only has so much to work with; the same goes for Christian Bale. I believe it is because of their characters that we do not feel as satisfied as we could. It would have been much better to, perhaps, follow John as he begins his bank robbing, and then continue through his arc to the end. As it stands now, we just watch him rob banks, love a woman, and die. Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) has the same sort of issue: he tries to catch John, argues with his boss a bit, has some conflict with his own doofus men, and then they finally get John.<br/><br/>The love between Billie (Marion Cotillard) and Johnny has its believable parts, and its unbelievable parts. He is captivated by her and pursues her. This is love... this makes sense. She, naturally, is a bit defensive, but does indeed fall for him. A great scene is where he just outright says to her (moments after meeting) that he robs banks and that he is John Dillinger. She's captivated and so begins their love story. The problem I had was how ""easy"" she was. Several times where conflict emerged between them, John would say a few convincing lines, and almost instantly she'd be swayed back to liking him. The love aspect of this movie could have been much more powerful if it had been more fully formed.<br/><br/>So many scenes are so amazing, and some lines are so good... if the script was just a bit better this film could have been truly amazing. The ending could have had a much greater impact (where John sends his last message to his lover, Billie).<br/><br/>As for the digital HD thing... it immerses you. The battle scenes were very exciting... very real. Personally though, I much prefer the look of film. HD/digital that isn't made to look like film (as in the case here) instantly puts you into the ""television show"" mindset. I understand what they were trying to do, and it succeeded, but I just didn't prefer it.<br/><br/>Overall: An intense movie that you won't forget, but a lot of missed potential. I give it an 8, simply because it's intense and enjoyable.<br/><br/>P.S. The sets and locations were amazing... stunningly beautiful."
"griffolyon12","9","4","6","4 July 2009"," The Tragedy of John Dillinger
","Public Enemies, the latest film from director Michael Mann, is a film that is entertaining, but comes short of true greatness.<br/><br/>The film chronicles the adventures of bank robber John Dillinger in 1933. Dillinger is portrayed here by Johnny Depp with the right amount of wit and charm. As a matter of fact all of the actors in the film turn in credible performances. Though what makes this film worth seeing is for the thrills. The action in the film is exhilarating and fast paced, keeping you on the edge of your seat. Mann handles the action sequences extremely well. Only problem with the action is that the film was filmed entirely with hand-held cameras, giving it this naturalistic feel that I am not usually a big fan of; I tend to prefer the more glossy-styled film-making.<br/><br/>My biggest gripe with the film though comes with the fact that none of the characters truly have any depth to them. There are times where it looks like Mann is going to take the time and explore who the characters truly are, but he just introduces it subtly and then moves on without really harping much on it. Still this doesn't really affect the film that much, I was just expecting something a little bit more from someone of the caliber of Mann.<br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed Public Enemies. It was a tense, action packed thrill ride that was in the end quite good, but just short of genuine greatness.<br/><br/>I give Public Enemies a good 9 out of 10!"
"blindredemption","7","4","6","3 July 2009"," Different style of Crime
","Public Enemies is beautiful in ways one wouldn't have expected. It isn't flashy, it isn't shot with a clean style loaded static camera angles or slow zooms and portrait shots, no instead Public Enemies was shot almost entirely with hand-held cameras and because of that, makes you feel that you're at the table with John and the gang, or with Melvin Purvis addressing his fellow G-Men. That style choice makes Public Enemies unfold in an entirely different way. I felt like I wasn't watching characters, instead i felt I was watching real people, wonderful style choice in my honest opinion. (I can understand that hate for such a style choice though) The true surprise here wasn't Johnny Depp's unusually toned back and powerful performance or Christian Bale's quiet strong underlining supportive role, it's actually Marion Cotillard's performance, she holds so much emotion it's astounding. (a scene near the end between Marion and a G-man is almost hard to watch) Direction, performances and cinematography are all top notch, expect a handful of Oscar Consideration for this one. Wonderful film.<br/><br/>8 out of 10"
"boomerchinde","2","13","28","1 July 2009"," A Huge Disappointment
","Michael Mann is capable of directing good films, i.e., HEAT. However, Public Enemies isn't one of them. This film is overlong, and even borders on boring in several unnecessary scenes. While Depp is, as always, fine in his role, all the characters are one dimensional, and Christian Bale is so wooden even his facial expressions seem to be carved in pine. Mann's hand held camera technique, annoying enough on the small TV screen, is nauseatingly bad on the large screen. The historical inaccuracies drain the film of any believability, and the action sequences generate next to no suspense. Visually, the cinematography and art direction are quite good, but nowhere near good enough to carry the film. The finale is anti-climatic in the extreme. Ironically, the scenes of Manhattan Melodrama toward the end of the film remind the viewer how gangster movies ought to be made."

"bobrandt","1","7","13","11 July 2009"," Public Enemas
","The theme of this movie has been seen so many times before. The (almost heroic) criminal is chased by the dedicated (almost obsessive) law officer, eventually leading to the slaying of the criminal. Nothing of interest is added to the theme in this movie, actually this movie doesn't even make the bar set by previous movies in the genre.<br/><br/>It's long-winded, shallow, boring and seems to have been directed without any real sense of direction. It looks as if the camera crew got progressively more drunk/stoned - to such an extent that they obviously trashed the camera and had to buy a new one at Wal-Mart (as mentioned in another review). Seemingly the the director had a spell of schizophrenia, not being able to decide whether to make a dogme movie or not.<br/><br/>As my summary suggests, I find Public Enemies as entertaining as having an enema in public."
"conorwalsh71","7","13","29","1 July 2009"," A lot better than I expected.
","Whatever camera was used to shoot this film needs to be eliminated as an option for further film making. When I first saw the preview for this film I thought it looked very amateur due to the camera's inability to properly capture the motion of every one on screen. The movement on-screen sometimes seems blurry and closely resembles that of a camcorder, however the visual effects and the sound effects make up for it. The gunfire sounds great and it almost makes you sweat during the shootout scenes due to their intensity. Gunshot wounds and the way people's bodies react to getting shot look great as well, nothing too corny. The movie picks up quick and holds a lot of action until the last fourth of the film where it really slows down and not much really happens (shoot-out wise.)Overall this is defiantly a film worth seeing, I enjoyed it a lot and I strongly recommend it to anyone who liked The Assassination of Jesse James film."
"herbstnebel2ss","6","10","21","1 July 2009"," Drab, dreary, dismal but a cure for insomnia.
","I will concede that Michael Mann is a topnotch director, but his latest endeavor simply doesn't cut it.<br/><br/>Public Enemies comes across as a low budget bust. Considering the funding, top notch leads and well known supporting cast I expected much more.<br/><br/>The biggest problem is the sound quality and many times lack of it. During dialog scenes, it sounds like the filming is taking place in a soundproof booth, much like a soap opera without any background noise at all. During shootouts the machine guns sound like cap pistols, which really detracts from the realism. The action is so poorly choreographed that sometimes it's hard to follow the sequence of events.<br/><br/>Obviously Mann was trying for an intense drama and not an shoot 'em up. However for all the weapons to emit exactly the same sound makes one wonder where the sound effects techs got their training. <br/><br/>While watching, I fondly recalled John Milius' ""Dillinger"", with it's superb action scenes, realistic gun battles and first rate effects in spite of it's low budget. With Milius at least a BAR sounded like a BAR and not a cap gun. <br/><br/>Character development was bizarre to say the least. The FBI was portrayed as nonthinking brutes while the gangsters were all the philosophical type??? Way too much time was devoted to Dillinger waxing nostalgic about his childhood. If you want an action packed, guns blazing shoot 'em up which is even more historically accurate, rent ""Dillinger""."
"adam-603","9","31","82","13 February 2009"," Saw the preview. very interesting film...
","The film was good overall. I think it's going to be a major hit, I give Michael Mann a lot of credit. There are two scenes which are beyond belief and should not be in the movie. First of all, Johnny Depp pointlessly and senselessly beats up a guy trying to get his coat from the coat check girl who Depp is trying to pick up. This violence impresses her and she decides to go home with him, apparently getting turned on by his harming a stranger for no reason. Second, there is the F. B. I. torture of a young woman who is handcuffed to a chair and beaten up, punched, hit with a phone book, etc., and forced to urinate on herself because they will not allow her to go to the bathroom. These scenes were quite out of place in this film and reminded me of James Bond being beaten in his testicles in Casino Royale which was just disgusting and turned me off the movie which was otherwise brilliant. Torture should not be depicted in film. I sometimes even like violence in film, but not pointless and senseless violence. I think Michael Mann did much better work with Heat showing bank robberies and criminal crews working together, etc. I was sick long before the end and it also made me not get involved with the characters as I might have."
"filmaker2002","2","24","61","7 May 2009"," Saw the same Sherman Oaks Screening
","I was at the same Sherman Oaks screening and I logged in today to say exactly what the other guy thought. He took the thoughts right out of my head! I and a few other viewers had a nice conversation as we walked to our cars hitting pretty much every point that was made by the previous author. For the people that have stated that the movie is remotely watchable, I think we may have seen different films. Channing Tatum is in the film for less than a minute, so I don't understand how we are supposed to feel anything at all for him. Depps' Dillinger and Bale's Pervis are both characters with no incentives or motivation to pursue what they do. They seem to exist only because the script demands it, but there are no risks vs rewards, nothing to gain and nothing to lose. Bale's character is completely flat and uninspiring and truly wasted the gifts of a fine actor. Depp's Dillinger is, according to the movie, motivated by his love of Billie, who needs to be reassured in every conversation with him that he will never die/go to jail/leave her alone/stop loving her, etc...<br/><br/>Also, the film completely ignores the cultural impact that John Dillinger had at the time, helping shape and define the careers of many Hollywood actors including James Cagney, who always played a gangster until Dillinger was killed. He subsequently starred in the film ""The G-Men"" in which he played and FBI agent.<br/><br/>At the conclusion of the film we are shown a bunch of captions about what happened to all the central characters in the film, but we could care less, because we knew so little about them throughout the film that what happens to them later is insignificant.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the shoot out scenes were excellent and reminiscent of ""Heat"".<br/><br/>Other than that, it was a terrible film, and not worth the trouble that Nielson made us go through to watch the screener."
"evilresident097","9","6","11","3 July 2009"," Johnny Depp IS John Dillinger!
","After riding on the gravy train that was the Pirates of the Caribbean, Johnny Depp delivers his best performance yet as 1930s bank robber John Dillinger.<br/><br/>Here's the skinny: After robbing many banks during the Depression, John Dillinger(Depp) is now Public Enemy #1. FBI director J. Edgar Hoover(Billy Crudup) sets up a task force to catch Dillinger and his gang, making FBI agent Melvin Purvis(Christian Bale) its leader. Meanwhile Dillinger, aside from robbing banks and repeatedly busting out of jail, is in a relationship with Billie Frechette(Marion Cotillard). What follows are Dillinger's last days until his death.<br/><br/>What shines best is of course the lead performance by Depp. He easily makes Dillinger look like an anti-hero rather than a heartless villain. Dillinger was a hero to most of the public in the Depression, and Depp easily creates Dillinger that way as well for the audience. The film is also well scored by Elliot Goldenthal, who also did the score for director Michael Mann's 1995 crime classic Heat. The film is mostly accurate history wise, save for a few mistakes. Aside from Dillinger, there are appearances of more big-time criminals like Baby Face Nelson and Pretty Boy Floyd, played by Stephen Graham and Channing Tatum. The film also drags a little bit, but it is still an excellent crime film.<br/><br/>Overall: 9 out of 10"
"twood5376","1","17","41","3 July 2009"," Awful
","This was not what I would have expected from Michael Mann, Johnny Depp, Christian Bale, Marion Cotillard, and Billy Crudup. While I do agree with people that video is an acceptable form of film-making, it did not fit this film at all. Also this was horrible on Mann's part. The whole movie just felt cheesy and these great actors and actresses were unbelievable and not good unbelievable. I wanted to get up and walk out in the middle but I decided to wait it out and I was unimpressed. In addition to all these the story was drawn out and had loose ends. We're expected to believe a relationship between John Dillinger and Billie yet they spend little to no time together and Christian Bale's character also was not given enough time to convince me that he posed a plausible threat to Dillinger. I could not stand it when Billy Crudup had any screen time. I love Crudup as an actor, but in this movie he seem to be just reciting memorized lines and he recited them almost like a robot. I think that the weakest part was the script though. The story was loose and the characters were underdeveloped and the dialog was cheesy. Even great actors like Depp and Cotillard sounded silly. More about the HD. For me, it took away from the look of the film. It looked more like a history channel reenactment or a film student who didn't know what they were doing then a Michael Mann film. It took away from the believability of the story and the poetry of the time. I was so excited for this film, but I was terribly disappointed. I've been telling my friends not to waste their money."
"jforem1","6","27","73","25 June 2009"," Peaks and valleys of brilliance and mediocrity
","Public Enemies was about what you'd expect from a Michael Mann film, some expert camera work, fantastic shootouts early in the film, and two top billed actors working on opposite ends of the law. The shootouts and action sequences are without any further comments excellent almost across the board. <br/><br/>Unfortunately the movie really fails at figuring out what message it is trying to convey. Does the movie want us to sympathize with Dillinger or Purvis? What roll does J Edgar Hoover ultimately play in the film (played brilliantly by Billy Crudup who is fast becoming a go to actor)? <br/><br/>Characters appear and disappear, and the movie seems to have to much to say and too little time to say it. Dialogue consists of characters that speak to each other in threats until someone caves. For this movie to rise to the next level it needed characters to stand out that the audience could latch onto besides Dillinger, Purvis, and Dillinger's love interest, Billie (who is somewhat bland). Instead the cast often seemed one dimensional, and consisting of either pure confidence or pure panic.<br/><br/>A big disappointment in the film was Depp's performance which was empty. Since he is such an eccentric actor, you as an audience member expect more charisma or at least depth, which he lacked throughout. <br/><br/>On the other end of the spectrum Purvis, played by Bale, was absolutely spot on brilliant, as a law enforcement official who doesn't need to say much, but when he does officers show him respect no matter what. Unfortunately, his entire performance, and perhaps the actions of Purvis historically, are undermined at the end of the film, which I will not spoil, but I will say a very poor directorial choice was made in one frame that left me scratching my head for hours.<br/><br/>Final word: Public Enemies has a lot of good qualities such as great camera work and some really compelling action sequences, but it wants to be a combination of ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" ""Heat,"" and ""The Untouchables."" <br/><br/>It isn't as good as Bonnie and Clyde, and Depp is no Beatty, The action sequences are in the same league as Heat at times, but not quite as good, and the film juggles too many characters and therefore loses the clarity and the ultimate message of the Untouchables. I wish Public Enemies had decided early on what type of film it wanted to be, because it all of the elements of a masterpiece, but ultimately fell short.<br/><br/>2.5/4 stars. 6/10"

","WOW!! simply wow...<br/><br/>Every time I'm gonna watch a Michael Mann movie I know i'm in for a technical treat.

I agree that there are moments in this movie that shooting them in Film would have been better..but there are some techniques that are simply impossible with Film cameras... For example, in the opening scene when the guy is dragged with the car holding Dillinger's hand...what a great shot! I seriously doubt if they could have pulled that off that with film cameras...<br/><br/>The scene where they ambush Dillinger and his gang's hide house is one of the most impressive scenes I've seen lately, along with Depp walking into the police station...awesome!!<br/><br/>All of that builds up to the perfect climax of the film in and outside of the theater....my heart was pounding although I knew how it ended!!!<br/><br/>All in all, an excellent movie with some spectacular moments. WELL DONE MANN!!!"
"Michael Fargo","8","5","9","5 July 2009"," Hunter and Hunted
","The film's biggest hurdle is to distinguish itself from other genre pieces like ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" ""The Untouchables,"" even films like ""O, Brother, where art thou?"" where some of the same characters that inhabit those films also inhabit ""Public Enemies."" Unfortunately, it fails at that, but there is much to admire.<br/><br/>With a pedigree director, a distinguished (beyond belief) cast, and all the time it wants, various set pieces are riveting. Great care has been taken in developing a soundtrack that lets the audience discover what slugs of various weights of lead sound like when passing at high speed through various substances, like air, plaster, brick, stone, tree trunks, motor vehicles, etc. It's spellbinding and the sound crew should find awards at the end of the year.<br/><br/>But what's missing most is form in the screenplay. It's not that there are too many characters that we have to sort through, there are too many that we have no idea of who they are or why we're watching them. In the cast, it's Christian Bale as Melvin Purvis who makes the most impression as a man who traditionally is the hero, and has to bring an era of crime—apparently single-handedly—to an end. But his methods are the first herald of modern day criminology, and it's fascinating to see early wiretaps and case development. Billy Crudup gives us a hint at what a full portrait of J. Edgar Hoover might be like (we're overdue for a full bio film on Hoover). And the amazing Marion Cottilard is always a rare and welcome presence, but the role created for her is too trite; nevertheless, she carries just about all the weight in her scenes with Depp.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp has never been boring even if he misses the mark. But here he seems not to even be present. There's probably a reason we've never had a film about John Dillinger. While myth abounds, he was a brutal psychopath. The screenplay goes for the myth, and we're left feeling ambivalent about the people he hangs with, the choice of vocation he's made, and many people we see blown to smithereens in the course of the film all to bring him and his raiding to an end. He makes a distinction early in the film that he's not taking a customer's moneyjust the bank's. In today's perilous economic environment, it just doesn't play well.<br/><br/>The film is fully scored using some music from the period, but nothing sounds like the period. That's at odds with the detailed art direction which appears both shabby (to reflect the world of the Great Depression) and extravagant in the use of cars and art nouveau architecture from the period.<br/><br/>Any schoolboy (or possibly girl) knows the end of this story. So what the film needs to give us is some reason to care when that end comes. But I didn't. The shootout at Little Bohemia Lodge which is a prelude to ""the end"" is exciting, but we don't know who the people are running around. ""Is it Dillinger?"" Christian Bale asks. I shrugged, and muttered, ""Don't ask me."""
"deathscythe_42","8","5","9","4 July 2009"," ""I'm John Dillinger, I rob banks""
","Being a huge fan of Micheal Mann's previous bank-robber film Heat, as well as Johnny Depp and heist movies in general, I was very excited for this film. I must say in some ways I was quite satisfied, but in others I was disappointed.<br/><br/>All in all, it was an exciting film with exciting action, some very well done scenes, and great acting all-around, but it somewhat suffered in the plot and character development.<br/><br/>The movie's main character pretty much sums up the structure of this film about 20 minutes or so into it: ""I'm John Dillinger, I rob banks."" The film altogether is more or less that straight forward. Director Micheal Mann really doesn't beat around the bush. The film just kind of goes from one event to the next, without really a lot of build-up or development.<br/><br/>The action in the beginning of the movie is well directed but it moves by quickly, and doesn't really give you a lot of time to get into the scenes. However, as the film went on, I found I started to get into it much more. As John Dillinger's character started to unfold a little, I began to really get into Johnny Depp's performance. He does an excellent job as the cocky, straight-forward, cool-headed gangster. The other gangsters in his entourage are perhaps not given enough screen time or development but they are interesting characters and also well-acted, and Oscar winner Marion Coutillard is of course fantastic as Dillinger's love interest. This all begins to show more and more as the film goes on. On the other hand, Christian Bale's character as the federal agent on Dillinger's tale is a little bit dull. This may not be his fault, though, as much as the script's. His character really doesn't have a whole lot to work with but he does a good job with what he's given.<br/><br/>The middle section of the film also consists of some top-notch shootout sequences. While I had hoped for a little bit more suspense and build-up, one thing I was looking forward to in this film was a whole lot of guys blasting away at each other with tommy guns, and in that department in delivers. One thing Micheal Mann certainly knows how to direct is a good shoot-out, as well as a very good break-out scene. The action does start to lose momentum towards the end, but there are a lot of good dramatic moments throughout.<br/><br/>One thing that kind of bothered me about the film was camera work. Micheal Mann seems to use a lot of what appears to be hand-held camera, as well as a lot of very close-up shots, which in some scenes are effective, but often makes the film feel somewhat claustrophobic. I also don't feel that the period was used to it's fullest extent. This film is set in the depression era, which has a very distinctive atmosphere, which in turn has a very distinctive charm, which can often compliment a film. To me, that atmosphere and charm really didn't shine through as much as it should have. This is probably mostly due to the claustrophobic camera work. The characters are always the center of attention, never the setting. This has it's merits, as the characters are what move along the action of the film, but often times a setting is as much as a character as the people. In a depression-era film, you need to see the depression a little more distinctly. In a bank-heist film, the bank itself needs a little bit of extra attention. You rarely actually get a very good look at where you are, just who's there and what's going on. It works for moving along the plot, but it leaves you wanting just a little more. <br/><br/>All in all, this film was quite enjoyable, very well acted, and in many parts quite exciting and action-packed, but it should have been better and certainly will not be winning best picture. Still, I'm sure any fan of gangster movies or of Johnny Depp will enjoy it."

","I was really looking forward to this movie - primarily because of Depp and Mann's involvement, and, as if often the case when a movie I've anticipated finally arrives, I feared a let-down. But thankfully, this is one of those happy cases when I was pleased.<br/><br/>Depp is the foundation for this movie. His performance was incredibly convincing. Movie-goers who are familiar with his range and characterization won't be too surprised by this. When he was on-screen, I felt I was actually watching Dillinger. He stole the show, and an Oscar-nod wouldn't surprise me. Miss Cotillard also gave a fantastic and emotional performance. Bale was a little wooden - something that's far too often the case, I fear - but still convincing.<br/><br/>Mann's direction was inspired, on par with other such great films as Heat, The Insider, and Collateral. He continues to be one of the great directors of our time.<br/><br/>I know there's been some complaint about the decision to use HD digital video for the film, and while I admit it was a little distracting in places, it also gave a sense of realism to it, almost as if I were watching a documentary. Helped me to remember that what I was watching actually happened, and wasn't just fantasy.<br/><br/>In all, an impressive, enjoyable film, with an ending that left me stirred. Highly recommended."
"MovieZoo","8","5","9","3 July 2009"," Public Enemies is a friend of mine
","The name John Dillinger sends a chill down the back of people from several generations. The memory of his fame fades faster and faster. Those directly affected by his actions probably wish they could forget. Born to people who were children during his rampages, I heard the stories of adventure and crime. While the same lips would warn of the evil, bloody acts done by that horrible demon of a man, how could I not wonder while shuddering in terror, ""What made this person do these things and why?"". To this day I still wonder. There is no better explanation than the basic ""evil"". Any movie about him and his peers before today would tell you that.<br/><br/>Now comes Michael Mann with his version of a man gone wrong. I still have no pity for the man but I left the theater more satisfied after seeing a more complete movie about the destructive legend. Not only are bad guys bad, but we get to see good guys go bad. Johnny Depp was excellent as the self absorbed, money and power driven bank robbing murderer. His sneers from overconfidence were chilling and even funny when, in one scene he particularly shows his disregard for police by challenging their intellect, or in another, where his picture is glaring over the audience in a theater while he struggles not to look at the attendees' reactions. You just knew he wanted to see how people would react if they knew he was there. Great performance Mr Depp!<br/><br/>Marion Cotillard, you were even better. The smoky, glassy-eyed local girl trying to hold on to her values(perhaps) gave it all up for a wicked man who should never be lucky enough to know a woman as lovely as her. She fought off the temptation for as long as she could, but that one man was able to make her feel needed in a way no other had. Marion is the kind of actress I would like to see in any love story. Her emotional performances were classic. Myrna Loy, from the really old days, appears on the really old screen and one can instantly see the comparison in skill and beauty.<br/><br/>Christian Bale is a very intense actor. I like what he does in about everything he has done. While I have no complaint about his performance, I was caught daydreaming temporarily when his first appearance during a testimony reminded me a lot of Oliver North. Thank goodness for gangsters shooting everyone up because that's what it took to shake that image.<br/><br/>OK, so the performances were great, but there were times I had to wonder why this movie sometimes seemed to be going downhill. I am glad I stuck around because it all paid off in the end. The slowest scenes were actually sticking in mind as the story built up to a climax that I thought made a different kind of twist. While you may think you know how it ends, just knowing the ""punch-line"" is not enough.<br/><br/>This is definitely not a fast paced movie so adrenalin junkies may need to adjust a little. It is a smart movie but not Shakespeare approved. I have to call it stylized drama suited for most ages(anyone who is allowed to play violent video games). While it is not blood gushing gore, there is plenty of violence.<br/><br/>Great movie gets a great 8."
"st-shot","3","18","46","1 July 2009"," Public embarrassment.
","There is an efficient fluidity of failure in every facet of Public Enemies that astounds as it frantically uncoils with sloppy incomprehension and crass piousness over it's two and a half hours running time. <br/><br/>The John Dillinger film bio which gets recycled every 30 years (45 with Lawrence Tierney, 74 with Warren Oates) this time around has a bigger budget, bigger stars and slicker production values making the finished product with its wretched excess even more appalling. Heavy handed, master of bombast Michael Mann's (Heat, Miami Vice) bloated and ponderous style jerks rather than plods this time with cinematographer Dante Spinotti's jittery camera-work shot mostly in tight under lit close-up obliterating composition and setting throughout. <br/><br/>As Dillinger, Johnny Depp does a very impressive Elvis imitation; more lovestruck than ruthless, more thoughtful than reckless. It's an abomination. Depp may have more talent than the other Dillingers but Oates was edgier and Tierney probably would have been more at home as a member of the real gang than the Hollywood crowd he populated. Depp is too suave, noble and lovesick. Christian Bale is equally woeful as Melvin Purvis; emptily staring out from beneath a fedora most of the time, sounding like a subdued Tennessee Williams character when he does blurt something out. Marie Cotillard as main squeeze Billie looks glum throughout while Billy Crudup's mincing J. Edgar Hoover (closely and silently shadowed by agent/lover Charles Tolson) and Stephen Graham's manic Baby Face Nelson provide unintended comic relief.<br/><br/>Of course blow hard Mann's big and empty acts of self indulgence would not be complete without the self important cathedral music scores of Elliot Goldenthal. As he did most memorably in another hot air balloon Heat, Mann attempts to elevate his hardscrabble characters and situations to mythic proportions with grand flourishes of Goldenthal's vapid score. It fits like a cheap suit. This isn't knights of the round table, it's the Depression.<br/><br/>Amid all this ineptitude Mann manages to find time to be au courant (shades of Guantanamo) by shoehorning a police interrogation scene involving torture and it's ineffectiveness into the story. Typical of his clumsy and fatuous style he even takes it up a notch by having the craven inquisitor look like, you guessed it Dick Cheney. It makes one wonder if Mann needs a crane to lift his hands. <br/><br/>Public Enemies is a textbook example of arrogantly bad film-making. With it's slick and expensive look, star power and self importance it displays a blundering confidence, gutting history and making the fatal mistake to go Bonnie and Clyde (not to mention the beautifully realized doomed lover bank robber films They Drive by Night, Thieves Like Us and Gun Crazy) while ignoring the grittier more realistic possibilities on the life and death of the Twentieth Century's most infamous bank robber. It's a fatal mistake that makes Public Enemies DOA."

","Johnny Depp (in a subdued cool swagger) is Public Enemy #1, John Dillinger, in director Michael Mann's handsomely mounted but curiously distant riff on Depression Era Gangster Shenanigans. Christian Bale is Melvin Purvis, the G-man hunting down Dillinger's gang, but the cat-and-mouse game never reaches the boiling point some viewers will desire, resulting in a tepid film designed to make you think you have to admire it.<br/><br/>Lifting material from the true crime book by Bryan Burrough, the workmen-like script from Mann, Ronan Bennett and Ann Biderman tries clumsily to weave in too many secondary characters while staying on point with the historical events. There are some decent attempts to anchor the film with a love story between Dillinger and Billie Frechette (played by the French actress Marion Cotillard, who is wisely striking while the iron is hot in her first stateside role since her Oscar win), but there's not much else in the realm of character development, and no one is given any backstory. The writers start ""in media res"" to give it that classical epic structure, but it doesn't work when you can't even identify the peripheral characters from each other. What results is a cavalcade of apparently great supporting turns from a large professional cast, everyone spot on with their period cadence and mannerisms but no one leaving any kind of lasting impression in the wake of the great turns from Depp and Cotillard, the only two in the cast given anything to work with. There are also some missed opportunities to explore Dillinger's Robin Hood mentality and the public infatuation with his ""celebrity"" -- just two of the potentially great subtexts that are only given brief surface level treatments by the screenplay.<br/><br/>From a technical standpoint, there's plenty to chew on here for thoughtful audiences. Mann's use of HD video to shoot the film gives the period-piece gangster film an interesting texture. I found it refreshing to watch a Depression Era film not washed out in sepia tones and instead look crisp and fresh, with the nighttime shots especially compelling from a composition standpoint. However, there are times when in tight quarters that the digital camera-work gives the film a ""home movie"" aesthetic, and whether shooting on film or in digital, the shaky hand-held work during action scenes is always a mistake in my book. Mann also attempts to do some throwback Fritz Lang ""M""-style work on the sound design, which works well in some of the ""silent"" scenes but often results in dialogue that is hard to hear and gunshots that are clamoring. These artistic choices are highly debatable, but I admire Mann's vision to do something different with a generic story. Whether you think Mann's manipulations work or not will be left to a matter of personal taste.<br/><br/>""Public Enemies"" is a film composed of many handsome elements from the costuming to the finely detailed set designs to the soundtrack, which most notably creates a recurring theme with ""Bye, Bye, Blackbird."" There are also some good standalone scenes including a well shot rain-soaked police escorted airplane landing in Indiana, some charming movie theater moments, a thrilling nighttime shootout in the woods, and a killer Cotillard-focused coda that would've packed more of a wallop had the rest of the film added up to the sum of its parts. While it's easy to admire the work of Depp and Cotillard, Bale is off key in his attempt to add subtlety and nuance to his hollowly scripted character. Sadly, Mann's film is a good-looking but shallow exercise in self-seriousness largely due to a faulty script that never successfully identifies the heart of the story. Watching that tear run down Cotillard's cheek before the credits roll, though, you might swear you had just watched something better."

","Public Enemies reaffirms Michael Mann as one of the true auteur directors of this generation. Easily duking it out with 2004's Collateral for second place in the Mann canon, it falls short of his 1992 masterpiece Last of the Mohicans, which I hold in regard as one of the five best movies ever made.<br/><br/>While Mohicans has left Mann with very large shoes to fill, Public Enemies sees Mann return to elements which worked to perfection in the earlier film, seemingly using it as a template to re-attain past glory.<br/><br/>Based on Bryan Burrough's non-fiction book ""Public Enemies: America's Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI, 1933–34"", it tells the depression-era tale of the virtual blood feud between FBI special agent Melvin Purvis (Bale) and John Dillinger (Depp), and to a lesser extent other gangsters like Baby Face Nelson (Graham), Pretty Boy Floyd (Tatum) and Alvin ""Creepy"" Karpis (Ribisi).<br/><br/>With the exception of Nelson, Mann relegates the others to little more than filler material to illustrate the world in which Dillinger moved. Capone henchman Frank Nitti (Camp) even makes a few appearances for good measure. None of this amounts to much as it's the manhunt involving Purvis and Dillinger which takes center stage.<br/><br/>Facing mounting pressure by nascent FBI director and architect J. Edgar Hoover (Cudrup), Purvis, whose entire career is on the line, revolutionizes detective practices by calling upon the latest technological advancements (archaic by today's standards) such as wiretaps, vinyl recordings of telephone conversations, early forensics and the like to track the nation's criminal prey.<br/><br/>Depp's Dillinger is portrayed as a principled gangster who eschews robbing the common man in favor of large banks, and restrains from excess violence, unlike fellow gangster Nelson who is portrayed as an unhinged psychopath.<br/><br/>Dillinger's Achilles Heel in this story is former coat check girl Billie Frechette (Cotillard), his love who is exploited by the FBI in their quest to track the charismatic hood.<br/><br/>Under Mann's guidance, Depp is allowed to bring his full range of talents to bear in his portrayal of Dillinger, alternately showing the character's ruthlessness, gentlemanly, egalitarian, brazen and egotistical nature. It's a tour-de-force by Depp that doesn't for one second come across as an actor pulling out all the stops.<br/><br/>In keeping with the gold-standard artistic template Mann first established with Last of the Mohicans, he makes copious use of a hypnotic orchestral score by Elliot Goldenthal, which evokes strong similarities to the Randy Edelman and Trevor Jones opus that drove Mohicans. And, like many of Mann's films, the film is populated by several extended sequences with little dialog, copious violence, and entrancing orchestral music – all Mann trademarks, and all signs that you're watching a movie created by a truly talented director who knows how to deliver the perfect cinematic blend between artistry and commercialism."
"gpkalisz","1","21","57","1 July 2009"," Terrible
","I like how this movie was able to bust the top 250 movies of all time without being officially released; that really says a lot about a movie - mainly that it was rated based on its actors rather than the quality of the film over all. The hand-held camera used in the film was terrible, reducing every action scene to nothing more than shaky flashes of light, and making everything else seem like some B-side movie. It is a shame that the acting and story were ruined by some extremely bad choices on the director's part. Public Enemies could have been a great film, and it should have been, but Mann's directorial decisions didn't give it a chance to shine, nothing could have saved this movie after the way it was shot, not even two great leading roles."

"archravenstorm","8","6","12","6 July 2009"," Visceral and raw - excellent job by Mann and co.
","I loved it, as well as the 2 other women I went with - yes, we like Johnny Depp in general and are already buzzing about the planned? Dark Shadows, but even the best actors in the world can make a dog of a movie.<br/><br/>I'm not real familiar with Mann's work or what some of the fussing was about, but I think I caught on fast as to what the director was portraying, and he did it beautifully, with a raw, visceral film - you can feel the rain on your face, and feel the branches scratching you as the actors run through the woods - you can feel the cold. And a kind of building bad coming, with a terrific soundtrack to match. Yet other scenes are simply gorgeous.<br/><br/>Generally disliking romances (not all) I was very happy with the tragic, mature adult treatment of the relationship, and I enjoyed Marion Cotillard's performance. Without question Depp shone in this (I was dubious about this part for this actor) - you forget it's Depp. As an actor he seems to be so completely immersed. I thought all the performances and casting were excellent, the biggest surprise to me was Christian Bale who I have always thought of as the world's flattest and most boring leading man. Here, (especially if you have read about the real Purvis) he conveys an unassuming, dedicated, even conflicted leader with a kind of almost delicate subtlety - impressive. The jail scene between Depp and Bale was particularly good, not over-the-top testosterone but realistic.<br/><br/>Only complaints - our theater had the sound problems as well, as thought the sound would fade and get loud again - obnoxious. Some of the shots made our eyes swim into focus. Overall I would like to shake Mann's end for a fine, fine movie and it's treatment - definitely want to see again and definitely one for the DVD collection. Personally I can't understand what the complaints are about, the approach Mann took was very refreshing and drops you right into the ride. It's like reading a very good, mature, intelligently written, REALISTIC, book - settle in and enjoy, although parts are very grim there are a few laughs here and there to ease things."

","This is what happens when a talented person mistakes an instrument for a tool.<br/><br/>Cinéma vérité is back, at least for this director. Michael Mann began his career as a documentary filmmaker. He graduated to film with the excellent Thief with James Caan and then Manhunter. More recently, I think he peaked and maybe topped his other works with The Insider from 1999. In some ways, with Public Enemies, his sensibilities may have come full circle. Using the CineAlta after flirting with Viper film stream camera in Miami Vice and Collateral, allows Mann to film an inordinate amount of shots in more diverse conditions. He can do, hand-held shots to his hearts content, he can do many more setups and no longer does he need to stop to change film mags. He can shoot in any lighting conditions, or so he convinces himself. He is now shooting total documentary style. He smashes the camera right into the cheeks of his actors. Can't you feel it? It's ultra real man. <br/><br/>The characters are all well done, though it is hard to tell sometimes with the camera bouncing around like a ping pong ball. Depp is good as Dillinger, while Bale fares a little on the weak side with Purvis. Out of all the characters, I would think Stephen Lang as Charles Winstead was the most authentic and interesting. He reminds me of my uncle Sonny, now passed but who was a bounty hunter and federal marshal. He was from the same area of north Texas/southern Oklahoma like the real Winstead. Lang's body language and manor are beyond authentic. He is dead on.<br/><br/>The film takes us places we've already been and shows us things we've already seen a million times before. The close calls Dillinger makes through the film are bright spots, but not nearly enough in a story that seems all too familiar. But again, Michael Mann was really trying to give us a documentary.<br/><br/>The problem is, Public Enemies is not a documentary. Though it was filmed in a faux- guerilla style with a digital hand-held half the time. There were no digital hand-held cameras in the 1930s, and the effect just pulls you right out of the movie. So again, this is no documentary, as there are actors and sets. There are props and special effects and computer generated blood. There are huge historical liberties taken with the script. And I have rarely seen any documentary where they barrage the viewer with 2 and a half hours of hand-held camera work. In fact, most documentary filmmakers are careful to show you things in a very direct and succinct way. <br/><br/>The audio sounded like it was recorded in a shoebox. The film score appears as if there is another movie playing in the background. And aside from being aesthetically uninteresting, problematic with motion work, having inconsistent color tones, and images which over-sharpened in post processing, the Cinealta camera has given Michael Mann the ability to shoot anything he likes at the moment. And this is the biggest of all the film's problems. Shaking the camera is not representative of reality. All those old cars and fancy hats don't do the trick. The film does not feel realistic, it feels as if there is a real lack of vision. Limitations in any medium are what focuses your abilities to create. Adversity breeds creativity, what you are left with after this process, is called vision. The lack of restraints in shooting method have left this film feeling haphazard and unfocused. <br/><br/>In short, I liked this film a lot more the last time I saw it when it was called Heat.<br/><br/>Also based somewhat on real characters and events, Heat was an epic film. And though overlong, tells an all too familiar story of these bank robbers and their dance with fate. It is still a beautiful work and shows no lack of vision.<br/><br/>Public Enemies is by no means a bad film. And technically since it was not shot on film, it can't be called one maybe. Like George Lucas and his techno toy Star Wars prequels, I think Public Enemies is a technical exercise from a person more interested in working with a new tool, rather than making music with a new instrument."

","The book spent so much effort describing the confluence of events during that specific period of time, it was a great read. To make a movie about it, and leave out so much as well as make it inaccurate it very disappointing.<br/><br/>Purvis did not kill any of the major characters and was only present during the shooting of Dillinger. Why not have him shoot Hitler in the bunker too. I understand that sometimes you have to change events to help with the story telling, however, if I were a member of Sam Cowley's family, I'd be pretty angry... Adding the story line of Bonnie and Clyde to contradict their hero status from the 1967 movie and peg them as the animals they really were Plus the Little Bohemia was an FBI failure, not success Hoover's lying to characterize Ma Barker as a criminal mastermind What a let down."

","This movie really had nothing to offer but an attempt to glorify a murderer and thief. Not really knowing much about American criminal history I was none the wiser by the end of this film (which seemed like an eternity to get to).<br/><br/>I don't know if it was the poor dialogue but Johnny Depp and Christian Bale both failed to deliver believable performances. They were both stale and monotone and did nothing to justify their massive pay cheques. Going through Depp's filmography it can be seen that he is most at home playing quirky characters that require a total transformation of his appearance. It is hard to take his teenage looks seriously in this movie and therefore seems totally miscast. (sorry to all the teenage die-hard Depp fans!). Bale once again did Bale, no further comments necessary.<br/><br/>Despite the sets being excellent the editing was very poor which included many quick shots of minor gestures and movements which disrupted the flow of the film. The cinematography was generally good but inconsistent.<br/><br/>To anyone contemplating this film move on to something else and save your time and money.

"mp697","6","4","7","10 August 2009"," A surprising masterpiece
","Michael Mann is, regardless of personal opinion, one of the greatest directors ever when it comes to action films. His notion of pace, narrative, and perspective are top notch, and Heat, Miami Vice prove this without a doubt. Now, Public enemies, his greatest film since Heat, comes to prove something that the pacino/deniro confrontation had left in the air: his subtle but certain analysis of the idea of the ""hero"" versus the ""anti-hero"". Let's be clear: Mann creates tough, aggressive, larger than life characters, but, at the same times, gives them a great sense of humanity. But let's focus on the film: Public enemies is a precious work of art, a fast-paced, epic movie not only about Dillinger, but also about the other great robbers of its time (the so called ""public enemies"", that gave origin to the film's name) and the clash between them and the law (represented, mainly, by Christopher Nolan's character). The result is a gangster movie, with a powerful love story fueling the narrative into a very compelling and powerful outcome. Deep's performance is simply off the charts, Oscar worthy, and his supporting cast is exceptional (Marion Cotillard and Nolan being the best proof of that). That, along with remarkable action sequences, extraordinary shootouts, brilliant photography, original ambiance, and masterful directing, makes Public enemies the best movie of the year so far. If you liked Heat, you'll love this. If you didn't, go see it anyway: it's just a brilliant piece of cinema. Not everyone will like it, but if you allow yourself to be taken in by the story, you'll probably love it. All in all, a masterpiece of modern cinema."

One of the reasons that made me see the movie is that i am a big fan of Johnny Depp and Christian Bale but what really surprise me was the performance Marion Cotillard as Billie Frechette it was really amazing. The movie itself i think it was great, a really nice crime and drama story. John Dillinger is a man who lives is life assaulting banks and what make him the best is that is really smart and even when he gets caught and arrested he finds a way of breaking out. In all the most movies with crime story's there's a very smart detective that tries to catch the criminal, in Public Enemies the man is Melvin Purvis and he his the detective that is trying to catch John Dillinger and he is very good to, he uses many tactics to catch the criminal John Dillinger like trying to use John Dillingér's girl Billie Frechette as bait. Billie Frechette is the girl that John Dillinger falls in the love.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed Public enemies and if you like a good movie with action and an interesting story you need to see this.<br/><br/>My Rating 9/10"
"quikbdr720","7","4","7","2 July 2009"," Not quite as hot as Heat, but its a warm addition to crime dramas
","Entering this movie, I wasn't sure if I should expect what the trailers depicted, a riveting action yarn similar to Mann's Collateral, or a crime drama similar to Mann's other baby Heat. Turns out, there's a good chunk of both, it is definitely a Michael Mann film, and Definitely a Johnny Depp film.<br/><br/>The opening to the first 45 or so minutes kept you intrigued at times but left out at times, there were times where you just can't tell which gangster is which (save Red Hamilton and Dillinger). The greatest flaw if this film is the lack of character depth, again, save the friendship between Dillinger and Red which had the depth needed to carry the film.<br/><br/>There are shootouts abound, the film very closely and accurately (save one mishap, ready the trivia and you'll find out) portrays the Dillinger saga. However, again, I was disappointed in the chemistry between Dillinger and Billie and the romance that budded in real life but not so much in the film.<br/><br/>I'm still confused in my total take of this film. It was very hyped up, considering the lead roles and director, but somewhere along the lines, it just fell flat in regards to its hype. Depp was outstanding in his role, and I quite honestly feel that there should be a Best Actor nod his way at next years Academy Awards. Billy Crudup definitely turned in a great performance as J Edgar Hoover as he continues to prove himself as a rising Hollywood star. Christian Bale (one of my favorite actors BTW) was a couple steps up from his performance in Terminator Salvation, but he just wasn't great, he was very monotone in all of his dialog (wheter Pervis was actually like that, everyone has a personality, and Bale's performance lacked any personality what-so-ever), and Cotillard wasn't effective as ""Dillinger's Girl"" either, not enough screen time with Depp, no back story, which was too bad because when she was on screen she turned on the drama, so maybe you can blame the script for excluding her.<br/><br/>Great accurate story line (minus leaving out any build up around Dillinger's gang), great cinematography, great camera work, great action sequences, excellent depiction of the 1930's. Visually this film was a 9/10<br/><br/>Great supporting cast but they all lacked any depth, little screen time for many rising stars of today, Johnny Depp, although not eccentric, turned in a charged Oscar Nominated worth performance which adds this film to his top performances, Mann definitely was behind the camera, and if you are a Michael Mann fan, you will enjoy the look and feel of the film, but may get antsy in your seat after 2 hours and wish there was more dramatic elements. performances 6/10"
"mmmrocks","5","26","75","12 February 2009"," Muddled story
","I just saw an early-screening of Public Enemies. Hopefully they can save this movie before it is released. Dillinger's love interest, Billie, was a distracting addition to a movie that is already too long. The overall focus of the film is confused and in the end runs long. The love sub-plot feels very tacked on and could be removed from the film, helping refocus the story on Dillinger and the FBI.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp does a good job and outshines the rest of the cast. They really try to make him seem like a good guy that would do anything to save his friends, but it is all talk...not very believable from his actions. Christian Bale is good, but his part is weak. His character is more of a bystander and mostly forgettable.<br/><br/>The action sequences were good for the most part, and the film could be saved if they stick to those scenes and forget about the non-existent love story."
"zardoz-13","10","7","15","5 July 2009"," Michael Mann's ""Public Enemies"" is Untouchable!
","""Miami Vice"" creator Michael Mann recreates the Golden Age of Bank Robbery during the Great Depression in 1933 with his latest thriller ""Public Enemies"" and gangsters riddle the screen with gunfire galore. This depiction of the rise to prominence of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the demise of John Dillinger is based on bestseller author Bryan Burrough's non-fiction book. ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" superstar Johnny Depp is cast against type as Dillinger, the sympathetic Robin Hood style desperado who acquired notoriety as 'Public Enemy No. 1.' ""Batman Begins"" sensation Christian Bale impersonates the soft-spoken FBI Special Agent Melvin Purvis who brought Dillinger down. Although they drive vintage automobiles, blast away with vintage Thompson .45 caliber submachine guns, and wear vintage apparel, the characters in ""Public Enemies"" prove to be just as enthralling as any of Mann's characters in his contemporary movies. Unfortunately, Mann doesn't always hit the bullseye for historical accuracy. Many of the events are reversed. For example, Pretty Boy Floyd died after John Dillinger and Melvin Purvis did not shoot him with a high-powered rifle. Similarly, Baby Face Nelson did not died before John Dillinger, but he perished long afterward. Moviegoers will cherish historical accuracy are in for several more surprises, but then ""Public Enemie"" is just a movie. Suffice to say, anybody who has read anything about Dillinger will not be surprised at anything that happens in this biographical epic.<br/><br/>""Public Enemies"" opens with an interesting shoot-out at the Indiana State Penitentiary with a manacled John Dillinger getting escorted into the grim looking prison. This is the first of several surprises that occur for people who don't know much about 'Johnny' Dillinger. Afterward, Dillinger and his gang arrive in East Chicago where they have bribed the local constabulary to ignore them. They also receive some favors from the local bookmakers that operate a coast-to-coast wire service link-up that relates to gambling on horse races. Mann shows Dillinger robbing banks and playing 'spin the dial' with bank presidents. Dillinger has men stationed out in front of the banks as inconspicuous sentinels with weapons concealed under their coats. Dillinger's closest associate Red (Jason Clarke of ""Death Race"") keeps the stopwatch running and knows when to wheel up to the front of the bank. Dillinger doesn't take money from any of the common folk in the bank. He steals only from the banks and then he takes hostages for a ride with him to ensure that the local authorities don't open fire on him when his gang cruises out of town.<br/><br/>All of this publicity aggravates FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover (Bill Crudup of ""Watchmen"" in an awesome look-alike performance) and he assigns Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale of ""Terminator: Salvation"") to manage the Chicago Office with orders to capture Dillinger. Purvis' shooting of legendary bank robber Charles 'Pretty Boy' Floyd (Channing Tatum of ""Step Up"") in an orchard is what brought him to J. Edgar's attention. Purvis doesn't take long to realize that Hoover's smart young men aren't adequate for the task, and he requests help from the Dallas FBI Office. Several tough-looking, no-nonsense customers show up in Chicago who look like they were born with badges. Charles Winstead (Stephen Lang of ""Tombstone"") and his cohorts stand out from the young, buttoned down types that surround Purvis. The FBI relies on telephone wiretaps and scientific analysis to monitor the Dillinger gang. When they cannot catch the gangsters squawking on the phone, they resort to more brutal methods, such as delaying medical treatment to a wounded bank robber to learn the whereabouts of the gangsters.<br/><br/>Dillinger picks up coat check girl Evelyn 'Billie' Frechette (Oscar winning Parisian actress Marion Cotillard of ""La Vie en Rose"") and cannot get her out of his system even when she walks off and leaves him after their initial encounter. Dillinger pledges himself to her, but she warns him that she doesn't want to watch him die. Things take a turn for the couple when Dillinger is captured in Tucson, Arizona, as Frechette and he are about to take a bath together and the authorities fly him back to Indiana. Dillinger's escape from Indiana is a part of criminal history. He wielded a fake wooden gun and bluffed his way out of jail. Later, he hooks up with Baby Face Nelson (Stephen Graham of ""Gangs of New York"") to knock over a ripe bank in Sioux Falls with $800-thousand in its vault. Everything backfires on Dillinger and Nelson. They lug off barely $30-grand and then Purvis and his men surround the inn where the gang has taken refuge and a major firefight erupts with several gangsters dying in a blaze of gunfire.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp bears a closer resemblance to John Dillinger than Christian Bale does to Melvin Purvis. Bale is actually taller than Purvis. Dillinger was idolized by many during the Depression and he strove to stay in the limelight so that the common people would harbor him when he was on the lam. According to Mann's version of history, Dillinger fell not only because of the persistence of Melvin Purvis and the FBI, but also because Dillinger brought too much heat onto his fellow criminals in the coast-to-coast racing rackets after Congress passed legislation against interstate crime. The cast is first-rate throughout ""Public Enemies."" Mind you, ""Public Enemies"" doesn't lionize Dillinger to the outlandish degree that director Arthur Penn did rural desperadoes Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker in ""Bonnie & Clyde,"" but we get glimpses of Dillinger's celebrity status when the Feds fly him back to Indiana.<br/><br/>""Public Enemies"" ranks as the best gangster picture since Brian de Palma's ""The Untouchables."" The shoot-outs are noisy but relatively bloodless, though there is an interrogation scene where a detective roughs up a woman. Incidentally, many of the scenes were lensed on the actual locations where this story transpired."
"Robert_duder","9","5","10","23 August 2009"," Historical? Not much. An amazing shoot em up gangster pic to entertain? Bullseye!!
","I wasn't sure how to take Public Enemies from trailers and from critics opinions. On the way hand was this a historical film about a real character and his life and death along the lines of a biography or was this simply an action flick, a Johnny Depp vehicle that simply pulls from history to make an entertaining mainstream movie that is meant to get your blood pumping. Public Enemies is absolutely the latter. So much is being said about the historical accuracy of the film and who cares? I didn't go see this film to learn the true story of John Dillinger, I went to be entertained and this film delivered on so many levels. The drama was heavy, the acting well performed and the shoot outs and action scenes were just incredible. The film also held nothing back from being a gritty and intensely violent film which means it holds it's own in the gangster/mob genre of films. Best of all no one character was held above the character of John Dillinger because he is the focus of the film. Also perhaps some or most of the film is not historically accurate but in reading a little bit about Dillinger and that time period some of it most definitely is including the bloody climax which was filmed in the actual location of Dillinger's death.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is perhaps one of the most versatile actors in Hollywood from Willy Wonka, to Captain Jack and now to John Dillinger. His suave appearance and screen charisma is perfect for this role. He carries the film with his usual ease and makes the character come to life in brilliant clarity. Award worthy perhaps? A real surprise in this film was the ever present Christian Bale who I am not an enormous fan of. Bale is not only tolerable but he is not overused and actually gives a good solid performance as Melvin Purvis, Dillinger's number one pursuer. I thought for sure Bale would try his utmost to outshine Depp and they would fight for screen time and ego but Bale takes a back seat with ease and turns in a solid supporting role! And he barely growls which automatically gives him points. There is a large and significant supporting cast including Channing Tatum in a decent role as Pretty Boy Floyd and who also gets the opportunity to star in one of the best death scenes I've ever seen in movies. However, no one person from the supporting cast stands out above the two Hollywood heavyweights Bale and Depp.<br/><br/>Director Michael Mann needed this film for my books because after what was hands down one of the worst films I've ever seen Miami Vice he needed redemption and this was definitely it. Mann is one of those directors that thinks he has this ultimate artistic style and he has to make everything with this sporadic and chaotic filming and fortunately he played that down for Public Enemies to give the film the proper 1930's feel. Although certainly he got his style during the gun battles. Sometimes the style works and sometimes it doesn't. He tells a great story and no matter what one thinks of Michael Mann he knows gritty and it works for this movie to the max. Action, suspense, romance, history, gun fights and mobsters...if any of these things appeal to you then you must see this movie. I didn't know what to expect and you might not either but you will be blown away. This is one summer blockbuster that was a genuine and welcome surprise. 9/10"
"MovieFanGuyy","10","5","10","14 July 2009"," Public Enemies is my favorite film of summer 2009 so far!
","Michael Mann's Public Enemies can be best described as The Untouchables meets his 1995 hit Heat. Johnny Depp, back in serious mode, plays notorious 1930's bank robber, John Dillinger who leads his gang of bank robbers, known as the ""public enemies"" robbing banks all over the country. He steals money from the banks and gives it to the little guy. On the other side of the law is Melvin Pervis, FBI agent, played very well by Christian Bale in a nice return to dramatic form after starring in one of the biggest action films of all time.<br/><br/>And in the best role of the film, recent Oscar winner, Marion Cotillard, plays Dillinger's loyal girlfriend, Billie Frechette. The film spans several years, involves the capture and escape by Dillinger in a maximum security prison, only to have the FBI led by Hoover, assign Pervis to bring in ""public enemy #1"" John Dillinger.<br/><br/>As a fan of gangster movies, this one is near the best filled with terrific acting, great dialog, and top notch directing by Michael Mann. Depp, Bale, and Cotilliard all stand out in their roles, and, even minor characters such as Pretty Boy Floyd are allowed to stand out. Heck, even famous gangsters like Frank Nitti show up in Chicago. All in all, a tragic ending to one of this country's most famous bank robbers, and easily the best film by Michael Mann since his 1995 Heat. Despite the mild reception from some critics, this is my pick of the best film of the summer so far. <br/><br/>I'll be laughed at by some for saying this, but I really feel that with the academy now picking 10 nominations for best picture, Public Enemies should be one of them!<br/><br/>Three and a half stars out of four! A must see!"
"Simon_Says_Movies","7","5","10","7 July 2009"," Sombre drama and brutal violence
","Micheal Mann's Public Enemies is a film of sombre drama and explosive violence, adrenaline highs and sobering death; a battle of the righteous and the villainous. Combining his love for gangster films and that of period dramas, Mann lets his passion and skill do all the talking in this vividly photographed and exceptionally acted endeavor. Public Enemies is a wide open window into the final months of notorious bank robber John Dillinger, not an origin story, nor truly a biopic. Instead of attempting to cover every aspect of Dillinger's life, or deeply exploring his psychological motivations it is just about a man in the moment and through this attempt we learn, and connect about the famous outlaw anyways.<br/><br/>More than a quote 'gangster film', Public Enemies is more a human drama that happens to feature gangsters. Then from these sequences of charm and humanity erupts brutal violence and often soulless murder. The gunfights are thunderous, the Tommy guns spouting deafening fire, followed by crushing impacts as the rounds strike everything in their wake. While an effective drama in many ways, the shootout sequences are arguable the most memorable, as never before have I felt like I actually needed to dive for cover in a movie theatre. Ground zero for the violence is the post-Capone, mob ruled Chicago and combining forces to stop the likes of Dillinger (Jonny Depp) and Baby Face Nelson (Stephen Graham) is the founder of the FBI, J Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup) and lawman Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale). With robbers make a mockery of the justice system Hoover unleashes Purvis and his team to control the situation and quell the growing wave of violence. On the other side of the law however, Dillinger is planning his big score and his eventually retirement down south with his gal Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard) and the battle of wits and bullets between the righteous agent and the slick crook begins.<br/><br/>Depp is very solid as Dillinger, oozing a cool swagger with playboy charms. He is cocky and while not truly in it for the money loves the celebrity and notoriety that goes along with his brazen robberies. Not the same can be said for Nelson who is like oil to Dillinger's icy coolness; trigger happy and greedy. Bale's character is one we have seen many times before, yet for the life of me I cannot figure out why I found Purvis to be so compelling and unique. Perhaps that is just more of Mann's charm shining through his characters. Fresh off her Oscar win Cotillard is lovely in a classic sense and her characters arc makes her all the more fiery and attractive. Aside from the leads, the supporting gangsters are recognizable but not big name stars and this works quite well. One of my favourite of such appearances is Steven Doriff who, if possible, looks even more menacing and greasy in a pinstripe suit and fedora.<br/><br/>Public Enemies is long, but never seems plodding. A so-so opening act succeeds to compelling human drama which is further progressed by the heart pounding action. While true brilliance may have alluded Mann due to the odd pacing issue and really offering nothing masterfully unique, this flick is one that fully immerses you in the time and shows us of a time of when celebrity did not always mean Hollywood, and endings were not always storybook.<br/><br/>Read all my reviews at: simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com"
"yallknowho","9","5","10","1 July 2009"," Mann redeems himself
","Wow. Michael Mann completely redeems himself with this movie after Miami Vice fell short of expectations. This movie is right up there with Heat which is my top 5 all time.<br/><br/>The movie takes some artistic freedom in telling the story. here is the plot: The movie picks up when Dillinger finishes up a 9 year stint for burglary and busts his friends out of jail. They have a lot of time to make up so they start robbing banks right away. The movie doesn't explain anything, it just drops you into right Dillinger's crew as they begin taking scores. Soon J Edgar Hoover and his boy Melvin Purvis have made the gang and are just a couple steps behind. Dillinger picks up a girlfriend along the way, getting busted in Florida, escaping from jail, eventually hooking up with Baby Face Nelson's gang, getting injured while robbing a bank, getting into a shootout in a cabin safe house, then trying to lay low only to get ratted on by a hooker, ultimately leading to his demise.<br/><br/>The Good: Johnny Depp is fantastic as Dillinger. They couldn't have cast a better actor. Leonardo DiCaprio was originally going to play him when DiCaprio's studio was going to do the film, but I'm glad that didn't pop off. Depp is on point and plays the heist man to perfection. Tommy from snatch plays a great Baby Face Nelson. Dillinger's crew is also very good. The shootouts are great, cars, clothes all the style Mann pays attention to is all there. Marion Cotillard is very good as Dillinger's girlfriend, and there's a scene where she gets smacked around in a police station that makes your blood boil. Billy Cudrup as J Edgar Hoover is really good too. The story is great. Even though Mann takes some artistic freedom in telling the story it flows very well. You are definitely rooting for Dillinger throughout the film. I was very moved in the end, got choked up and almost lost it. It's very unusual for a movie to do that to me.<br/><br/>The Bad: Christian Bale is turning out to be a one dimensional actor. he just doesn't have the range we thought he had when he was coming up. They should have cast Ed Norton if they wanted someone to play Melvin Purvis the right way. Bale pays more attention to getting his accent right than playing a convincing human being. On the contrary, Melvin Purvis is definitely the antagonist in this film so maybe Bale's wooden lifeless portrayal is good in making us like Dillinger. Maybe Purvis really acted the way Bale portrayed him, but his performance was the weakest link of the film.<br/><br/>The Ugly: Enough with the HD already, Mann. During the shootout in the woods the HD makes the footage blurry and annoying. HD is great in some circumstances, but regular film is definitely superior in many aspects."
"pjdoughnut","9","6","13","3 July 2009"," If your a Michael Mann Fan you ll love it.
","I went into this movie with a clear expectation that I was going to love every minute of it. I am a big Michael Mann fan and also love Johnny Depp and Christian Bale ( although after Terminator Salvation I must admit Bale has sunk a little in my estimation) There was just a slightly lingering doubt due to the fact that his last movie, Miami Vice was well pants. Plus I did think that to make a Gangster movie that actually can stand toe to toe with the best IE Goodfellas Godfether etc is more and more difficult. Yet to my surprise Public Enemies within about 10 minutes had me convinced. <br/><br/>The opening scene was visceral and packed with energy, reminding me of what it was first likewatching the shoot out in Heat and it showed without a doubt that this was Michael Mann back at the top of his game. The sound the editing the look of the film, it is obvious that he has spent hours honing this film until it dazzles. <br/><br/>Story wise Public Enemies is what you expect, there are no real twists and despite the title it really is only about one public enemy, John Dilinger portrayed amazingly and subtly by Johnny Depp. This is not as you may expect a Heat style two hander, Purvis, the character played by Bale is really there to show how Dilinger was ultimately brought down and to act as a foil to Dilinger. Whereas Dilinger shows his humanity creep through almost from the off,holding onto a dying comrade as they make their getaway, Purvis seems cold and detached arresting Pretty Boy Floyd and reading him his rights whilst he is dying, stomach exposed bleeding everywhere.<br/><br/>The most amazing aspect of Public Enemies for me was simply the way it was shot. This was no stylised film noir style this was realistic and gritty as if someone with a digital camera had travelled back to 1933 and shot what they saw. This is what is the key to its success and the reason why I think it deserves a mention alomg with the greatest classics of the genre. This approach makes the film seem real and new. Even though the audience can see from a mile away where this film is going almost from the off it still managed to enthrall and draw me in. Indeed this is the point- the film itself reminds me of what Sergio Leone said about Once Upon A Time in The West- that it was meant to resemble the last dying breaths of a person. This is what Public Enemies is - one long dying breath for Dilinger. But as good as Bale and Depp are the real heart of the movie belongs to Marion Collitard as Billy Frechette. She has a great classical beauty and her romance with Depp is both beautiful and sad. <br/><br/>Critics may scoff at the use of hand held camera, the lack of characterisation but this is Michael Mann and it is all as part of his style and the way he works as a film maker. People who complain about the hand held thing may think to remember that it was Micheal Mann himself who pretty much pioneered this technique back in Heat and it made for the first really explosive and realistic shootout in recent memory - a similar scene in Public Enemies reminds us that Mann is still the daddy when it comes to this stuff despite many imitators.<br/><br/>What is most significant about Mann though is that what he leaves out is as important as what he puts in. Mann paints characters as enigmas leaving the audience to draw their own conclusions. The dialogue is minimal and I love this about Mann- every word counts. There is no clumsy expositional dialogue, nothing to inform us about the characters backstory. When Collitard is swept away by Depp from her job working in a cloak room and she tells him she knows nothing about him he sums up his character is three seconds flat- ""I like baseball, movies, good clothes, fast cars... and you"" what more do you need to know?<br/><br/>Much of the character is expressed through imagery rather than dialogue . The ending sequence with Depp watching a Clark Gable movie gives you as many clues to his character and what made him tick as any book or documentary could . But hear""s the rub, you have to actually use your brain with this film. This is no sit down and turn your brain off movie, quite the opposite. Anyone willing to give it a go though is likely to find themselves rewarded. <br/><br/>The only reason it gets a nine is like Miami Vice before it, the middle section is just a tad too slow moving and my attention did start to wander a little, however once the tommy guns start blaring in the trademark shoot out I was sucked back in once again.<br/><br/>I think anyone who is a Michael Mann fan or wants to watch a film that does nt substitute plot and character for effects will enjoy this film. I found it a pleasant antidote to the rest of the summer s releases."
"way2grimee","9","7","16","2 July 2009"," Michael Mann is back!
","Firstly, let me say, that I have given up all trust and faith in film reviews. How 'The Times' could rate this 2 out of 5 I have no idea. Metacritic averages around 50% I think for this title, highly variable opinions. But then again, how could I place my trust in the judgement of yuppie journalists with nothing better to do than slag off the works of others.<br/><br/>Anyway, on with my review! Minus the shoddy cinematography towards the start of the film, and some poorly captured dialogue (sound-wise), this film is up there with the all-time greats! Johnny Depp delivers a stellar performance as always, the man exudes charisma and really does a great job at portraying John Dillinger as a lovable rogue rather than a cold blooded villain, in fact he's almost one of the good guys when compared to the character of baby-face nelson, brilliantly portrayed by Stephen Graham (Tommy from Snatch). Even Marion Cottillard plays her role to the tee, superb. Most Gangster's chicks drive me nuts (Penelope Cruz in Blow, I wanted to slap her!) but Dillingers girl was a real babe, down to ride in any situation! And she never sold him out, not once! The film does away with the classic rise and fall formula and focuses more on 'the fall'. The pace is relentless and bullets in abundance. I really enjoyed it throughout. If anything, I'm a big fan of Christian Bale, but his character seemed to lack something, he had a certain emptiness about him, but then again I think this was intentionally done.<br/><br/>Some of the cinematography seemed quite shoddy at the beginning of the film but this soon went away, whether I was so engrossed that I no longer noticed it or whether Mann had simply 'found his mojo'? I don't know, but its really not bad enough to justify the poor reviews I have seen. Some people clearly don't like these sorts of movies, I wouldn't write a review on something like 'Gone With The Wind' because that is clearly not my thing.<br/><br/>John Dillinger says ""I like baseball, good clothes, fast cars and you."" Well I like all that and Gangster films so this was right up my street. Ladies and gentleman, if you want to see a heart thumping gangster flick with the pace of a fighter jet and more bullets than the u.s army, this is for you. If not then go watch something pretentious, but don't go slagging this off with your yuppie articles in your local paper because I'm sick of reading them.<br/><br/>If you took a hardcore football fan to the opera or ballet, you wouldn't expect a glowing review of his experience would you? So why on earth are upper class yuppie journalists who much prefer the latest pretentious low budget love flick to come out of Cannes attempting to pass judgement on a big budget gangster flick of this caliber?! I'm so riled up right now, I'm sure the real John Dillinger would have loved Public Enemies and so did I! It may have received good press but I never thought much of Collateral anyway, so well done Michael Mann!"

The background ambiance was overpowering to the point of annoying and the gun shots were deafening. Micheal Mann is not my style of director and I dislike his writing. So why do you ask , did I set through this movie? Johnny Depp is why. I find him fascinating to watch and love his acting and delivery. But even Johnny couldn't bring life to this script. A decided lack of character development and to many characters overwhelmed the screen many times so it was difficult to determine who was who in some cases. I will not recommend this film."

"richard-diggins","5","3","5","21 December 2009"," A slickly recreated documentary with little substance
","I agree that Mann succeeded in showing a great ""visual story"" but this movie offered me little else. <br/><br/>As noted, Bale's portrayal of Purvis is perfunctory and Depp had few moments in which to dazzle us with character development through words and voice - other than when he was in jail speaking to his captors. Others might disagree claiming that less is more.<br/><br/>I think the writers should have taken more creative licence to create dialogue that would have allowed his principles to shine. I see this film as a slickly recreated documentary of Dillinger's life: a marginal movie that draws interest from branded stars, great set design, costume and historical accuracy. <br/><br/>Mann does illustrate the pop status of Dillinger - a 1930s Robin Hood, so to speak - but I'll be curious to see if the movie wins any Oscar's other than best sound or cinematography, or some other 'craft' award."
"winner55","2","3","5","31 October 2009"," May be greatest misfire in cinematic history - certainly for a gangster film.
","I like Michael Mann, and I like gangster movies; but the trailers on this were not inviting - flashy, slick, without a lot of tension. So I waited 'till the film got to the bargain theater. My pre-viewing apprehension proved to be spot on.<br/><br/>While there are a number of really fine set-pieces here, I haven't seen a film so utterly lacking in focus or theme in a long time. The bare story of the real John Dillinger is strong enough to carry the viewer of the film, but did the audience not know at least something of that story, it would be hard to follow story here, it goes all over the place. And I am shocked that we get to know so few of the characters here - it takes a while to recognize one G-Man from another, even after they have become important to the narrative (such as it is).<br/><br/>It's hard to figure out why Mann decided to go wild with the historical inaccuracy; I'll mention one I found most annoying, first because it is a seemingly small matter, but it also reflects two larger problems. I'm referring to the repeated use of Billie Holiday on the soundtrack - she's even on the radio whenever Dillinger turns it on - unfortunately, she wasn't known during the early Thirties, she was just starting out! It's clear someone wants to make a point by playing her that often - but I haven't got the foggiest idea what it is? Is Dillinger supposed to be a 'black white man' like they say of Bill Clinton? Is his career a foreshadow of Hollidays's? Couldn't they find any other period music to play? Which remarks the soundtrack itself, which is one of the worst in a major motion picture in recent years - it's a mess, evoking a dozen different emotions, almost none having anything to do with the images we're watching at the moment.<br/><br/>The dialog is needlessly pretentious. One thing I feared was having to compare this film to John Milius' ""Dillinger"" with Warren Oates - but the comparison can't be avoided. Milius, taking his cue from ""Bonnie And Clyde,"" from the earlier Lawrence Tierney film ""Dillinger,"" and from the gaudy gangster films of Roger Corman, fashioned a film that was both flashy yet homespun, part unabashed B-movie, part evocation of American Gothic. Milius' film is by far the better of the two. Even his occasional tinkering with historical accuracy could be forgiven, since it was clear he had a firm grasp on what the Dillinger phenomenon was really all about - 'farm boy makes good by turning bad' is an undeniable folk-theme of American life.<br/><br/>But Mann clearly - and desperately - wants Dillinger to be a real hero, not only of his time but ours. This is the most romanticized version of Dillinger - of any American outlaw - I've ever seen, making the many cinematic apologies for Jesse James seem like harsh condemnations by comparison. But it can't be done. The brilliance of Warren Oates' performance in the Milius film is that Oates plays Dillinger like a runaway farm-boy with a sense of humor and a quick temper, who just happened to rob banks for a living. That's as much as you can give any professional criminal without lying about the nature of crime namely, it's about stealing other peoples' money and hurting many of them in the process. The cowardly punk Dillinger as performed by Lawrence Tierney is probably even closer to the truth. But the sum of all this is not simply that Mann has romanticized Dillinger; that, in a B-movie at least, could have been forgiven. The real problem is that he sentimentalizes the bandit. This turns the whole shenanigans soft like mush, instead of the hard-boiled crime film we should have gotten.<br/><br/>And this leads into one of the worst finales in film history, dragging on and on, and even after we know the story is done - it still goes on, trying to turn itself into a tear-jerker! What a waste! <br/><br/>And what a disappointment from Michael Mann. And don't blame the actors, as some critics have done - they're actually trying to do a good job - but the script is poor, and Mann can't think of any way to direct it properly."

I don't mind movies with a lot of talking, if there is a good story to support that. But there is none.<br/><br/>I actually had the strong urge to get up and leave..for a cigarette break or simply to go home. I left the movie with two basic conclusions: 1. I fell asleep right towards the end and I have no intension of finding out how it ended if it is in any form costing me money or time (like renting it). 2.

","I really love that playing a normal person is finally a novel enough prospect to attract Johnny Depp. I thoroughly enjoyed his performance. The story was well written, moved quickly and kept my interest throughout the film.<br/><br/>My only complaint, (and it's enough that I deducted two points for it in my vote), was the cinematography. I suppose it was an effort to capture the flavor of the early 1930's in which the story takes place, but the camera was shaken so much and so frequently that I actually wound up looking away part of the time because it was too hard to focus and it became unpleasant. This is not a good sign when the whole purpose of watching a movie is exactly that - to WATCH.<br/><br/>Low lighting and a fuzzy camera were also used for the same purpose. These were quite effective in my opinion and didn't bother me at all. They could have - and SHOULD have - stuck to that. Shaking the camera seems to be a disturbingly popular trend in new movies these days. I sure hope they wise up and STOP. In the old days they couldn't help it, but there's no excuse for it now and in my opinion, no use for it either.

"freemantle_uk","8","3","5","15 July 2009"," Heat of the 1930s
","The summer of 2009 has offered nothing by poor blockbusters. Public Enemies is so refreshing, a mature film for grown ups.<br/><br/>The 1930s were a poor time to be around, The Great Depression was in full swing, unemployment was high and fascism in Europe was on the rise. It was also a poor time to be a lawman or bank employee in the Mid-West of America. The 1930s was a time were America had high profile bank robbers. One of the most famous was John Dillinger (Johnny Depp). He was thorn in the side of American law enforcement and became public enemy number 1. He you going between states to avoid being arrested. But Dillinger was a popular, Robin Hood like figure who only robbed the banks, not the people. He terrorise banks in Chicago and Indiana and frees his crew from public. The director of the FBI J. Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup) was lobbying Congress for more funding and give the FBI more power via the Crime Bill. Congress rejects the proposals and so Hoover starts a media campaign. He declares America's 'first war on crime' and names John Dillinger his big target. He is obviously playing politics. He makes G-Man, Special Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale), the head of the Chicago Field Officer and more importantly find and arrest Dillinger. Purvis aims to bring scientific and professional methods into crime investigation. In the middle of all this Dillinger finds romances with Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard), a half native-American cloakroom girl from Chicago. A similar sub-plot to what happen Robert De Niro in Heat.<br/><br/>Michael Mann is an excellent director but had recently had a dip in form with Miami Heat. He is back with a winner, directing excellent actors, story and action with this film. He directs with style and flair and does fancy tricks which show that style can add substance. He directs excellent action set pieces with instance camera work, and doesn't overuse shaky cam. He also gets a good feel for the 1930s. He keeps the story going for the most part, but the film does drag occasionally. Mann also leaves it ambiguous on who is the hero and villain of the film. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp is excellent as the charismatic John Dillinger and easily the best performer in the film. He is an early contender for best actor for when award season comes around. Christian Bale offered a good performance, but his character does lack depth and disappears when he is not around. Marion Cotillard is a good actress and does well in the film, she even has a good American accent. Billy Crudup was also fine and slimy as J. Edgar Hoover and was last seen being big, blue and naked.<br/><br/>Public Enemies is flawed, but is one of the better films of 2009."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","8","3","5","9 July 2009"," Hooked
","I did not know a lot about the history before watching this, though I understand that this is highly accurate, with a few liberties taken for creative license. I have a great degree of respect for Mann's work... apart from obviously this one, I've watched Last of the Mohicans, Miami Vice, Collateral and, by far the one most comparable to this, Heat. The endings of the latter two have been disappointing, and while it may not be completely perfect, the final portion of this is considerably less anti-climactic and unfulfilling than that of those. However, the Pacino/De Niro piece does get something completely right in an area where this one stumbles: The amount of characters is spot-on, and we get proper insight to the motivations and personalities of them, we get to know them. This one has too many, and as a direct result, not everyone gets to stand out as an individual. Worse still, at points, you'll find yourself forgetting who this or that guy is, and what side they're on. Each of them is credible, as is the background that we do get. The writing is excellent. Dialog and script are solid. Every single acting performance is marvelous, Depp is charming and sympathetic without being Orlando Bloom-y, and Bale gets to use subtle hints. One can definitely tell this is directed by Michael... the level of detail is incredible, and the action is awesome(and doesn't divert the attention from the plot), realistic and genuinely exciting. This does not feel like a Hollywood flick. He also makes you care about the people, if this is not his strongest in that regard. You can also see that this is recent, with the hand-held cinematography and such, but I enjoyed it(and the fact that, done right, it can be rather effective should not be neglected, simply because it can be argued to be an annoying current fad). This is entertaining and, at times, quite suspenseful. It's fast-paced, and you do have to be ready to pick up on a good bit of information to follow it completely. The editing is sharp. All of the music is well-chosen and fitting. This evokes the 30's feeling and mood well, it doesn't try to ""update"" it. There is bloody violence, with a bit of language, and sexuality that is never graphic. None of this is gratuitous. I recommend this warmly to anyone who likes film depictions of the period and its criminals. 8/10"
"inkblot11","8","3","5","8 July 2009"," Very worthwhile, especially with Depp as the star and Bale, Cotillard & Crudup offering great support
","John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) is very adept at robbing banks in the 1930's. He and his closest friends have done well, so well that they have a definite swagger in their steps. And, since they have executed successful jailbreaks a time or two, their skills are formidable. Naturally, this is most upsetting to the young director of the FBI, J.Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup), compounded by the fact that there are no laws to cover the crossing of state lines during a crime spree. But, JEH will press on. Enlisting the services of one very determined G-man, Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale), Hoover assembles his gang of ""go-to"" guys. In the meanwhile, John has spotted a beautiful but poor gal in Chicago, Billie (Marion Cotillard) and insists that she become his woman. Bowing to his looks, wealth, and charm, she accepts his advances and the couple enjoys a brief interlude of romance. But, money does run out and John & Co. have to plan their next heists. They even join forces with Babyface Nelson for awhile. Can the ""public enemy"" criminals escape the hand of the law forever? This is a very worthwhile film, especially for those who love action, gun battles and history. The casting of Depp as Dillinger is terrific, making it difficult to see anyone else in this role. But, Bale, Cotillard, Crudup, Leelee Sobieski, and all of the others are quite fine, too. Then, too, the re-creation of the Depression Era deserves much praise, for the sets, costumes, camera work, script, dialogue and direction all work well to fashion this bygone time in American history. One small comment to add is that it is pretty violent, so if you don't like a bit of blood and guts, stay away. But, then, its not excessively gory, either. Therefore, while it may not be the best film of 2009, it is hard to imagine anyone not being enthralled Public Enemies."
"max von meyerling","7","3","5","2 July 2009"," The anti-depression version of Dillinger.
","The concerns and gestalt of every age (not to mention hairstyles) are reflected in the films made in that age. In the 30s the Dillenger persona was used by playwright Robert Sherwood in his drama of Existential Angst - The Petrified Forest. This made a star out of Humphrey Bogart who consciously copied Dillinger's mannerisms. At the end of the 30s W.R. Burnett imagined an older, wizened Dillinger, with graying temples, being paroled after years in prison through the influence of a crime boss to lead a robbery in High Sierra and wind up in a slightly more dignified death.<br/><br/>The two direct presentations of the Dillinger story were in the late 40s by a noirish pre-TV Movie movie starring real toughguy Lawrence Tierney. This film was so cheap that only one car, a contemporary Packard I believe, was used both for Dillinger and the FBI, in fact all cars in the drama. John Milius' version was a 60s movie in all but date, presenting a post Bonnie and Clyde anti establishment version of the story. Warren Oates' version was big hearted, swaggering and wry. Ben Johnson as Melvin Pervis was upright and unbendingly moral but gracious.<br/><br/>Michael Mann's PUBLIC ENEMIES is a post-911 take on Dillinger. If anything this picture should have been called DILLINGER, or JOHN AND BILLIE except for the fact that the target audience can not be reliably expected to know about anything from before they were born, or at least since they've been on-line. The cheeky bank robber played Johnny Depp seems to be just even all of the time, as if he's on Zoloft. Dillinger says what he's doing is fun be he doesn't look like he's having fun. He's passionately in love but he just looks so, I donno, even. At the end of the picture Dillinger is in the Biograph Theater watching Manhattan Melodrama and as Clark Gable is going to the chair he says something about living fast and dying as he lived and there is a minimalist smile which can almost be discerned in Depp's lips. I guess in the age of Botox this counts for expressiveness. It's nothing about 1934.<br/><br/>Like poplar music, the (secret) context of popular films seems to be which drugs were ascendant at the time of a film's manufacture. Its all about 2009. Torture and widespread wiretapping are a part of this picture so nobody's liberal creds are in danger of being questioned.<br/><br/>There is a tremendous amount of bustle about the picture. The opening is almost unwatchable with rapid cutting, camera movement in every shot movement in every frame. No doubt to not offend the ADD community it can be nauseating to the older demographic. There are a huge number of actors milling around the two major characters but its strange that it was nearly impossible to identify any individuals. They had a glaring sameness not only within each group but with each other. Beefy but bland guys, gangster or FBI man, they were mere background. There are only two personalities on view and one is one note and the other excessively wan.<br/><br/>Oh other people are seen doing things, but that's about all. Considering the modern stricture of shooting in medium close-up (for TV I'm told) with limited depth of field everyone and everything seems to be mere background for Depp. Speeches, other than his, are no longer than sound bites.<br/><br/>Christian Bale as Pervis has one operating system - intense. That is his one and only personality trait. He has no back story and doesn't have anything to say except to give orders to capture John Dillinger.<br/><br/>I feel there must have been about 20 minutes cut out dealing with the Pervis-Hoover relationship. This was famous because Pervis got all of this publicity and Hoover was jealous - for the good of the bureau of course. In this version Hoover seems more sinned against- a senator kills an appropriation increase for the FBI. Hoover vows to get it by getting more publicity. In fact the FBI spent one third of its total budget that year on capturing Dillinger.<br/><br/>This brings up some interesting material which Michael Mann brings in for the first time - The influence of the Mafia in closing the trap around Dillinger. Frank Nitti and the Mafia controlled the vice rackets including bookmaking which went across state lines. If a National Crime Bill were enacted because of Dillinger it would effect their businesses. Since Dillinger was betrayed by a madam and the mob controlled all of the whore houses it seems to be a straight line. On the other hand while Hoover played up the Dillingers of the era he categorically denied that there was anything like organized crime or La Cosa Nostra and went on denying it until the infamous 1957 Apalachin, New York meeting. Hoover used to actually go to the track with Lucky Luciano who complained about how much money it cost him to fix the races so Hoover could win a $2 bet.<br/><br/>Its not a terrible picture, nor even a bad one. It's entertaining for what it is and a break from wizards and princesses and cute animated animals and space warlords and whatnot. A costume picture with some good music and everything that moves in gleaming black enamel (the Locomotive positively shines. Its a clean machine.) The locations are spectacular, in most cases the original like Little Bohemia and a series of banks that speak of an era when every business was proud to show the world it had taste and the civic responsibility to give its community something beautiful. Its actually far better looking than the period was, which was a depression. No Walker Evens, Dorothea Lange or Ben Shann need apply. You want Johnny Depp as the bad man John Dillinger, you got him. I think I'll stick with Warren Oates. That was actually fun."
"PeggyGoodwin","8","3","5","5 July 2009"," Who are the gangsters?
","Public Enemies is an introspective look at the fragile dance between law enforcement and criminals. It especially emphasized the abuses of J.

Bale did a wonderful job of showing that Pervis had a conscience and in fact, left the FBI shortly after the capture/slaughter of Dillinger and eventually killed himself."

","I went into this movie expecting something fun, exciting and original. I have seen many takes on historical figures (most notably Braveheart) and was expecting something of that genre.<br/><br/>What I witnessed was the worst movie I have seen in my entire life. The story drags on and it's a constant, I get caught, I get out, I get caught, I get out sort of movie (referring to being apprehended by authorities and then escaping from prison). I was so bored I started to text message friends on my Blackberry Bold. Now.. a Blackberry Bold is a VERY handy device if you're going to see this movie. I did some emailing, got some work done as well as browsed around for some new furniture for my house. I'd pop my head back up only to see people leave the theater (they hated it as well).<br/><br/>At the end the whole crowd booed the movie."
"mombot","10","4","8","2 August 2009"," ""I like baseball, movies, fast cars, whiskey, and you. What else do you need to know?""
","Public Enemies truly takes two viewings to fully appreciate. This film was my most anticipated of the year. I've followed it's making and read the book and still wasn't sure what to expect. I first saw Public Enemies at a midnight showing June 30/July 1st with 4 other people who have decidedly different film tastes. All of them liked the movie a great deal. That said, it took me 3 days to decide if I myself actually liked this film. First time out, some of the shaky cam and editing between scenes bothered me a little bit. My second viewing (with other friends) was a much more enjoyable experience. Everything was perfect, sound, editing, the whole works.<br/><br/>Depp really IS John Dillinger, not simply because they shared the same initials and the same pants size. (In an interview, it's revealed that he had the opportunity to try on a pair of Dillinger's pants.) From the books I'd read, I had a pre-conceived vision of how I thought Dillinger would look and act like, and was amazed the Depp fit him to a ""T"". Bale gets some bad press for being ""wooden"" or ""flat"" in his portrayal of Melvin Purvis, but he's being real and is believable in his role. Purvis was a by-the-book guy. The rest of the supporting cast does a stellar job and the second viewing made it easier for me to appreciate their contributions. Marion Cotillard is wonderful in her portrayal of Dillinger's girlfriend. Their on-screen chemistry is excellent. I think my favorite of all the lesser support characters is of the actor that plays his lawyer, Louis Piquett. He's very memorable in a courtroom scene where he manages to keep Dillinger from being transfered to a state pen.<br/><br/>The look of the film is something to get accustomed to, as not all of us are into a digital look from a digital film. I found it a fresh take on how to do a period film, not going the conventional route we so often see. The cinematography is one of those aspects that I love about films, so if it's good or bad, I'm going to take notice. Different doesn't equal bad, and I loved what Mann did with this film. Made it feel as if it happened recently, not 70 years ago.<br/><br/>The gun fights are in-your-face and loud. The robberies are fast paced, not drawn out. As Depp/Dillinger says, ""one minute, 40 seconds...Flat!"". One of my favorite parts of the film is the Little Bohemia shoot out, which is very intense. This is a very historically accurate scene which was also shot on location at the same lodge.<br/><br/>Most of the scenes and dialog is historically accurate, and of course, since this is not a documentary, some liberties where taken with the time line of who died when or some of the events. On a scale of historical accuracy, I'd say it's a good 7.5 to 8 out of 10. So far, it's my favorite film of the summer of 2009. 9/10 easily.<br/><br/>If you like your films to be dumbed down, this isn't for you."

","PUBLIC ENEMIES Director: Michael Mann Country: USA Year: 2009 Language: English Runtime: 140 Minutes Rating: 15A<br/><br/>Johnny Depp and Christian Bale are at the very top of the acting game. Depp has just emerged from one of the biggest blockbuster series of all time, bagging an Oscar nomination along the way for his role as Captain Jack, in PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN, while Bale is churning out massive movies every other week. Already we've had BATMAN and TERMINATOR and now we have PUBLIC ENEMIES, the latest from Miami VICE creator and all round champion of cops and robbers, Michael Mann, who brought Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino together in HEAT, where they appeared on screen together for the first time.<br/><br/>PUBLIC ENEMIES follows John Dillinger, who is played by Depp, and who rocketed to fame over a period of just 14 months, beginning in May 1933. He and his gang blasted across the Midwestern United States stealing an estimated 300,000 during a time when soup kitchen lines stretched around the block. Through a combination of charisma and audacity Dillinger became an enduring American folk hero.<br/><br/>Yet the movie never really explains Dillinger's mythical status. We only get glimpses. Early on in the film, in the middle of a heist Dillinger sees some money on a counter and asks ""That your money, Mister?"" to a customer who nervously answers ""Yes,"" Dillinger then tells the man, ""We're here for the banks money not yours. Put it away!"" At another point he takes a female customer prisoner but gives her his coat.<br/><br/>We get glimpses of the character and the reasons behind the legend but it's hard to believe that Dillinger was mythologised into a modern day Robin Hood on the evidence of this pic. Sure he gave young ladies his coats, and yes he was handsome but surely a hero needs a little bit extra? Something that sets him apart from the other thugs and low-lifes?<br/><br/>Christian Bale is equally unimpressive as FBI agent Melvin Purvis, the film doesn't even hint at the demons that drive men to hunt down other men. Where as HEAT was an insightful look into the lives of cops and robbers and the women that share their lives, PUBLIC ENEMIES is a look at the guns, clothes and cars of the 1930's. If you're looking for a great character driven movie rent HEAT on DVD, if you want to see a pretty film, full of pretty people making a pretty big noise with machine guns then PUBLIC ENEMIES is for you. But I'm afraid it's a little too pretty for me."
"jdkraus","9","4","8","3 July 2009"," One of Mann's and this year's best!
","Praying that Mann wouldn't mess up like he did with the film ""Miami Vice"" I went to see his ""Public Enemies"" today. As soon as the movie started with the opening prison breakout my attention was held from start to finish. It felt nice to see Michael Mann at his brilliant best again. I will admit that ""Heat"" will always be his landmark crime saga, but ""Public Enemies"" is an excellent follow-up. <br/><br/>Like all of his movies, Mann jumps right into action without any dull monologue, or having a character explain the story as it goes along. It is clear enough to know what's going on and who's who. The 1930s crime spree is not my specialty in history, but I checked up on some of the characters that are portrayed in the film and many of the accuracies are right on, particularly with John Dillinger. <br/><br/>Adding to the film's trueness to its time period is some wonderful costumes and set designs as well as music that fit not only with the era, but also to the story. When there's an emotional peak, it hits it, when there's suspense it picks up on that too, without getting bombastic. <br/><br/>But the one thing I had difficulty with this film is the sound. Probably for the first half hour of the film, the dialog is very low, its volume focused on the sound effects and gunshots. Michael Mann is known for this, particularly in the big gun battle in ""Heat"" but it stands out very noticeably, and is very disappointing. <br/><br/>Another thing is the hand-held camera. I have no problem with hand-held, but at some scenes it seems out of place. There are also no huge lighting techniques that are used in this movie like in ""Road to Perdition"" or ""Changeling."" Instead, it seems the cinematographer chose a wider aperture, or opening to let more light in. People on the IMDb board have complained about this, but I personally like it. I think one of the most well done scenes with this technique is a gun battle that takes place at night. You can see what's going on, but at the same time it is hard, like it would be at night. The only source of light used is from artificial sources that take place on the screen. <br/><br/>Performances wise, they were great all around, though I wouldn't consider any Oscar-worthy. Depp, as always, gets into character and becomes John Dilinger. He's easily a guy the audience can sympathize with, but this doesn't necessarily mean all the bad guys are depicted as heroes. Some of them are pretty bad ass while others can be likable. This is the same way with cops. Several I absolutely despise while others I respect. Bale is one that is not necessarily the one to sympathize with, but is a guy that can be deeply respected as a hardboiled crime fighter.<br/><br/>Marion Cotillard, who I now appreciate for her mesmerizing work in ""La Vein Rose"" is gorgeous, and pulls off an okay accent. Personally though, her voice seemed a little out of place for her character, but nevertheless, she's great. In fact, there's an intense scene, in which I won't spoil, that delivers very powerfully. I doubt she won't get a nomination (that'll probably come around for her upcoming film ""Nine""). Overall, ""Public Enemies"" is a great film. It's not the best I've seen, but one of Mann's best and this year's best. <br/><br/>Overall rating: **** out of ****<br/><br/>I will point out that there is hardly any swearing which is nice, but it is very, very violent."
"nhaynes84","8","4","8","2 July 2009"," True gangster classic
","I saw this film really late and was sleepy but it kept me mostly awake, which really is a testament to this movie's great story and action. First, I liked the delivery of this one as it was real and at times I felt like I was watching a real stage play. The music was infrequent but good, acting was top notch, and action/shootouts were as good as it gets without heavy special effects. It was raw bone but not really violent. The main violence was in the bloody gunshot wounds that were consistent throughout. Nothing too graphic and certainly nothing disgusting. Violence flowed well with the movie and was about equal to that seen in the Untouchables. Depp played a wonderful portrayal of Dillenger and outdid Bale. Bale's role was good too but not as convincing as Depp's. Bale's Pervis was not nearly as ""tough"" as Connery's character from Untouchables, and , if I do say so, this may have been one of the few character roles Bale wasn't well suited for. McConoughey or Russel Crowe would've been better choices for the role of Pervis. Did not like the actor who played J Edgar Hoover. He was not a strong enough actor to deliver a real punch for that role. All of Dillenger's crew were well played by each respective actor, and Dillenger's girl was also a great role. I guess it could be said that the ""bad guys"" really dominated this movie. The gun fights were very realistic and fun to watch. This movie could easily win an award for best sound. I don't care for movies with a lot of profanity, and this one suited me fairly well. Profanity was very minimal, especially for an R rating. Movie was lengthy but never dull. Overall, I really liked this one and would say it was one of the top 5 action movies I have ever seen. This will be a REAL tough guy movie classic one day, and will join the likes of Dirty Harry, Untouchables, Godfather, Platoon, and all those John Wayne classics. Very Solid!!"

None of the Oliver Stone fantasies about Hoover in a dress, but the Hoover who ran the Department with an iron fist.<br/><br/>The supporting cast of Dillinger's fellow gangsters is too long to list, but mention should be made of Marion Cotillard who played Dillingers girlfriend Billie Frechette. She proved that her winning the Oscar for Best Actress (Le Vie en Rose) was no fluke.<br/><br/>Michael Mann deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Director and possibly Screenplay (he co-wrote).<br/><br/>A great film, possibly the best gangster movie ever. Don't miss this one."

"oakstreetamy","10","5","11","12 July 2009"," ""Far Off the Map"": Freedom vs. Control in Public Enemies
","Public Enemies has been unfortunately called Heat set in the 1930s. This is an extreme oversimplification, though we can imagine how that film would have played out being that Bryan Burrough's marvelous book on which the film is based reads a lot more like Heat than its consequential film adaptation. Mann, whose own narrative style has evolved since 1995 into something very impressionistic and sparse brings the material closer to The Aviator (2004; directed by Martin Scorsese) and his fascinating and fussy Miami Vice (2006). Scott Foundas writes in his review of Public Enemies that the film ""suggests a period redo of the 1995 crime saga, Heat, albeit reduced nearly to the point of abstraction."" Unlike Heat, where almost every actor in the crowded story is given a juicy scene that clearly establishes an identity, Time in Mann's more recent work is moving ahead so fast that there's no room (no Time, no Space) for an individual to establish Identity, where even the protagonist is struggling to hang on under the weight of this immense gravity that pulls the Self into a black void. <br/><br/>Public Enemies does not operate with the usual tropes of character development wherein character actors are allowed juicy monologues and self-serving scenery chewing. It is terse, silent, and even mechanical as opposed to conventionally humanistic. Even when it unfurls using the norms of cinematic suturing – such as the heightened melodramatic music of Eliot Goldenthal during the blooming romance between Dillinger and Billie Frechette (Marilon Cotillard) – the affect is almost ironic and distancing. Instead of compelling the audience to feel what the lovers are feeling, the result is much more akin to Todd Haynes' Douglas Sirk homage, Far From Heaven (2002): these characters are constructions of the growing cinematic world of their particular historical context (1933-1934). As a filmmaker whose style is geared towards generating content, Michael Mann is here eschewing normal methods of character development and storytelling precisely because he doesn't want us to disappear into the movie, the same way the characters are disappearing into History; we have to be in a dialogue with a film that is asking us about our reactions to it, because it is the Movies, after all, that generate our own personal myths and validate our preconceived identities, making sense out of human experience - our relationships, our loves, our deaths – much as Mann's Dillinger experiences cinema (Manhattan Melodrama) moments before his last stand. Indeed, the cinematic construction of the Self for Dillinger is circularly reinforced, being that his image of identification (Clark Gable) is in part a film studio's construction based on the man Dillinger himself has created with the assistance of the media. The ""Real Self"" is possibly non-existent, ghostly, and perhaps the only place John Dillinger can be captured and killed is under the blinking lights of a movie theatre, the Biograph (a name suggesting a ""Life""), because he's more Real there than in his corporeal body. Public Enemies is focused on the Real Self within History and how that Self dissipates within that History's systematic unveiling. The State becomes realized as an Idea of absolute Control and Reason, and people within that Right Hegelian System personified by J. Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup), such as the tragically alienated Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale), are doomed to become nothing but despair-ridden suits, dying slowly and then forgotten.<br/><br/>This kind of structure is not exactly conducive for a summer multiplex audience, any more than Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut was in July of 1999. But as Time magazine critic Richard Schickel points out, Kubrick's critics were always looking for ""what wasn't in the movie,"" ignoring the ""movie-ness of the movie,"" what was being communicated within the frame. The same could be said for Mann. Like Kubrick, his pictures demand the audience to communicate with the text, analytically participating instead of passively viewing. Which is why both directors' films are able to be watched and re-watched numerous times, each viewing having its own resonance depending on the viewer's response, as if each screening had the distinctive character of a live stage performance. <br/><br/>Public Enemies is not a rehash or period revision of Heat, but rather an obtuse and fascinating dialectic between film and audience and between historical reality and American myth. The film documents a particular time in history, when technology was enabling larger social structures to override local structures and private individuals, to the extent that it would completely absorb human beings and the symbolic functionality of their relationships in addition to Nature and the mystery of the frontier. Hoover's bureau, the abstraction for the Great Corporate Body, is thrown over the once mythological and transcendent American frontier as a technical matrix web that forces its workers, however virtuous, into base submission. Rebelling against this system, or shown to be active in fleeing from it, are the ""public enemies"", portrayed as archetypes pursuing a kind of poetic freedom, which denotes freedom from economic and political structures, so that the individual may control his own subjectivity and his own time. Unlike other elegiac period films, where the characters are either revisionistically de-mythologized or their presentation is wholly based on myth, the famous characters in Public Enemies are demythologized beings who are presently aware of their mythos and how that mythos is ""becoming."" It is a film that affirms the paradigm of our mythology, a trait that it shares with the films of Terrence Malick (whom is casually referenced through inter-textual clues), as long as those myths do not exist as tools of control but rather as touchstones with which we can identify and make sense out of our own experiences. The work of art must hence be in dialogue with its audience, not communicating clearly in order to communicate. We must experience it not passively, but actively, just as we may experience and analyze our own life experiences."

","My high expectations for this film were nearly through the roof. But, the actual film itself is a bit of a drag.<br/><br/>The story of John Dillinger's reign of crime in America's depression era is a good story that needs to be told...well. I'm a fan of Michael Mann and I was excited to see him doing this film. I loved Collateral, Heat, The Insider especially, so this was a real treat in my eyes.<br/><br/>But, like ever so often, I was let down. The performances were good (even the irritating, wooden, douche-looking Christian Bale didn't annoy me). Fabulous costume design and art direction were the high points of this film.<br/><br/>I've gotta keep this one short. I'm too tired to write on, but I will leave you with this: see it, enjoy it, but don't see it again. I'm still relishing in the disappointing aftermath of this film. It wasn't entirely terrible, though. Oh, you see? Now I'm repeating myself. I hate writing reviews for so-so films - there's really not too much to say about them except for the fact that they're decent."
"SimonJack","5","2","3","25 June 2018"," Wrong focus on this romanticized crime film
","It's okay to make a modern movie about one of the most notorious criminals in American history. And, the makers and cast of ""Public Enemies"" did a good job in portraying the main characters. Johnny Depp does a decent job portraying the fun-loving nature of John Dillinger. If anything, he is not as humorous or frequently smiling as the real J.D. And, Christian Bale portrays the always somber FBI agent Melvin Purvis well. Billy Crudup does a good job portraying the young, impetuous J. Edgar Hoover. <br/><br/>""Public Enemies"" also is a good portrayal of the widespread lawlessness of the time. Prohibition lasted from 1920 to the end of 1933. Bootleg booze was big business and organized crime flourished. The Great Depression was on and many homeless and jobless Americans turned to crime. The almost wholesale corruption of law enforcement in Chicago made it a haven for criminals.<br/><br/>Thus, John Dillinger returned often to his base of operations after his bank robberies. To this extent, this film does a good job. But, from then on, one begins to wonder. Dillinger joked with the press and liked publicity. And, there was something of a cult following, especially among the young, including boys. Some had a skewed notion of Dillinger as a sort of Robin Hood. And this film seems to play along with that. If anything the dour Purvis is pictured as an obsessed pursuer. <br/><br/>Of all the criminal charges against Dillinger, he had just one charge of homicide against him. But this film shows him in scene after scene with Tommy Guns and pistols blazing away and people falling to the ground. Is one to think that Dillinger couldn't hit anyone and that only others in his gang were able to shoot all those people?<br/><br/>The film has a scene of a fictional meeting between Dillinger and Purvis. They never did meet face to face in real life. In the movie, Dillinger is behind bars and Purvis comes to look at him. As Purvis walks away, Dillinger says to him, that he should change his line of work. At that point, Bale (Purvis) stops and the camera holds on him a few seconds, showing that he's obviously thinking something. <br/><br/>What was the point of that piece of fiction? Might not the writers instead have had Purvis make that statement to Dillinger? That would have squared more with the matter of right and wrong among those shown in this film. After all, wasn't it Dillinger who was being hunted and constantly fleeing to avoid the law? Wasn't it he who was in the wrong ""line of work?""<br/><br/>The film overall seems to have slight empathy for Dillinger and his girlfriend, Billie (played by Marion Cotillard). It never shows anything about the FBI agents, police, people in banks or others who are killed. There is no empathy for the families of those people. <br/><br/>""Public Enemies"" overall seems to glamorize the lives of a bunch of brazen bank robbers and killers. It sure is a lousy public statement about right and wrong, justice and law and order. One wonders why this film was made at all. <br/><br/>Incidentally, the Tommy gun could be fired with a 100-round drum or a 32-round magazine feeding bullets at a rate of 900 per minute. In the film, the actors were using magazines. Yet only a couple of times did it show anyone changing a magazine. But many scenese showed the robbers firing the Tommy guns for long blasts, one after another. And never a change of ammo."

","John Dillinger, at one time one of the FBI's Most Wanted and Public Enemy #1. In the era of Baby Face Nelson, Pretty Boy Floyd, Bonnie And Clyde and even Al Capone, Dillinger was one of the most flamboyant. A bank robber but also one who was sympathetic to the little man. <br/><br/>
The originality of the film plays a semi poor grasp at historical timing, and does get a few things wrong. strong script with some shining moments by Depp as Dillinger. Depp brings that charisma, swagger and finesse to how collected Dillinger was. The accuracy of the tommy guns and the vehicles I thought was spot on. Christian Bale I found to be rather dull as Melvin Pervis. At some points the character drove the logic of the FBI but mostly it became a vendetta.<br/><br/>There were a few points in the fil that were choppy in editing, cinematography was very well done. Filmed in parts of Chicago and even in Wisconsin. If you have a vast knowledge of history and enjoy gangster films then this will fill your viewing pleasure. I give this a simple but worth 7/10."
"james-cheeseman","4","2","3","24 January 2012"," Disjointed, Haphazard, & Jarring
","If you want a film where you are thrust into an action sequence, bullets flying, glass breaking, and all around chaos erupting onto a screen wrapped in shiny foil and a filling of movie stars that don't save the film, this poor excuse for a film might interest you. You will see characters shot and killed without a discernible identity, and you will be confused and lost during most of the film. You may find yourself asking ""Did Babyface Nelson get shot or was it that other nameless gang member?"" The lackluster, poor semblance of plot together with utter failure of maintaining an engaging narrative leaves you with a bad taste in you mouth. The film begins to seem like scenes of poorly written dialogue, aimed at filling time while leaving the audience waiting for a gunfight to break out, obviously feeding into the action oriented thirst that masses of movie-going meat-heads seek out in theaters today. The gaps and structure just leaves you wondering how in the hell was this adapted from a book? The only explanation is that they omitted 2 chapters every time they crafted a collection of scenes from one. The shaky, Blair Witch-esque camera work was worse and more jarring than that of Cloverfield. A perfect analogy would be rolling yourself down an enormous steep hill within a garbage can.<br/><br/>On the more positive note, Johnny Depp's portrayal of John Dillinger was excellent, as was his lover's, played by Marion Cotillard. However, their relationship seemed to be nothing more than Dillinger finding and holding onto a piece of ass that was madly in love with him and seemed to be constantly wearing her own pair of rose-colored glasses when she was with him. Christian Bale's portrayal was a little too robotic to be characterized as a human, driven by his superiors and an irrational obsession chasing Dillinger, but that may as well been how it was, but that I cannot comment confidently on that without more knowledge behind the man. <br/><br/>Finding yourself looking for a look into the hunting down, death, and destruction of one of the most infamous criminal gangs in American history, instead go save yourself the grueling 2-hour 23-minute cinematic vomit comet that Public Enemies is and rent ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford."" However, if John Dillinger is your thing, its been done countless times, each once either strictly Dillinger, or some derivation of the criminal. <br/><br/>If you really want to see the film, go right ahead. It was decent, the starring performances were solid, just try and decipher who is who very earlier or your'll find yourself lost within the gunfights. Also, try and avoid watching it on a large screen else you'll arrive at the predicament of your face retching in a bucket or kneeling at the porcelain throne."
"jmcginn174","1","2","3","16 June 2011"," A failure on so many levels.
","Public Enemies is a terrible movie, it failed on every level.<br/><br/>I expected a lot more from Michael Mann. He is one of my favorite directors. He has done so many good to great films from Collateral, Manhunter, The Last of the Mohicans to Heat.<br/><br/>The script/writing for this film was terrible. The way writers put the film together was all wrong.<br/><br/>The pace of the film will put you to sleep. The was no drama, because you just won't care about anyone in this film. The action was pathetically done with grainy film to I guess make it feel more realistic.<br/><br/>The music...well there virtually was none and when there was some it wasn't very good.<br/><br/>The acting had to be my biggest disappointment. Everyone seemed like robots no emotion, almost like they were sleep walking through the film. Christian Bale trying to destroy his reputation as a good actor this year. First Terminator and now this film. Then there was Johnny Depp who I think is a great actor, he was the only thing truly worth while in the Pirate of the Caribbean movies. But in this movie he just looked bored uninterested.<br/><br/>Then there was the running time of the film at about 2 1/2 hours long seemed like a eternity. I kept hoping the film would just end. And I know some of you will fall asleep watching this movie. I know I saw people asleep in the showing I went to and many were laughing at how bad it was.<br/><br/>Overall this has to be one of the worst movies I've seen in a theater in a long time. If you want to learn about John Dillinger watch the History Channel show about him and the other guys from that time or read a book I guarantee you'll be more entertained that way.<br/><br/>I just can't believe I couldn't find anything redeeming about this film but I couldn't. I think the last film I saw like that was Battlefield Earth and that's saying something about this film."

","John Dillinger (Depp) is robbing banks and the Feds have a hard time stopping him<br/><br/>I don't know why this movie wasn't called Public Enemy No 1 as it was all about Dillinger. Yes, Baby Face Nelson and Pretty Boy Floyd were mentioned but this was all about Dillinger who was called Public Enemy No 1 by the Feds. This movie also showed the beginnings of the FBI under J. Edgar Hoover.<br/><br/>It was okay. The best parts were when Dillinger spoke and we wished he had more dialogue. We hung on every word and when he was courting his girl, Billie (Cotillard) we heard some good dialogue. The entire cast performed well.<br/><br/>The story didn't explain Frank Nitti's involvement although his character was in a couple scenes that sounded important but were vague, so we never knew anything. <br/><br/>What was missing that could have made this a better movie? Two things. First, his men didn't talk about him in glowing terms among themselves or to others. That would have enhanced the legend. <br/><br/>And, second, if we had seen Dillinger pretend he was a bank alarm systems salesman while casing out some banks, that would have helped as well. <br/><br/>Not to glorify Dillinger, but the general feeling among the people of the United States, at that time, was that he was getting back at the banks, which they hated. Remember everyone was just coming out of a depression and it was generally felt the bankers caused it. We are talking 1933. So if Dillinger robbed a bank, the bankers deserved it. A breakfast table conversation in awe of Dillinger would have been correct and funny, in a way. <br/><br/>Would those two things have made the movie even longer? No. All they would have had to do was to cut down on some of the shootings. That big shooting scene in the woods when the Feds thought they had Dillinger went on for too long, the scenes were were too dark and no one could tell who was shooting at anyone. It took a scene later on when Dillinger was caring for his wounds that we knew he had gottten away. <br/><br/>One of these days the powers that be will realize that Johnny Depp is so much like a Brando in that he becomes the role he is playing. He is that good. <br/><br/>But, on the whole, the movie was okay. Could have used more humor too. <br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Some GDIs were only heard."

When you look too many times at your watch, the usual reason is you are not immersed in the movie.<br/><br/>And this is a pity. Specially when a superb Depp makes you believe you are looking at the very eyes of John Dillinger, when Bale's face is so deeply involved in his Purvis pose, and specially when production design and cinematography (a great job by Dante Spinotti) sometimes make you think you are watching a documentary instead of 'just' a movie.<br/><br/>Maybe the problem is that 'sometimes'. Or maybe a script that doesn't tie the spectator to the cinema chair.<br/><br/>A good film that could have been a great film."

This is a costume show, there things like the ongoing depression is hardly seen anywhere. This film puts the sympathies on Dillinger and the antipathies on, well what had you expected, J Edgar Hoover.<br/><br/>If this is supposed to be a celebration of gangster anarchism, it's not helped by Johnny Depp, who is resting his talent, being quite close to overacting. The movie is a half-failure and not a very interesting one."

","I was disappointed with ""Public Enemies."" A lot of expectations were developed for this film because of the star combination that it features -- Johnny Depp, Christian Bale and Marion Cotillard. It also has an interesting central character, John Dillinger. I have read about the gangster Dillinger in various books in the past, but don't really know much about him, so I was curious to find out more about him.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I did not really like this movie. The direction seemed to be rambling. The running time was too long. The scenes were confusing. I could not recognize the other characters during those many heists and gun fights. There was no excitement that develops despite the subject matter. I found several parts of the movie actually sleep-inducing. There was no build-up on the character of Dillinger at all, which I found the most disappointing. We meet him at the height of his career, but we do not know how he really got there.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp does not really disappear into his role as Dillinger. I can clearly recognize his acting tics, like how he wears his shades. I do not think Dillinger ever wore shades that way. Despite that, he is still the best part of this movie. He is charismatic and likable, like how Dillinger supposedly was. His scenes with Marion Cotillard (as his moll Billie Frechette) were the most involving parts of the whole film.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Christian Bale is simply turning out to be one boring actor for me. His scenes are very uninteresting. His acting is dull. His line delivery is quite monotone. The way he was eating his words was reminiscent of his Batman character, if you can imagine that. During his scene with Johnny Depp, Bale could not hold a candle to the incandescence of Depp's star appeal.<br/><br/>Overall, this was a waste of time for me. I expected too much, and got short-changed in a major way. Director Michael Mann was not able to deliver the best product out of the promising subject matter it had. I think another better film about John Dillinger can still be made in the future, as this one is not a definitive biography."

","I'm not going to use up much of my time writing about this film as it has already consumed enough of it in the cinema. There are three main things wrong with this movie:<br/><br/>1: Far too long 2: Far too much Hollywood 3: Glamorized a killer<br/><br/>This movie has a running time of 140 minutes. Cut it down to 90, which could be done incredibly easily, and I might not have been so disappointed. There are several scenes, which I assume are to give a sense of drama, anticipation and build-up (which seems to be the way these days), that should be cut either completely or way way down. For example, the love scene between Dillinger and Bille; a complete waste of time and kept in purely for the sake of sex.<br/><br/>My biggest issue however, is that the movie glamorized a serial cop killer. This man was not a hero, even if the American public did brand him a ""Robin Hood"" of the depression. He was a bank robber who was prepared to remove anyone who got in the way. We see in the movie that he used innocent people as human shields so he could make a clean getaway from his jobs. He also claimed the lives of many law enforcement officials. These do not make up the character of Robin Hood or a hero. Good riddance to him.<br/><br/>That aside, as a movie, it's far too long, boring story line and some quite shoddy acting displayed in places.<br/><br/>Don't waste your money."

","When Michael Mann's new film Public Enemies (and first since the 2006 Miami Vice) became part of my ""must-wanted"" films for this year I never imagine that the day it opened in theaters of my city I was going to be thinking about the fact that it was shot in digital, sort of ""worried"" about the look of the film. Certainly during the past few days I read some criticism towards the look of this film and because of being sort of ""worried"" I came to give a quick look to a wikipedia list of films shot in digital and for example by seeing films like Steven Soderbergh's Che Part One in the list I was like ""I don't remember even noticing the digital cinematography"". <br/><br/>Maybe was just because this time with this film I was alert, I was ready to judge the digital thing and sure I was but I do think I would have noticed how ""home made""-like Public Enemies looks at times if I would have went to the theater without reading any single comment of it. So now I can say, after seeing it yesterday on the big screen, that honestly yes, this doesn't looks like a big, period piece, production with an inspired Johnny Depp and an inspired Marion Cotillard should look but in the end, did the digital cinematography ruined Mann's Public Enemies for your humble commenter? No, simply no. <br/><br/>John Dillinger in this film can be resume with one scene: he's on the thing he does, which is of course robbing banks, when an old man gives to him his own money to avoid any possible and dangerous situation, certainly the man is afraid (how could not?) but in a way Dillinger ""calms"" the old man since he's there just for the bank's money and not for his or for hurting him. These actions are the ones that make obvious that a man like Dillinger will not be comfortable while working with a man like Baby Face Nelson (played in this film by the great Stephen Graham, who shined in Snatch and in This Is England), these actions are the ones that put an audience in the side of the criminals. And frankly Christian Bale, who is Melvin Purvis, ""helps"" since there's not much to remember about his character, actually is not Bale's fault (he is good) but is the big ""Dillinger vs. Purvis"" thing that doesn't delivers as I was expecting, it feels that Purvis is just another of the bunch of good guys and certainly I was expecting something much more memorable out of the Dillinger vs. Purvis stuff. So the audience is with Dillinger, there's enough material of both Dillinger's skills and intelligence and charisma and of the federals and just police's incompetent. <br/><br/>Some of what we have here are a couple of bank robs, a couple of breakouts, an intense shoot-out in the woods with the feds against Dillinger and Baby Face Nelson and company (this sequence was horribly affected by the digital cinematography), the difficult times for Dillinger, the love story of Dillinger and Evelyn Frechette (Marion Cotillard is superb) and the final moments of Dillinger.

This could have been so much better and certainly not only technically, so yes the digital cinematography didn't ruined for me Public Enemies, it's not something that can't stop me in recommending it and I do recommend it but it's just not one that goes immediately to my list of favourite crime films"

","1933 The hunt for Dillenger has intensified & Edgar Hoover & his Bureau of Investigation are looking to put an end to the era of Robin Hood bank robbers. Michael Mann employs all of his best skills here & never being too impressed in the past by his style of camera work here it works very well. Christian Bale plays a more subtle version of himself than were used to as Melvin Purvis & it is a relief. Depp as well steps away from the over the top caricatures he usually plays to reminds us just why we fell in love with him to begin with. I think the biggest complaint people have is how the movie doesn't really focus on anything specific. Which for me was fine watching Public Enemies was like getting a glimpse of that time period instead of an autobiography of one man. Depp at one point when asked who he is rattles off a pitch perfect line of Dillengers life & that was enough for me & all that needed to be said. Mann should be applauded for juggling so many aspects of this time in one movie without ever losing sight of the principle objective. Does it feel a little undercooked again not to me. You could make 5 or 6 or more movies out of this yet I don't think they would be 1/2 as interesting to watch as Public Enemies. There are also a wide range of supporting actors some known some not that add little splashes of color through this movie. Public Enemies works for me & serves as a nice break form the normal crash bang boom of other summer movies out there right now. Also of note 6 people walked out midway through the showing of Public Enemies I saw. Which really made me want to follow them out & politely ask why. To each their own I guess."
"rileye-wilson","8","2","3","4 July 2009"," Riley's Review: Public Enemies
","Let me first say Gangster movies are my type of cinematic genre, thus bias was a component of my high rating of this movie.<br/><br/>Another reason why I think this movie is the best of its kind since 1987 (The Untouchables) was the good selection of actors. Whenever you have Johnny Depp you are bound to not have a bad performance. Stephen Graham's facial expression and delivery as acting as Baby Face was merely sensational. Christian Bale is Christian Bale. You may hate his off the camera antics, but he did an adequate job. I think Marion Cotillard (Billie Frenchette) did an amazing job acting as an emotional woman falling in love with the infamous Dillinger.<br/><br/>The art direction was one of the best I have seen. I felt like I was in 1933 Chicago. The action scenes with the tommy guns were awesome. Thus, the action component of a typical gangster movie was fulfilled.<br/><br/>So far this is summer 2009's best."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Based on Bryan Burrough's book, ""Heat"" director surprisingly takes a straight-on approach to the story of Public Enemy Number One, John Dillinger. There is none of Mann's usual MTV approach, though some of the texture and look of the film seemed inconsistent and even distracting.<br/><br/>Personally I appreciate the mostly no-frills method here as Johnny Depp brings Dillinger to life as a serious, dangerous man when he's working, and a bit of a charmer when dealing with the press or the ladies. The sets, costumes, accents and cast are all spot on. I especially enjoyed the look and feel of the train station and the Biograph Theatre.<br/><br/>If anything, too many characters are thrown at us, but the cast is so strong, that even that is no real negative. Channing Tatum as Pretty Boy Floyd, Marion Cotillard as Billie Frechette and Stephen Lang as Agent Winsted all add a nice touch. And don't miss Diana Krall (Mrs. Elvis Costello) as a lounge singer. Christian Bale actually plays Melvin Purvis close to the vest and some of the best stuff is thrown down by Billy Crudup in a wonderful spin on the ambitious J Edgar Hoover. He is excellent and creepy.<br/><br/>Depp and Cotillard have some strong scenes together, but I actually thought the gun fights were a bit over done and unrealistic - though efforts were taken to make it seem very real. Just a slight disconnect there for me.<br/><br/>Overall a pretty decent and straightforward bio-pic with minimal Hollywood fluff. Dillinger's story is plenty strong enough without the dramatic license we usually get. Also loved the soundtrack."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","10","28","29 June 2009"," Like an exciting modern thriller, only done in '30s gangster style
","It's been awhile since we've seen a good cat-and-mouse thriller done old school, and that's exactly what ""Public Enemies"" is. Merely trade in your usual summer crime movie full of thieves in ski masks wielding uzis for ones wearing suits and fedoras armed with tommy guns and suddenly you're getting entertained Great Depression-style. ""Public Enemies"" is a neat crossover between the action-packed thrillers of today and the mob movies of yesterday, and one that comes to us well-armed with the talents of Johnny Depp, Christian Bale and a master of the thriller genre: director Michael Mann.<br/><br/>""Public Enemies"" is about 80 percent action thriller, 20 percent biography of infamous '30s bank robber John Dillinger (Depp). It gives us a colorful character portrait of Dillinger as a care-free crook with a sense of humor, but its main goal is to give us a handful of flashy crackling gun fights. It's not an intimate or dramatic character study that makes us think twice about what it means to be America's most wanted; the intention is to develop Dillinger enough so that Depp can make him an intriguing personality for us to follow on this 140- minute ""catch me if you can"" adventure. So check your Oscar-caliber expectations at the theater entrance.<br/><br/>Depp is a perfect fit as Dillinger, a man who lived in the moment, doing only as he wanted and hearing only what he wanted to hear, even when it was ""you won't get away with this forever."" He's a likable criminal type, not unlike a clean-shaven and articulate Jack Sparrow. Basically, he makes life hell for the Bureau of Investigation (it's his example that will later add the ""F"") and the chief detective on his case -- Melvin Purvis (Bale). He's the silly rabbit that keeps getting away, and Bale -- in a strong but unremarkable performance -- vows to hunt him down.<br/><br/>This isn't unfamiliar territory for director/writer Mann, whose thriller ""Heat"" was basically a more sophisticated modern version of the cat-and-mouse story with two other stars on opposite ends of the fight (De Niro and Pacino). Like that film, ""Public Enemies"" has a lot of exciting and dramatic nighttime action scenes. The gunfight at the Wisconsin getaway with the guns lighting up the cold night air is most memorable. Mann more or less film this movie like someone who's been here before. His only weakness is overuse of hand-held camera shots. In a period piece, you'd expect a filming style that would be a little more classic, framing every shot perfectly, but Mann insists on this modern technique that does sort of shatter the bubble of being in the '30s in spots. There is definitely a sense at times that these are just modern people playing gangster dress-up -- it's not a flawless recreation of the era.<br/><br/>I'm unaware of the historical truths surrounding Dillinger and his cronies ""Pretty Boy"" Floyd and ""Baby Face"" Nelson, or even if he had a relationship with a Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard), but all their roles and the facts that may or may not accompany them are of little consequence to the enjoyment of the film for those who aren't crime history buffs. Billie is the best example of a character rendered ineffective because the movie cares little about her (despite Cotillard's talents). She's just there because every no-good gangster/mob guy has a girlfriend, which isn't great, but it's fine because it gives us another side of Dillinger and he's what is supposed to make the film stand out.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that ""Public Enemies"" was released in July and not December and you should enjoy it -- it's an action thriller done '30s gangster style, not an Oscar-contending biographic crime drama. It wouldn't be unfair to expect a bit more character conflict or development for all characters and actors not named ""John,"" but it's definitely appropriate summer movie fare."
"Med-Jasta","8","1","1","22 May 2020"," Much better on a second watch
","I never hated this movie, but it felt like a missed opportunity, I kept waiting for the directors cut and I'm still waiting. But since this came to Netflix I figured I'd try it again and I was surprised. Really I guess the only problem was pacing? I don't know. A couple weird musical choices. Something seemed to be missing but I can't put my finger on it. A lot of things were very similar to Heat, of course that movie was based on this real event so they was unavoidable but as a movie watcher it was familiar.<br/><br/>I'm a huge Michael Mann fan. Heat was my favorite movie before that became cool, I even love Miami Vice and The Keep. When I go into one of his movies I expect a game changer which this wasn't, but there's nothing wrong with that. I was impressed. I may watch it again. The shoot out in the woods is crazy cool. And I love how the muzzle flash lights up their faces when they shoot.<br/><br/>I followed the development closely on this one, again huge Mann fan. When Christan Bale and Johnny Depp were announced I was excited. I'm not even a huge Depp fan but of course he's good and he's got the necessary presence for the role. And he was great. And arguably Mann has the best casting sense. You go back on his movies and so many people you saw for the first time are big now, or at least established. This movie was no different.<br/><br/>If you weren't a fan the first time it's worth a second watch. If you hated it then I'm sure you'll still hate it."

","This movies starts out with a less than exciting prison escape, then follows that up with Pretty Boy Floyd being killed. In reality, he was killed after John Dillinger. While this wasnt a documentary, and didnt expect it to be, this scene adds nothing to the movie. So I'm not sure why the director decided to put this in there.
This movie was just plain dull. The actors have the emotional range of a door. Personally, I couldnt develop any sort of interest in any of the characters. Even the relationship between Dillinger and Frechette is devoid of any sort of passion.
The camera work was shoddy as well. In at least one scene, the camera jumped around. I say in at least, because I couldnt finish this trainwreck of a movie.
It's just that awful."

The location of old America of late 1920s and early 1930s is beautifully captured.<br/><br/>Direction is good, screenplay is slow but the plot demands slow screenplay as the movie is setup in 20s and it is necessary to present the life of that time perfectly to keep the essence of the movie as life was not fast at that time.<br/><br/>Another credit for background music of the movie which works as a soul.

Christian Bale does likewise as Purvis, those two were excellent casting choices.<br/><br/>The film also features other familiar faces, e.g. Stephen Graham and Giovanni Ribisi, who are all fairly accomplished in their respective roles. The down parts of this production, for me at least, are the plot and the editing.<br/><br/>Plot-wise it is a little drawn-out, it can feel a bit pedestrian in the moments away from the fire-fights.

"PredragReviews","5","1","1","5 May 2016"," Hugely disappointing
","I don't know what it is that's missing from this film but there's definitely something.. Not that Johnny Depp didn't do a bang-up job as Public Enemy Number One, a role that the Pirate of the Caribbean had long coveted. He probably deserves kudos for the best Dillinger portrayal, but you can't do a whole lot with a worn and weary script. Mann should've called John Milius for advice: his own 1973 Dillinger starring Warren Oates was an awesome flick but, as he learned, Dillinger just doesn't go over big at the box office. Even Lawrence Tierney could've told him that. Oscar winner Christian Bale as Melvin Purvis and Award-winner Marion Cotillard as Billie Frechette added star appeal but you just can't make a good meat loaf out of spam. No teasing, no toying, just things happening. there's little plot movement, zero character development and the muted acting comes across as sleepwalking. Depp has the odd moment, mostly in the love sub-plot when he finally shows some intriguing charisma and as a result you're left wishing there was a lot more smooching and a lot fewer gunfights. bale is blank - such a shame when he can often do the inner-turmoil/explosion thing so well.<br/><br/>For Depp, Bale and Cotillard fans, this is a solid effort for which these actors deserve recognition for putting over a registered stink bomb. For Michael Mann watchers, this ranks right up there with Manhunter as a classic book-to-movie fumble. For crime buffs and action/adventure flick fans, well, let's say this is better than Boys In The Hood... but not much. All in all, a big disappointment; I had expected much better! Overall rating: 5 out of 5."
"C22Man","4","1","1","3 March 2016"," Good Fun but Slightly Underwhelming
","Michael Mann is one of the few directors where I'll happily watch anything that he is involved in. He is an expert when it comes to telling big stories and keeping them engaging, always fleshing out his characters and writing dialogue that leaps off the screen. Most importantly though his films always leave some kind of impact upon you and really make you consider the stories they are trying to tell. Public Enemies focuses on the famed bank-robber John Dillinger, who became something of a celebrity in his day due to his crimes never actually hurting innocent people. Whilst also looking at the FBI force, led by Melvin Purvis, out to catch him. With Johnny Depp and Christian Bale in the lead roles you're thinking this could be something special with Mann's directing, yet the film falls short where Mann's other films have soared and never becomes anything more than an entertaining little piece.<br/><br/>The story focuses on three areas in Dillinger's crime exploits, his relationship with a girl named Billie and the FBI's efforts to catch him. I think all three areas are handled adequately, but never anything more than that. The crimes and shootouts are exciting to watch but nothing we haven't seen before. The romance is very believable but could have been delved into more. It is interesting to see the workings of the FBI yet more could have been shown of their efforts and plans. The big problem with the film appears here. It is enjoyable but it severely lacks the pathos and grandness of Mann's other works, while on the flip side it doesn't go into enough detail on Dillinger himself to be an intriguing character piece that is could have been. It is stuck somewhere between these two styles and would have fared better if it had picked one to go for.<br/><br/>Mann is capable as ever behind the camera, he knows how to make the dialogue interesting and create a sense of location. It must be said however that the hand-held camera work and shooting the film in digital do get in the way many times, mainly due some irritating shaky cam and some shots looking distinctly amateur because of the low resolution. Not to mention that quite a lot of the film is shot in close-ups which does appear somewhat unambitious at times. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp does a good job with what is a difficult type of performance, he makes Dillinger charismatic and gives his relationships an air of believability. The problems with the role are mostly due to the writing as we're never given a true insight into Dillinger and what makes him tick. Its all well and good making him stylish but there needs to be a complexity to such a character. Christian Bale is solid as Purvis and offers the intensity we've come to expect from his performances, but he is also let-down by the writing. Purvis simply isn't fleshed beyond wanting to take down his prey and he has nothing more than that, we're not shown any witty or intellectual side to the character. Marion Cotillard is good as Billie, bringing a sense of style and respectability to what could have been a forgettable role. Stephen Dorff, Jason Clarke, Billy Crudup and Stephen Graham show themselves as fine actors despite their limited characterisations.<br/><br/>The action scenes are very effectively done and have the appropriate amount of tension, it is certainly an area that Mann knows how to do well as he has shown many times in the past. The shootouts and the bank robberies had a real excitement to them as there was a sense of vulnerability to both sides. The sequence at the woodland lodge was extremely gripping and there was an unpredictability to the outcome which is something Mann has done in the past, keeping you gripped to the screen as a result. Dillinger's eventual downfall also lacks the bite that you would expect and is something of an anti-climax given the build-up. Some of the commentary that the film gets in is quite welcomed. The way that Dillinger becomes something of a celebrity whilst the FBI is shown in a not so positive light is smartly done especially considering that most films tackle this aspect in a heavy-handed manner.<br/><br/>So Public Enemies falls short mainly because of its unsure story- telling and weak characters. I think the plot, acting and directing are all solidly done yet that is also part of the issue. They're all done well but never especially well because it is lacking in the key areas. You know Mann will provide the goods in these areas but he can never propel the film onward because of the script. We never really know anything in detail about the characters we follow and as a result the film isn't as gripping as it could have been because we are kept at arms length at all times. As said the film would have benefited greatly if it either decided to go all out and tell a big story or if it was an understated character study, but as it falls somewhere in the middle it never reaches its potential. It's all good fun and easy to enjoy, but it is not a film that will get you thinking and it is rather underwhelming when its all said and done."

","There are so many things wrong with this film I won't list them, other reviewers have pointed them all out correctly.<br/><br/>For such an important, topical concept the script that was wrung - or squeezed to death - out of it was shameful. There is a lot of historical back story that would have made this film really sizzle. Capone, prohibition, the bank crisis and depression, Hoover and his Boyfriend Tolson, jeez these producers were asleep at the switch.<br/><br/>I want to rewrite it, fund it and re-do the whole thing. If even Depp can't save it, WITH Christian Bale, then it's sunk like the Titanic, ripped apart by the horrific cinematography, and thankfully in THAT movie DiCaprio took the part, unlike this dud to which he said no.

There is something disconcerting about this modern way of filming done on a period piece. The incongruity is off-putting. It's missing its heart. Depp and Cotillard are two of the greatest actors around but their chemistry is tepid. I like Depp and Bale in their roles. The action is brutal as in most Mann movies.

This forms the rest of the story. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp had always succeeded in rendering the most magnificent performances in his several movies and this isn't the exception, he had done the best in the shoes of Dillinger, Christian Bale as the FBI agent had made quite a appreciable performance, its Marion Cotilard who steals the show with her marvellous acting skills, her role as the Billie is the best, cinematography and the entire settings of the movie is so convincing with heightened authenticity, overall its best of its kind."
"slightlymad22","7","1","1","17 September 2014"," Depp Makes This Movie More Than Average
","I recently called Michael Mann's 'Public Enemies' a missed opportunity, having only seen it once, (in the cinema when it was released) I decided to revisit it. And my feelings have not changed much, it's better than I remembered, but not by much. <br/><br/>Back when this was made Depp was still one of my top 10 actors, but sadly there is something missing in his work since early to mid 00's (with the exception of Sweeney Todd) as he seems to be lost in big budget sequels to the 'Pirates Of The Caribbean' and underwhelming movies. Whilst this is his best movie since Sweeney Todd, it still falls flat. Then scene between him and Bale in the prison should have radiated chemistry (see the Sly Stallone and Mel Gibson scene in the van in Expendables 3 as an example of how it should be done.) but there is nothing there. Just two actors saying the words. Depp seems very into his role, and is the best thing in the movie, effectively carrying it on his own. <br/><br/>Giovani Ribsi, Stephen Dorff, Channing Tatum, Carey Mulligan offer Stellar support and Casey Siemaszko (who I've always been a fan of, and deem to be an under rated actor) is here too as is Al Capone from TV's 'Boardwalk Empire' actor Stephen Graham as ""Baby Face"" Nelson. Leelee Sobieski brightens the picture with a small role late on. She is a talented actress, that I find very attractive.<br/><br/>But for me Adam Mucci as Agent Harold Reinecke is the stand out supporting performer as he is one of those actors who makes you hate his character. <br/><br/>I think the problem with this movie is Mann's direction and Bale. Bale who is a talented actor is merely going through the motions and offers nothing of note here. As for Mann he directed 'Heat' which I loved, and hoped for something similar here. <br/><br/>All in all Depp carries this movie above the average line."
"ShootingShark","5","1","1","8 October 2013"," Enjoyable But Familiar Gangster Flick Of Infamous Thirties Bank Robber
","In Depression-era thirties America, John Dillinger is a notorious bank robber and public enemy number one for the federal Division of Investigation. Thriving on celebrity status, how long can Dillinger carry on evading the G-men ?<br/><br/>As gangster movies go this is an enjoyable and well made crime story, but doesn't have either the style or the richness of atmosphere I'd expect from a director of Mann's talent. In particular, the visual tone is erratic, ranging from excellent period costumes and some sharp, beautifully designed scenes (notably the early bank heist) through to rushed, shaky moments, culminating in a big shootout at a forest lodge which looks like it was shot with a cheap camcorder. This might be innovative and daring, but for a movie with a hundred million dollar budget I want more for my money. The liability with the Dillinger story for me is that while it was shocking and sensational at the time it occurred, it's become the formula for so many gangster pictures since that a new version struggles to add anything. The cast are good, with Depp charismatic in the lead, half-smiling, half-sneering his way through the role, and a strong support ensemble, notably Lang as Texan lawman Charles Winstead. Perhaps the best aspect of the movie is Elliot Goldenthal's excellent traditional score, because it's this which wrings the emotion out of the story more than anything else. In a movie where it's hard to care much about anybody, it's the music which reminds us how to feel. Shot in some beautiful Wisconsin locations, this is reasonable fare for the undiscerning crime film enthusiast or US history buff. For other movie versions of this story, check out John Milius' 1973 Dillinger, or Lewis Teague's 1979 The Lady In Red; neither are as authentic (or expensive) as Mann's movie, but both are a lot more fun."

","This film fails at so many levels that it's actually very educational.<br/><br/>First of, you can feel that the script lacked structure or a specific vision. I think the scriptwriters didn't know what the story was about, is it a love story, a historical telling of Dillinger's life or a battle of good v.s. evil.<br/><br/>So they went for the easiest copout in storytelling, a love interest.<br/><br/>This could have easily been a very good man's man movie, a classic HK or Reservoir Dogs type of crime drama but instead they went for romance because, it seems, American filmmakers can't write anymore for men.<br/><br/>Impossible to have a story about honour or brotherhood, the only motivation they can find for a male lead character is a love interest.<br/><br/>Also the use of video was more distracting than immersive, shots felt disconnected because of noise & colouration issues.<br/><br/>This film shows that if you don't know what you're story is about then all the other layers of the cinematic language will suffer in consequence, whatever is the acting, editing or even cinematography."
"MichelleAudrey","3","1","1","25 November 2011"," Disappointing. Michael Mann hang your head in shame.
","One minute and forty seconds flat. That's the time it took US outlaw John Dillinger to rob a bank. It's also the length of time it would take a viewer to realise how truly poor this film is in its portrayal of one of the biggest gangsters who ever lived. Directed by Michael Mann – Thief (1981), Manhunter (1986), The Last of The Mohicans (1996) Heat (1995) – one would expect a certain savvy in terms of production skills but the end product is one of the most underwhelming to be seen on screen in recent years.<br/><br/>The film opens, with Dillinger (Depp) disguised as a prisoner and being lead by his partner John 'Red' Hamilton to a penitentiary. The two enter the building only to engage in a violent breakout of the rest of the prisoners who form Dillinger's gang. This opening sequence is functional in portraying Dillinger's abilities as a criminal but it fails to provide any form of background for the character. This is a notable flaw seen throughout the film, hence Dillinger and many of the other characters appear somewhat two-dimensional. At the same time as Dillinger's breakout, Melvin Purvis (Bale) and his team of FBI agents manage to run down Pretty Boy Floyd. This results in Purvis being upgraded to lead in the hunt for Dillinger. The film marks another disappointing turnout from Bale (after Terminator Salvation). It would appear that the success of The Dark Knight may have stunted Bale's growth and development into what has been overly hyped as a phenomenal on screen presence. Instead he seems to be relying more and more upon his deep vocals to perform much of his work for him. As Purvis he is just about competent, enabling the audience to despise him and become more endeared to Dillinger. It could be argued that this is more directly due to Depp and his portrayal of Dillinger's charismatic presence.<br/><br/>Aside from Depp, Marion Cotillard provides an entertaining turn as Billie Frechette, the check- in girl to whom Dillinger becomes devoted. One amusing sequence that occurs when the two meet at a dance centres around the couple being watched closely. Dillinger is aware that everyone present knows who he is whilst Billie feels she is being inspected for her Native- American heritage. Thus, they become the perfect outsider couple with just a touch of cliché surrounding them.<br/><br/>The storyline bumps along, lacking a certain finesse that can be found in other Michael Mann films. For example, when Purvis finds what he believes to be Dillinger's hotel room,bursting in on an ordinary looking couple, there is a fragmented delay between the instance when Purvis makes his apologies, leaves and then discovers one half of the couple is a wanted member of Dillinger's gang. The failure to eliminate Dillinger in this sequence results in Purvis demanding to be equipped with professionals who can hunt criminals dead or alive.<br/><br/>Another memorable scene occurs towards the end of the film. Dillinger's trademark is one of invincibility, a status that is seen when he strolls through the 'Dillinger Squad', the unit of Purvis' police force that is hunting him. Here he freely views all the information that has been gathered on him and his gang whilst the officers within the room fail to recognise him. Depp carries the scene with enough charisma to portray a frighteningly accurate representation of Dillinger's arrogance. Similarly when Dillinger's girlfriend Billie is captured before his eyes and he can do nothing to save her, the viewer is introduced to the vulnerable side of the outlaw.<br/><br/>Cotillard's performance as Billie mirrors that of Depp. The interrogation and abuse she suffers at the hands of Purvis' men is harrowing to watch and although the gangsters fate is inevitable, there are moments where it seems as though he may slip through the radar yet again. This of course is not the case and sadly Michael Mann chose to depict Dillinger's death in a similarly bland manner to the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Perhaps the biggest flaw in Public Enemies is the sheer romanticisation in the director's portrayal of one of the bloodiest men in history and his gang members. Michael Mann has not brought his viewers the tour de force that the trailers promise, instead Public Enemies is a watered-down love story that fails to resonate. One would think it was not necessary to highlight that Dillinger was not a thoroughly lovable rogue yet, this is how he appears and the atrocities he carries out are not emphasised enough. On leaving the cinema, there was an undeniable confusion and an aura of disappointment. The film is at times, attempting to be a more violent, modern-day Bonnie & Clyde and it fails on both counts. Overall, had Depp and Cotillard not provided such entertaining profiles, Michael Mann may have had a disaster on his hands.<br/><br/>The end titles of the film inform us of the aftermath for Purvis and Billie and this method of storytelling itself is quite frustrating. Not only is the viewer not given any background on the main characters (aside from Billie) but the end of the characters lives is told through a mere sentence on the screen. There are enough books written on Dillinger for select research on specific characters if they spectating public would prefer this. Perhaps Mann would be more suited to this method of storytelling if he no longer finds it necessary to depict his characters through motion pictures.<br/><br/>All Rights Reserved © Copyright 2010 Michelle Lacey (Michelle Ní Láitheása)."

","My title might confuse you, but allow me to explain. Have you ever jumped on a movie after it has started and somebody gives you a little ""Important Points"" rundown?<br/><br/>This is the problem with Public Enemies. Michael Mann shows a lot of things that are important, you'll see John Dillinger checking his guns and cars. You'll see Melvin stepping in because Hoover has no ""street credibility"", the FBI being born. But all you see is a 30 seconds scenes about every and each one of these features. The movie feels shallow, like a big box for a small gift. It goes on for a long time, but is basically made up mostly of these small tidbits of ""trivia"" on the characters.<br/><br/>While on Heat you could relate to both the cop and the thief, in Public Enemies you will have a hard time relating to any. While Deep has his usual charm, and plays very well his ""Deniro meets Deep"" take on John Dillinger, there is no depth given to this character, he says he wants the world but he doesn't look like up to it.<br/><br/>Bale gives us a lovely vocal interpretation, but his character has absolute no depth. He has no past, no family, nothing to care for other than catching Dillinger and dealing with the way some of his co-workers behave.<br/><br/>Ironically, Marion Cottilard who plays Dilinger's girlfriend is the most interesting character, you can relate to her struggling in life and being swept away by this ""whole different world"" that Dillinger brings to her.<br/><br/>The action scenes are good, but there aren't many. The movie seems to build up for a incredible heist that never happens."

","The lighting is absolutely dark in the movie. Avoid. Ruined a good script and the audio at times was too quiet. The acting wasn't bad beside a few of the bank robbers looked really cheesy. Mr. Depp was good in the movie, when you could see him. It's hard to imagine in this day and age they would light a set like this and expect us to think it is some mood setting depression era look or feel. It's not. Also many of the Chicago cliques were repeated that you see in every Chicago film that is overdone. Also while the dialog was mute at times, the fighting scenes were way overdone. The sound would spike up to the point that it was deafening. Maybe they went with a cheap sound and lighting crew to pay all the big actors in the movie, but it shows in what could of been a great film had they caught on early and re shot all this junk."
"KineticSeoul","7","1","1","3 May 2011"," Good as a docu-drama about a notorious bank robber
","For a film this doesn't really have much soul to it or really pulls you into what is going on. But for a docu-drama this is done pretty well but has some flaws. I didn't really like the cinematography to this, I can see why Michael Mann went with this direction in order to seem more realistic and make the audience be part of what is going on. But I personally didn't find it effective and sort of looked cheap in some areas. So yeah didn't really like the camera work in this, it was like watching a expensive play instead of watching a movie. There also isn't much depth to this movie and doesn't really expand. However Johnny Depp did a fine job playing one of the most famous bank robbers in history. He really showed a lot of charisma in this movie and somewhat made his character likable because he played his character in a very charming and yet dangerous manner, also the way he carries himself. Christian Bale does a good job of playing Melvin Purvis, who is a FBI agent trying to track down Dillinger. Like Johnny Depp with Dillinger, Christian Bale really stood out in this as well but unfortunately the script didn't give his character a chance to give depth to his character. Even with the chase scenes and the shootouts, the movie felt mostly dry a lot of times. The love story in this is important to the story, but felt like it dragged the pacing of it all at times. This film would have been better if at least the characters had more depth to it, especially John Dillinger. He was just a cool and slick criminal and a bit of a hero to some degree and nothing was really menacing about his character. And didn't really feel like he was a bad guy at all sometimes because of the feel and direction the movie went with his character. ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" did a better job with character development and direction even if it lacked action like this movie. This isn't one of the best movie of 2009 or anything like that, but it's still a watchable movie and is worth the time to check out.<br/><br/>7.6/10"
"kneiss1","5","1","1","18 November 2010"," Overrated and empty
","I have been expecting so much more from this movie. While this movie doesn't disappoint me in the usual way Hollywood does. It is not extraordinary silly, nor cheesy - but nonetheless, it still has one of those really bad Hollywood endings. But the worst is, and this really destroyed the movie for me: The characters. There is 0 depths in them. Jonny Depp was nothing but cool. No fear - barely any humanity was given to this character. So I couldn't feel any sympathy for him. The whole movie was making an empty, dull impression on me. It didn't convince me in any way, not historical and not emotional. <br/><br/>The Action: Those constant repetitive gunfights bored, and even annoyed me. I usually don't dislike shaky cams, but in this movie I did. I often didn't like the angle from which this movie has been shot. I even disliked the cutaway in a lot of scenes. I might have to over- think my opinion of Michael Mann.<br/><br/>The atmosphere was another thing that I really disliked about the movie. With all the money they had, and the awesome set they have been able to use, this movie could have created an awesome 30's atmosphere. - But, it sadly didn't. The camera they have been using was a digital one. The movie sometimes looked like an absolute B-Movie. Colors lacked warmth and everything looked artificial. One of the worst things for me, has been the jazz-music. It didn't add any emotional weight to any scene. - At max it added some ""coolness"" feeling to the movie. Something I personally didn't find fitting. Atmosphere wasn't created by the jazz- music at all. It was as cold, as the movie looked. Only in the end, they used a good musical score - too bad that the ending was cheesy and not fitting to the rest of the movie."
"Turfseer","3","1","1","8 November 2010"," Depp serves up chivalrous romantic in place of wise-cracking psychopath
","Here we go again with another John Dillinger movie. There have been a fair number of them over the years and the question arises, do we really need another one? The answer is, not really! But if one is insistent on making another movie about the legendary Depression-era bank robber, as Michael Mann has done here, one should at least provide us with a convincing protagonist as well as a realistic atmosphere.<br/><br/>One of Director Mann's big mistakes was to film 'Public Enemies"" in high definition. It's ironic that the original concept was to shoot the film as a TV mini-series based on Bryan Burrough's non-fiction book about early 30s gangsters and the origins of the FBI. The HD cinematography gives the film too modern a look as though we're watching an HBO special. What's more, some of the action is hard to make out during the scenes shot during the night. I also found the soundtrack to be irritating as the music was also much too modern at times. The fault lies with composer Elliot Goldenthal who admitted that his job was ""chiefly composing dramatic music that didn't necessarily have to sound like it came from 1931 or 1933. It could be timeless.""<br/><br/>But Mann's biggest mistake was to cast Johnny Depp as Dillinger. Depp might be good playing offbeat characters such as Captain Jack Sparrow or Ichabod Crane but he's no gangster. Just look at his smooth, almost feminine face—it's a face of an artistic type not of a criminal or someone who has experience dealing with the underworld. Before he became successful as an actor, Depp was involved in the rock music world as a musician and songwriter. <br/><br/>No doubt Depp was drawn to the films' scenarists conception of Dillinger as a misunderstood romantic. Their Dillinger makes it a point to cover a female hostage with a coat following a bank robbery. He's also adamant about not committing any kidnappings as bank robberies are his modus operandi. The only time we see the Depp Dillinger get really violent is when he slugs a man who's acting impolite toward his love interest, coat-check girl Billie Frechette. Depp Dillinger's chivalry reaches its apotheosis when he makes tender love to Billie in an early drawn-out sex scene. Now the real Dillinger was known to be quite personable and perhaps at times could be chivalrous—but what's missing here from Mr. Depp is the notion that Dillinger was a dangerous psychopath and capable of many fits of violence. <br/><br/>There is a complete disconnect in this film with Dillinger's character (who we're supposed to sympathize with) and his true-life actions. Somehow Dillinger is excused for his behavior because deep down he's simply misunderstood—he's not really violent. In his place is a surrogate--Baby Face Nelson (very convincingly played by Stephen Graham) who we can blame for the violence while the Depp Dillinger gets his free pass. Even lawman Purvis' associates end up being worse than Dillinger—they torture one of the gang members to extract information and rough up Billie before Purvis intercedes on her behalf.<br/><br/>Another big mistake in this script is that it totally lacks humor. Compare the humorless Depp Dillinger with the wise-cracking psychopath conceived by Warren Oates in John Millius' 1973 take on the notorious outlaw. In the 1973 ""Dillinger"", Oates is far more believable because he can be both funny (likeable) and scary. Sometimes the violence is too over the top when he slugs Billie (played by Michelle Phillips) in the face but there are enough moments of black humor that give the 1973 film its charm. Despite being too old for the part, Ben Johnson was a far superior Melvin Purvis in the '73 version to Christian Bale's virtual automaton. Johnson's phone conversation with Oates is hilarious as he makes it clear that their relationship is 'nothing personal' and everything is kept on a 'friendly' level. On the other hand, Bale, with no coolness whatsoever, simply informs Depp while he's in the jail cell that the only time he'll get out is once he's executed!<br/><br/>Just as in the 1973 version, all the main bases are touched in the Dillinger story: Dillinger's arrest and escape from the Crown Point, Indiana jail; the shootout at the Little Bohemia Lodge and Dillinger's death in front of the Biograph theater. What the new film has over its predecessor is some nice on-location cinematography. However, the opening scene gives more credit to Dillinger than is his due: he never directly participated in the escape of his associates at the Indiana State Prison.<br/><br/>My main problem with 'Public Enemies' was that it deliberately attempted to distort and perhaps glorify a criminal who terrorized innocent people. Even if Dillinger never killed anyone (although he supposedly was responsible for the death of at least one bank guard), good citizens feared for their lives whenever he robbed a bank or took people hostage. What's more, 'Public Enemies' only presents the basic outline of the Dillinger story. We never get a sense of a fleshed-out human being, replete with all the behind-the scene tidbits that could have made this film something truly special. It's hard to believe that Michael Mann is the same director who gave us the excellent 'Last of the Mohicans'. But the aging process will take its toll on even some of the most creative among us."
"jeffislouie","4","1","1","11 October 2010"," Mediocre. Michael Mann ruins an otherwise interesting story.
","Only Michael Mann can make a bad guy like Dillinger seem far less bad than the FBI. Seriously - the FBI finally picks up Dillingers girlfriend and what do they do? Slap her around, hit her with a sack, and force her to pee on herself. Nice job, dipstick. It's a miracle you work in Hollywood. Depp does a good job making Dillinger interesting - even if it is a hammed up, poorly scripted character. Hey Michael Mann - you could have made this movie great by actually making it about Dillinger. Instead, you made this movie about a boring guy claiming to be Dillinger, a love story that, frankly, falls flat, and a political commentary on ""torture"". Here's a newsflash for you Mann - no one cares what you think. We wanted to see a movie about a wildly popular, fascinating John Dillinger: a man who, despite being a murderer and bank robber, managed to capture the publics attention as a bit of a hero. Why ruin all that history? Why turn Dillinger from interesting to lame? Why show ""torture"" (especially stupid torture that, in all likelihood, never happened - because it was unnecessary)? Why tell the story in so much of a hurry? The gun battles were boring, the chase scenes were boring, and the love story was boring. Michael Mann's legacy is just that: boring. I'm so glad I didn't pay to see this (caught it on cable). I'm already upset at how much of my life was wasted by watching this stupid, poorly written, terribly directed film. I won't be checking out any more of Mann's ""films"". He's lost what made him interesting and become a hack. Thanks for proving you don't care about good film making anymore."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","1","1","8 October 2010"," 'Bye, bye, blackbird'
","By no means does Michael Mann rank among my favourite directors but, for quite some time, I have been awaiting the release of 'Public Enemies' because the subject matter about one of the most infamous criminals in American history and the appealing cast. However, having now seen the result, 'Public Enemies' disappoints. It's not a bad movie by any means but, given the source material, it could have been so much better had it been crafted by the hands of directors like Sam Mendes or the Coen Brothers.<br/><br/>Mann's film is above average at best, that too in parts. First of all, his storytelling does not involve the audience. The viewer feels like a complete outsider who is detached from the characters. Mann puts more focus on action than on characters. I found the background score uninteresting and intrusive rather than contributing to the scene. Several scenes could have been more effective without background music. But, the songs work and they contribute brilliantly to the art direction which definitely captures the feel and look of the time period. The cinematography is very ordinary. The editing needed some working. I found the pace to be slow at times while the characters lacked development.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp does the best he can with what he's got. He captures the charm, slickness and determination of an infamous criminal. Had the character been better developed, his performance would have been outstanding. Christian Bale is restrained and he does a decent job but he's overshadowed by Depp. Luminous Marion Cotillard is spellbinding and she delivers the best performance in the movie. She shares an excellent chemistry with Depp. For me the highlights of the film were the scenes they shared. Of the talented supprting cast Branka Katic and Stephen Lang stand out while most of the others are wasted.<br/><br/>I think Mann is better suited for lighter action movies. The action sequences in 'Public Enemies' are brilliantly executed. But, if you're going to make a movie about someone, character and story development should come first. Even though much of what I've said sounds negative, I don't mean to trash the film. It is watchable even if it's not something I'd include in my DVD collection."
"MBunge","5","1","1","7 October 2010"," Hint - It's generally a good idea to figure out what your movie is about BEFORE you start production.
","This summer blockbuster is really a little film that never decided what it wanted to be when it grew up.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp plays Depression-era bank robber John Dillinger, the man whose wide ranging crime spree across the Midwest made him public enemy #1 of the newly created Federal Bureau of Investigation. Dillinger was the most famous of a generation of outlaws who used the new technologies of fast cars and faster guns to recreate the Wild West in the 20st century heartland. Christian Bale plays Melvin Purvis, the FBI agent obsessed with capturing Dillinger dead or alive. Marion Cotillard plays Billie Frechette, the poor Chicago girl Dillinger falls in love with at first sight, promising to whisk her away to a life of excitement and adventure.<br/><br/>Public Enemies starts out strongly, with Dillinger staging a bold prison break to free his gang but the story wanders into the wilderness after that and never makes it back to the main trail. It drops us into the midst of Dillinger's bank robbery career without preparation or explanation, immediately launches the FBI into the mix, throws in Dillinger's relationship with Billie, adds a bit of the uneasy union between the Dillinger gang and the organized crime in Chicago that was coalescing out of post-Prohibition, spices things up with fairly blatant yet surprisingly vague allusions to the socioeconomic dynamics of that age, tosses in a splash of anthropological theorizing about the rise of institutions crowding out the individual act and even stirs in some garden variety treachery and betrayal. The film is always going in so many directions that it never ends up anywhere.<br/><br/>For example, both Billie Frechette and Melvin Purvis and the FBI are major elements of the movie from the very start through to the end. Yet, while Billie may have been important to John Dillinger the man, she's irrelevant to his story. She doesn't really play a major role in anything that happens to him and could be lifted out of the film entirely without losing much. Likewise, Purvis and the FBI aren't much of a factor until the later stages of Dillinger's criminal career, yet this film highlights them like they were breathing down Dillinger's neck all the time. So, for the first three-quarters of the movie, the FBI stands around talking about Dillinger but never accomplishes anything. Much of that last quarter of the film is also devoted to the idea that organized crime is growing and pushing out flamboyant outlaws like Dillinger, but while that may be an interesting point of discussion, it contributes very little dramatically.<br/><br/>Public Enemies tries to focus on Dillinger the man, the myth, the popular phenomenon, the historical symbol and the cultural linchpin all equally. The result is a story that never gives you enough in any of those categories. It's like the filmmakers never decided if this was a period drama, a biography, a social commentary or even whether it was a summer blockbuster or some small independent flick. So while they've got a lot of interesting parts, they never build anything with them.<br/><br/>I think the core of this movie was supposed to be the contrast of Purvis and Dillinger, not as good vs. evil but as competing societal forces. Dillinger was supposed to be freedom and personal power but also selfishness, irresponsibility and barbarism. Purvis was supposed to represent justice and order, but also oppression and control. I think the story was meant to be about how America in the 1930s was starting to shift from a Dillinger world to a Purvis civilization and how that was a mix of good and bad. But these filmmakers either gave up on that idea or added in so much nonessential stuff that it got lost.<br/><br/>Director Michael Mann also made extensive use of hand held digital cameras in making this film, so in many respects it looks more like something on TV than a big screen film. On the one hand, that gives some of the more traditionally shot scenes a strong sense of realism. On the other hand, some scenes look like they were filmed by a local TV news camera crew. And not one from the good station in town, but from that 3rd place station nobody watches.<br/><br/>There are a lot of individual moments in Public Enemies that are entertaining, however you can't say that about the entire movie. If you're willing to indulge this film's faults, you'll probably enjoy it. If you're more demanding than that, you'll probably be disappointed."
"Rodrigo_Amaro","5","1","1","5 September 2010"," Opportunity thrown into the wind
","The right director, the right cast, the perfect sets, and a great story to be told for the upcoming generations. Everything seemed great and this film surely looked a promising potential Oscar nominee but something was missing: A good screenplay. As Hitchcock said one time ""The script, the script and the script"". That's what makes a good movie; that's what makes the difference between a memorable movie and a trashy movie. But ""Public Enemies"" is not trashy neither is memorable, it is just weak. Weak in almost everything and that lies on the hands of the people who wrote it without thinking on the public. <br/><br/>The movie focuses on John Dillinger's greatest moments while robbing banks, escaping of jails and the police, and also his romantic life. This is the villain (here played by Johnny Depp). Tracking this bad guy and many others is FBI agent Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) and his team of young agents. This is the good guy. I just presented these opposite forces of the story because the rest is equal as any other films of the genre even reminding us of another work of director Michael Mann ""Heat"" where you have these two guys on the different side of the law fighting each other with all their forces (brilliant film). ""Public Enemies"" could have been just like ""Heat"", it could have been like ""The Untouchables"". It could have been a memorable film in terms of everything. You may wonder why all this dislike? <br/><br/>1) Weak screenplay, it needed a better development of action scenes, lack of criticism on the main character and a plausible explanation of what they're doing and why they're doing it; a point of view worth seeing was missing here. The whole aspect Mann wanted as letting the main characters been played realistic was totally wrong because in the end of all you can't care enough for these two guys, they're dead on scene, very stone cold figures with no trace of likable things. People needed someone to cheer up throughout the film. 2) a anti-climatic ending; 3) Unrealistic things (such as the guy shot on the head being able to talk who shot him (very laughable scene); 4) it moves in so many different genres, very indefinable; 5) Considering the ensemble casting of this film no actor was outstanding here (except Stephen Lang who was very good); 6) Many of the technical aspects dragged the viewer out of the movie such as HD camera work (for a story set in the 1930's it was a awful aspect); the musical score composed by Elliot Goldenthal was wrongfully played at times and even worst than that he copied himself using a excerpt of his score from ""Michael Collins"" (those who have a great ear for music and a good film memory knows that Mann rejected a piece of music of Goldenthal in ""Heat"" that was later used at the end of Neil Jordan's film); and some viewers noticed a familiarity with the score of ""The Thin Red Line"" so can we say plagiarism? 7) The movie runs for too long, it bores a lot.<br/><br/>But it is good for a few things. The art direction and the costumes was interesting to see, very well made; the editing is not that bad as people say it is, it has some shaky camera but it's not so bad. And again Stephen Lang's performance stealing the show of Bale playing a FBI agent. As for Depp, Bale, Marion Cotillard, Billy Crudup, Channing Tatum, David Wenham, James Russo and company it was just another film added in their filmographies. Nothing more! <br/><br/>Good premise for a film but I didn't involved me. Writers thrown a great opportunity to the wind. Good old times when James Cagney was the real thing playing a truly ""Public Enemy"". 5/10"

","The newest Michael Mann film to date so it should be good right? Well no.<br/><br/>The good points first.<br/><br/>There is a level of quality to a Michael Mann film, a look, that lets you know you are watching a Michael Mann film. This is present in Public Enemies.<br/><br/>A story created around two central male figures and their place in their world is also inevitably here.<br/><br/>But this is also where Public Enemies shows its failings.<br/><br/>We have the characters place in the world but it isn't a world we care about. Their goals don't draw you in and in the case of the character of Dillinger his goal isn't clear. He cares for a woman but you're left wondering why? as we are given such a brief introduction to her. This is not to say the actors, with the exception of Bale, are not in acceptable form just that they aren't given enough to work with and consequently you don't really care.<br/><br/>Bale is perhaps giving his worst performance to date, fewer roles might see us getting a higher standard from Bale but this has to be his worst, with an accent that almost draws a giggle and a performance that isn't believable.<br/><br/>Superficially Public Enemies looks and sounds good. Everything is in place for a good film and yet it doesn't work. Sometimes a film no matter what the ingredients is just kind of boring.

"TreyLovesMovies","4","1","1","17 August 2010"," Public Enemies is an unfocused mess of a movie.
","Shot almost entirely hand-held on digital cameras, Michael Mann's Public Enemies feels like a home movie shot with a professional budget, its hard to comprehend cinematography fitting hand in hand with an unfocused story.<br/><br/>We open the film with John Dillinger, played by Johnny Depp, being led into a federal prison for robbery. As he is being processed, his gang is inside preparing for a daring escape, and Dillinger seems confident that he won't be there for long. After the escape, Dillinger and his crew launch into a spree of bank robberies, elevating him and his policy of only stealing the bank's money to fame and legend. To stop Dillinger, the director of the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup) assigns hotshot agent Melvin Pervis (Christian Bale) to head up the field office in Chicago, Dillinger's stomping grounds. Amidst the ensuing robberies and daring shootouts, members of Dillinger's gang are killed while he finds love in the form of Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard).<br/><br/>The romance between Dillinger and Billie is one of the biggest problems of the film. There is almost no chemistry between them, nor do we really understand why they fall in love. The whole affair feels incredibly forced and phony, almost as if we are lacking some key information that would make us connect with the doomed couple. Some may argue that this was a choice by Mann and since both performances are so good, I understand how it would be easy to come to this conclusion. However, if this is the case, it was a poor choice on his part, as during the final parts of the film when we are asked to actually care about their relationship we have no reason to do so. There is simply no development between the two characters, which must have been a theme of the movie as it occurs with literally everyone.<br/><br/>When I think about the gangster flicks during the height of the film noir movement, I remember how even the most insignificant gang member was given some form of development that makes them stick out. Sure, in lesser films these little instances of development were usually bogged down with clichés such as ""the violent one"", ""the nice one"", ""the guy who likes guns"", and so on, but it worked, it helped me care about people I would find repulsive in real life. ""Public Enemies"" doesn't attempt that at all. I found myself becoming confused as to who was who in the film among the various criminals. Dillinger's gang seemed like a mish mash of random bodies to be shot (even his close ""friend"" Red) and the other gangsters seemed like equally blank stand ins who exist solely to die in ways that beg us to care.<br/><br/>What's even more unforgivable is how unfocused the story of Dillinger himself feels as the movie progresses. The film seems to jump from event to event with no logic or reason. Maybe his development is happening between the scenes? By the climax of the film when he's reduced to a desperate man I started thinking about how powerful such circumstances would have been had we been watching a movie that actually knew where it was going and had a point. This is the movie's biggest downfall and one that ultimately killed it for me. Mann is presenting us Dillinger as is, with no explanation or reason, just slapping him up on the screen as if we are watching a documentary. Maybe some will be pleased with this choice, but for me, it makes for a poor movie and an ever poorer drama. If I don't care for a character, a movie fails, and if a character isn't being developed properly along with a story, I simply cannot care.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the camera work did little to improve the clarity of the film. Mann chose to shoot pretty much every scene hand-held, which began to make me feel sick about ten minutes in. This choice throws any chance for beautiful shots and montages right out the window, leaving room for an ugly and unpleasant experience that is all too familiar with a style that should have died out years ago. Hand-held is fine for certain scenes, but it is not something that lends itself well to an entire film. Combined with the who is who nature of the characters, the films cinematography made it almost impossible for me to decipher what the hell was going on.<br/><br/>Which is a pity, as there are some damn fine performances in the film. Depp was unsurprisingly good, if quite reserved as Dillinger, and Bale pulled off a admirable job as his nemesis. The best of the lot was easily Cotillard as Billie, a performance that actually made the film seem better than it actually was (such an achievement is usually Depp's doing). She was beautiful and believable, her characterization almost made me care about the relationship between her character and Dillingeralmost.<br/><br/>I'm trying to remember more of the film to critique, but I'm actually finding it hard to recall. The unfocused nature of the script and Mann's directorial choices leave the film as a blur in my mind. Even as it began to draw to a close I found myself pondering how we reached this point. How did these series of seemingly random events get us to this stage of a story? Which is a shame. The story behind the movie is a fascinating one, one that is rich with potential to turn into a great film. This wannabe docudrama is a mine of missed opportunities, an okay film that could have been outstanding. Of course, what can you expect from a film that simply presents things to you as they supposedly were, one that tries to develop the lead character with one line: ""I rob banks."""

","A hugely disappointing experience - I am a big Michael Mann fan: the coffee shop scene in 'Heat' is one of the most bristling moments of recent cinema history. Perhaps that's part of the problem. 'Heat' works because the entire film is drawing to a meeting of the colossal forces that are Lt. Vincent Hanna and Neil McCauley (played, of course, by Al Pacino and Robert de Niro). In the coffee shop scene the audience realises that what they are seeing are two sides of the same coin - they are the same people, and their confrontation can only end in self-destruction.<br/><br/>In 'Public Enemies' there simply isn't that kind of collision between the characters of Johnny Depp and Christian Bale. There's a brief, witty yet flippant meeting of the two between the bars of a jail in the first half of the film, which entirely dissolves the tension between these supposedly titanic enemies. A real flop after the fizz of Mann's previous work. In the end, I found that I just didn't care enough about the characters to stay interested.<br/><br/>The HD handy-cam style works perfectly in the slow dialogue of scenes like the race course scene, picking out every stitch in Depp's expertly tailored suits. Or in the half-light of a photographer's flare as the plane brings its prisoner onto a journalist-packed airstrip. But as soon as it tries to capture a fast-moving firefight in a cottage in the woods, the style collapses. Mann simply hasn't hit the mark with his cinematography. I have no problem with the style in general; it just doesn't work here.<br/><br/>Finally, Mann's enduring weakness with his female characters really stands out in 'Public Enemies'. When you have a screen presence such as Marion Cotillard at the beginning of the film and then take her away half way through the film, you really notice. Worse of all, to then bring her back only to beat her unnecessarily around the head for 15 minutes in a scene dangerously close to misogyny just grates. Give me more of her, and less of unwatchable shootouts in darkness please! I'm sorry, but it's an overly-long, overly-busy movie that could do with a few more days in the editing suite. 140 minutes - a real let-down for a otherwise praising Michael Mann fan."

","Did you see ""Dillinger"", the movie from 1973? No? Well, that's the one you ought to see, not this fancy fabricated Hollywood soap opera.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp fails completely in giving a strong and convincing portrait of the arrogant, extroverted, hot shot gangster named Dillinger. He is simply not the guy for such a role. To tell you the truth, I had the impression he didn't even try very hard and was permanently making an effort not to do one of those grimaces à la Jack Sparrow. Compared to Warren Oates, who masterly played Dillinger on ""Dillinger"", Depp seems to be a frightened schoolboy with a dirty nose. On the other hand, I believe that Christian Bale made a much better job in grasping the essence of the not less extravagant FBI agent Melvin Purvis.<br/><br/>I do like Michael Mann, his slow pace and his organic camera work. Nevertheless, he was never capable of portraying a strong Dillinger, who seemed more like a second rate bank robber instead of the public enemy Nr.1 that he really was. Of course, Depp's acting only strengthened this lack of strength. Mann was also incapable of providing a solid overview of the strained sometimes charismatic relation Dillinger developed towards society and police. Every attempt to do so fell too thin. As a viewer, I could not help asking myself ""oh, so this is the famous Dillinger mmmm"" <br/><br/>At the last big shooting scene, which takes place at night, Mann decides to introduce the B movie effect, as to try to place the viewer inside the war arena. Well, in my opinion, it not only felt very forced and unnatural, but it totally collided with the way he had been filming. Personally, I did not enjoy this sudden touch.<br/><br/>Not a good movie unfortunately."

Public Enemies feels like a long, drawn out TV program. Director Michael Mann's laundry list is mostly directing and writing for the idiot box. And then it hits me again – what's missin'. What's missin'? Back in the days when actors were under contract to studios they called it movie magic.<br/><br/>So, I give Public Enemies the grand bounce. I press ""eject."" Then I take Cagney's G-Men out of the barrister and set my peepers on that for 86 minutes.

Until now.<br/><br/>""Public Enemies"" has no real conceivable reason for existing. It tells the story of John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) but feels like a warmed-over and irrelevant rehash of every gangster movie that's come before it. It suffers from a serious case of identity crisis. It doesn't know whether it wants to be a character study of Dillinger, a love story about the girl he brings with him on the lam (Marion Cotillard) or about the specifics of the investigation leading to his eventual murder outside of a Chicago movie theatre. It ends up not really being about any of these things and gives its actors, all good ones, nothing to do. It's a giant bore of a film, and a long one at that.<br/><br/>Much of the film reminded me of ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" and made me wish I was watching that pretty much perfect movie instead of this one.<br/><br/>Grade: C"

As far as being a period piece goes, the costuming and sets and locations and automobiles worked fine. But sometimes it was too dark to see what was going on, and the sound was over-modulated, meaning the dialogue was unintelligible. Huge overlong gun-battles that were too loud are of course Michael Mann's trademark, so I shouldn't have been disappointed there were so many of them. I guess if you're going to do a docudrama, your only recourse is to put your trademark on it, whether you're Oliver Stone, or Michael Mann. Yawn. Zzzzzzz..... It wasn't even worth renting.

","Like David Fincher and Robert Rodriguez, Michael Mann has embraced HD, having utilized the format for three films. The transfer to blu-ray, a native hd format, is stunning, perfectly rendering the film's muted, contrasty cinematography. I would STRONGLY RECOMMEND investing the extra few bucks for the blu disc. It's one of the better editions out there.<br/><br/>The movie itself is one of the more engaging historical crime films. While taking liberties with certain facts, the central hunter/ quarry conflict propels the movie forward at a blistering pace, making the more mundane, expository passages forgivable. Similar to his other offerings, Mann's action sequences are sure-handed and tense, relying more on traditional film technique than the frenetic Paul Greengrass style. The performances are strong. Depp's portrayal of Dillinger stands out as both complex and quirky, imbuing the character with a charm that makes the audience invest in him completely.<br/><br/>Public Enemies stands out as the most precise and entertaining telling of the Dillinger story thus far."

"manningt","5","1","1","23 October 2009"," 'Heat' with tommy guns and fedoras
","An appealing recipe and list of ingredients: two equally smoldering, brooding leading men with fab jawlines; a well-chosen supporting cast; gorgeous period costumes, sets and props; an American legend based in the reality of a not-too-distant past; cops-n-robbers action and the requisite conflicted love interest who stands by her man and looks the other way despite his obvious flaws.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the finished meal isn't going to win any Foodie awards - mostly because we've all been here before with Michael Mann. Mann has made great contributions to both television and film. 'Miami Vice' is often derided as strictly an 80s phenomenon but its film-noir darkened sets, whispered dialogue and quirky supporting cast (with some unlikely gorgeous policewomen thrown in) influenced dozens of shows from NYPD Blue to CSI. 'To Live And Die In LA' was a Friedkin film but it borrows liberally from the Mann cookbook.<br/><br/>'Heat' is one of the few stylish crime thrillers of the 1990s that still feels fresh today thanks to its pacing and players and it's clear that Mann thinks so too. He can't be faulted for revisiting a successful formula but it all feels too familiar: Depp/Dillinger is a curtain-twitching DeNiro ready to skip town in 60 seconds flat, Bale/Purvis is Pacino stalking his prey and apparently never sleeping, Cotillard/Frechette is Ashley Judd wailing and gnashing teeth over her criminal boyfriend. Mann even reuses the 'criminal meets cop up close and personal before the end of the movie' scene in which the two have a staredown and exchange threats pregnant with ominous foreshadowing.<br/><br/>Many would-be Hollywood blockbusters are mindlessly edited to squeeze into a predetermined running time but at an expansive 2 hrs 20 min 'Public Enemies' feels overlong with too many lingering shots of its stars (usually a tight closeup of the eyes) and a surfeit of shaky hand-held camera work meant (apparently) to convey the frantic nature of bank jobs, police ambushes and prison breaks. The gun battles are admittedly well done with impressive sound effects and believable damage to buildings and bodies.<br/><br/>'Public Enemies' isn't a bad film and may even be a good one - it's definitely preferable to have two stars sharing screen time than to have only one (think Tom Cruise in the MI series) tearing through scenes and scenery. Unfortunately if you've already watched films by Michael Mann particularly 'Heat' the frequent moments of deja vu are too distracting to allow one to fully enjoy his latest offering."
"cre8toruk","7","1","1","16 October 2009"," Nearly but not quite
","I was really looking forward to this movie. Johnny Depp for me is one of those once in a life time actors like Erol Flynn, Clarke Gabel, John Wayne etc. The sort of actor you just go to watch no matter what the film is.....<br/><br/>Public Enemies is set in the 1930's and details the end of one the biggest crime waves in American History, adding historical references such as the formation of the FBI and the introduction of the concept of a federal i.e. cross state line crime.<br/><br/>Halfway in to the movie, I found myself wondering if it was actually going to get started, there's a lot meaningless scenes, jail breakouts and guns firing without actually hitting anyone.<br/><br/>The second half of the movie is where things really get going and the menace shown by Depp is only bettered by that of his leading ""gal"" Marion Cotillard, in under played, performance with a sense of the femme fat-ale about her. This coupled with the menace that Christian Bale, tries but ultimate fails to bring to the Agent Purvis in charge of tracking down Dillinger and his gang, all add to a movie with promise.<br/><br/>This unfortunately is where things don't quite work...I felt as though the movie didn't explain the plot to me, perhaps as a non American not knowing the story of Dillinger etc put me at a disadvantage, but the tag line of the movie talks about a crime wave, but the viewer isn't shown in any real way (apart from a couple of bank jobs) anything like a crime wave. The FBI seem to know where to find Dillinger at every turn and there's a real sense of inevitability about the brutal ending.<br/><br/>To that end I was disappointed not because this is a bad movie with a bad plot badly acted with bad direction in 99.9% of it in fact the reverse is true... I guess I hate feeling like I wanted to see more, know more and for the film to never end, I guess that makes it a success, but I have a feeling there won't be a Public Enemies 2, so I'm left not really knowing any more than when I started.<br/><br/>The caption at the end says that Purvis killed himself a year later but doesn't really explain why and like wise the film pays little attention to character definition and I think it suffers because of it. I'm giving it 7 out of 10 only because a movie with Johnny Depp in it deserves 7 out of 10 just because of that fact...It could have been better."
"fenderfrank86","7","1","1","30 July 2009"," John Dillinger: like the film, good and bad at the same time
","In the following review, when I say something is good or bad, I mean in my opinion. <br/><br/>I'll get right to it. PUBLIC ENEMIES is a good film. But not a great film. It's based on the book of the same name by Brian Burrough. If you want to know what really happened, I recommend reading this book. It's well researched and Burrough writes better than 99% of the writers alive today. <br/><br/>The movie uses some of the facts presented in the book, but jumbles them around to fit the Hollywood standard. (SPOILERS) The biggest change is the timeline. Pretty Boy Floyd and Baby Face Nelson died after Dillinger did. A few others:<br/><br/><ul><li>In the movie Dillinger sees that a female hostage is cold and gives her his coat. In reality it was Harry Pierpont, one of the other gang members. - Hoover uses the term 'G-Men' in his press conference. In reality he wasn't so happy with the term. And it wasn't until later that 'G-Men' was widely used.</li></ul><br/><br/>Another element that really bugged me was the whole persona of Melvin Purvis. In the film he's shown as a hero, shooting gang members here and there, while in reality he did more things wrong than right. He was a heroic, and no doubt a good man, but from what I've read, not a very competent Special Agent. There are a lot more factual errors, but you can read about them right here on IMDb. <br/><br/>I think Johnny Depp was miscast. He bears no resemblance to Dillinger; not physically nor emotionally. Dillinger was a farm boy, and I don't believe he ever said: ""I'm having too good a time today, I ain't thinking' about tomorrow."" I think they got Dillinger all wrong. The same goes for Melvin Purvis, but I said that already. <br/><br/>Then the good parts of the movie. Giovanni Ribisi has a small part as Alvin Karpis, and it looks as if Karpis is alive on the screen. Ribisi looks like him and plays Karpis exactly how I thought he would be. The same goes for Jason Clarke, who makes an excellent Red Hamilton and for Stephen Graham, who clearly enjoys playing the notorious Baby Face Nelson. <br/><br/>The Little Bohemia shoot-out is well-filmed and perhaps the best scene in the movie, together with the Biograph Theatre scenes. <br/><br/>I obviously need to watch the movie again, because it's hard to notice all the details films like these offer in one viewing. My conclusion is however: if you want to be entertained and don't care too much if the movie sticks to the facts, you will probably not be disappointed."
"DICK STEEL","7","1","1","30 July 2009"," A Nutshell Review: Public Enemies
","It looks like Michael Mann just can't get enough of playing cops and robbers, and with previous efforts from Heat to Miami Vice, he just about goes to show that he can weave some exciting scenes of pursuit, testosterone charged shoot em ups, and parallels between those on opposite sides of the law. What more, he has the services of Johnny Depp and Christian Bale as his leading men, set in a time during the Great Depression where desperate men turn to desperate measures to survive.<br/><br/>Mann doesn't waste time and puts you smack in the middle of the story, introducing you to the John Dillinger (Depp) character through a very daring prison break. Not his of course, but orchestrated by him to free his merry men, to form his band of brothers to rob banks with. Unfortunately though, the bank robberies that made it to the final cut wasn't as sexy as those in the trailer, and doesn't offer you too much techniques or tactics into breaking into those bank vaults full of cash, and neither does it add to the Dillinger character other than one-liners telling the public that this is nothing personal, highlighting his code of honour even amongst thieves.<br/><br/>As for Christian Bale's lawman Agent Melvin Purvis, he gets introduced opposite Channing Tatum's Pretty Boy Floyd, and gets put in a no-nonsense light somewhat like an Elliot Ness type, and gets personally handpicked by J Edgar Hoover (chillingly played by Billy Crudup) to lead the charge in capturing Dillinger. With pride in serving in the very roots of the FBI's formation, and with great belief in the force's standard operating procedure and cutting edge (at the time) scientific methods, Purvis comes across as a very straight laced contrast to Dillinger's free-wheeling, devil may care attitude. Which of course sets up the initial differences between the two men more than just merely being on the different sides of the law.<br/><br/>However, Public Enemies seem to be, like Dillinger, always in a hurry. While it's paced incredibly well to plough through its rich material of a famous American bank robber during the Great Depression era, very little gets said about him as a person other than his romantic pursuits. His romance with Marion Collitard's Billie Frechette seemed to stick out like sore thumb and presented a tangent in the narrative, with too much desperate focus on it being that sliver of a personal piece on the notorious bank robber. Collitard had little challenge in a role which began quite interestingly with the romantic games people play, but fizzled out with time, being no more than a glorified flower vase in a role that could've been tackled by any fresh faced ingenue.<br/><br/>Mann seemed to be pulling his punches with a lot of subplots going underdeveloped. There were plenty to be explored, such as the code of loyalty between Dillinger and his band of merry men, or even the formation of the FBI could've been tackled in more depth especially since the film included the grilling of the unpopular J. Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup), whom I felt had enough fuel for a tussle of hearts for Melvin Purvis to handle. I can already imagine with John Woo at the helm, sans the more balletic gun fights, these are areas that Woo would probably exploit, and areas which could have made this a more interesting, meaningful film than a shiny, glossy one. Not to say that Mann didn't try, which can be seen in those excellent scenes with Dillinger not being able to keep up with the times of white-collared crime versus brute-force robbery with diminishing returns, and being written off as old- fashioned. That too was in great contrast again to the FBI's newer, modern methods, which didn't prove to be as successful as the tried and tested process of crime investigations and problem solving.<br/><br/>So what's the verdict of the match up between Johnny Depp and Christian Bale? Like Mann's Heat which had the much touted about pairing of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino on opposite sides of the law, or like other much touted collaborations such as Ridley Scott's American Gangster starring Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe, which is another biography of a more contemporary gangster, Public Enemies join that list in having its star billing spending less than a handful of screen time in the same frame. They rarely meet since they are adversaries on opposites, though here when they do, it's nothing more than some mediocre exchange of words. Nothing too exciting about it, which is somewhat of a pity since these two gentlemen are just about the hottest property in Tinseltown right now.<br/><br/>With cameos by Leelee Sobieski and Channing Tatum as Pretty Boy Floyd in blink and you miss roles, Public Enemies felt a little short-changed in depth, with wasted potential from being a contemporary classic such as how Brian De Palma's classy The Untouchables which was also set around the same period, with a famed lawmen and an infamous crook as its lead characters."
"kunalkhandwala","7","1","1","19 July 2009"," Aesthetic rendition of a true story though well short of being Great
","The 1930s was the era of the Great Depression in America when one man chose to thwart the authorities by robbing banks consistently in the most audacious fashion. John Dillinger was an outlaw romanticized as a folk hero for his contempt for authority but that hardly seems as enough reason for him to achieve the celebrity status of his days. Melving Purvis (Christian Bale) is on the Dillinger hunt with a capable force that he would rather not lose to unscientific methods of crime investigation. With this, Michael Mann, who gave us 'Miami Vice' and 'Heat', attempts to depict the crime saga of the 1930 era in a stylish fashion but falls short of making it a superior crime drama. <br/><br/>The movie starts with Dillinger breaking some of his friends out of prison in one of the better sequences of the movie. Soon, after robbing banks in an inglorious and rapid fashion (unklike Mann's 'The Insider'), Johnny falls in love with Billie Frechette after a bold and straight-forward encounter at a posh restaurant. We have seen love stories in a crime drama involving gangsters and one cannot help but recollect those moments from 'Scarface' or even 'American Gangster' but Dillinger and Billie's relationship lacks the connect that can engage you in the diversion from all the robberies and shootouts. Dillinger is a rebel with a cause in a depression-hit America but the reasons for it are unknown and that makes the viewer dispassionate towards his character's importance. The same goes with Melvin Purvis who is initially seen shooting a most wanted criminal in an orchard but his iconic status as the good man in the story is under toned and under performed. Purvis is constantly challenged while being a straight arrow cop who is simply upholding the law with a special team and being outwitted by the Public Enemy #1.<br/><br/>The only character insight we really see is Dillinger's refusal to abandon friends, colleagues and loved ones to the extent that it brings his own fall. John Dillinger's character, at least in Mann's direction, lacks the cool factor of a cold blooded villain like Tony Montana in 'Scarface' (""say hello to my little friend"")or Frank Lucas in 'American Gangster' (as he shoots a rival on the street outside the diner) or Robert De Niro in 'The Untouchables' (murdering his associate during a meeting) . Well, if not the villainy, he even lacks the wittiness and suave of Frank Abagnale in 'Catch me if you Can'. The character of Dillinger is so loosely crafted that even after Johnny Depp's best attempt, he only manages to keep you in the theater for the 2 ½ hour duration with mixed interest. The film rides on his shoulders and he manages to carry only his role but not the entire movie. <br/><br/>The film's cinematography is impressive and renders the vintage look of the 30s. More of the look has been focused upon than the 'feel' of the movie and that perhaps is its downfall. On the other hand, unlike the other crime and gangster movies mentioned earlier, 'Public Enemies' fails to take sides. One isn't totally convinced by the ways of either John Dillinger or Melvin Purvis and the ambivalence makes it harder to engage oneself with characters and the conclusions that the movie draws. Christian Bale's performance of a loosely drawn character is at best – unremarkable while Johnny Depp gets a few one-liners and charisma that make him look bigger than the character written for him. One will remember 'Public Enemies' for Johnny Depp if at all but not in the same manner as one would remember 'Pirates of the Caribbean' for Captain Jack Sparrow. <br/><br/>The film fails to highlight some essential aspects of the movie that may have aroused greater engagement from the viewer. These include the heroic status of John Dillinger in a depression-hit economy of America, his reason to choose the path he chose, Melvin Purvis' background or character insight and the rise of the FBI after failed attempts of local judiciaries to fight crime due to geographic limitations. <br/><br/>However, there are some highlights in 'Public Enemies' that cannot be ignored. The opening scene of the prison-break is brilliantly directed in an almost choreographed manner, the cabin shoot-out is violently breath-taking with exemplary high def camera work and the inevitable conclusion of the film's 'villian' is caught in some brilliant cinematography as well. In the end, it is these few moments and Johnny Depp's coolness that manage to leave an impact but they sadly are not enough to make Public Enemies a brilliant film or a remarkable depiction of a true story about John Dillinger.<br/><br/><ul><li>7.010 on a scale of 1-10.</li></ul>"

"isabelle1955","Null","1","1","12 July 2009"," Off to a Slow Start.
","Personally I thought the first third of Public Enemies was rather disjointed. Had I known nothing about the background to the story, I might have been struggling. I sat in my seat with a slight sense of disappointment, but not quite able to put my finger on exactly what wasn't working for me. Then, about one third of the way into the movie, maybe slightly less, it picked itself up, and I started to enjoy it. Maybe it was the appearance of Marion Cotillard as Johnny Depp's love interest that livened things up and made everyone suddenly multi dimensional? Or perhaps it's just that we expect so much of star Johnny Depp, and so much of director Michael Mann, that anything less than utter perfection is bound to disappoint? Public Enemies is certainly one of the better movies I've seen so far in 2009, and I watch a lot of movies. But it didn't really live up to the high expectations I'd set for it. Good? Yes. Great? No.<br/><br/>Let's be honest here, any movie featuring my two favourite actors on screen at the same time – Depp and David Wenham – would have to be pretty dire to truly disappoint me, and I simply cannot see Depp getting involved in anything dire, can you? But this isn't Bonnie and Clyde, although it may well have had ambitions in that direction. It will not be seen as a classic of the gangster movie genre.<br/><br/>Depp, as always, is charismatic, as Public Enemy No. 1 bank robber John Dillinger in the Mid West of the depression era. This guy was no Robin Hood, and the movie doesn't gloss over the slaughter and mayhem his gang caused. When the movie opens, the gang is being busted bloodily out of jail. They set off on a string of bank and train robberies across the Mid West, upsetting not just the authorities but also the Mafia, for whom Dillinger is a renegade, a free agent and a nuisance beyond their control. Crime has moved on, they tell him at one point, beyond the freelance small time gangs such as his, into massive organized crime such as wire fraud. Against this backdrop, J. Edgar Hoover (a very good Billy Crudup) is trying to set up the FBI, a force able to pursue outlaws across state lines. Christian Bale plays Melvin Purvis the G Man tasked with tracking Dillinger down, but it's a rather one dimensional performance. Eventually Dillinger is betrayed by a supposed friend, a woman who will be deported if she doesn't finger him.<br/><br/>The performances are all pretty good. I especially liked Cotillard as Dillinger's girl, Billie Frechette, and Diane Krall puts in a brief appearance as a night club singer. The sound track is good and the cinematography just fine, the time period is lovingly recreated. But somehow, for me, it never really rose above the sum of its parts to become the truly exciting film it should have been with a director and a cast this good. It lacks that extra magic that distinguishes a good film from a great one. As I said above, good but not great."

","Watching Johnny Depp's John Dillinger, I couldn't help conjuring up in my mind images of Brat Pitt's (another super-star with a 4-letter name with the last two repeated) Jesse James from two years ago, and started wondering whether he would have been a better Dillinger. Depp's popular persona, after all, seems too campy for the one-time most wanted criminal. But after a while, Dillinger's introvert and surprisingly subdued character started to take shape on the big screen, something better suited Depp so long as he keeps is campy side in check.<br/><br/>Compare with JJ's infuriatingly (to some) slow-burn, Public Enemies is fast-paced (ANYTHING is, in that context). The dramatized bio of Dillinger recycles around the circle of bank robbery – capture – prison break, which would have been somewhat banal had not been for Michael Mann's mesmerizing direction. The stunning visual under his signature digital works brilliantly.<br/><br/>Another asset is the love story, which takes up a large part of the movie (even the time when it is not played out on the screen). Oscar-calibre Marion Cotillard as girlfriend Billie Frechette captures the heart of the audience first with her ravishing beauty and later her portrayal of the loyalty and courage when ""slapped around"" by FBI agents. Her final scene, when the love motif ""Bye-bye blackbird"" was evoked, is heartbreaking, even if melodramatically so.<br/><br/>Christian Bale's FBI agent Melvin Purvis, sworn Dillinger-hunter, is more iconic than substantial – grim, taciturn, determined. A slightly unrecognizable (compared with Almost Famous, Big Fish or The Good Shepherd) Billy Crudup displays some flare as J. Edger Hoover in his younger days. Adding to the general interest of frequent moviegoers is a parade of familiar to half-familiar faces – David Wenham, Channing Tatum, Giovanni Ribisi, Leelee Sobieski, just to name a few. While not something that you'll you'll include in your ""top 50"" list, Public Enemies is an entertaining movie and a visual treat (in more ways than one)."
"tchockythegreat","7","1","1","9 July 2009"," Low-key, but engaging...mostly
","Considering the track record of director Michael Mann when it comes to making crime dramas (Collateral, The Insider, Heat), I found myself surprised by the direction he took with Public Enemies. Instead of a nail-biting suspense movie set in the 1930s, I found myself watching a fairly low-key drama about the fall of one of America's most notorious criminals.<br/><br/>Audiences who come to watch Public Enemies expecting it to be a swashbuckling crime film will likely leave the theater disappointed. Some critics and film fans have faulted Mann for not putting enough adrenaline into this movie, and truth be told, at times his insistence on keeping this movie low-key as a whole does get a bit tiresome. Because of the film's overall lack of suspense, it finds itself relying heavily on the performances of its actors to keep audiences engaged. And for a crime drama without much suspense, that is asking a lot. Fortunately, the cast of the film is generally up to the task.<br/><br/>In terms of the performances in the movie, Johnny Depp is the standout, hands down. Film fans who know Depp only as Captain Jack Sparrow likely will be shocked by his understated and effective performance in this movie, which is a refreshing change-up for him, given his recent track record of films. Depp's best scene in this film, in which his John Dillinger tries to woo Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard) at her job with a smörgåsbord of tough talk, is a perfect testament to why practically every girl alive is currently infatuated with him. Similarly, Christian Bale plays a role against type, portraying FBI agent Melvin Purvis, a promising agent who finds himself somewhat in over his head after he is assigned by the fledgling Bureau to track Dillinger down. His performance is not quite as effective as Depp's, but nevertheless is a welcome change of pace for him after he mailed it in as John Connor in his last film (Terminator Salvation). Cotillard does a solid if unspectacular job as Frechette, while Billy Crudup's J. Edgar Hoover is entertaining but slightly more cartoony than it should have been.<br/><br/>Mann's depiction of the 1930s Midwest, oddly enough, lacks much visual evidence of the Great Depression, and the film as a whole would have been better (especially considering the film's overall lack of suspense throughout) had he sacrificed some of the film's more melodramatic moments in order to give the audience a clearer idea of just how important the Dillinger case was in modernizing the way crime is fought in America, as well as how much Dillinger himself captured the imagination of Americans as a then-modern-day Jesse James. Nevertheless, Mann was clearly valuing substance over style while making this movie. For example, the violence in this film is played out in a fashion that stresses realism over showiness, even when the intensity of it is dialed up a bit, which is a nice change of pace from the stylized insanity of the violence found in many other crime flicks.<br/><br/>Though far from being a dramatic masterpiece, I found Public Enemies to be a welcome breather from much of what has been passing as entertainment in movie theaters these days."
"Billroom","4","22","74","28 June 2009"," A big disappointment
","I saw Public Enemies at a preview the other day. I am sorry to say I was quite disappointed with the movie. Being old enough to remember those days (and a movie buff, I might add), when I saw the trailers on P/E, I couldn't wait to see it. One of the best actors, Johnny Depp, was starring in it. Some of my disappointment was in the way Mann filmed it. Very much of it was filmed in tight close-up. This denied us seeing groups of characters conversing, switching to close-up for each bit of dialogue. Much of the movie was filmed in darkness, so in some scenes all we saw were flashes of gunfire. Agent Purvis (Christian Bale) had the worst South Carolinian accent I've ever heard - and must have realized it himself when later in the movie he abandoned it all together. The movie did very little to establish character identification. It took quite awhile to find out who Pretty Boy Floyd was or who Baby Face Nelson was. I thought the continuity of the movie was terrible. Heck, the movies of the 30s and 40s did better jobs of characterizing gangsters of that era. The one thing I did like was the actual showing of the Biograph theater. It brought back memories of a day long, long ago, when I went to the Biograph during a visit to Chicago."

"qormi","2","4","9","3 July 2009"," Public Enema
","This movie was historically inaccurate. In reality, Dillinger's story was much more fantastic and unbelievable. What right does the producer of this film have to change history? One example is the Bohemian Lodge case. Red did not die there. They all escaped. Nelson was killed four months after Dillinger; Pretty Boy Floyd was killed three months after Dillinger. In the film, both were shown to have preceded Dillinger in death.<br/><br/>Depp was smug and subdued; sort of a snotty gangster. This role could have been out of his range. He seemed too skinny and punkish. Stephen Graham, who portrayed Baby Face Nelson, actually looked like him and was able to portray the viciousness of the real person. Christian Bale was solid as Purvis. One thing about the directing: It was awful. The movie consisted of one extreme closeup after another. It happened so frequently that one scene where the camera panned up Christian Bale's face so that you looked up his nostrils prompted laughter from the audience. Marion Cotillard has ugly brown stains on the tips of her upper front teeth. I felt like her dentist staring into her extremely close-up mouth. The scene where they had sex was again filmed so close up that I thought the creases on the soles of her feet were her butt cleavage. What will Mann do in his next film? Use a microscope instead of a camera? And don't get me started on the shaky-jumpy camera technique. The camera panned around and quivered constantly; annoying. The final scene at the Biograph neglected to show Dillinger run into an alley. It also left out the fact that several people were injured by bullets and debris in the carnage. Could have been much better. Depp, like DeCapprio, is a grown man with boyish features. He encountered problems portraying Dillinger much like Leonardo Decapprio had trouble portraying Howard Hughes."
"dougmcnair","4","3","6","11 August 2009"," Why did they do so little with so much?
","Public Enemies is an unfortunate case of a director focusing all his attention on the star to the detriment of the story. And this is doubly disappointing since the story is a true one that captivated America and defined an era. How could anyone take such fertile material and make it so dull? The film is a plodding, cliché-ridden exercise that goes out of its way to avoid character development, leaving us watching a bunch of cardboard cutouts that we neither know nor care about at any point during the film. Dillinger, Purvis and an older agent brought in from Texas are the only interesting characters, but they aren't allowed to do anywhere near enough between gunfights. None of the careful planning that went into the Dillinger Gang's bank robberies is ever shown; it's portrayed as if they just got out of a car, walked in the door and started shooting. No bank robbers who worked that way would ever survive to attain legendary status, let alone steal enough money for anyone to notice.<br/><br/>Worst of all, the fascinating relationship between Purvis and Hoover gets little attention, which is absurd. The closing credits mention that Purvis ""left"" the bureau a few years after getting Dillinger. In actual fact, Hoover's paranoia drove him to force Purvis out of the bureau for fear of being usurped by his own poster boy. Michael Mann could have improved this film tremendously by cutting an hour out of the middle and then depicting Purvis' rapid fall from grace after his triumph over Dillinger. It would have added some real drama and an ironic twist at the end: The outlaw Dillinger is loyal to his confederates unto death, while the lawman Hoover betrays his own best man. How could any director pass that up? Like everything else in this film, we can only wonder what he was thinking."
"alexfromhorn","2","3","6","9 August 2009"," Irritating, style-less, confusing,
","OK I won't tell any specific things about the movie, cause there aren't any specific things.<br/><br/>It's the story of John Dillinger (Johnny Depp)and the guy who started the FBI (Christian Bale). They chase each other again and again and again. There where a lot of more characters but I can't tell who they were because they all looked the same. Some times I did not know who shot whom cause you could not see it, especially because of the really bad camera movement. The movie is also quite dark, so sometimes you won't see a lot.<br/><br/>The whole setting used to be somewhere in the 20's or 30's but I don't think that you see that like in Road to Perdition for example. I think there was only once played a 20's song in the radio. Only once! Twice they smoked cigarettes and you have seen NO whiskey.... I don't know but I think it belongs into a 20's movie.<br/><br/>There was also no kind of climax in this movie. The tension was always on the same level, a low level. There weren't really situations with priorities. It was just chasing, shooting, chasing, shooting..... it was incredibly lame and style-less. The soundtrack was also not so good.<br/><br/>All for all I should have stayed at home. After half of the movie I was thinking ""when does that crap end?"" .... Do not watch this, it's not worth it..."
"dierregi","4","3","6","1 August 2009"," Gangsters are nice guy
","Much as I like other Michael Mann movies, I truly despised this one as a manipulative cross between ""Last of the Mohicans"" and ""Heat"".<br/><br/>From a visual point of view the movie is beautifully shot with a real feeling for the 30's, yet the scene of the chase through the woods reminds of the Mohicans. The soundtrack too is reminiscent of that movie. The scenes of bank robberies, though not as powerful as in ""Heat"", convey the same type of manic energy.<br/><br/>The love story which forms the heart of the story is also supposed to be moving and romantic like those depicted in the two other movies. Unfortunately, the two lovers of this movie are superstars Depp and Cotillard, playing a ruthless gangster and a dumb girl who think they are living the romance of century.<br/><br/>Besides presenting the tragic story of the star-crossed lovebirds Mann does his best to prove how stupid and inept policemen are. It is exactly here that lays the fraudulence of the movie: some scenes have no purpose whatsoever, but are just built to enhance the reputation of superstar Johnny Depp, playing a very romantic tragic hero. Among all, the scene of Dillinger entering the police station and walking around, without anybody challenging his presence or recognizing him, truly has no purpose whatsoever, but to prove how supremely stupid cops are.<br/><br/>The romantic angle can also be debated, with Dillinger uttering to Frechette lame sentences on the phone, such as ""I want to protect you"", while he is on the run from the police. Hard to see how he is going to protect anybody, but it does sound good. The same applied to Frechette, challenging the police while being interrogated and telling them how stupid they are. However, since she got arrested and is going to be sentenced to two years of prison, she seems hardly in the position of being the smart one.<br/><br/>Since Depp is a superstar the movie must drag on forever, and thanks to the useless of several scenes it takes quite a while before the final showdown. You can finally leave cinema with the uneasy feeling of having been taken for a ride."
"brendangcarroll","2","3","6","22 July 2009"," Overlong and Disappointing Gangsta-flick
","Sitting through this very long, tedious and meandering film I couldn't help think back to the gritty, rat-a-tat tat style of the genre's progenitors from Warner Brothers in the 1930s where pace and style ensured total audience involvement with both story and characters. Michael Curtiz would have shot this story in a crisp 100 minutes. But this is 2010 and a BIG picture must be well over two hours and have a budget of 100 million dollars - or it doesn't count.<br/><br/>It is not just the inflated length. As others here have noted, we do not really care much about Dillinger or any of the other characters in this romanticised take on historical events. The script is mostly one-dimensional and the clichés come thick and fast. Johnny Depp (a good actor capable of much better, if given the right material and well-directed) does his 'Jimmy Dean' frown and spends much of the film with a furrowed brow. Not for him the deeply penetrating character study of, say, Cagney's Cody Jarrett. Because, when it comes down to it, most of the effort in making this film went into the various bloody gun-battles all of which are staged magnificently.<br/><br/>Dramatically, however, the film is stagnant.<br/><br/>Many have observed the historical inaccuracies but for me, the dramatic license taken with chronology and actual facts would have been bearable if the film had achieved some impact. The huge amount spent on trying to capture the period also failed, largely through a complete failure to grasp the style and look of the early 30s. Hiring a lot of old cars does not achieve it and dressing the actors in period clothes is only effective if the rest fits too.<br/><br/>Dillinger's girlfriend looked as if she had just stepped off the set of 'Friends'. Her hair and her make up were totally wrong and not remotely reflective of the period. The glimpse we had of Myrna Loy in 'Manhattan Melodrama' proved it. In fact this was true of everyone else as well.<br/><br/>As for the music, yet again I wanted to scream by the end. The incidental score was so soporific and so unrelated to the action, it was as if somebody had put a CD on and left it playing. The so-called period music (especially that played in the nightclub scene near the beginning) was equally anachronistic - far too modern arrangements of songs from the era. This is inexcusable as the original arrangements from most of the great bands of that time still exist. The atmosphere was all wrong as result. (I kept thinking back to Ray Heindorf's brilliant use of period songs in the score to Raoul Walsh's 'The Roaring Twenties' back in 1939.) <br/><br/>So, here was yet another example of how Hollywood has lost the knack of doing this kind of film well. Inflated, overlong, overly violent, and obsessed with effects. Comic strip action for adults and a paper thin script that leaves one unmoved, unimpressed and unlikely to want to ever see it again.<br/><br/>One reviewer here said he is looking forward to the Director's Cut with some scenes restored.<br/><br/>Please God NO! 140 minutes of this were quite enough!"
"whatsurname","2","3","6","11 July 2009"," Not ready for prime time
","This movie fails on two fronts: First, it is not a film which would draw you in as an historical documentation. Second, it wastes the talents of two brilliant actors as they did their best to portray the parts which were assigned to them.<br/><br/>I regret going to this movie, and can usually rationalize such regret, by thinking I'll get more out of it on DVD. I will NOT rent the DVD.<br/><br/>There was no way that anyone in the audience could rationally care about the life or death of any single character in this movie.<br/><br/>Briefly, here's your story: Once, America had bank robbers who enjoyed the admiration of the public. The country was suffering through the Great Depression (also not well developed in the movie), and banks were the enemies of the common man. These gangsters had (surprise!) a great proclivity for nasty violence. Oh, and they were pretty crude. As the FBI led the way in more intelligent and scientific crime analysis, it was more difficult to be a bank robber with the flamboyance of the era. So, many gangsters turned to less violent crimes which had more predictable cash flows-- centralized betting centers are but one example. The ""new"" gangster model put the ""old"" gangster models at risk. The bank robber had fewer allies in his old ""family."" So, Johnny Depp couldn't count on his gangster buddies who were modernizing their crime models. He felt forced to associate with the fewer (and stupider) people who remained in his profession.<br/><br/>A better FBI did the job against a smaller population of high profile bank robbers, because stupidity was a poor weapon to employ when you had no friends to protect and hide you.<br/><br/>Movie goers are obliged to wait for about 45 minutes while Johnny Depp weaves his way into his eventual demise.<br/><br/>Tedious and moderately entertaining.<br/><br/>If you are going to see great actors in a dreadful movie, this one is for you."

","Director Michael Mann has given us a stylish gangster film, the kind that Warner Bros. used to make in the studio days with someone like James Cagney as Cody Jarrett in WHITE HEAT.<br/><br/>This time the gangster is real-life public hero, John Dillinger, played in JOHNNY DEPP style by the actor who is convincing as the man who, from the very opening scene, plans a prison break that Mann has filmed with startling realism that jumps off the screen. I say hero because that was the public's perception during the Great Depression of any man who could thwart the authorities and rob banks with such authority and skill.<br/><br/>MARION COTILLARD is the love interest, the only angle of the film that reminds one of Hollywood hokum, the way the gals were always featured in the Cagney and Bogart crime melodramas--but she plays her part well and is especially strong in some of the final scenes where the police are giving her a brutal interrogation in an attempt to locate Dillinger.<br/><br/>Technical credits are all excellent, including the photography and background music, evocative of the '30s settings. Interesting use of some Billie Holiday songs on the soundtrack are combined with an effective and unobtrusive soundtrack by composer Elliot Goldenthal.<br/><br/>The only weakness is that most of the other supporting members are given little character development to work with--but since the camera is almost always on Depp as Dillinger, who gives a riveting performance, this can easily be overlooked. Good chemistry between Depp and Cotillard is an asset.<br/><br/>There are only two other main characters of interest--Christian BALE as Melvin Purvis and BILLY CRUDUP as J. Edgar Hoover. Both are excellent. Bale comes across as a basically decent man from Tennessee who is practically forced into becoming an enforcer by Hoover who is anxious to get his Federal Bureau of Investigation started. His first job is to go after Pretty Boy Floyd. When Floyd is killed, Hoover knows he found the right man for the job of hunting down Dillinger and his gang.<br/><br/>The shootouts are exceptionally well staged and there are many of them throughout the story of one of America's most famous outlaws. Although the film runs two hours and twenty minutes, there is seldom a lull in the storyline, thanks to some very impressive direction by Michael Mann and some fine performances from the cast.<br/><br/>The windup concludes with Dillinger attending the Biograph theater to see Clark Gable, William Powell and Myrna Loy in MANHATTAN MELODRAMA. When the police learn that he has a choice of two theaters, one of the detectives asks what's playing at both. We know they made the right choice for their ambush when a detective says with assurance, ""John Dillinger isn't going to see a Shirley Temple movie!"""

","This movie was one of the best this year. I think that all the crap that producers are pushing out is getting old and viewers are getting tired of disappointments like Watchmen and Wolverine. So a lot of people are saying that this was a ""swing and a miss"" or ""Not worth the time."" But in reality this was actually a hard one to forget. <br/><br/>At first, this seemed predictable and in some parts it was. The story was not unheard of, a man who gets a lot and looses what he most loves in the end, and by the way if you care enough about the history in the movie, to wright about it, than you shouldn't see this movie or any movie based on history. Well Johny Depp does not disappoint with this one. He looks a lot like Dillinger and gives a certain realism that's almost hard to find in any of Johny Depp's Characters. Now if you're going to see this just because of Bale than you should reconsider because most of his screen time is usually not focused on him. Which brings us to the camera. The camera in this film is set for realism, action, and desperation, which the film gives all of these with open arms. The camera is some what shaky and the picture is not as high quality but they get the job done on this film perfectly, frame by frame. <br/><br/>But the thing that made me like this picture so much was how you could actually see desperation in Dillinger's eyes and how you feel sympathy for the characters. This is one flick you should see and you won't be disappointed and it's one that could be someone's favorite. P.S. This is a Action\Drama **NOT A GANGSTER FLICK** ITS HISTORICAL"

I said it once and I'll say it again...the critics don't know what they're going on a about. I thought this was a great movie and Michael Mann, who many thought had lost his touch after the dreadful Miami Vice, still knows how to make a good film. Johnny Depp is just great in this, I was rooting for Dillinger from beginning to end, he really did a great job portraying the 1930's gangster. Almost after 20 twenty years in the business the man still knows how to churn out great performances. Christian Bale isn't far behind neither. I thought he also did a great job as Purvis, bringing the same type of commitment and energy to this role and he does with all his other films. Marion Cotillard was great as Dillinger's love interest, she continues to show she's a class act and can perform just as well as the big boys. Others include, Stephen Lang, Stephen Graham, Stephen Dorff, Billy Crudup and Jason Clarke were just great to watch as they all had a part to play in the Dillinger Story. Michael Mann hasn't lost his touch in my opinion. He still knows how to tell a story and always has the best actors to help him tell that story. All in all there's not much I can fault with this film apart from the fact it was a little too long and dragged in some places. But these can be easily overlooked, because of the performances and the fantastic gunfights which in my opinion, equal the big gunfight in Heat, which is probably the best cops and robbers movie ever made. I really enjoyed this film and I hope you do too...Go see now!"

","Johnny Depp has always been a showman, and he does it fine, but with a little of Michael Mann's help, he gave the best performance of his career as John Dillinger, not even Tim Burton could do that. Christian Bale and Marion Cotillard are also pretty good, but I think 2 acting monsters like Depp and Bale could have interacted more, but the scene where they act together is greatly performed because they speak each other like thinking ""this guy is an idiot and I'm a genius"". Michael Mann achieves to show a cynical and brutal gangster, who is at the same time a passionate romantic. We men should learn from him on how to get a girl. That makes Public Enemies the film where Mann best develops his characters and plot, specially in Film Noir, where characters have to be as good as they are evil. Speaking on Film Noir, the 30s atmosphere giving tribute to James Cagney and Clark Gable films is enjoyable. In resume, it's Michael Mann's best film."

I did not know too much about John Dillinger until I saw this movie but when I did it cleared up a lot of questions I needed answered. I found Public Enemies to be a 1930s version of Heat and another version of the movie Road to Perdition. Aside from the storyline, I will be surprised if the film does not win or is not nominated for an Academy Award for Sound. The sound of the machine gun fire and gunfire in general was very well done and deserves an award or several awards in 2010. <br/><br/>SPOILER: Even though I did not know much about Dillinger until seeing Public Enemies, I found the death scene at the end to be dead on from what I read about him. However, certain flaws I found in Public Enemies were that certain characters were killed after Dillinger in real life while they were killed before him in the movie.<br/><br/>Aside from the flaws, I believe Michael Mann did an excellent job on Public Enemies and I believe it should be nominated for Best Sound, Best Sound Effects Editing, Directing and Picture at the Oscars in 2010.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Thanks to the Kindergarten direction of Michael Mann, his weak script, and the willfully awful camera work; Public Enemies doesn't amount to anything like a good movie. Mann had two of today's best actors, Johnny Depp and Christian Bale; but each is wasted on too-little-character and too much cutsie-wootsie. Also, the filmmakers forgot entirely that Dillinger was a multi-murderer and hero only to the mentally disturbed -- the kinds of folks now sobbing over the recent death of pedophile-freak, Michael Jackson.<br/><br/>Compare this pitiful mess to 1932's ""Public Enemy"" from which the title was ripped-off. The 1932 film, still a classic after 76 years, has the authentic feel of the gangster era, believable people, downright good acting, and the solid direction of William A. Wellman. The 1932 movie had raw-edged guts, the new film just looks like dress-up.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp falls far short of Lawrence Tierney's portrayal of Dillinger in original movie.<br/><br/>There are simply dozens of excellent gangster movies -- films that will be remembered long after Public Enemies is forgotten. So OK, you say it's a cop movie, not a gangster picture. Well, Michael Mann is no match for Desi Arnaz either. Desi gave us ""The Untouchables"" the ultimate crime-fighter TV series."
"reel_emotion","8","6","17","1 July 2009"," Retelling of the Dillinger Legend with a Modern Perspective *spoilers*
","Public Enemies is a good, solid biopic of John Dillinger--with action, romance, good acting, and metaphors abounding about the nature of good and bad. I'm not sure how close director Michael Mann stuck to the facts of the story of John Dillinger, but he sure adds his trademark realism. We are brought into the world of Dillinger--the pay-offs, obtaining the cars, his ties to organized crime, his bank robbing. We are brought into the world of a forming FBI--the first uses of wire tapping and hard tactics to do whatever it takes to get their guy, Dillinger.<br/><br/>Mann picked the right actor for each role, knowing the particular strengths of both Christian Bale and Johnny Depp to bring what they did to each character. Bale brought a kind of stoicism and presence to the character of Purvis, which I don't think Depp could have. And vice versa, I think Depp played Dillinger well, and I think Bale was suited better to the Purvis character. Depp added an impish charm to Dillinger, and I was impressed by his acting, not being a fan of his acting at times. I think both men, too, were probably better suited to the physicality of their real life characters.<br/><br/>Bale plays Purvis as a new sort of G-man--able to think about the logistics of catching the criminal (wait until he buys a new coat; wiretapping) and he has the ability to use the muscle behind it (being a sharp shooter). Purvis wants to do a good job and meet his objectives--Bale says very little in the movie, but there is much in his face about how uncomfortable he feels when he ventures into morally questionable territory (basically, IMO, Dillinger is executed). Dillinger is just a simple man, really, who wants to be with Billie and have money--he's not bad, only in the fact that he'll kill anyone who gets in his way. He's made uncomfortable by Baby Face Nelson's joy and glee in violence and murder, but he doesn't really have a moral dilemma like Purvis does. In Public Enemies, Purvis and Dillinger are both the heroes while Nelson and Hoover (played well by Billy Crudup) are both the villains.<br/><br/>We can see the difference between Purvis and Dillinger during the confrontation scene at the jail. Dillinger is talkative and doesn't waste time on telling Purvis what he thinks of him, but Purvis says very little and just stares him down. During that scene (almost reminiscent of the scene between Agent Starling and Dr. Lecter in Silence of the Lambs), Dillinger questions Purvis on how it is to see someone shot down and dying....he knows that Purvis doesn't enjoy it. Throughout the movie, we see Purvis looking at each person (outlaw and G-man alike) shot down and dying. Towards the end of the film, we see Dillinger with one of his men wounded and dying--he optimistically refuses to believe the man is dying and tries to patch him up.<br/><br/>My favorite part of the movie was the romance between Billie Frenchette and Dillinger. Although most of it was played out in shallow clichés of first dances or witty repartee, it rings true. Franchette is a good girl being swept off her feet by a charming, good man who just happens to rob banks and kill people for a living. Frenchette confronts Dillinger with the inevitable--that he will eventually be caught or killed--but the cocksure Dillinger doesn't think he will be. Marion Cotillard does a good job with this role--their relationship is the key to making Dillinger a sympathetic character in the movie.<br/><br/>Character actress Lili Taylor plays the female sheriff of one of the prisons. Mann makes some surprising feminist commentary in this film--perhaps because one of the co-writer is female. We also have the interrogation scene of Billie being beaten by a brutal G-man adhering to Hoover's order to do anything necessary to make the witnesses talk. The one woman working at the FBI (secretary?) brings it to Purvis's attention when he arrives back at the office--he puts a stop to it in a very calm way. This is one of the key scenes that highlights the moral dilemma of who is the real criminal here--and is part of film's contemporary social messages that apply to our times today--in the time of such things as the 'Patriot Act.' <br/><br/>Public Enemies is an entertaining (sometimes slow) movie which can be enjoyed on many different levels."

","This movie could have been great, but the plot was just too poorly written, and the execution of it was terrible. I love watching documentary-like movies, and this movie could have had a lot of action and could have delivered a powerful message. I mean the ear of the great depression offers so much potential in terms of stories and understanding the human conditions etc. But rather than using this potential that is literally handed from reality, the movie lulls you to sleep. It is dreadfully boring - I have no idea why Michael Mann decided to make this movie approx 2 hours. The plot only offers enough material for a short 45 min movie – and this point is very evident in the movie. I literally fell asleep watching its lengthy monologues. It is not that I do not appreciate a good monologue, but these monologues seemed to be nothing more than filling and conveyed no apparent message."

","What a profound disappointment. Good costumes + good acting + good music + lousy camera work and shitty HD equipment=large wasted looking home movie. I am ashamed to have paid $12.50 to see Johnny Depp running around with an all star cast filmed with what appears to be a cheap Canon XL 1 video camera. Mann should be ashamed to film so many great stars in a format that is only good for pornography and reality TV shows. I hope everyone does not end up going this way. How disappointing. I wonder if the all star Hollywood cast knew that the final product would look so cheap, and I wonder if audiences around the country are aware that they have been swindled. I am sure this film looks fine on your home TV, but it should never have been blown up onto 35mm and projected in theaters across the country. Especially a period piece set in the 1930's."
"texasthunderhawk","10","4","10","7 July 2009"," Public Enemies: The ""Heat"" of the Gangster Era
","As I write this, I have read the mixed reviews by both professional critics and even my fellow commentators on IMDb. About how the movie is slow, meandering. Or that it's over-blown, over-long, or too stylistic. It's funny, but I can recall a similar critique of another Michael Mann movie when it premiered....<br/><br/>1995's ""Heat"" with Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino. Yes, I can clearly recall such mixed reactions. Yet, going on 15 years later, if you ask people to list their top 10 crime dramas, ""Heat"" is sure to be on the list. And I feel that someday ""Public Enemies"" will be too.<br/><br/>As someone who avidly reads about the history of the Gangster Era of the 1920's and 30's, I was not disappointed in either the filming, the writing, or the acting in this film. It was ""stylish"". But that's what made it great. It was about the style and glamor that existed in that era. How it was both stylish and glamorous to be a bank robber at the height of the Great Depression. Men like John Dillinger, ""Pretty Boy"" Floyd, Alvin Karpis, and ""Baby Face"" Nelson and others, with their cock-sure attitudes and flamboyance, were turned into heroes by the desperate public and the media despite the fact that they were little more than killers and thieves. What the movie does is analyze the mythology surrounding these outlaws and then showing us the truth about who they were and where their life of crime ultimately led them.<br/><br/>All of this brings us to the three main things that made this movie great: Johnny Depp, Christian Bale, and Michael Mann.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp as John Dillinger: Depp's Dillinger is a spot on portrayal of the kind of man Dillinger was. Indeed, he plays Dillinger as a man who knows his time is short so he lives out every moment to the fullest. This attitude is personified by Dillinger's statement ""We're having so much fun, we ain't thinking about tomorrow."" That was true of the real Dillinger. I loved the way Depp is always watchful of everything that goes on around him with a laid-back ""devil may care"" attitude and a sarcastic smile. He always seems to be on the look out and gets a private thrill whenever he manages to pull off his latest trick. However, that same attitude that makes him so lovable was also Dillinger's curse: He never contemplated when things would go terribly wrong. Which makes him so human when you see the anger and anguish in how his fool-heartiness causes the walls to crumble around him.<br/><br/>Christian Bale as Melvin Purvis, FBI: I can say it is absolutely refreshing to see Melvin Purvis portrayed as something other than a mythic ""super-lawman"". In many other previous portrayals of Purvis, he is given the mythic stature of a Wyatt Earp or Eliot Ness, declaring his greatness from the start. Here, Bale's humanizing portrayal of Melvin Purvis is as intricate and welcoming as Johnny Depp's portrayal of John Dillinger.<br/><br/>In this film, Bale portrays Purvis for what he truly was: A clean-cut man, with quiet dignity, humility, and grace who was suddenly thrust into thick of the most famous manhunts in American history. Bale's Purvis is a decent man full of compassion who is forced into situations he does not truly enjoy being in. Take his introductory scene: He is shown hunting down and ultimately killing ""Pretty Boy"" Floyd. Even though he is doing his sworn duty, Purvis doesn't take pleasure in killing Floyd. In fact, he appears to genuinely regret killing another man. At one point, J. Edgar Hoover is so determined to get John Dillinger and his gang that he orders Purvis to arrest friends and relatives and to push them hard for info on Dillinger. Purvis's immediate reaction is one of shock and moral objection. As when he kills Floyd, you can see it in his eyes: Purvis does not want to do it and he personally does not like it when he has to employ such tactics. This all culminates into an act of heart-felt compassion and chivalry when he puts a stop to a ""third degree"" interrogation. <br/><br/>Michael Mann, Director: As I said before, the stylistic approach of this film is what makes the tone so great. And when it comes to stylish crime dramas, Michael Mann is the best. He's employed such tactics on ""Miami Vice"", ""Crime Story"", ""Heat"", and ""Collateral"". And he has again succeeded in creating a vivid template to this film. One of my favorite visual devices he employs here is that hand-held camera like he used in ""Collateral"" which gives a ""reality TV"" feel to some scenes as if we're running alongside of Dillinger and Purvis. That camera style helps to add a heightened sense of realism to the moments of violence that explode off of the screen. Meanwhile, the ""traditional"" movie camera is employed to set the scene and give the film an epic, Norman Rockwell Americana feel. Working in tandem, the cameras achieve the feel I spoke of earlier of how the movie gives us the glossy veneer of the mythology and then peels it away to reveal the hard-core ugliness of gangsters beneath the surface. <br/><br/>I think all three men are worth of at least an Oscar nomination for this film.<br/><br/>In short (I know, it's too late for that!) I'd just like to say that even though the movie may seem long at two and half hours, it is NOT dull. It draws the audience in with great depth of character and then blows us back with sudden explosive violence that was true to the era. If you want the exact facts of the era, go read a book. But if you want to be entertained, go see ""Public Enemies"". You will not be disappointed."
"priest_of_zeus","1","4","10","6 July 2009"," Hurts me to say this.
","If you are a film aficionado I would strongly advise you to avoid this movie. Beginning with the points that first struck me, this film has terrible cinematography. The lighting is sloppy and sometimes left completely to natural light which serves only to leave awkward shadows or simply doesn't fulfill the needs of the scene. Second the Camera work is atrocious. the blatant overuse of hand-held home movie style camera, mixed with the low resolution digital, leaves the film with a goofy home made amateur feel. Not to mention the lack of close ups or varying angles simply leaves your eyes bored with the scenes. <br/><br/>Next is the story. Now as far as the acting goes, top notch, I really felt the actors put everything they could into this movie. The writing as well, especially Dillinger's Dialogue, was great. But the story just doesn't do it. I mean, it moves at a snails pace and constantly repeats itself, almost like your watching the same scene over again. Not to mention by the end of the movie, you honestly don't care about the characters."

What do we learn from this film? Nothing. A guy has an addiction to robbing banks? This is a D- version of ""Heat"" but with one storyline and a shadow of a love story.<br/><br/>Mann thinks he's being original by having Dillinger casually walk around a section of the police department that is dedicated to tracking him down. We've seen the kind of character bravado in WAY too many films. It is no longer original. It's boring.<br/><br/>This was incredibly painful to watch because it dulls the mind so much.

","It's a pity these three great actors were squandered on such an inferior script and so undervalued by this B- director. Apart from the fabulous sound design and the blazing tommy guns—which shoot flames in 2 directions—the film is an overproduced and under-directed snooze. Remember the prissy and purple script for Untouchables? This one is not that precious, but the performances are. It is not the fault of the actors, who have only trite or dim dialog to work with. I think they knew it was bad as they filmed it. You almost sense them looking at their reflections in the camera and making corrections to exquisite effect. Why not? Might as well be part of an artifact that looks great if it's not going to break new ground. The make-up enhances the preciosity. Everyone looks ridiculously pancaked. Producers take note: never let the make- up distract from the drama, especially one that's already so unconvincing. I had expected a thrilling script that might lay bare the world of these dazzling '30s sociopaths, born with extra Y chromosomes. Instead, I got a parade of implausibly clad Ralph Lauren mamma's boys."
"rainbowpoet","10","4","10","4 July 2009"," The Quintessential Masterpiece...The Greatest Motion Picture of All Time
","Let me start by saying this: 'Public Enemies' is exactly what a gangster flick should be. It is genuine, heartfelt realism at its finest with a pulse that never lets up and never ceases to strangle the viewer. Not once in my entire life has a movie captured my imagination and my heart with every single solitary frame. It is the only movie ever made that succeeds in creating fully realized, well-rounded, graphically fleshed-out characters without ever touching upon a single hint of back story (aside from a quick second of dialogue from the 'Maestro of Robbery' himself that reads something like this: ""I grew up on a farm. My mother died and my father beat me because he knew no other way to raise me.""). Never has a book been able to accomplish this feat. Never has any story I've encountered (and that's quite a grandiose collection of stories, given that I'm a writer myself) been able to reach the heights of this brilliance. The sheer magnitude of the experience has left me dumbstruck.<br/><br/>The film begins and ends centered around John Dillinger. Every other character, aside from Billie, Dillinger's ""Blackbird"", is just a sideshow for the main attraction. Christian Bale's Melvin Purvis fades into nothingness cloaked in the failure to capture his prey, the failure to appease his guilt...and the failure to entertain the audience. But that doesn't matter. Because each of Purvis' moments on screen belong to Dillinger, and Dillinger alone. Purvis, like all the rest of us, is just a passenger along for the ride of his life. Never is he able to escape, even (I suspect) after one of his agents kills Dillinger near the end of the film. Billie shares the same fate. While she sits in her cell after Dillinger's death, the agent who shot him enters and sits with her, at Dillinger's request (his last). He gives her a message straight from his last stage (the stage of his demise, outside the theatre in his favorite town to hold up): ""Bye bye, Blackbird."" And the film cuts to black, leaving us with our hearts in our throats and our fingers clutched on the armrests. And so ends the masterpiece unlike any other, far too soon as it is unfortunately unable to last forever."
"petralyn","5","4","10","3 July 2009"," So Boring I Fell
","asleep in several places. First, Johnny Depp was excellent as Dillinger, Cotillard wasted her talent, and Bale was a total loser for his part as Purvis. My objection to this movie is several fold: over use of hand-held shots caused severe eye strain and did not advance the story line; shot in HD and it shows by lowering the production value. When coupled with the unsteady camera, the overall effect was quite annoying. Made the movie appear to be of less than professional quality. Furthermore, the simulated gun fire was totally fake--all white with jagged edges? Why the clearly fake gunfire? However, I found the sound and sound editing to be very interesting and one of this movie's only redeeming qualities. This movie is 5 out of 10."
"duner229","4","4","10","3 July 2009"," Disappointing, frail plot, poor cinematography
","Before seeing the movie, I saw the biography of Dillinger on the Biography channel. This gave me a decent outline of how the movie would play out. And the movie did, for the most part, follow the lifeline that I learned of in his biography. BUT, the actual plot that is portrayed in the film is broken up and vague in many parts. The cinematography reminded me of someone carrying a camcorder with Vaseline on their hands (The Blair Witch Project style); it was horrible and very difficult to follow. The gun fight scenes are unrealistic and far-fetched as far as Hollywood movies go these days. The movie was an overall disappointment: see for yourself because the previews make the film look amazing."
"CaptJack4","10","4","10","2 July 2009"," Great film, both technically amazing and entertaining
","This movie was fantastic.<br/><br/>With its A-list cast, and gifted director, this movie was everything I expected from it. All of the cast members gave outstanding depictions of the real life people. It made you feel as if you know the person.<br/><br/>Depp, as always, did an excellent job. He made you really believe that even though Dillinger was a bad guy, he had some good qualities about him. Any time that a movie makes you feel sympathetic towards the bad guy, you know the actors have done a great job.<br/><br/>Bale, gave another great performance. It was nice to hear his normal voice instead of the deep batman voice as well (haha). He seemed (IMO) to give an accurate portrayal of his character. His language, body language, and just the general tone in which he said certain lines made his character believable as well. You could tell that both Bale and Depp had spent a good amount of time researching their character before filming this movie.<br/><br/>Michael Mann, has done it again. Although distracting (FOR SOME), the HD camera really seemed to bring this movie to life for me. Most of the movie was slower (which most seemed to dislike, however I understand why it was necessary), so the camera becoming blurry while trying to focus was never a big problem. The HD cams also brought the shoot outs to life. I felt like the battle was actually happening right in front of me. The muzzle flash from their guns was amazing.<br/><br/>Another plus for this movie was that all of the filming locations were historically accurate. They used all of the buildings that the events with Dillinger actually took place in. The theater, the jail, the house in the forest, the sidewalk where he was gunned down...everything was real. The fact that they were able to use these locations for filming was very shocking (For me at least). It was VERY cool to see the place where Dillinger actually stood, and with Johnny Depp's spot on portrayal of him, it seemed like the real Dillinger was their again in the present day.<br/><br/>Overall, this was an outstanding movie. Both technically, and for entertainment purposes. It had everything that it needed in it. Amazing actors, great story, historically accurate, love, comedic relief, action scenes, etc. This film couldn't have been any better, and I highly encourage everyone to see it."
"wolftab-1","5","8","26","25 June 2009"," Disappointing Bipic, but don't blame Johnny Depp
","Michael Mann's much anticipated biopic about notorious bank robber John Dillinger (played expertly by Johnny Depp) comes up short. The story of John Dillinger and how he became a notorious bank robber who liked living the good life while eluding the newly formed FBI all the while laughing at them as they kept coming up short in trying to catch him. And when they did catch him, no prison could hold him. This sounds like it would make a pretty interesting story, unfortunately, Michael Mann didn't see it that way. Public Enemies is in a wordslow. The pacing is deliberate and more importantly for a character driven drama, I didn't find much clarity in what made John Dillinger, John Dillinger. The film doesn't have any back story to Dillinger, as it takes place in 1933 after a daring prison break. We are shown that Dillinger is a man of few words, has a cool confidence, thinks big and when he wants something, he will aggressively pursue it, whether it be knocking off banks or going after women. But, one woman in particular catches his fancy, Billie Frechette, (Marion Cotillard) a hat check girl he becomes smitten with at a club. On the flip side, are the ""good guys"" of the FBI. J. Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup) is tired of all these glorified gangsters, forms a task force to get them, led by Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale). Dillinger is listed as Public Enemy #1 and Hoover tells Purvis to do whatever it takes to bring in the popular bank robber.<br/><br/>The film has a strong cast but many of them prove to be uninteresting, there are of course exceptions Johnny Depp does a very fine job as Dillinger. He played the character with strong convictions, bravura and was a likable crook. Mr. Depp seemed to know what made Dillinger tick, but aside from a few brief clues, it was not clear to me. Unfortunately, without that clarity, his character wasn't permitted to have an arc, so I was left feeling ambivalent about him and what he stood for. His acting was unforced, honest and truthful. He is fun to watch. Marion Cotillard (who was fantastic as Edith Piaf in La Vie en Rose) does an admirable job as Dillinger's moll and she had a good connection with him and their relationship looked genuine. Billy Crudup does a very nice job as Hoover. He certainly had his mannerisms and speech patterns down. It is a shame we didn't see more of him. Which leads me to Christian Bale. He seemed at a loss as to how best to bring his character to life. Judging by a fact we discover at the end, it would seem that Purvis was a conflicted man but Mr. Bale seemed to just play him with one note throughoutstoic. Not really sure how he felt about Dillinger, except for a few glimmers of dialogue. His brief scene with Depp was bereft of tension. Depp clearly had more going on. Mr. Bale seemed tired to me and who could blame him, filming this amidst The Dark Knight and Terminator: Salvation. He did seem to realize this was Johnny Depp's film and to his credit he doesn't try to outshine him. Lili Taylor makes a brief appearance and it was not a memorable one, for such a fine actress.<br/><br/>Michael Mann puts forth an earnest effort but alas this is not one of his best work; either with screenplay or direction. The film lacks suspense, drama and more often than not feels like it is going through the motions. He does a lot of research that brings a rarely seen realism to that era, especially when we see early wiretapping. The film really falls apart in the last 1/3 and the climax fizzles. Despite several good scenes scattered throughout, the film falls flat."

"cultfilmfan","10","3","7","5 July 2009"," Public Enemies
","Public Enemies is based on actual events in the 1930's during the Great Depression dealing with notorious bank robber John Dillinger and his gang of men. The film shows John robbing many different banks and hiding out from the police and Federal Bureau of Investigation, who have named him ""public enemy"" number one. The film also focuses on the man who is determined to bring John down and to have him captured once and for all. A side plot involving a romance between Dillinger and a woman named Billie, is also featured. Films like Public Enemies can go either way for me. Sometimes they are high on substance and little on a good story and more on action and style, which I do not really care for, or there are also those which are very well structured and put together and leave the viewer entertained, thrilled and marvelling at the achievement. Public Enemies for me, fell into the second category. Yes, it does have a lot of style and was made with what looks like a big budget and popular Hollywood actors like Johnny Depp and Christian Bale, but the film does have a very involving story and even though it is quite stylish and was made for quite a bit, it never goes overboard with being unrealistic, or trying to show off with a lot of special effects, or technical tricks. There is one action scene that does go on for several minutes, but I found it to be very well paced as well as quite suspenseful and thrilling, so the fact that it was a longer scene did not bother me at all. I also found that the script had enough to keep us as the viewers interested and intrigued for the entire length of the film. I also liked some of the twists and turns that the film took and revealing some of the true intentions and real motives, of these characters. The only thing I would have changed with the film was to have more of Marion Cotillard's character Billie, because I found her to be quite interesting and it was a great performance, and yet I did not feel we got to know her as well as we could of and I would have liked to have known more about her and because the performance was so good, every time she was on screen it was a real pleasure to watch. Some scenes especially near the end with her in it are quite powerful and show the range of her great acting. Johnny Depp and Christian Bale are great also, but again we do not see as much of Christian Bale's police character as we do Depp as Dillinger. Mainly the film is about Dillinger, and having being advertised that way, it was no real surprise to me that the film mainly focused on him, but I would have liked a little more of the supporting characters as well because when they were on screen, I found them to be interesting and added more to the story than if it had just been about Dillinger robbing banks the whole time. The script really does develop the characters well and as I mentioned there are some powerful moments as well as thrilling moments to capture anyone's attention. The film looks good with it's cinematography (which is digital and has brought forward some complaints) to the great looking replica costumes of the era. Public Enemies has style and a great deal of substance to really fulfill any real movie lover's expectations and I felt mine were met and I really enjoyed what I saw. One of the best films of the year."

"fender_bender2","9","3","7","3 July 2009"," Gangster in raw form
","This movie expresses gangster life with true and unsurpassed realism. Through both supreme sound quality in gunfire, and intensely bone-chilling action sequences, Public Enemies ranks among the best in gangster movies.<br/><br/>Set during the 1930's, Depp plays the role of John Dillinger - a straightforward gangster with a lot of friends in the business. Throughout the film, Depp proves more than convincing in his part rivaling the police force with his notoriety and criminal genius. I was overly pleased with how his subtle nuances gave life to his character, but only when necessary to establish a proper setting to which he accompanies. In addition, Johnney Depp adds a hint lighthearted comedy throughout the course of the movie.<br/><br/>In his role as Dillinger's hunter-counterpart (Purvis), Christian Bale finally escapes the mindset and vocal tone of the dark knight. Originally, I felt as though Christian may not have been the most suitable person to cast as a highly intuitive police official, but as the movie progressed it soon became obvious as to why he was chosen. Purvis' respect and swagger amongst the other police officials made his character all the more intriguing and added complexity and depth in the hunt for John Dillinger.<br/><br/>Following close behind Bale and Depp in fascinating characters were the well acted Marion Cotillard and Billy Crudup (to whom I give special props in diversity from Dr. Manhattan of Watchmen). Every minor detail throughout this film adds a spark of originality, making it all the more difficult to turn away.<br/><br/>On a final note, the film is well cast/acted, surprisingly action-packed, occasionally dramatic (in the good sense), follows well to the time period/true story, and realistic beyond any preceding gangster movie. The guns are crisp, loud, and powerful -- as is the rest of the film. This is one gangster movie that should not be overlooked! I only leave room for two more stars due to the semi-lacking plot progression throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, a powerhouse film for any movie-goer!"
"hjrosales","10","3","7","2 July 2009"," Michael Mann delivers on a realistic portrayal of John Dillinger
","Going into this movie I knew exactly what to expect from a Michael Mann film. ""Amateur"" camera work. I do not believe it is amateur camera work but it is used in a way to make what the audience is seeing more realistic. Think of any documentary you've ever seen or news reports; Michael Mann realizes that when we see camera angles in those types of media we associate them with reality. So in a way the movie is documentary style but in a good way. The movie is shown in a new way and I loved it. I was already a fan of Heat and Collateral. Public Enemies just looks and sounds so authentic that you appreciate all of the ""cheap"" looking camera work but I happen to believe there were many scenes were the picture looked so beautiful and crystal clear. I highly recommend this film to anyone who has a passion for realism in a movie. The acting itself was great from all members of the cast."
"ANewLeaf","7","3","7","1 July 2009"," Good, but not great.
","This movie has moments of greatness, but certain things hold it back from being as good as it could have been.<br/><br/>Casting: The good: Depp dominates the role of Dillinger, The brief moment we get Channing Tatum as Pretty Boy Floyd is stellar, Cotillard is amazing as Billie, and the best performance of the show IMO is Stephen Graham as a perfect psychotic Baby Face Nelson.<br/><br/>The Bad: Bale was miscast for a man who was small in stature and looks nothing like the brooding ominous Pruvis that the movie creates. Bill Camp is horrific as Frank Nitti not looking as imposing as Nitti truly was (his nickname was the enforcer) or even Italian for that matter.<br/><br/>Plotwise the character development of Dillinger needs work, we get told brief accounts of his past, but we see nothing and are given no emotional connections to his emotional mindset or reason he became the man he became, a major misstep. Connections between Dillinger and his close associates are never developed enough to feel the true pain of their deaths. The movie DOES pay off in the end with Dillingers own death scene and the reaction of Billie. A scene in the police station where Dillinger waltzes through the department focused on hunting him looking at pictures and asking the police the score to a baseball game was ludicrous, contrived, and unbelievable to the point of jarring one out of the immersion into the storyline.<br/><br/>The art direction of the movie is first rate though, you are IN the 1930's in this movie from the opening scene to the closing. The cars, the cloths, the guns, the food, everything just looks and feels 1930's. The one thing that might have been an improvement would be making the problems of the times more apparent, this was in the midst of economic lows such as America had never seen and the poverty that existed is hardly alluded to although it had a part to play in Dillinger's fame with the public.<br/><br/>All in all, a good movie, worth seeing, but one cannot help but feel it could have been a great movie with some of the above issues fixed. 7/10"
"Stevendcravens","8","3","7","1 July 2009"," Mann's best since HEAT
","3 years after the underwhelming Miami Vice, Michael Mann returns with Public Enemies. To say it is a great movie is an understatement. This is why movies are made, so stories like these can be told by artists like Mann. The performances, especially Bale's, are great and restrained as many people are probably wondering. Depp shows that he is an actual actor who doesn't just put on makeup and appear in Tim Burton films and makes Dillinger incredibly human and likable just like the real man himself was and also shows his violent side with subtlety instead of being over the top. The HD cinematography by Dante Spinotti was also incredible and probably the highlight of the movie since it brought so many dull things and dark rooms come to life with color and light. The sound design is of course amazing as is the case with every Mann film and Elliot Goldenthal's score brings so much emotion and ambiance to every scene it is used in. Go see this film, it truly is a great film and one that you will not regret that you saw at the cinema."

","Public Enemies tells the story of the pursuit of John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) by Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale).<br/><br/>The narrative is straightforward, the dialogue and setting all ring authentically of the era in which the events took place, and the cast are all first rate.<br/><br/>I have several relatively minor reservations.<br/><br/>One: the movie takes things at a very relaxed pace, and my attention wandered slightly in the final third. I felt it could have been tightened up usefully by about half an hour.<br/><br/>Two: sound balance was very poor in the first 10 minutes. Music and effects were fine, but dialogue was muffled.<br/><br/>Three: you end up liking the murderous thief Dillinger, and not caring for law enforcer Purvis. Quite possibly this reflects the characters of the two men, but it doesn't seem quite right to finish the film thinking ""That John Dillinger - what a nice man! What a pity he got killed."" <br/><br/>Four: hand held camera! There's a dialogue scene between Dillinger and his girlfriend at the racetrack, shot from about four different camera angles and, because they are all hand held when they could have been shot from tripods, the constant wobble is very distracting. It doesn't all have to be hand-held, really it doesn't! <br/><br/>But a decent job from Michael Mann. Not a classic, but a good movie nevertheless."
"writers_reign","5","4","11","3 July 2009"," Mann Act
","Apparently director Mann has a rep as a pretty fair director, especially in the case of Heat. In that case he must have been having an off day when he helmed this. The period detail is fine and though I'm no expert I'd guess it would be hard to fault but there's little or no chemistry between any two of the players including Johnny Depp and Marion Cotillard playing Dillinger and his girl friend. Cotillard is the classiest thing in it - and she only IS in it for about half an hour; after her the next classiest thing is Billy Holliday singing The Man I Love on the soundtrack. There's a fair bit of gunplay but it's neither thrilling nor excitement - I've had more excitement in a tight game of Scrabble and more thrills at a Sinatra concert. That is, of course, only one person's opinion but I'm not holding my breath waiting for raves when this Sunday's newspapers hit the stands."
"cartboya","7","4","11","1 July 2009"," Horribly Inaccurate
","After much anticipation I just returned from Public Enemies. Though a very watchable movie it is amazingly inaccurate. Pretty Boy Floyd was not killed by Melvin Purvis and was still alive when Dillinger died (as was Van Meter and Nelson). Not only that but Purvis was a complete imbecile. Hoover disliked him but had no other choice until bringing in Samuel Cowley, who was technically in charge when Dillinger was gunned down. The Little Bohemia scene, again though interesting, was way off base. That event was one of the biggest disasters for the FBI. Everyone of importance got away. Plus it was a rookie Fed who killed the citizen as they tried to leave, not Purvis (there was very little shooting that night, unlike the movie). Then at the end Hamilton was Dillinger's new girlfriend though not portrayed that way in this movie. That's why he went to the theatre that night. The movie made it seem like some random event. And, last but not least, no one heard what Dillinger muttered when he was lying in the street dying. Worth the price of admission but don't try and write a biography paper for school from it."

","I can't stand this type of filmmaking... All rules broken... I can't believe that ""Michael Mann"" is as popular as he is. This movie looks cheap (like a film school project that had no budget) - Camera feels like they couldn't afford a a steady cam nor a film or RED. There are scenes where you really can tell that it is shot on a cheap video camera. Then the music is OFF, it has nothing to do with 1933 - much newer rock'n'roll - terrible... then the script is week and the dialogues very week. And the stupid closeups and fast edits make it really hard to build a connection to the characters. If it wasn't for great actors in this movie, this would have gone straight to the worst movies of all time, and probably would have never been produced. Sad - I had so high hopes - because I love movies out of that time-period... but everyone will forget this film, and not even know it existed in 3 years. Nothing like ""The Godfather"" - now that's a timeless Gangster movie - unreached.

","Public Enemies is a decent action crime drama with exceptional performances by it's two leads. Writer/Director Michael Mann is admirable in bring this movie of notorious bank robber John Dillinger but some flaws with character development and the pacing weighed it down. I thought the good outweighed the bad though with this one. Johnny Depp is great as always playing the charismatic Dillinger who became public enemy number one in the 1930'S Chicago. Christian Bale is equally impressive as determined FBI Agent Melvin Purvis the man whose assigned to track Dillinger down. Depp and Bale only have a few scenes with each other but they both are very believable as their characters. Well done. Marion Collitard as Dillingers love Billie Frechette, Billy Crudup as J. Edgar Hover, Stephen Lang as Charles Winstead, and Giovanni Ribisi as Alvin Karpis are also good in their limited screen time but lack development. Their characters and others including Channing Tatum as Pretty Boy Floyd who makes a brief cameo aren't really developed which weighed the movie down a bit because most of the focus is on Depp and Bale. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing but you don't really get to know many of the characters that well except for them. The pacing of the film was a little slow at times with a running time of 140 minutes but overall I thought it was a decent. If you like gangster movies than chances are you'll enjoy this one. Public Enemies has action and drama with solid performances by Johnny Depp and Christian Bale who make this film worth watching at least once."
"innocuous","7","2","4","6 January 2010"," A bit of a disappointment....
","You've been living under a rock if you don't already know quite a bit about Mann's latest film.<br/><br/>I'll just add that I was disappointed in several aspects of the film. This is unfortunate, as I consider myself somewhat of a fan of Mann's.<br/><br/>The first negative is the emphasis on overt melodrama. (This is quite ironic, since there are several scenes from ""Manhattan Melodrama,"" the last film that Dillinger saw, in the movie. It's almost as if Mann was overtly telling the audience that this would be a MM for the 2000s.)<br/><br/>Also, I wouldn't mind the cornpone storyline so much if it were historically accurate. Unfortunately, it is not. It is one thing to fantasize about characters in a fictional story (as in ""Heat""), but Dillinger, and virtually all the other characters in this movie, were real people and they did real (and, in most cases, historically verifiable) things. The non-fictional aspects of the Dillinger story are exciting enough. Why was it necessary to jazz them up for this movie? It certainly wasn't done to improve the pacing of the story.<br/><br/>Finally, what's with the sound and the cinematography? Mann, and others associated with the film, state that the quality of the digital photography was deliberately chosen and used for effect. What? The rectangular digital anomalies (like photocopy screening) were deliberate? What was that supposed to represent? Wire news photos? This just looked bad...and cheap. Plus, the sound is terrible. Forget the mumbling and just turn on the captions. As for the sound overall and the sound FX, they were nowhere near as convincing as in ""Heat."" The weapons used in ""Heat"" sounded like actual weapons being fired on the streets of LA. The weapons in ""Public Enemies"" sound like canned sound FX bought on-line. You never once believe that a shotgun or Tommy gun is being fired.<br/><br/>Other than my complaints, not a bad movie. Depp does a pretty good job, as do Crudup and Bale. (Though they should have just given up and told Bale to drop the accent.) Everyone else is pretty forgettable.<br/><br/>Frankly, I prefer John Milius' 1973 version of the Dillinger story with Warren Oates. Check it out."

","Well I don't often come on here to write reviews unless a film disappoints me as much as this one has. It is truly horrible. Where to begin? The whole thing looks phony, cheap direction and photography. At times it looks like a low budget British or Canadian independent film. The camera work is amateur. But thats just the beginning because there is not much of a story here either. The whole film screams 'Hollywood', and does not come off as very believable. It's trying too hard and missing horribly. I expected more from Mr Depp, his films are usually interesting, at least. This one is bland and just goes on and on. We never get to learn much about the main character, he's too busy trying to look cool. It's all style and no substance. Two thumbs down for this flick - I'd like my money back please."

","Michael Mann is back with a powerful gangster movie where two male egos face (actually they face off). Plus Public Enemies (in my view not as strong as Heat), has a strong love story with a girl who goes along with the gangster's lifestyle, in the sense that she commits to him staying loyal (they spark chemistry all around). Johnny Depp is a prototype of the perfect businessman, being him efficient, ruthless and using all the updated technologies. The cop Bale is very effective as well, always focused on his aim, flawless and professional. The story flows overall, giving the feeling of being held every minute, with a sense of tragedy and loyalty as we approach the end."
"alex-posti","5","2","4","15 August 2009"," Unexciting camera waggle
","I was very disappointed from this movie. When I first saw the trailer I thought: Yeah, a cool Gangstermovie with Johnny Depp and Christan Bale. Can't be bad! But it was. What you expect from a good Gangstermovie are smart robberies and clever prison brakes. But there ain't any. They just go into banks and go like: ""Hands up, gives us the money."" And then they get the money, shoot some cops and hide in a farmhouse. No big deal. And same thing at the other side. The FBI is boring, too. ""Oh, now he's there. Let go get him. Oh, missed again."" - This may be how it was. But who wants to see how it was, when it was boring? In a Gangstermovie you have to think: They must have made that up. But if this is how it was - wow, those guys where brilliant. But here it's just: Oh, they hid guns in box and now they escape. Yep, seen that before. Nobody in this movie ever pulls a brilliant trick, neither to good nor the bad guys. And the characters aren't any better. Non of them is developing in any way. But they should, cause they a terrible the way they are. John Dillinger is a live-for-the-moment guy who's in love with a girl. But their love story is just: ""You're my girl, you know I'll watch after you!"" And Melvin Purvis haven't got any personality at all. Last of all the camera is gross. Way too hectic, often too close and some times in very strange ankles. It seems as they tried to cut as infrequent as possible. Like in Children of Men - just bad. Only good thing were, sad to say so, the shootouts. Despite the fact that they ain't clever either - but shootouts just doesn't have to."
"MovieRat-2","7","2","4","26 July 2009"," Decent yet uninspired
","Sadly, the hype generated for this film and the chance to have Depp and Bale go at each other in a deadly game of cat and mouse fell short of the mark. Three things kept this film on a short leash, teasing the audience but never fully delivering.<br/><br/>1) Camera work. I have noticed a trend in the film industry to film action with shaky, quick-cutting camera work. I understand it is intended to give the audience the same sense of chaos that the characters are feeling, but I find it distracting and just pure sloppiness. What was worse was that the ""shaky camera"" was use throughout the film even when there was no action to speak of. I absolutely despise this ""style"" (I use the term loosely) of camera work. Couldn't the studio have spent a few dollars more for a still camera set a vastly improve the quality of the film? Speaking of quality of film: 2) ""Digital film quality."" A film that is supposed to be set in the 1930's certainly lost its appeal when it feels like it was filmed with a digital camcorder. The ""digital"" quality of the film made the movie feel unrealistic and out of place with the gritty world of the Great Depression.<br/><br/>3) Lack of connection to characters. Given the last two problems I've discussed and adding to it the style of story telling, you feel absolutely no connection or sympathy for either Dillinger or Purvis. Its almost as if the director said, ""Here is Dillinger...here is Purvis...this happened...this happened....the end."" And this unemotional story is dragged out for over 2 hours.<br/><br/>Sadly, it has the potential of being a great film but will ultimately become just another one of the hundreds of films that are released each year and will disappear into film history."
"micz81","4","2","4","25 July 2009"," It could've been ""HEAT"". Or at least a HIT. But it's rather SH*T.
","My first and major charge is the form of this movie. I'm little confused about what actually Michael Mann wanted to achieve by using digital cameras. I can imagine that it was a ""reality feel"" what he persuaded. I can imagine that it was a wish of close emotional contact of audience with characters depicted in the movie. But the only undeniable advantage of shooting THIS particular movie in digital is economy and convenience. The other two are still director's wishes, I think. <br/><br/>Let's say ""Public Enemies"" was shot by Laars Von Trier in Dogma style. That's quite a challenge, that's quite an idea! Maybe in that way, this story would have been told better, stronger. But here we have to much of inconsistency - it's far away from Dogma drill. One scene is shot with natural light, while in another, lights are set up. You can hear dialogs recorded on the set and few minutes later - postsynchronisation and sound experiments. Here camera is held in hands, and shakes like hell, and there you can see long, steady shots from tripod, or even from air. Inconsistency! You CAN see that manner in 35mm movies and it feels good there, but here it only emphasizes cheapness of the technique used. And what's funny - the best scenes in the movie are the ones with the strongest ""oldschool 35 mm"" feel - where camera is held on a trolley or tripod and the lights are set up properly (those scenes lacks only... to be shot on 35 mm). The rest of the movie looks like amateur flick - when you take out the well known faces of star cast, you will have a Sundance Festival candidate.<br/><br/>I know that Michael Mann is very pro-digital (Miami Vice, Collateral), but I think it's far to soon for this technology to be used for making first-class Hollywood movies. It could be used by freaks like Von Trier. But, compared to him, Mann is a director with very traditional soul, and the traditional, Hollywood way he tells his stories is rather conflicted with the avant-garde form he tries to use to do this. In ""Heat"" the scene of bank robbery is outstanding because of dogma feel in it, BUT the rest of the movie is based on solid aesthetic grounds of classical way of shooting. Here, in ""Public Enemies"" nothing looks nice - everything looks like a goof, or making-of.<br/><br/>Second charge is rhythm - I didn't felt any suspense based on longer period than one scene. Whole movie is just a set of scenes and it has no strong general backbone. You can't even feel the final is really a final.<br/><br/>Third charge - acting. But here again - rather the digital neglectful form of depicting is guilty, because actually pretty good, strong Hollywood acting is exposed by ""sincerity"" of digital. Every line feels like rehearsal, every character feels like a dummy.<br/><br/>Forth charge - factual errors. It's only loosely BASED on facts, but there is much much fiction in the story. And OK, but why then, through the whole movie director tries to emphasize the reality feel?<br/><br/>PROS: music - it helps the suspense. Props and sets - very very nicely chosen.<br/><br/>So only 4 stars for wasting an opportunity for quite good gangster movie."

","Michael Mann directs this exceptional crime drama. The setting is America in the early 1930s and the nation is suffering. Bread lines, soup kitchens and the cheapest entertainment is refrigerated theaters where you can watch a movie and news reels of Baby Face Nelson, Pretty Boy Floyd, Alvin Karpis and John Dillinger. It seemed that no one could stop Dillinger(Johnny Depp), a modern-day Robin Hood, who had little sympathy for the banks that sunk the country into the Great Depression. Charming and cocky with a cold humor, Dillinger was the first Public Enemy Number One. J. Edgar Hoover(Billy Crudup)chomping at the bit to capture Dillinger and make a name for himself and his fledgling FBI. Sure other named criminals were hunted, but the dashing Dillinger was Hoover's obsession and put a dandy lawman Melvin Purvis(Christian Bale)in charge of bringing him in.<br/><br/>Chases, jailbreaks and shootouts kept the nation in awe and rooting for their endeared criminal. Dillinger loved baseball, movies, sharp clothes, fast cars and 'his girl', Billie Frenchette(Marion Cotillard). And if it weren't for greedy betrayal by the infamous ""Lady in Red"", Purvis and a gang of haphazard FBI gunmen, Public Enemy Number One would have been able to torment Hoover longer and give his followers something to feel good about.<br/><br/>Director Mann uses a lot of extreme facial closeups. Not a lot, but a whole lot. The shootouts, bank robberies and action sequences are the movie's highlights; but there is some collateral...historical accuracy. Scenery looks fantastic; cinematography as a whole is top quality. The cast is not slouchy either featuring: Rory Cochrane, Branka Katic, Ed Bruce, LeeLee Sobieski, Giovanni Ribisi, Stephen Lang and Channing Tatum.

Sure, I get the point that it's not a pure 100% accurate biography, that is reflects the Depression, but it just doesn't gel: we are never engrossed in the film, we are left as outsiders, and strangers at that.<br/><br/>Despite good production values and an OK cast the plotting is weak at best and it seems the film could have been at least 30% shorter without skipping a beat.

"Apemangalore","6","2","4","11 July 2009"," A nice escape from the summer blockbusters
","Firstly, the performances in Public Enemies are terrific all across the board. Johnny Depp (who, even despite being one of my all-time favorite actors, I was initially a bit skeptical about), especially, is perfect as John Dillinger. Literally, from minute one, you buy into his character. Obviously, we're still far from ""Oscar Season"", but I'd honestly be a bit surprised if Depp didn't – at least – get nominated for his performance in this film. Now, Christian Bale, much like in Terminator Salvation, isn't given as much to work with in terms of his character. Unlike his performance in McG's latest film, however (and contrary to what most people have said), Bale does an extremely solid job here, doing the best with what he's got.<br/><br/>The action sequences, too, are surprisingly well done. Everything is pushed just to the edge of reality, while not becoming too frenetic or too unbelievable for a film like this. However, perhaps the greatest strength of Public Enemies is how it manages to capture the feel of the 1930's. Everything, from the settings and costume design, right down the dialogue, comes together to really bring you back to that time.<br/><br/>Now, on the negative side of things, I never once bought into the relationship between John Dillinger and Billie Frechette. Dillinger just looks at her once, and instantly falls in love with her. On top of that, I didn't feel that there was any chemistry between the two of them. With love being such a huge motivating factor in what Dillinger does, it makes their lack of ""spark"" a real problem for me. This lack of character development carries through the rest of the film, though. Every character (excluding Depp's) feels extremely one-dimensional, despite the solid performances of the actors portraying them.<br/><br/>The story doesn't flow very well either, making the movie feel more like a series of clips (as enjoyable as they may be to watch) randomly strung together. While I still really enjoyed Public Enemies, it's these shortcomings that kept it from being a truly great film for me."
"CryptoGuy","8","2","4","9 July 2009"," Good Movie With A Sour Note
","I thought this movie was very well acted, shot, directed, and written. Johnny Depp can do no wrong these days it seems. The violence was brutal and Mann did a great job at making the audience sympathetic to Dillinger. For the record, I was not sympathetic, as I am fully aware of Dillinger's violent and murderous actions. He was a monster. Nevertheless, my wife was very sympathetic.<br/><br/>The downside to this film was the horrendous sound mix. It was one of the worst I've ever heard. At first, I thought it was the theater's problem, but once I had the operator change the mix from surround to mono, I realized it was the film's problem. Too bad. I was amazed that the studio let the final print out in that condition. Thumbs down for the sound designer, editors, and producers.<br/><br/>Overall, Public Enemies is a crowd pleaser and enjoyable movie that doesn't glorify the gangsters of that age, but portrays them in a very real and shocking way."

","OK, so some of the people who have posted comments on here have serious mental disorders. You can't say the film is bad because it's historically inaccurate, because it's about making a good movie - not a documentary. You can't say the film is bad because you have gripes with John Dillinger's ethics, dig him up and argue that with him you fool! You also can't moan about awesome camera work which made the film so unique, bitching that the film looked like a ""B-side"" movie (when it's B Movie idiot!). Finally, you can't moan about the excellent sound, spouting about how the guns were too loud because guess what... GUNS ARE LOUD!!!<br/><br/>It seems that people have become too used to the Hollywood sheen of fixed cameras, steady-cam, and unrealistic sound effects. You know... filmmakers intentionally make things sound and look more extreme than they are to wow you as the gullible, popcorn shovelling, brainless audience. Then when someone like Mann chooses to make a realistic recreation of the Public Enemy era of the 1930s, you get on your high horse because it didn't live up to your deluded high standards of small pistols sounding like APC-mounted .50 cal machine guns, and every second not being filmed on hyperHD laser-cameras from the future.<br/><br/>It's about film making, not impressing pointless you with feats of technological prowess.<br/><br/>The cinematography was beyond reproach. The amateur non-steady-cam work coupled with the lack of any musical score in all of the main action scenes really made it realistic. It became so convincing and exhilarating, as though the camera man was back in the 30s getting shot at too. The acting by all was excellent, with Depp and Bale giving great character performances. Michael Mann really knows how to play with your emotions and perceptions of good and evil (with the aid of Depp and Bale), and he made me switch sides in my mind on many occasion throughout the film. One of the best aspects of this film for me though, was how Mann captured both the danger and the romance of the era.<br/><br/>If you are interested in the Public Enemy era of the 1930s, and/or are interested in John Dillinger, you should definitely see this film."

Indeed, as Mann has been exploring similar subject matter throughout his film-making career, there would seem no more fitting director for Public Enemies, profiling infamous depression era bank robber John Dillinger and his relationships with a culture alternatively abhorring or hero-worshipping him and a law enforcement bureau tenaciously hunting him and branding him public enemy number one. But, as sad a realisation as it is, Mann's being the obvious choice to direct sadly detracts from his film's quality, as, with so many prerequisites for the subject matter, it increasingly feels that Public Enemies, for all its accolades, has preciously little new to say in regards to the gangster genre or in general, making it feel like an impressively realised, but inescapably overdone story.<br/><br/>While pinning down why Public Enemies feels like an unsatisfying watch in the midst of so many promising attributes proves elusive, the prevailing complaint is the familiarity factor. If anyone were to find more to say in the gangster or cop genres it would be Mann, but one of the most authoritative voices in both appears tongue-tied, unable to generate content which has not been ground into the mires of predictability. Rather than being an immersive experience, the film feels sketched in point form, hitting all the familiar notes (heists, a romance on the side, betrayal, desperation) without finding anything new to say. <br/><br/>And while Mann's copious adherence to factual period detail is particularly impressive, guaranteeing that his film at least credibly looks and feels like the 1930s, there is more to the story of Dillinger than he chooses to explore, making his film's familiarity unattributable to his sticking to the facts. There is an intriguing self-reflexivity element in making a film about a figure obsessed with movies and who styled himself after them, only to in turn inspire generations of movie villains after his public persona, yet this is merely one of many potential approaches Mann ignores in lieu of the conventional. Similarly, the character of Dillinger may be a paradoxical enigma, but the film seems to simply take it for granted rather than giving the audience the opportunity to see what defines or motivates Dillinger - his legendary charisma, focus, ethics, showiness, etc. While glimpses emerge (a memorable sequence showing crowds of people cheering as he passes, arrested, in a police car and there are hints of his living for the moment and not envisioning a future), one still gets the feeling than a more conclusive and contemporarily relevant take on the story existed within the project, which somehow became obscured and lost along the way. Apart from the occasional high point and a memorably resonant ending, Mann's film seems to simply drift along, never quite ensnaring the viewer's focus as it should. <br/><br/>The familiarity of the story also impacts one's enjoyment of Mann's telling, his typical attention to detail and nuance make the film feel overlong and dragging rather than engaging. Nonetheless, overdone story or not, there are few who can convey a crime film in as thrilling a fashion as Mann, and his usual flair for amplifying nail-biting tension and delivering expansive, inventive and jaw dropping shootout sequences does not disappoint (although it is frustrating to see the dazzling cinematography of many of the gunfights marred by unnecessary shakycam, making it difficult to see anything happening). Unfortunately, Mann's initially bold experiment of high resolution digital filming, aiming for a gritty, realistic look backfires, resulting in a grainy, out of focus look which literally hurts the eyes, making the 140 minute running time hardly a pleasant watch. But, even more frustratingly, the visuals are confusingly inconstant, with some scenes nearly indecipherable and others pristinely clear with glossy Hollywood lighting and composition. Mann's usual flair for appropriately stylised music feels similarly on hiatus, with a musical score which generally feels overbearing or downright out of place, apart from certain moments (the recurring heist theme) which click with his usual precision. <br/><br/>More commendable is the valiant attempt of Johnny Depp to redeem his under-explored character, offering an excellent blend of icy precision, quiet smirking confidence and a winking sense of fun - indeed, had his character been explored more thoroughly, his Dillinger could easily have been a character for the ages. Christian Bale impressively delivers steely reserve to his tenacious fed Melvin Purvis, but his character is tragically deprived of a backstory or context of any sort, leaving Bale struggling to redeem a painfully bland character (when an ending title announces his character's suicide the year after the film culminates, the viewer is left cold, with no real emotional attachment or sense of enough character to fully empathise). Despite mastering delightful arrays of charm and wounded concern, Marion Cotillard similarly flounders to rise above a tragic lack of character, dimming her and Dillinger's love story, the film's emotional centrepiece. Stephen Graham and David Wenham contribute much needed energy to the film as fellow lawbreakers Baby Face Nelson and Pete Pierrepont respectively, even if they too could benefit from further character exploration, but Billy Crudup as J. Edgar Hoover feels irritating and unnecessary, forgettably chomping scenery to no viable effect. <br/><br/>While Mann's film is far from a failure (and in a cultural vacuum would likely be quite brilliant), it becomes increasingly unsatisfactory through the knowledge that everything good about it has been done better, often by the same parties involved. Therefore, while Public Enemies may offer a mature, impeccably researched and often thrilling profile of an infamous criminal, more often than not it sadly feels unnecessary, leaving one instead yearning for the more engaging films it took influence from. <br/><br/>-6/10"
"u2nspenserfan","7","2","4","8 July 2009"," Pretty good summer film, but disappointing
","When I first saw on IMDb Johnny Depp cast as John Dillinger in this film, I was thrilled. Dillinger, after all, was a charming, swaggering, cunning, womanizing thief. Remind you of anyone - say Captain Jack Sparrow? I read articles with Depp saying he had studied Dillinger, even wore a pair of Dillinger's dress pants. I was excited at the thought of an actor of his caliber dedicating himself to such a robust, interesting character.<br/><br/>When I left the theater, however, I had mixed emotions. I was glad someone took the time to show what the world of cops and robbers was like in the 1930s. There was some good action, and there were some tense moments in the movie. Billy Crudup was near perfect as J. Edgar Hoover - the man who thought himself God. The acting was very good overall. The major problem I had was that I had no sense that Melvin Purvis and John Dillinger had been brought to life on the screen.<br/><br/>Melvin Purvis was a pencil-neck attorney who had no law enforcement experience previous to the FBI. Christian Bale's character is a polar opposite - a manhunter who can shoot a running man down from 200 yards, a great planner and interrogator. It would be hard to get farther from the truth. Read up on him and take a look at a picture and you'll know what I mean. The worst part was that there was an actor in this film who was a spitting image of Purvis - I believe it was Richard Short.<br/><br/>The most egregious, however, was Dillinger himself. Instead of the larger than life bank robber whose charm could buy him a drink or a date anytime, he is a troubled loner with a violent streak. The real Dillinger was known to rob banks with a smile on his face and sometimes to not even display a weapon. The movie Dillinger busts in with a gang wielding Tommy guns and tries to terrify everyone into submission. Again, as far as bank robbers go, it would be difficult to get further from the truth. I think Johnny Depp acted the part as it was written, and did that well. It's just a shame the part was written so poorly.<br/><br/>There are also some pretty severe historical inaccuracies. Minor ones I don't mind, but killing someone off at the beginning who was actually part of Dillinger's gang for years after is a bit much. If you know the history behind Dillinger, you'll find yourself thinking ""wait, that never happened"" or similar things.<br/><br/>The filming has been mentioned in other comments, and I will echo that. There are far too many close ups, and a lot of the filming is very fast-panning and unsteady. The '30s were a time of sharp contrasts - abject poverty in some places and some of the most elegant and beautiful architecture and apparel ever seen in other places. This film chose not to show that - whether that be due to budget or just poor film-making, I don't know.<br/><br/>This was overall a pretty good movie, and will keep your attention. It had a chance to be really special, and it didn't make it there. It's a shame to see all that talent and material go to waste."
"bkoganbing","7","2","4","7 July 2009"," Dillinger And Purvis
","When The Petrified Forest was on stage and later on the screen, there was no doubt that Duke Mantee for the movie going public was based on John Dillinger. This bold and lawless man captured the imagination of the Depression era like none other, especially in that bold and lawless time. Banks and those that ran them were not the most admired folks of the time, many a person's life savings went down the drain in bank failures. A lot of the public saw Dillinger and his kind as just giving a little vicarious payback.<br/><br/>What Public Enemies does do very well is show how J. Edgar Hoover used the tales of these people to publicize and modernize his Federal Bureau Of Investigation. That they put these folks out of business is beyond question. Billy Crudup as Hoover and Christian Bale as Melvin Purvis show the difference between the straight arrow G-Men of popular fiction that Hoover had popularized and the very real ruthless men looking to put the outlaws out of business.<br/><br/>In the career of Johnny Depp I count five real life characters he's brought to the screen, Lord Rochester, Ed Wood, James M. Barrie, Joseph Pistone, and now John Dillinger. Depp seems to be making a movie to surpass Charlton Heston for portraying the most real life people. Of course this is far more eclectic list than Heston ever considered. Everyone of them different and yet all bear the stamp of Johnny Depp's persona in them. It's what I've always liked about Depp, he likes challenges and he meets those challenges.<br/><br/>I can't say too much for historical accuracy here. John Dillinger met his fate before Pretty Boy Floyd and Babyface Nelson. And Melvin Purvis was not in on the killing of Nelson at all.<br/><br/>Still the era is nicely captured by director Michael Mann. We might see an Oscar nomination or two for the technical awards and maybe for acting for Johnny Depp. Maybe he'll win this time."
"lasciata","8","2","4","5 July 2009"," A cinematic triumph; an historical bust.
","Minor spoiler alert. I don't mind that a movie based on fact deviates from the facts. What bothers me is that it does so pointlessly. Ebert says, ""Mann is fearless with his research."" No, he isn't. Early in the film Purvis guns down Charles Floyd, then later meets Dillinger, who has already heard of Purvis' reputation. Oh? Then how is it that Dillinger actually died three months before Floyd? Let's not even mention that Dillinger and Purvis never met. There are 20 other instances of this sort of sloppiness, none of which serve any purpose whatsoever. But this film sure does look good. It's worth seeing for no other reason than that."
"nprata","4","2","4","5 July 2009"," Not very good
","This movie is shallow and empty with only occasional bits to recommend it. <br/><br/>It's hard to make either Depp or Dillinger boring, but somehow Mann (Or the writers? Or both?) managed to do so. Dillinger was a real smart alec, charge forward, live wire--which is mostly not Depp's portrayal of him. And a lot of really amazing details of the true story were left out, for some reason, so much less impressive invented ones could be interjected.<br/><br/>Dillinger's wasn't the only characterization that needed work, either. There is almost nothing to hang your hat on regarding the other gangsters. As well,the cinematography, which many have raved about, is pretty average. <br/><br/>I like Tommy Guns as much as the next guy, but that wasn't enough to salvage the movie for me. Mann can do, and has done, better.<br/><br/>The Warren Oates film is a far better work."
"budmassey","8","2","4","5 July 2009"," Depp doesn't disappoint, but, in the end, almost everything else does.
","First of all, we must address the critical issue here. Johnny Depp is the best actor currently working. This places upon him the awesome responsibility of building a body of work while he is in his prime that will be worthy of him as a legacy. It is that standard against which Depp's work, including Public Enemies, must be measured. Even in those lofty terms, Public Enemy is successful, but hardly a triumph.<br/><br/>I should also admit that I am a notorious Michael Mann hater. Sure, I liked The Aviator, but probably more despite Mann's touch than because of it. His envisioning of Will Graham, the central character of Thomas Harris's Manhunter, as an ersatz Miami Vice cool cat was criminal, and in the decades since he's really done little to redeem himself.<br/><br/>Public Enemies is, of course, set in post-depression Indiana, where John Dillinger was an unlikely folk hero. His grave at the Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis is regularly visited, as evidenced by the stacks of coins that are always resting on his stone. Depp's portrayal of Dillinger, perhaps the most satisfying aspect of the movie, reels with charisma befitting the legend, without becoming corny like Warren Beatty's Clyde Barrow.<br/><br/>Depp's scenes with Oscar winning leading lady Marion Cotillard smolder with a sexuality which the eccentric characters Depp often plays rarely give him the opportunity to portray, but which he does searingly. Throughout the movie, Depp is almost constantly on screen, and his presence is always electric and incendiary.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is superb. Christian Bale, looking a little wan in this movie, is beautifully wooden as Melvin Purvis, reminding me a bit of Kevin Costner as Elliott Ness in The Untouchables. Speaking of The Untouchables, Billy Drago's portrayal of Frank Nitti in The Untouchables was much more powerful than Bill Camp's version here, but then Drago's character was more central to the story in The Untouchables.<br/><br/>Billy Crudup, fresh off his turn as the all powerful Dr. Manhattan in Watchmen, is almost unrecognizable as J. Edgar Hoover. He manages to capture the ambition and determination of Hoover, while avoiding the clichés associated with him, particularly with regard to Dillinger.<br/><br/>It's wonderful to see Giovanni Ribisi in a major picture again, and it looks like we'll be seeing more of him in the near future. Likewise Stephen Dorff and Lili Taylor. In fact, one has to give Mann credit for assembling such a great cast, although credit for this probably goes to the amazing work of Avy Kaufman and Bonnie Timmermann, both of whom are among the most sought after casting professionals in Hollywood.<br/><br/>And now to the movie. Although the story plays out pretty predictably, as any such movie must, at times it reels and lurches like a music video, complete with period soundtrack. Little could be presented about this story that isn't already known, so, instead, we get touchstones decorated with details most likely imagined, albeit convincingly.<br/><br/>Technically speaking, the movie is put together nicely, and why not? Master cinematographer Dante Spinotti and his HD cameras illuminate every scene in scintillating detail. Elliot Goldenthal's soundtrack is equally thrilling, if for no other reason than its authenticity.<br/><br/>Now you might be asking, at this point, with all the talent assembled here, what went wrong, because, as you might imagine I have been leading up to, something did go wrong. Well, it's the script. Cowritten by Mann, along with Ronan Bennett and Ann Biderman, it just doesn't happen.<br/><br/>With Mann and Bennett, I'm not surprised; neither has shown himself to be a particularly capable writer as such. But Biderman gave us Primal Fear and Copycat, so I expected more. Essentially, however, the story ends up dramatically inert and more than a little uneven. As I mentioned, it ""reads"" like a music video, desperately lacking narrative foundation and structure. The central characters, most of them epic in real life, lack depth, and little is done to capture the dramatic tension inherent in their collisions.<br/><br/>I'll be honest. I went to see this movie for one reason – because Johnny Depp is in it. When Mann works with marquee talent, it usually works. Take Al Pacino and Robert De Niro in Heat, but then, how could you go wrong with that much talent? With Public Enemies, despite all the assembled brilliance, what you end up with is essentially a wind-up story left to unwind on its own, which it does predictably and without much of a payoff. Definitely worth a watch, and Depp doesn't disappoint, but, in the end, almost everything else does."

","Public Enemies is like an irresistible to hate as even if you didn't like the story or the acting or anything like that Public Enemies looks absolutely stunning with it's brilliant costume and set design.<br/><br/>This could had been a perfect 10 out of 10 movie but what was the let down was the fact that the story was a real let down as it didn't give enough of an insight into the actual life of John Dillinger, which makes Public Enemies not a biopic but more of a cops and robbers movie right? Not really as it is more played as a drama not a thriller. But despite some minor setbacks Public Enemies is an exciting and well made film and if your looking for a good summer film you'll be better off watching this over two and a half hours of robots fighting (you'll be much better)"
"Flyer78","9","2","4","5 July 2009"," Wanted Dead- JOHN DILLINGER.
","I have always been a fan of the director Michael Mann, and I thoroughly enjoyed his 1995 film Heat, which is known for having arguably the greatest action scene in the history of film making. So naturally, I was eager to see what he could do with telling the story of, in my opinion, the best criminal of all time- John Dillinger. And let me tell you, he did NOT disappoint.<br/><br/>As expected, the acting was superb. Johnny Depp is always great, and he did a fantastic job playing John Dillinger, and Christian Bale was awesome in his role as Agent Melvin Purvis, especially with that old-school accent. I was previously unfamiliar with Marion Cotillard, but she impressed me with her role as Billie Frechette. All of the supporting cast did a good job as well, but Depp and Bale are the ones that truly made this film.<br/><br/>From the instant the film opens, you feel yourself submerged in the movie, and you truly want to know what happens. This movie has a good amount of very intense and adrenaline-pumping shootouts, and the camera will often go to angles that are over the shoulder of one of the gunners, and it often makes you feel as if you are right in the middle of the firefight.<br/><br/>I have read some reviews that said this seemed rushed, but I disagree with those statements. The film ran just over 130 minutes, and for a film of this type, that's the perfect duration. Perhaps it would have been nice for the film to open with a flashback depicting Dillinger's rough childhood, but the film pretty much covers the main details of his childhood in all the conversations Dillinger has with the various characters in the film. The movie covers all of the main points of Dillinger's criminal life, and that's what I would have done if I had been director. There's no need for all of the minor things that have nothing at all to do with the main story, and that would have thrown wasted time into the film, and I think it would have made it an overall inferior film to what we got.<br/><br/>I would only recommend this to people who enjoy crime films with a good amount of action, so basically what I'm saying is this- Public Enemies is a 100 percent guy film, so if any of the guys are looking for a compelling, testosterone-filled thrill ride, head over to your local cinema and check out Public Enemies."
"rogerdarlington","Null","2","4","5 July 2009"," Formidable addition to the gangster genre
","Michael Mann is a fine director known for his male movies from ""The Last Of The Mohicans"" to ""The Kingdom"", often featuring real-life male characters as in ""The Insider"", ""Ali"" and ""The Aviator"", and frequently focusing on criminality as in ""Heat"", ""Collateral"" and ""Miami Vice"". ""Public Enemies"" then - set in crime-ridden 1930s America and telling the tale of flamboyant bank robber and prison escapee John Dillinger - is quintissential Mann. Stylistically - and this movie oozes style - this is trademark Mann, complete with the huge close-ups of intense male faces. What is new is the use by cinematographer Dante Spinotti of high definition video which, together with scrupulous attention to period detail, makes this a true evocation of the period and, together with interesting use of colour and intense sharpness of sound, creates an absorbing movie that one simply has to see at the cinema to enjoy the full richness of the work.<br/><br/>For all the bank robbing and gun fighting, this is essentially a human story and inevitably comparisons will be made with ""Heat"". Again we have the lawless and the lawman as complex, committed but somewhat taciturn figures circling one another plot-wise and only once actually meeting face to face. The charismatic Johnny Depp plays Dillinger, while Christan Bale is his nemesis FBI agent Melvin Purvis, in accomplished performances backed up by a succession of strong minor appearances. For me, the one female role - Marion Cotillard as Dillinger's moll Billie - does not work as it should and it's hard to understand why he would take such risks for such a tepid character.<br/><br/>Based on Bryan Burrough's non-fiction book ""Public Enemies: America's Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI, 1933-34"" and with a screenplay partly written by Mann himself, Dillinger is presented in a rather sympathetic light as a kind of latter-day Robin Hood, adding colour and escapism to the dreary lives of Depression-era Americans. It's not always clear what is being said and what is happening, but inevitably one is swept along in a work that, while long (140 minutes), is never boring. It may not have the pacing and drama - and that station shoot-out - of ""The Untouchables"", but ""Public Enemies"" is a worthy addition to the gangster genre."
"mgtbltp","7","2","4","4 July 2009"," Less pseudo reality more myth & legend
","The cinematography it had an uneven look definitely due to the HD digital, the biggest noticeable contrast being the Little Bohemia shootout with the rest of the film. The hand held camera-work was way overdone, there was no reason for it in certain scenes particularity during the night club sequence where you had Billie & John tête-à-tête conversing, why, why must the picture be bouncing up and down? Why when Bille is captured do we get a munchkin POV looking up? What's the point of that? Now some complain about this effect making them nauseous for me it just makes me annoyed. I think minimal use in key segments could accent certain sequences but when its continuous it becomes redundant. It also robs us of the appreciation of the props and the art of set design, if everything is a blur or constantly bouncing about it makes set design an exercise in futility. What is the point of showing beautifully restored automobiles as a bouncing blur, at least the shot of the steam engine arriving at the station seemed not to be not hand held. The whole effect gives me a feeling of what I assume someone with HAADD would experience.<br/><br/>There is a current trend in Hollywood in making certain Genres into, historical costume dramas, almost docudramas when dealing with the past, its the same in the Western Genre trying for too much reality takes away the magic of the Western iconography built up over the years. Westerns were about Myths and Legends same as the old Gangster Genre films. Too much reality is killing Westerns and you can see this to some extent in Public Enemies. In the schizophrenic Public Enemies we get a bit more detail and emphasis on accuracy in some areas and then wild fabrications in others but what is lacking in this film is the small touches that give some character development to Dillinger's gang they seemed to all blend in to a blur and the same likewise could be said of the FBI team. Public Enemies spent a bit more time with the Billie-John relationship at the expense of the ""Public Enemies"", but I somehow get the feeling that that(Billie-John) was all contrived Hollywood BS anyway.<br/><br/>The little extra vignettes that the 1973 Milius' Dillinger had gave a bit of character development to the legend of Dillinger's gang, the gumball machine, Dillinger's visits to his family, Dillinger's sister, the bar scene, Dillinger splitting the money from the robbery that he did at his jail escape with the mechanic the warden and Reese, Purvis' vow of smoking his gift cigars from his shot down buddy ""over the dead bodies of every one"" of the public enemies gave Dillinger that mythic Gangster Film cachet. Were any of these historical, possibly, but others particularly Purvis was wildly inaccurate. But a larger than life Dillinger needed a larger than life Purvis. In Public enemies neither Dillinger nor Purvis really reaches Iconic status. It also helped that the character actors in Milius' Dillinger were well enough known and in enough prior films to be distinguishable from one another and add gravitas to their roles. When the legend becomes fact film the legend was Milius's MO.<br/><br/>Now let us examine how the two films handled the Little Bohemia Shootout. In Dillinger the FBI arrive just at dawn and the shootout commences when three hapless innocents walk out of the lodge all the action is in the light. In Public Enemies Mann stages the shootout at night the action being ignited by three men leaving the lodge in a car.<br/><br/>Now I'll digress for a moment, let me tell you a little parable, there once was a survey leveling crew on a survey project that was working on the edge of the Bob Marshall Wilderness Area in Montana. They were running a level circuit on a construction P-line and decided to try and finish the three mile project before sunset and the ensuing darkness. In short they didn't make it, finding themselves about 2.5 miles from the existing road on a steep fir pine and spruce covered hillside, and had to continue walking out carrying their equipment. When it got dark it got DARK under the tree cover, pitch black, as if you were in a closet. Besides obviously trees everywhere there was also blow down, underbrush etc., etc., to negotiate around and through. They could not walk normally they had to feel ahead with their feet for any obstacles in their way at the pace of a crawl. Every once in a while they would break into a natural clearing and a sliver of moon lit it up enough so that you could see but as soon as the hit the tree line on the other side again in was back into the abyss.<br/><br/>There is no F-ing way in Public Enemies that anybody is going to be running around in the frickin dark through the woods, its totally ridiculous you would be slamming into trees tripping over logs etc., etc. Its just not believable, but the muzzle flashes of the Tommy guns looked nice, lol. Apparently that is what he was going for.<br/><br/>The film overall was entertaining but it could have been way more than it is, it needed a tad more myth and less reality. 6.5-7/10"
"mukava991","7","2","4","4 July 2009"," extravaganza of closeups
","For fans of extreme facial close-ups, this is the great movie of 2009. Not only is the camera cheek-to-cheek with Johnny Depp, Marion Cotillard, Christian Bale and the rest of the sterling cast, it's downright microscopic, revealing a vast landscape of zits, pores, peach fuzz and capillaries. This kind of cinematography gives the film a persuasive intimacy that locks us into the drama from the earliest scenes (the film opens with a closeup of a tight formation of shackled prisoners in classic black-and-white striped uniforms marching across a prison yard). Depp is a good choice to play the dapper gangster John Dillinger. It's not that others couldn't have done equally well in their own way, but there is something about his nonconformist offscreen persona that underpins the role. Christian Bale as FBI agent Melvin Purvis matches him scene for scene in a performance of seemingly effortless brilliance. Marion Cotillard reinforces her reputation as a convincing, versatile actress as Dillinger's girlfriend; she plays ""wounded-soulful"" very well. And a plumped Billy Crudup is properly officious as the young J. Edgar Hoover.<br/><br/>The film shifts from Dillinger and his gang to Purvis and his gang, taking breaks occasionally to indulge in protracted shoot-outs between the two which get rather tiresome after a while, particularly because they tend to confuse the viewer. In one nocturnal scene, an ambush takes place at a motel in a wooded area. The parking lot around the motel is pitch black, but the surrounding forest into which a significant chase sequence occurs, is conveniently bathed in what can only be described as the very generous light of a full moon. <br/><br/>Costumes, interiors and autos are all convincing. The soundtrack is okay, but in its languor tends to add to the slowness of the film's pace. The underscoring is half Flatt-and-Scruggs style banjo licks (was Michael Mann trying to pay homage to the 1967 film classic Bonnie and Clyde, which also dealt with Depression-era gangsters to the tune of strumming banjos?) and anachronistic recordings with a jazz-swing sound that date more from the later 30's and 40's than from the film's actual time period (1933-34). Recordings by Billie Holiday dominate. In truth, Holiday was not making these recordings at the time; they are from a much later period. More authentic are the use of ""The Last Round-up,"" an actual hit song from precisely that period, and, if this movie is to be believed, one of Dillinger's favorite pop songs and Al Bowlly's crooning of ""Close Your Eyes"" in a bar scene as one of the Dillinger gang's molls agrees to set Dillinger up for the kill. Diana Krall as a nightclub singer exhaling ""Bye, Bye Blackbird"" as if it's 1945 is far advanced musically beyond what people in fancy Chicago show places would have heard in Dillinger's day. Somehow Mann didn't trust the music of the period to complement the action as he conceived it. I wonder why. Oh well, he's the director and it's his film.<br/><br/>To sum up – very good on character, visuals and script. The pacing is a bit too formal and wearying. Too many overlong machine gun battles. Beautiful ending. Musical choices could have been better."
"howatkr","7","2","4","3 July 2009"," Great Plot, Bad Execution
","This movie is has a great plot that really brings you along for the ride and makes you love John Dillenger even though he is the bad guy, but there is terrible editing and awful film shots that make it seem more like a TV or B movie rather than an A-list movie. It shocked me at points how the sound would fluctuate from very quiet to blareingly loud for no apparent reason. And at points it seemed like the film was being shot by a high schooler on a hand-held camera rather than by a professional. Not that the movie and the acting was not amazing, but the awefulness of the editing and filming process detracted from the plot at points. The director should have been much more careful about what he was putting out because it was enough to make me very disappointed in a movie that I expected to be much higher quality for the hype it was getting."

","I'm not a fan of gangster films, I've never seen The Untouchables or anything of that ilk. I'll fully admit that the primary reason I saw this film was because of Johnny Depp. So I can't comment on how good it was versus other movies of a similar nature.<br/><br/>But as a stand-alone film, I enjoyed it immensely. Lots of action, the gun battles were breathtakingly realistic, and Johnny Depp did a wonderful job, as always.<br/><br/>I did have a few qualms, however. I felt that the romance was a bit contrived; Depp and Cotillard did have some chemistry, but the fact that their relationship was so hurried didn't help to showcase the connection between them I also had trouble understanding some of the lines, I don't know if it was the delivery (from multiple characters) or due to the background noise.<br/><br/>Overall, however, I really liked this movie.

One moment Depp is clean shaven, then he has a moustache, then he is clean shaven again. There are also confusions about some of the characters and the time changes with no indication. Secondly, there is a lot of his life left out. Some of the main info such as Dillingers amateur surgery. With this surgery he was able to sneak about unnoticed.

","Johnny Depp delivers another mysteriously effective performance as gangster John Dillinger. The script sticks close to the actual events in Dillinger's life and in some ways tries to make him a heroic figure, but with the FBI relentlessly pursuing ""public enemy #1""not for his murderous ways but because he perfected the art of both robbing banks and breaking out of prison it is easy to see him as a sympathetic character. Although the film does not portray law enforcement as totally idiotic, it does make the FBI seem to use crime-fighting as a distraction from the poverty and brutality that drove men like Dillinger to it. However, in an effort to be even-handed, the film does not delve too deeply into the motivations of the detectives who pursued him nor does it investigate the mindset of Dillinger himself. The Chicago settings are masterfully re-created. Nevertheless, and this is an above par gangster movie that even contains references to James Cagney, whose film ""The Public Enemy"" remains the standard against which all gangster movies are measured."

","This is a stunningly good looking movie about the battle between organised crime and the emerging FBI in the USA in the 1930s. Johnny Depp is the charismatic Robin Hood style bank robber John Dillinger who has escaped from prison and embarks on a crime spree that makes the authorities look hapless. J Edgar Hoover drafts in Christian Bale to lead the Chicago office and stop Dillinger at all costs. The film now proceeds to depict the long, very long, relentless game of frequently publicly-fought cat and mouse game between them; with plenty more bank robberies; protracted gun battles and, occasionally some style. Depp and Bale are rarely on screen together and the rest of the supporting cast; except, maybe Marion Cotillard - really don't pull together ands the story quickly becomes repetitive and really quite dull. Depp carries off his part well, raising his character from the reputed thug to someone who did care for his loved ones, and who certainly had a more benevolent side. There has been a considerable degree of effort put into the costumes, cars and general aesthetic of the film, but given we all already know what happens at the end it just isn't enough to keep it interesting for 140 minutes!"

","PROS:Public Enemies is an enjoyable ride into the life of a bank robber in a time when capitalism was at its peak and the poor were led into criminal activities. Johnny Depp is charismatic as John Dillinger and captures beautifully the mannerisms and the charm of his character. On the other side, Christian Bale is convincing as the FBI agent Purvis and Marrion Cotilliard nails everything she's been given (the interrogation scene is terrific). The shooting scenes are entertaining and the two jailbreaks are impressive. The detail in the settings is incredible and the early 1930 era is captured perfectly. Also, it is worth mentioning the costumes and the music score.
CONS:The characters of the film are poorly developed. It depicts John Dillinger as ''Robin Hood'' but his moral values and leadership skills are never expored. The romantic stuff between Cotilliard and Depp feels generic and cliche. Aside from historical inaccuracies, the illustration of the fellow gangsters is shallow and forgettable (why is it even called Public Enemies?). From a technical aspect, the use of wide-angled zoom lens doesn't always pay off."

","I watched this without any expectation of historical accuracy of which, after now reading some of the more negative reviews; there appears to be some inconsistencies.<br/><br/>However, the film is excellent - character development is absolutely fantastic, a rare example in today's 'Marvel universe' of film making. Depp plays the role perfectly, and the viewer; despite seeing a number of heinous acts, feels an urge to support Dillinger.
Christian Bale plays a role which suited him to a tee, and did justice to a man hungry to complete his duty, yet it is clear to see the absence which presides within him when this duty is no longer.<br/><br/>The scenes for me were all of perfect length, detail and emotional value, and there is a careful balance of action and emotional tenderness, which is full credit to the director and the writing team.<br/><br/>Prepare for a whirlwind of hell-bent loyalty, unexpected backstabbing and barbaric brutality, all rolled together in an emotional roller-coaster.<br/><br/>I will certainly watch this again, and relive the enjoyment.

","Mann, ever ahead of his time and not risk averse throws two fingers up at a proper sound mix, and revels in digitals ability to move from outside and inside of environments giving the film a truly homemade feel. Fly on the wall was not a way you could describe a film set in 1933 before, something the film enjoys putting ahead of the first scene to remind you you're not seeing something in the present day. Mann shoots the history that is stranger than fiction with a Fincher-like attention to detail that had me googling for hours afterwards to find more of the details behind the supposed truths.
A yell when you spot them star studded cast sit alongside the stars in cautious, subdued thankless roles. The boiled down script and Mann's proclivity to let the fire burn deep inside his characters means that critics were easy to be cruel to them, when in reality it's refreshing to allow Mann's close camera to let us peer into these souls instead of have everything splashed around in grand OTT fashion. It makes you engage as psychologist not passive when watching them.
There are flaws, it loses steam by the end, an intentionally terrible sound mix is still terrible and Cotillard and Depp's chemistry is pared back to the point of nonexistence and therefore chunks of the movie depending upon it fail entirely.
But Mann has made something magical as always, something edgy and experimental and well worth existing which is more than most filmmakers do. Here he is actually making art of a kind. And in time it will be appreciated. His editing swallows all the best filmy bits of the film the way The Wire swallows its most TV storylines in between episodes. Where else would ceilings actually be an integral part of deciphering the themes of the film. And in many ways Public Enemies is a bookend to the superb Assassination of Jesse James regarding celebrity outlaws in the history of the USA, whereas Jesse James had only archive newspaper and pulp serials to base its myth and legend on, Public Enemies had the early days of reporting and witness testimony To hinge a sort of tangible historical reconstruction on. Here there are some scathing parallels between the birth of G-Men and the height of post-9/11 law enforcement techniques and torture. In many ways the film is secretly a bait and switch to show how sadistic and villainous Hoover's police were and how their celebrity and their lawlessness made them a far more formidable threat than Dillinger perhaps ever was.
There are many other reasons why I love this movie, dripping with period detail and then set at with a run and gun approach to make you forget all of that. The rest of the things I love about this movie, I can't put into words. In my book, that makes it one to remember and one to promote."

During a major crime wave in the 1930s, they were the first priority for the Feds due to their actions on robbing banks, murdering a lot of people including many police officers.<br/><br/>I liked this movie very much because it is based on real facts and incidents that happened in a very difficult period of time for the United States. It has a very interesting plot with many plot twists which were really unpredictable and made this movie even more interesting. Regarding the direction which was made by Michael Mann, I want to say that it was simply amazing. It has to be mentioned also the great interpretation of Johnny Depp's who played as John Dillinger and he was outstanding. Other very good interpretations that have to be mentioned too were Christian Bale's who played as Melvin Purvis, Jason Clarke's who played as 'Red' Hamilton and Marion Cotillard'S who played as Billie Frechette.<br/><br/>To sum up, I have to say that ""Public Enemies"" is a very good movie with an interesting plot, many good action scenes and equally great interpretations made by its cast. I recommend everyone to watch this movie because I am sure that you are going to enjoy it very much. If you are a fan of crime movies and especially if you like some other movies such as ""Black Mass"" and ""Road to Perdition"" then you must watch this movie too."

","Chicago, thirties of the last century. John Dillinger and the crew rob banks and with high-speed cars flee across state borders, escaping the police. The FBI is in its infancy and Hoover wants to build a reputation by catching Dillinger, a state enemy number one. Story is realistic, almost like documentary. Action scenes are well shot and from a technical standpoint film has no flaws. But, although it definitely isn't boring, it failed to pull me in. I was not tied to the characters, I wasn't rooting for either side, nor did I care about their fates. Johnny Depp, Christian Bale, Marion Cotillard, Jason Clarke, Stephen Graham and many other big names guarantee that trouble certainly doesn't lie in acting, but screenplay didn't left room for characterization. Characters are one-dimensional. Criminal is just a criminal, cop is just a cop, there's no background stories, no diverting from main course of the movie, no inner struggles, no emotions or depth. Just black and white and straight forward, like TV news. Though, here and there they inserted a couple of emotional moments, I guess in attempt to breathe some soul into the movie, but they only achieved needless pathetic that simply doesn't fit with the rest of it. Technically excellent film, but not essentially powerful.<br/><br/>7/10"

"bowmanblue","7","0","0","7 January 2015"," Okay, but not what it could have been
","Johnny Depp and Christian Bale are probably two of the best-known actors around at this time. Between them they have clocked up a wide range of varied characters and have proved their acting might on more than one occasion. Therefore, the temptation by studio bosses to get the pair of them in the two leading roles must have proved too much to resist.<br/><br/>Therefore, we have Johnny Depp portraying real life gangster John Dillinger, with Christian Bale as the FBI agent hell-bent on bringing him to justice. Naturally, as the film's about Dillinger himself, Depp gets the lion's share of screen time. In fact, fans of Bale may feel a little cheated regarding how much they get to see the man behind (arguably) Batman's most successful incarnation. He's little more than a figure who turns up every now and again to narrowly miss Dillinger. We never really get to see what makes him tick – he's just a particularly driven lawman, who has to catch his man. I don't recall ever seeing anything that shows us if he has any real life outside his work.<br/><br/>Depp too feels more than a little underused. Dillinger's not a particularly nice guy. Okay, he doesn't rob 'regular' people, only banks. But he's prone to acts of extreme violence and doesn't think twice about killing if it suits his needs. So the audience might find it hard to relate to him, let alone support him in his side of the story. Depp's better at playing larger than life characters. Dillinger is pretty one dimensional. He steals and he hits people and has little else to his personality.<br/><br/>I haven't read Dillinger's life story, so I can't comment on how close the film is to portraying the real man, or how accurate is, but there were a couple of scenes which didn't seem to fit – namely when Dillinger finds it easy to walk among entire departments of the very police officers charged with bringing him in and yet they don't actually recognise him.<br/><br/>But, despite the film not really utilising its two trump cards, i.e. Bale and Depp, it's not a bad watch. I'm sure it's a reasonable account of Dillinger's life and, even if it isn't, it's a decent enough crime drama."

","This remake has everything it needs except script and character development. It does bring up a couple of good valid points. The big gangs did get away from big bank robberies because they found that AT&T and the US government were so far behind in phone network security facilities that they could steal much more money using the holes that US Gov't provided. - Tax free too, even though the IRS can tax wire thieves, they are still rarely caught which means this money is tax free. Smaller item- J Edgar Hoover fired Purvis because he was a homosexual dictator who could not share power with anybody in the FBI. Later in Hoover's life he was holding back the FBI more than he was helping it. The FBI and US Gov't still have never cracked down on wire payments, years after people have learned about it. <br/><br/>The Dillinger story presented here is no where near the quality of the 1960's epic Bonnie & Clyde. In that one the viewer got engaged with well drawn characters. In this movie the character's are more of a sketch. The film makers did their homework here but missed the real history and made the characters card board cut outs who don't seem to relate much to each other or the audience."

","Set in the days of the Great Depression this film follows the actions of notorious bank robber John Dillinger and the hunt for him which led to the creation of the FBI. We are introduced to Dillinger as he goes back to prison to break out his associates. He is declared Public Enemy Number One by Hoover's Bureau of Investigation but that doesn't mean he plans to lie low; instead he sets about hitting a string of banks. The more he gets away with it the more desperate the investigators, led by Special Agent Melvin Purvis, become. Dillinger forms a relationship with Billie Frechette and the Bureau think his love for her will provide them with the opportunity to catch him. He is eventually caught but that isn't the end of him as he escapes from prison and once again robbing banks across the country it is only a matter of time before the Feds catch up with him and criminals like him.<br/><br/>While the film is based on real people and many real events some liberties have been taken with other details; several people who we see killed before Dillinger actually died in different events after Dillinger's death; that doesn't detract too much from the film though. Johnny Depp puts in a solid performance as Dillinger making him a likable character despite his crimes something that seem suitable given the real Dillinger's folk hero status at the time. Christian Bale is also good in the supporting role of Purvis and Marion Cotillard is likable as Billie Frechette. Michael Mann does a good job directing; keeping things more matter of fact than his more obviously stylish early works. The frequent action is tense and brutal rather than overly exciting. Overall an entertaining film that is well worth watching; it is fairly inevitably violent but there is little else to offend."

","(54%) The big question here is why isn't this movie better than it actually is? Because with Depp, Bale, and Mann combined this should be a great movie, but as a matter of opinion it hardly makes it to the levels of a good movie, which is quite a disappointment in my books. Bale is hardly ever on screen, and when he is there isn't anything for him to do, even Depp is fed crumbs from a script that ambles along in circles making the ruthless Dillinger seem almost dull. The bank robbery and prison break scenes are almost identical to each other, and are quite poor compared to the ones in the fantastic ""Heat"", as the direction is slack and more than a little distracting from the far from gripping events on-screen. Worst of all though is the uncanny feel that much of the movie has to a TV docudrama. I almost expected a staged interview to pop up between scenes and a talk about 1930's organised crime to happen. So the performances are muted from the biggest stars of the production, the direction is below par for even an average film maker, and the script sucks the life from a criminal that shook America. On a plus side the scene when Dillinger enters the police headquarters and has a look round is a highlight and is certainly the best part of the whole movie. But this is still a reasonably big misfire and a let-down from a promising looking flick."

","Chronicling the criminal escapades of John Dillinger, famous bank robber, in his later career Public Enemies plays cop (or in this case FBI agent) and robber on a grand scale in the 1930s American Midwest. Johnny Depp is brilliant as Dillinger, always cool and confident to the point of cockiness he makes the role really come alive. Set against him is Christian Bale as Melvin Purvis, an agent of a FBI still in its early days. He is also great and a good counterpart to Depp as he relentlessly tracks him. The acting and filming is good and makes the story come alive but do not mistake Public Enemies for a documentary or even an extremely historically accurate film. There are numerous factual discrepancies which is fine as long as it still tells an interesting story. That brings up one of the other problems in that Public Enemies falls halfway between history and story while neither completely recreating events as they were or coming up with something completely original. Some characters are not as fleshed out as they could be and a lot of knowledge on a particular figure is sometimes expected to explain their behavior. While those things can be a bit of a problem at times that doesn't stop Public Enemies from being an enjoyable film which while not on the level of some older gangster films like The Untouchables is still good."

","There's so many things why this movie falls flat for me. The Johnny Dillinger of this movie is not likable as a character. I didn't care about him. I wanted him to be locked up.<br/><br/>There is the love relationship, if you can call it that, between Billie Whatshernameagain and Johnny. The whole setup of it is weird; Johnny spots her in a restaurant and decides to own her, like ""you're my girl now."" At first she's like ""okay"", then she's like ""I don't wanna, I don't even know u,"" but all it takes is a few stern words and some trivial ""now you know me"" -facts from Mr. Dillinger to convince her otherwise. And that's portrayed as their ""love story."" Suddenly Billie is willing to sacrifice everything for Johnny, just like that, for no good reason, really. <br/><br/>It all left me wondering what was wrong with her. Was she in denial? Does she not value herself as a woman? Well if that is the case, the real heroin of the story would develop along the story and finally discover the real state of things. Doesn't happen. Was she stupid? I don't want to watch a movie about stupid people. Marion Cotilliard's take on Billie was a deer-in-the-headlights-one. Awkward to watch.<br/><br/>The film lacks any emotional buildup. Billie and Johnny have a love relationship. I don't care. People die left and right. I don't care. Johnny is shot in the end. Good riddance. The sound track desperately tries to add drama to such moments, but the outcome is cheesy, because the character development does not support it. I do not feel the way about these characters as the score suggests.<br/><br/>As Johnny Dillinger is an annoying character, the other cast disappear in the gray masses because the sheer number of them. There's no emotional connections to any of them. Their screen time is short and I don't know enough of them to care. Even Christian Bale's character, his right hand, Dillinger's right hand and all the fed agents and gangsters are just pawns. Many of them die. Whatever.<br/><br/>Then there is the plot, or rather the carrying out of it. There is, for instance, the pointless character of J. Edgar Hoover who gets owned by some even more pointless politician in a pointless scene, where FBI's financing is discussed. J.E.H. basically states that the FBI rocks, the politician barks at him that it doesn't and the whole scene has no impact on the movie whatsoever. It could have been left out. Everything with J.E.H. could have been left out, it was meaningless. I could list more, but will not, because it won't all fit here.<br/><br/>Then there's the notorious shaky cam camera work. I did forget to be annoyed by it at some point, but at first it was noticeable and irritating.<br/><br/>All in all, a disappointment. A waste."

Therefore, I could be a little biased towards this film, and this is my first review, so please be nice. The story and plot were good, I was thoroughly entertained throughout (as films should seek to do!). There is an argument that the film is lacking in depth and it's hard to feel anything for any of the characters, but I enjoyed deciding on which character to support through the film. To put it simply, it's about the American criminal John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) and his gang of bank robbers. They are pursued by cop Melvin Purvis (Chritian Bale). Both give good performances, as do Marion Cotillard and Stephen Graham. The make-up, costumes and the overall look of the film are brilliant. They capture the late 30's and early 40's great and the high-definition picture is definitely up there amongst some of the most crystal clear images I have ever seen. However, it is the sound that really lets this film down and costs it scoring a seven or eight. Having bought the blu-ray release, hoping the sound quality would improve on the digital version I had previously, I was bitterly disappointed to hear no change. The sound changes volume at will and in periods needs to be drastically turned down. It was so bad I had to hole the remote throughout the film, for fear of blowing my speakers! Simple review, but I feel my point is made. It could have been great and would watch it more often if weren't for the poor sound."

","Bryan Burrough's book, 'Public Enemies', was an exhaustive account of the wave of bank-robberies that afflicted America in the early 1930s, and the people who undertook them. In his forward, the author makes the interesting point that the story proceeded in an essentially modern world, a place with automatic weapons, automobiles, and air-planes. Michael Mann's film dramatises some of the book, concentrating on the person of John Dillinger, and it's a fairly typical Michael Mann film: heavyweight and solid, slightly over-glamorising its participants, pitching the tale as a personal fight between the lawman and the criminal (though to be fair, the book also does this to some extent) but somewhat emotionally unaffecting and impersonal. The sense of Dillinger as one-part folk-hero, one part cold-blooded murderer, never quite comes through as Mann prefers to show us a story of people just doing what they have to do (a world-view he also showed us in 'Heat'). This is a fairly true representation of what happened; but a little bit more creativity would not have gone amiss."
"antonjsw1","9","0","0","7 April 2013"," A solid drama, meticulously made with a first rate performance by Depp as Dillinger
","Led by a first rate controlled, confident but restrained performance by Depp in the lead role, film-maker Michael Mann has crafted another excellent crime drama, albeit its rather restrained and detached nature means that it doesn't quite reach the heights of involvement that a viewer gets with some of Mann's previous outings such as Heat, The Insider and Miami Vice. However, the film is so well made, the script so well put together, and performances so impressive, that it keeps you engrossed even though the ending, based on real-life history, is known from the outset.<br/><br/>All key performances are universally impressive, most notably Depp as Dillinger, Bale is nascent FBI lawman Purvis, and while virtually other performances are spot on, there also has to be mention of some excellent performances in smaller parts by Billy Crudup as J Edgaar Hoover, Peter Gerrety as the lawyer Louis Piquett, and Stephen Lang as Agent Winstead (he previously worked on Mann's Manhunter). However, Oscar winning actress Marion Cotillard's performance is not as good as those around her. It's not bad, it's just it feels less involving than the other performances in the cast.<br/><br/>As usual technical credits for the film are generally excellent. Regular Mann director of photography Dante Spinotti frames the shots well, certainly the action sequences, which have Mann's trademark slickness and panache, but are also very grounded. However the use of filming this particular story with digital cameras I found an interesting one, as it can occasionally feel unusual to have the video look in what is a period film. Dark Knight production designer Nathan Crowley creates a fine look to the proceeding, and editing is also slick yet subtle.Composer Elliot Goldenthals score is effective if low key, with the focus being on the effective integration of appropriate period music. <br/><br/>Michael Mann orchestrates proceedings with his usual skill. However there is one fault in the film that prevents it from achieving greatness. Despite being very well made, the balance between a realistic portrayal of the characters and getting the audience involved in their personal journey was definitely weighted towards the former. While there was probably as much apathy towards the police as gangsters in that time period, albeit there was something of a folk hero persona around Dillinger, it is interesting that the film takes a neutral stance on this, which rubs off on an equally neutral portrayal of Purvis and his team, and does rob the film of a genuinely interesting personal story to invest in emotionally.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it's a meticulously well-made and impressive film."

I could see this being hard for people who aren't interested in history to watch, but the action might be able to capture their attention again. And the bluegrass music is to die for."

","PUBLIC ENEMIES.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>I have been wanting to see this for a while now. I am a Johnny Depp fan and a Christian Bale fan.<br/><br/>The movie is about a notorious bank robber named John Dillinger, played by Johnny Depp. There are only 2 things he loves, his girlfriend Billie, and robbing banks. Christian Bale plays an FBI agent who is determined to catch Dillinger.<br/><br/>The movie has some really good action scenes in it. I love the bank robberies and I also love the scenes where he tries to escape from prison. This movie is set in the 30s and has that old fashioned feel to it.<br/><br/>It is not Johnny Depps best film in my opinion, i prefer the ones where he is made up not to look like himself... but it does make a nice change to actually see his face on the screen.<br/><br/>I thought Christian Bale could have been in it more. He does not have anywhere as much screen time as I had hoped. Also, he is speaking in a strong accent and I struggled to understand some of the lines he said. But this does not ruin the movie too much.<br/><br/>I remember thinking while watching Public Enemies how in a small way it has a similarity to Natural Born Killers. Mickey & Malory Knox were murderers on the run but the general public grew to love them anyway and were cheering for them to escape the police. The same thing happens here... Dillinger was robbing banks and shooting his gun all over town, but he was loved by most of the public. They protected him.<br/><br/>I give this film a 7 out of 10.<br/><br/>Great movie, but like all bio pics, how much of it is true?<br/><br/>For more of my reviews please like my Facebook page:<br/><br/>http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?fref=ts"

","Johnny Depp brings a gangster-charming quality to his performance as famous (or should I say infamous)gangster John Dillinger in this dramatization of the criminal's life as 'Public Enemy # 1.' Though not everything is historically accurate, this film is still an interesting story on the last few months in the life of Chicago's most infamous resident since the days of Capone. Alongside Depp is 'Batman' star Christian Bale as FBI Agent Melvin Purvis who spent years chasing after Dillinger through the Midwest of the United States. In her American film debut is Marion Cotillard as the lovely Billie Freschett, the main squeeze of Dillinger before his death. The film really sets you into the era of the 1930s when crime was rampant and the most infamous criminals were loose in the streets of Chicago. If you want a good crime thrill, then check out 'Public Enemies'"

","Even Miami Vice had something that inspired me to revisit it, even if that revisit only confirmed my suspicions. Nonetheless, it offered a sense of greatness missed, in a lesser variation on the way that Heaven's Gate does. Public Enemies offers none of this. It's not a disaster. It is exactly what it seems to be, and that's its problem. Subtext, never a big part of a Michael Mann movie, is MIA here. The other problem is the choice of medium. This is the first film I've seen which has made me question the use of digital photography. Here it grates. It's a modern medium. Here, in a movie steeped in the 1930s, it throws you out of the moment, time after time. There are good performances, the cinematography's appropriate, the script's adequate but the whole fails to achieve anything beyond the sum of its parts. Blah."
"rcastl2335","2","0","0","26 May 2012"," A paycheck movie
","This is a paycheck movie for all concerned, a chance to dress up in 30's drag and collect some cash while skipping through some tired, old material. In this case, it's an expensive rehash of the 1973 Warren Oates/John Milius'film Dillinger. (In fact the older, low budget version, with an over-ripe performance by Warren Oates as Dillinger and a young Richard Dreyfuss as a mad/bad/belligerent Baby Face Nelson, is more fun.)Although director Michael Mann bragged at the time about the amount of original research done for the script, it manages to repeat many of the historical inaccuracies of the Milius' film. (The Little Bohemia ambush wasn't the end of the gang; they pulled at least one more job. Also, Baby Face Nelson and Pretty Boy Floyd both out-lived Dillinger.) Finally, the visual look of the film is of poor quality during the night sequences and shootouts. Mann, who in the past has shown a sumptuous eye (watch Thief or Last of the Mohicans) switched to shooting in digital on Collateral and it was a bad move. In night sequences, digital looks grainy and cheap while during the gunfight sequences you can actually see the pixels separate. It's a grubby, artificial look. Despite the amount of talent amassed for the film, it's wasted pretty badly. Skip this one and watch Bonnie and Clyde again."

","Maybe the marketing was bad, leading me to believe this was a film that it wasn't. Maybe the story was bad, not quite able to draw the viewer (me) in to their world of crime society at the turn of the century. Maybe the characters were too shallow, or their inner-workings too subtle, making it difficult for me to care about them.<br/><br/>In any case, if, at the end of a movie, I'm asking all these kinds of questions, you know I'm not going to give it a good grade. <br/><br/>I've never been a fan of ""bad guy"" as the hero/protagonist type of story. And that is what Mann has been serving up in many of his movies. So perhaps it is my bias. But the main characters, who are marketing as having this cat-and-mouse type game between them rarely interact. There's no strategy. There's no planning. It's just ""hey, let's go rob a bank with a bunch of guns and a getaway car"". Followed by the good guys saying, ""OK men, this is a dangerous assignment, be prepared to be killed in a hail of bullets, and if you see them, shoot to kill"".

"jackharding89-1","6","0","0","9 April 2012"," Where's the HEAT?
","It's hard to watch any Michael Mann film these days without feeling even the slightest of tendencies to measure it against HEAT- Mann's cops- versus-crims epic that stirred, stunned and starred a couple of 'alright' actors called Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. Ask any Mann fan what they consider his best film to be and they'll almost certainly come back with the aforementioned. Ask a stubborn film snob like me and I'll insist on The Insider. Anyway, whoever you ask, whichever Mann film you favour, the above-mentioned movies actually have a lot in common: superbly acted urban allegories with clear eyes about the importance of look, sound and feel. They're also comprised of great scripts, photography, sound, scores, half a dozen lens filters and rather memorable endings. <br/><br/>So, ""where does this leave Mann's latest film?"" I hear you ask. Well, not only is Public Enemies his finest since the quite brilliant Collateral, but it's reasonably akin to the above-mentioned movies in a variety of ways, especially HEAT. Public Enemies is a relatively well acted, well shot and scored US based action/thriller that's loaded with breathtaking shoot outs: it looks, feels and above all sounds pretty good. What's more, Mann's grafted A-list stars Johnny Depp and Christian Bale onto its set-up, employing vintage yet somewhat bare characterisation techniques to show the similar mind sets and emotions of cops and robbers. Having said that, though, Public Enemies lacks that (for want of a better word) 'zing' that made Mann's finest work just that. To rank his latest film amidst his best would not only be generous, it would be wrong. <br/><br/>Pubic Enemies is an overlong, self assured film that has been drained of all depth and complexity to make room for some fast, profit- reaping commercialism and high concept. Spun from Bryan Burrough's equally titled book, the film tells the true tale of notorious bank robber John Dillinger (Depp), a charismatic, Robin Hood like maverick whose swift and graceful raids made him the number one target of J. Edgar Hoover's newly founded FBI and its chief agent, Melvin Purvis (Bale). <br/><br/>Back in a Depression ridden, 1930's America, Dillinger's name and antics held somewhat of an illustrious place in society. No cop could stop him. No bank could beat him. No jail could hold him. His magnetism and foolhardy prison breaks widened his appeal to almost everyone, from his girlfriend Billie Frechette (a superb Marion Cotillard) to a society who felt no compassion for the banks that had thrust their nation into a Depression. If only Dillinger and his band of crooks were among us now, eh? Anyway, the film is basically a far from extraordinary dramatisation of a particularly 'eventful' year in the life of a love- struck Dillinger with Purvis' bid to catch him acting as an omnipresent plot boost.<br/><br/>Pitting Depp against Bale, Public Enemies certainly harks back to Mann's metro' crime classics HEAT, The Insider and Collateral, yet, it ultimately fails to tap Bale's true potential. If there's any area that the film can be seriously accused of faltering in then it's in the sheer depth of Bale's forgettable supporting character: there isn't any. Depp is excellent, playing a tortured, bent kind of anti villain who, like De Niro's character in HEAT, has a heart, a dream and enough principles to steal the audience's sympathy. Bale is far less convincing, though- trapped inside a shallow, uninspiring role that begs to be explored. He does the best with what he's been given, yes, but I'm afraid the usually reliable Bale has been upstaged for the third film on the bounce by an actor who's just had more to work with. Ledger had the Joker. Worthington had Marcus Wright. And now Depp has Dillinger. I'm not even sure why Bale even went for this role. He's a side character at best. I found Marion Cotillard's character and performance far more interesting. Anyway, enough Bale bashing. Onto the film stuff.<br/><br/>Mann's hands-on approach to filming combined with Elliot Goldenthal virtuoso score and sound mixing are the film's underlying strengths. A modern sheen on 1930's styling is also brought to fruition but Mann and DP Dante Spinotti shoot and frame the locations in such a way that they ultimately fail to boast the same kind of presence the urban spaces did in their previous work. For me, Public Enemies does not reflect Mann's knack for transforming city and landscapes into screen characters. A few overhead shots, tracks or even the odd long shot or two would've been nice. Maybe even a tea-stained, saturated lens filter would've added a little more authenticity, a little more character. It sure did the job in that Francis Ford Copolla gangster film. I forget what it's called. Anyway, I guess I'm nitpicking, but when it comes to Michael Mann, when it comes to one of the most experienced visualists in the business, you expect better. The dark and largely sombre palette employed along with the cold, clear interiors certainly add to a detailed mise-en-scene that works well with a whole host of hand-held coverage but Mann's summer smash stirs in the shadows of his transfixing, urban masterstrokes and emerges a forgettable gangster caper.<br/><br/>Good: At times suspenseful, sometimes sensual and very well scored, Public Enemies is a decent yet unremarkable film riddled with remarkable gunfights. Mann's authorial traits permeate the plot throughout and his droll Cagney homage a la Stephen Graham was a very nice touch, but I guess Public Enemies belongs to Johnny Depp- if anyone.<br/><br/>Bad: The comparisons are there alright, but Public Enemies is no HEAT. Bale's talents all but go to waste inside a second-rate supporting role and the film, itself, is nothing more than a flimsy genre mash-up when weighed against the likes of, say, Scarface, Once upon a time in America, American Gangster and Miller's Crossing."
"c-foss25","5","0","0","29 February 2012"," Formulaic, Hollywood gangster movie
","When I think about the gangster flicks during the height of the film noir movement, I remember how even the most insignificant gang member was given some form of development that makes them stick out. Sure, in lesser films these little instances of development were usually bogged down with clichés such as ""the violent one"", ""the nice one"", ""the guy who likes guns"", and so on, but it worked, it helped me care about people I would find repulsive in real life. ""Public Enemies"" doesn't attempt that at all. I found myself becoming confused as to who was who in the film among the various criminals. Dillinger's gang seemed like a mish mash of random bodies to be shot (even his close ""friend"" Red) and the other gangsters seemed like equally blank stand ins who exist solely to die in ways that beg us to care.<br/><br/>What's even more unforgivable is how unfocused the story of Dillinger himself feels as the movie progresses. The film seems to jump from event to event with no logic or reason. Maybe his development is happening between the scenes? By the climax of the film when he's reduced to a desperate man I started thinking about how powerful such circumstances would have been had we been watching a movie that actually knew where it was going and had a point. This is the movie's biggest downfall and one that ultimately killed it for me. Mann is presenting us Dillinger as is, with no explanation or reason, just slapping him up on the screen as if we are watching a documentary. Maybe some will be pleased with this choice, but for me, it makes for a poor movie and an ever poorer drama. If I don't care for a character, a movie fails, and if a character isn't being developed properly along with a story, I simply cannot care.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the camera work did little to improve the clarity of the film. Mann chose to shoot pretty much every scene hand-held, which began to make me feel sick about ten minutes in. This choice throws any chance for beautiful shots and montages right out the window, leaving room for an ugly and unpleasant experience that is all too familiar with a style that should have died out years ago. Hand-held is fine for certain scenes, but it is not something that lends itself well to an entire film. Combined with the who is who nature of the characters, the films cinematography made it almost impossible for me to decipher what the hell was going on.<br/><br/>Which is a pity, as there are some damn fine performances in the film. Depp was unsurprisingly good, if quite reserved as Dillinger, and Bale pulled off a admirable job as his nemesis. The best of the lot was easily Cotillard as Billie, a performance that actually made the film seem better than it actually was (such an achievement is usually Depp's doing). She was beautiful and believable, her characterization almost made me care about the relationship between her character and Dillingeralmost."

","Public Enemies is a great movie that brings to screen the story of John Dillinger, who was public enemy #1 during the Great Depression. Johnny Depp is an amazing actor as John Dillinger, and was also made to look quite alike in this film.

It shows that he had love in his life as well, which is shown through the character of Billie, played by Marion Cotillard. The plot in this movie is realistic and quite reflective to John Dillinger's real story.<br/><br/>Public Enemies has action at times, and a lot of shooting. The theme of this movie is similar to that of the movie Bonnie and Clyde, who were two other criminals during the Great Depression.

The characters were using their stage names but you couldn't hear it very well and it was ""mumbly"" at best so knowing who was who was difficult at best. Overall, a disappointing film that lasted about a half hour too long. Buy a used copy from Amazon but don't invest too much in it. I believe if they could have given the audience a better picture of who the characters were (outside the main ones) and what their roles were, it might've made a better movie. But for goodness sakes..don't fill the screen with their faces. It looked like the camera was looking at the character through a peephole..so much face! I give it a C-- rating."

","Man, I was expecting better. And probably because I was expecting this movie to be really cool, I gave it such a low rating. It was very disappointing. I mean, a crime drama with Johnny Depp, Christian Bale and Marion Cotillard in the main roles, all of them Oscar worthy actors. What more could you want? I think for starters I would like another DIRECTOR. Michael Mann has done some great films. And by done I mean directed, produced and wrote. The Insider and all the others he did, I'm right up there with him. But man do I think this is a poorly directed film. The screenplay isn't that thrilling also. I mean even in those RARE scenes in which we have tension, one of the characters comes up with a stupid line and screws it all up. Marion Cotillard wasn't that great. But if we are in the ""bad acting"" category over here, might I say that the performance Christian Bale gives in this film...AWFUL. Maybe it's just me but I would've preferred him with his Batman accent or whatever.<br/><br/>Now what was good? I found only two things positive about this film. The first one is Johnny Depp. Even with the whole ""opposition"" he had from the script he still managed a strong performance. Now the second one is the cinematography. Have to say, that was actually great.<br/><br/>I will not give this movie a 5 because it is not as bad as movies like Legion or Priest but I won't want to see this movie again unless it's with someone that can attract my attention while I am watching it."

","Public Enemies is a gripping film chronicling the final moments of one of the most infamous American criminals - John Dillinger. The film, set in 1930s Chicago, allows the viewer to peer into the life of a twisted yet brilliant renegade. John Dillinger, played by Johnny Depp, is a man plagued by an traumatic childhood and is artificially seeking satisfaction from life of crime. As the movie progresses, the real desire of Mr. Dillinger is revealed - he wants whatever man wants, to be loved unconditionally. His love interest in the movie is a woman named Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard). Billie is capable of loving Dillinger although she knows that his lawless escapades will soon come to an end. Dillinger is challenged by his nemesis, Melvis Purvis (Christian Bale) of the FBI. Purvis represents rise of the FBI, he is bent on bringing down the crime world's elite and John Dillinger will serve as his greatest accomplishment. Dillinger repeatedly evades capture while performing some of the most daring and incredible jail breaks. He is eventually thwarted by a prostitute and killed as brazen as the crimes he committed.<br/><br/>The theme of the film is love conquers all but crime never pays. The love shared between Dillinger and Frechette rivals any witnessed in a major motion picture. But love is blind and Dillingers lifestyle assured a meaningful but short relationship between himself and his beloved Billie.<br/><br/>Public Enemies is similar in dramatic presentation and romance to the movie, ""American Gangster."" Denzel Washington plays a modern day gangster, Frank Lucas, who controls a powerful drug-running business in Manhattan. Detective Richie Roberts, played by Russell Crowe, is bent on bringing down Lucas' empire. While the intense drama between Lucas and Roberts plays out, Frank Lucas falls in love with Eva (Lymari Nadal). Frank and Eva's relationship is one that exists despite Eva's knowledge of Frank's nefarious ways. Likewise, Eva knows that her life with Frank will be short but she desires his presence in her life nonetheless. Frank's drug smuggling schemes are eventually figured out by Roberts. Lucas is arrested and sent to jail. But, not before he reveals a wide-spread laundering scheme by a vast majority of New York City police drug-enforcement officers.<br/><br/>Both ""Public Enemies"" and ""American Gangster"" are based on real-life stories of two infamous American crime figures. Both movies also prove that although love looks beyond faults, some faults deny the possibility of a long-lasting relationship."

It seems that director of the movie try to tell the story in extreme hurry. He did not let the characters developed properly as we understand very much less about the John Dallington's any other aspect of life apart from being a robber. Johny Depp no doubt is an acknowledged actor. He has done a great justice to the cool, confident, cocky nature of the character but i feel there was not much acting margin or you can say supporting details into characters provided by the screen writer to make the character really stand out. Christian bale, another fine actor could not amuse me much. He was perfect in his looks for FBI agent but when we seen him shooting down the streets lawlessly and viewer could not find any clue about the depth of the character. I would must appreciate the cinematography on the other side. intriguing night scene, street lights, car head lights, FBI agents costumes and old gadgets such as radio and shoe polish chairs were treat to watch on screen. There are some times in movie when you like it then next moment when it comes to characters you start feeling some thing is missing. Story is been told in some way more like a documentary style rather than a movie because of the poor scene sequences. the action sequences, robberies and street shootouts were very well picturized but.......editing...could have been add much more to this crime drama. Nothing at all through the editing software has been used to bring the dramatic effect into the movie you don't see slow motion camera actions or time lapse or anything fancy. In summary expectations were quite high but its hard to ask for. It can be a date movie (who cares for the movie when some one is on date) but its not serious film.

","""It took me two year to finally see this Film."" I intended on seeing it upon release but stayed away because of a few negative reviews. Overall, I recommend this Film but with some reservation. There is somewhat of a thematic afterthought to glamorize this notorious gangster and that I cannot recommend. To rob banks and to murder in some of our (USA) most depressing times and to be idolized decades later is without question, a biographical error in Filmmaking and in judgment. There are also chronological errors as well as the fact that Pretty Boy Floyd times had not yet ended and Purvis (Bale) is given credit for his death by Dillinger (Depp). Now I realize that with three credited screenwriter's including the Film's Director, you would think somebody would have the correct factual research. Also, Gene Autry's stardom and music was not around until the 1930's but I won't quivel about that. The cast is great, Bale is really strong and Depp finds a way to make us think this man had at least some kind of heavy heart. The editing is choppy aka; Michael Mann style and there is even some modern music thrown in for effect. The problem is, this film and story as true has can be did not need to be edgy or at that matter a new-age gangster picture... what it needed is simply to honor the facts in the case. We know now the woman in red actually had a orange dress so if they had that research you would think the filmmakers had actual Chicago Police and FBI files to work from. The Production Design is excellent but for whatever reason, there is a purposely left out the society of people that smoked, drank heavily and were in the middle of a depression. For Michael Mann's the Film is actually tame aside from his realistic violence. I just wish his realism could reach to the people that are the subject of his Films. The G-Men are portrayed as usual babbling idiots and the gangsters are the typical dark underworld types. For the Dillinger conspiracy theory folks out there, you won't like this film but for myself that wanted to know more about Purvis's motives to get Public Ememy number one, it did satisfy my craving there."

For someone who has portrayed so many quirky characters, it's surprising to see Depp so determined to make a famous gangster into someone who could as easily be a stockbroker. Dillinger turns out to be the least interesting thing in the movie.<br/><br/>More interesting is Christian Bale's intense performance as Purvis and the portrayal of the FBI changing the way criminals are pursued.

The secondary characters added to the story and made it all the more interesting and entertaining. <br/><br/>I liked how the movie started, it got me attached to it; and also, how it ended, which was disappointing but nice.<br/><br/>Overall, you should watch this movie, although it's kind of long."

","Public enemies was a colossal disappointment with huge star cast and a famous director. The difficult 1930s is a time of robbers who knock over banks and other rich targets with alarming frequency. Of them, none is more notorious than John Dillinger, whose gang plies its trade with cunning efficiency against big businesses while leaving ordinary citizens alone. As Dillinger becomes a folk hero, FBI head J. Edger Hoover is determined to stop his ilk by assigning ace agent Melvin Purvis to hunt down Dillinger. As Purvis struggles with the manhunt's realities, Dillinger himself faces an ominous future with the loss of friends, dwindling options and a changing world of organized crime with no room for him. When I saw the trailer, I was very excited from the promos but was completely disappointed after watching the film. The film was too long and at some point of time was dragging at a snail's pace. Michael Mann direction was extremely poor. The way Depp escapes from the prison was too difficult to digest. It was too lenient. He is not in form this time. Christian Bale did his part well as an FBI agent. Cinematography was awesome along with the art direction and sound effects. So, overall I was not satisfied with the movie at all. If it wouldn't been for Johnny Depp and Christian Bale, I would never see the movie."

","I had medium hopes for this movie before I watched it. They were soon dashed to pieces like Nancy Kerrigan's knee meeting a steel pipe. Except the Nancy Kerrigan story was interesting. I never thought they could make a story about bank robbers who lived fast, violent lives boring. Somehow, they found a way. The movie drags in many, many places in between action scenes. The pacing is horrible. There are so many long dull parts you'd swear you were watching Depp in Leaving Las Vegas. <br/><br/>Nothing happens for long periods of time, then all of a sudden there's an action scene. Unfortunately, the action is also boring or shot in a manner that makes watching it unbearable. The camera often zooms in too close to tell what's going on, like in the Quantum of Solace, but not quite that bad. The filmmaker also decided to shoot the movie in a grainy style, which makes it look more like it is from the 1940s or 50s or whatever, and also makes it even harder to tell what's going on. The worst part is that Johnny Depp's character thinks he's so cool and bad, when the movie makes it seem like he doesn't really do anything. There's some guy chasing him, but we barely see him at all. Mostly it's just Johnny Depp doing nothing and talking to some waitress or something trying really hard to impress her even though she's dumpy and not attractive. <br/><br/>There could be an interesting cops and robbers meets the Fugitive story in here, but the director instead told a boring love story: the story of how John Dillinger was in love with himself and tried to make a waitress think he was cool. This, apparently, was his life's goal. In the end, nobody cared, especially the audience. A much better period piece of a similar vein which I think also has Johnny Depp or possibly Jude Law, is Road to Perdition. If you want to watch something interesting, watch that. If you want video proof that before television, the internet, and video games the world was very boring, watch this piece of monkey crap."

","This film elicited nothing but indifference and boredom from me. The cinematography, pacing, sound editing and lighting all seem very amateurish for someone like Mann who is considered a great stylist. The love story aspect of the film is very tepid we are subjected to some terrible acting from the female lead during her interrogation scene. The members of Dillinger's gang are all relegated to the background so Depp is never really given a decent foil for his character and we also learn next to nothing about his co-conspirators. Christian Bale is wasted here in his role as the agent pursuing Dillinger. He has very little screen time and the little that he does get sees him scowling and frowning as he paces about.<br/><br/>If the best thing people can say about the film is that the gunfire is very very loud in the shootout scenes (a Michael Mann signature) and that the costumes look nice.....then it might be best to give this one a miss.<br/><br/>Back to re-watch Heat then."

Michael Mann did a bad job shooting the movie, although the acting performances are pretty good for a big budget movie. Avoid this movie and watch Scarface or Godfather.

The movie, albeit a bit long, goes at a smooth pace until the careful direction of Mann, who rarely misses a step in his films. A robust cast of characters play their respective roles effectively, but the highlight is Depp who commands the screen whenever he's on it.

"johnnyboyz","7","0","0","28 July 2010"," Not exactly 'number one' in the Mann back-catalogue, but Public Enemies is a roaring and pulsating return to form which will certainly suffice.
","This surely must be the proof that Michael Mann can now make these sorts of films in his sleep. Public Enemies is an interesting retreading of old ground, a thriller focusing in on the criminals whom run the show and the police officers charged with taking them down; you don't need me to tell you which of Mann's films this most sounds like. I think a degree of getting back on track accompanies Public Enemies, much like Tarantino's film from that same summer of 2009, Public Enemies is a going back to basics for a man whose last film was flat-out woeful: a deprived and stupefying exercise named Miami Vice. If Inglourious Basterds was an acknowledgment of the tried, tested and failed experiment that was Death Proof; and began with a sequence involving a Nazi officer and a scared French farmer somewhat reminiscent of Samuel L. Jackson's Jules and his badgering and interrogating an apartment room full of kids as he senses what he wants is nearby, then it was Tarantino as a whole going back to what he is most known and liked for in Pulp Fiction an re-jigging the material to win us over again. Here, Mann revisits the same sort of material he's best known and liked for, in 1995's Heat, only he delivers Public Enemies with a slight re-jigging in that it's a retelling of the plight of real-life gangster out of the 1930s: John Dillinger.<br/><br/>There is no Pacino chasing De Niro around modern day L.A. here; instead, the still rather ample replacements of Johnny Depp's Dillinger and cohorts running amok in a number of locations, predominantly Chicago, and Christian Bale's Bureau of Investigation agent named Melvin Purvis, an additionally true-to-life character, after him. Mann's toying with the material is an entertaining and substantial enough yarn, the men here apparently connected not by way of the fact they know not how to do anything else nor their link in that they struggle domestically with their lives and friends around them; there is no coffee house scene to highlight the similarities both men share as they occupy different sides of the coin, but there is a sequence when Dillinger and Purvis stand opposite one another whilst Dillinger is incarcerated. What follows is an exchange that sees both men forced into recognising they share the same experiences with death, specifically the deaths of friends and co-workers, and thus are somehow intrinsically linked. It'll sound loose and flimsy, but then few will say it's a better film than Heat anyway.<br/><br/>Dillinger's superiority when compared to other criminals is established in the opening sequence, a scene that sees a number of jailed prisoners out in the courtyard shuffling forward whilst chained together in drab, striped prison uniforms. Cut to Dillinger, by himself, and being escorted into the prison whilst decked out in a smart black suit and hat. That small sense of hierarchy is complete when it's revealed he's there to aid in instigating a breakout. Meanwhile, Purvis is on the run after gangster Pretty Boy Floyd through some woodland; Purvis' men outnumber him but Floyd's automatic weaponry dwarfs Purvis' bolt action rifle: the catch being Purvis is a crack-shot, and we soon find out that he is. The link between the establishing of both men is chase, Dillinger's dominating of the guards as he lays siege to their watch tower outside the jail in getting away with most of the men standing in contrast to Purvis' chasing and apprehending of Floyd; Dillinger's dominance of his pursuers and Purvis' clinical efficiency of his apprehension of those fleeing neatly teeing up the later match between the two.<br/><br/>It is indeed after these pleasantries the film becomes the game of oneupmanship you'd expect, a cat and mouse thriller in which both sides suffer losses, lick wounds and revel in glories. Like Heat, the principal thief character in Dillinger is given a somewhat spur of the moment love interest; someone he promptly sleeps with, falls for and promises to ship on out of the country with in due time. Here, rather than De Niro promise Amy Brenneman's Eady tales of New Zealand, we have French actress Marion Cotillard's character Billie Frechette coming into contact with Dillinger and tales of far off nations plus the good life. Billie's character arc is given due attention, the sorts of dangers that face her becoming slow realities after a handful of incidences and the stark realisation of which side of the fence she's on becoming gut-wrenchingly apparent when a police station beating occurs. In a film about a feud-come-relationship between two men, it's pleasant that Dillinger's bonding with Billie doesn't detract too much.<br/><br/>The film is punctuated with an array of shoot outs and heists, heists often turning into shootouts; the centrepiece of which is a woodland area shootout perhaps comparable to that grandeur post-bank robbery shootout which spilt out into the street and beyond found in Heat. Supporting characters on either side are not given us much attention here, but at a small cost; with an interesting sequence unfolding later on, in the camera lingering on Purvis' pained face as a captured and injured gangster in serious need of some anaesthetic lies next door being interrogated – these are sadistic and cruel methods being administered in sadistic and cruel times of crime by the enforcers of the law themselves. Does Purvis seem minutely allured by it all? A small taste of what Dillinger himself inflicts, either physically or by reputation, on people all the time? It'll remind you of Barbara Stanwyck's perverse expression-come-smile in Double Indeminity, as her crippled husband is strangled next to her; it's the feeling of being this close to off key, off colour tactics for the first time to garner what you really want, and it comes out perfectly in the slightest of facial expressions. Mann is back on track after a temporary blip, and here he and his team have crafted a fine thriller."

","Michael Mann made a taut and colorful movie about a gang of thieves, ""Heat,"" some years ago but, boy, this is familiar material.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is John Dillinger, public enemy number one in the early 30s. Everyone knows his face and name. Marion Cotillard is his moll, to whom he returns whenever the story needs a break to allow the wreathes of gun smoke to clear. Christian Bale is Dillinger's chief nemesis, his Jabert, as it were, named Melvin Purvis, who is ordered by J. Edgar Hoover, President-for Life of the FBI, to track down Dillinger and bring him to justice. Assorted miscreants like Alvin Karpis, Frank Nitti, Louis Piquett, Pretty Boy Floyd, Baby Face Nelson, and Jo-Jo the Dog Faced Boy show up in minor parts.<br/><br/>It should have been called ""The John Dillinger Story"" and it would have made a good 1930s B feature or a Roger Corman cheapie from the early 60s, which, maybe, it was. It's all about Dillinger and his travails. Depp plays him as a go-getter unconcerned about the past. (What keeps him awake at night? ""Coffee."") He wisecracks with the press and becomes something of a public hero, along the lines of Bonny and Clyde.<br/><br/>Christian Bale as the G-Man is efficient, ruthless, humorless, relentless, and a bit of a brute. He beats hell out of prisoners to get information. But, well, come to think of it, he has certain limited gentlemanly qualities. When he finds one of his agents -- a jutting chinned, beefy, pig-eyed guy -- using the petite French actress Marion Cotillard as a punching bag, he puts a stop to it. And we should note that when a captured criminal, a horribly wounded man with a bullet in his brain, is screaming with pain and begging for a shot from the doctor, Bale turns away as one of his men chokes some information out of the bad guy. Purvis is strictly a one-note character.<br/><br/>But, really, don't expect much new here. Purvis gained so much notoriety from his exploits that the media-hogging J. Edgar Hoover demoted him and Purvis resigned from the FBI in 1934. The gun battles are frequent, though sometimes clumsily staged, and you've seen them all in one or another form before. The Tommy guns chatter away with lightning speed but no recoil. You can hold it in one hand and spray bullets as if it were a garden hose or water pistol. And when two bank robbers are sitting around ruminating over a forthcoming job and one of them says, ""I got a feeling I'm not going to make it this time"" -- do you think he makes it? It's not a terrible movie. It doesn't insult the audience. It doesn't shove a viewer's face into the pain and the gore. It's just that it's all so awfully old."
"fred-kolb","Null","0","0","22 July 2010"," Nostalgic, well-acted gangster thriller, with some serious flaws in the pacing of the story though
","During the 1930s, which marked the infamous era of the Great Depression, a number of gangsters appeared on the scene and went on killing and robbing sprees throughout the United States. Among them were Bonnie & Clyde, who were immortalized through the 1967, but also Machine Gun Kelly, Pretty Boy Floyd, and John Dillinger. Now, the book ""Public Enemies"", by Bryan Burrough, which I have indeed read, is about the careers of all of these criminals, and one can assume that the film would have been about six hours long, if all the material from the source would have been incorporated.<br/><br/>Michael Mann, director of acclaimed crime thrillers such as ""Heat"", and ""Collateral"", decided to focus on the bank robber John Dillinger and his permanent cat and mouse game with the just recently established FBI. While several historic liberties were taken, the film creates a wonderfully nostalgic atmosphere in 1930s Chicago and other locations, and gives the audience an interesting perspective on the increasing crime spree during these days. Gangster thrillers are not exactly my favorite genre, but this film is a notable exception, as it is more the portrait of two extremely different men, one is the hunter, and one the pray, but both are outstanding in their wits and cunningness.<br/><br/>It is the Great Depression, and several gangsters emerge over the United States and go on a crime spree as there has never been one before in the country. J. Edgar Hoover, the ambitious head of the newly established Federal Bureau of Investigation, asks for more government funding, but is denied and his capability as a leader is repeatedly questioned. One of his most outstanding men, Melvin Purvis, manages to kill one of the most notorious criminals of the time, Pretty Boy Floyd, and earns Hoover's recognition and is entrusted with the task of heading the Chicago field office. Meanwhile, John Dillinger breaks out several of his friends out of the Indiana State Prison, where one of his best men is shot and killed by a guard. After robbing another bank, Dillinger meets Billie Frechette, and she is immediately charmed by his passion and enthusiasm for freedom, even though he tells her quite quickly how he makes his living. Purvis quickly gets onto Dillinger, but during a stakeout at a hotel, Purvis realizes that it wasn't Dillinger hiding out there, but another gangster known as Baby Face Nelson. Quickly, a cat and mouse game ensues between the two, and it is only a matter of time before one of them kills the other.<br/><br/>The mood of this film is extremely dark and the entire atmosphere is nostalgic, perfectly recreating the tone of the 1930s in the United States. Mann cut out several of the story lines found in the book and left out a number of criminals or reduces them to supporting players, like Pretty Boy Floyd and Baby Face Nelson. The entire film, which is just short of 2 1/2 hours, concentrates on the bank robber John Dillinger and his relationship with Billie Frechette, as well as his numerous escapes from the FBI. Even though the majority of the agents are portrayed as clueless amateurs, who make numerous mistakes that allow Dillinger and his gang to get away, the book points that out even clearer, and it's quite evident how much the Bureau has changed in the last 70 years. ""Public Enemies"" is a very quiet film most of the time, that only uses music sparingly, and that heavily focuses on character development. Once in a while the dialogs are interrupted by short shootings, which more or less succeed in keeping my attention, but unfortunately they also made me realize how long and slow-paced the rest of the scenes really were the movie really could have been quite a bit shorter. It almost seems like the writers couldn't decide whether this film should be about Dillinger and his love interest, or Dillinger robbing banks and shooting up the Feds, and instead of going deep into one or the other, at times they don't really seem to get into either one of the two. The cutting and action scenes look almost a bit sloppy and amateurish at times, but for some reason it seems to fit with the mood of the film.<br/><br/>One of the greatest parts about this film is without a doubt Johnny Depp, who cleverly avoids being stereo cast too much by occasionally playing dramatic roles instead of weird ones for his friend Tim Burton, and succeeds in bringing John Dillinger back to life. He brings an incredible personality to the character, without making him seem really likable, but instead playing him like he probably was in real life, cold and risk-taking. On the other side there's Christian Bale, adding another impressive performance to his resume, as FBI agent Melvin Purvis. Even though he stands on the good side of the law, he comes over as extremely cold and calculating, and there are very few scenes where he actually shows his warm and friendly side.. Marion Cotillard shows once again how much talent she has as Billie Frechette, Dillinger's naive, but eventually really tough girlfriend. Even though her acting is superb, I didn't find Dillinger's and Frechette's relationship too convincing and much too cold to have actually worked out. Maybe that is, because whenever they got really close, the scene was interrupted by another shooting. Those three dominate the plot and very few other actors manage to leave an impression, mainly because you can't keep up with the rapid introductions of new characters. Billy Crudup makes a convincing J. Edgar Hoover, but the character is really not explored too much, which also goes for Giovanni Ribisi and Channing Tatum.<br/><br/>Michael Mann went down with ""Miami Vice"", but with ""Public Enemies"" he went straight back to the top again, and let's hope he'll stay there with the next round of ammo he'll deliver."

Billy Crudup is heinous warlock J. Edgar Hoover, who started the Federal Investigation Bureau, so that police could chase bad guys like Dillinger across state lines.<br/><br/>From the book by Bryan Burrough, ""Public Enemies: America's Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI, 1933-34,"" directed by Michael Mann (LAST OF THE MOHICANS, THE INSIDER), PUBLIC ENEMIES dutifully goes through the paces of Dillinger's bank robberies (back when it could be done with three men in hardguy overcoats, big hats, and getaway car with lots of posing space on the running boards) and just as dutifully shows Purvis chasing Dillinger with his coterie of Keystone Cops. Neither Depp nor Bale create anything memorable with their characterizations, dialog or posedowns on running boards.<br/><br/>PUBLIC ENEMIES makes the same mistake as American GANGSTER - it makes the criminal too sexy to envision as an anti-social thug. Dillinger was notoriously popular and a charmer, but the man was also a sociopath. In a scene lifted from one of Dillinger's real life breakouts, he uses a plastic gun and manhandles each successive guard past each gate in such a way that none of them discover his ruse until he raids the gun rack for real guns. A man with that kind of force of will and resolve would have something really dangerous inside him that would override his charm. To look upon him would be to fear him. Yet how can we fear Jack Sparrow? While J. Edgar Hoover declares Dillinger the very first Public Enemy #1, the rest of the world is declaring him The Sexiest Man Alive.<br/><br/>Dillinger's heyday was in a transitional age, when physical bankrobbers like himself were slowly being overtaken by virtual bankrobbers. Phil D'Andrea plays a mob bookie whose telephone exchange brought in as much during a day as Dillinger could steal from one bank. Which should make one rethink the title of Burroughs's book - America's Greatest Crime Wave was not during the early '30s, it is now: AIG, Lehman Brothers, The Bush Klan and the Savings and Loan Scandal, et al...<br/><br/>Dillinger's friends - scattered around the country in safe houses and brothels - deserted him as the heat was turned up under him. The world crept away from Dillinger in the space of a short lifetime.<br/><br/>Dillinger takes a floosie (Marion Cotillard) as his squeeze and she seems to relish the life of worry of a gangster's moll. We never really connect with her until the film's last moments when Dillinger sends his last words, ""Bye bye, Blackbird."" Delivered by Stephen Lang, in a small role that packs that last emotional punch.<br/><br/>His final moments, Dillinger watches Clark Gable in MANHATTAN MELODRAMA delivering sage advice from the screen, ""Die the way you lived - all of a sudden - don't drag it out. Living like that doesn't mean a thing."" After spending 10 years in jail from age 19, it is a wonder how Dillinger's rep grew so fast into the blaze of glory it would become. And he went out the same way he lived: sexy."

On the one hand the camera is steady and flows, then there are the hand-held moments that inexplicably have the feeling of a home movie. Then there's the issue of the characters not being properly developed (another aspect of it being too busy). The casting is well-done but Cotillard doesn't fit in. Though she does look a lot like Billie Frechette, her French accent is too noticeable and though she tries to hide it by changing her tone, it doesn't quite work.

","I'm an admirer of Michael Mann films, and when I heard about this project, I got quite excited by the prospect of the famously meticulous director working with the equally obsessive, and detail-oriented Christian Bale. Oh, and I suppose the idea of Johnny Depp as Dillinger in a high budget period piece didn't hurt either. Unfortunately, one can't watch a Michael Mann film without drawing comparisons to his best work, and on that note, it doesn't live up to the man's incredible standards.<br/><br/>Let's put it this way: it lacks the suspense and existential banter of Collateral, the character play and development of Heat, the action of Last of the Mohicans, and the simple brilliance of The Insider. It does, however, borrow many of the negative factors in previous Mann films: the too-conventional love story from Last of the Mohicans that feels rushed and poorly strung together, the pacing of The Insider, and the sometimes too-obsessive attention to historical detail as in the case of Ali. That brings me to my next point, which is that Mann obsesses over some very small details, making sure that they are authentic to the way history has written them, while taking huge creative liberties with others. What makes this frustrating is that it's hard to see the pay-off when he chooses to be creative, and when he chooses to get bogged down in details.<br/><br/>From a technical standpoint, I'm not opposed to the use of digital photography, which has proved itself as a dependable medium (Benjamin Button, Collateral, Sin City etc.); however, the choice of colour pallet and minimalist lighting makes this film incredibly ugly to watch, and is one of the few overtly digital quality films I've seen where you know for every frame that this wasn't film. I imagine that Mann did this in order to differentiate himself from other period films, like The Untouchables (DePalma), which depicts prohibition era Chicago in an all-too-self-aware grandeur. Having said that, it's still no excuse for some of the really poor setups where you can see the actors' make-up, which is distracting, and takes you out of the experience. And perhaps it was the theatre I was in, but I've heard many similar complaints about a bad sound mix. Due in part to this latter fact, I felt the movie lacked a sense of rhythm, and never quite found its stride.<br/><br/>In the end, this film is not as thought-provoking as Mann's previous works, and it really lacks the two-way head-to-head that Heat did so well. In that film, one got a sense of the cat- and-mouse struggle despite the two opposing leads sharing very little screen time. In this film, you know that Purvis (Bale) is chasing Dillinger, but you only know this because you're told; otherwise, it's really like two separate films, both of which lack any sense of urgency between either party to take the other out. It also lacks a great deal of excitement, even in what should be its most riveting moments. I still say see it, but go in without expectations, otherwise they'll be dashed."

","The most awaited film of the year, Public Enemies, is a Michael Mann crime film. None among his peers are as adept at making crime dramas (with a particular tendency towards bank heists) as Mann. With films like Manhunter, Heat and Collateral Mann has established himself as a master of this genre. His latest, Public Enemies harks back to the time of the 1931-34 crime wave at its peak during the Depression Era, now dubbed the Public Enemy Era.<br/><br/>A discussion of the film hinges entirely on two novelties here. Filmed with a High Definition camera (Dante Spinotti), the cinematography alternates between whirlwinds of activity - almost as if trying to keep track of the heady and adrenaline-filled periods in the lives of John Dillinger and the other Public Enemies, and shots of the principal characters from close quarters, again coming across as attempts to gain admission. The second stems from the fact that Mann's film is based on a non-fiction book Public Enemies: America's Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI, 1933-34 by Brian Burrrough. It shows. The play of events on screen feels factual. The drama is very much present but lacks the choices-conflicts-decisions that made Heat and Collateral memorable, partly because the characters here are historical and we know what eventually happened to each of them. They are novelties for sure. A step forward for cinema in that this can serve as a model for dramatizing whilst documenting slices of history. As a result though, the nature of the participatory viewing the movie elicits is primarily of a technical nature, an invitation to be part of the ride. This has its bearing on every other aspect of the film.<br/><br/>The leads Johnny Depp and Christian Bale are perfect for their parts. Depp's John Dillinger is as steeped in fact as the film itself and benefits considerably from the tone of the film, designed to make the audience react to his character in much the same way that America did. The role requires him to be a star on-screen and fully conscious of it. A suave Depp pulls this off with aplomb; his every exploit is achieved with a swagger. That he fleshes out the other aspects of Dillinger is credit both to him and the script. Bale meanwhile, adds his reliability to the film, playing Melvin Purvis in a manner that isn't as straight- forward as seems. It is a consummate performance from an actor whose portrayals never overshadow his films and who seems to be an ace with accents, both traits prevalent here. Marion Cotillard is a different proposition from her turn in La Vie En Rose. In keeping with the Mann tradition, a supporting cast is well picked and delivers performances that don't sink with the weight of the leads. Elliot Goldenthal, whose score for Heat garnered praise, captures the thrill of the heists and the getaways. However, the score suffers from banality when the narrative lapses into drama.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Public Enemies' experimental nature makes it difficult for it to be judged completely now. In all likelihood, it might turn out to be a film that grows with time with certain aspects gaining greater acceptance in the future. I'm tempted to say bravo Mann."

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>In 1930s America, John Dillenger (Johnny Depp) and his cohorts were the talk of America, with their series of audacious bank robberies and the canny skill involved taking the news by storm. So to take down a ruthless criminal, was needed an even more ruthless Federal Agent, in the shape of Purvis (Christian Bale) who lead a team of men who left no stone unturned in their increasingly desperate battle against their adversaries.<br/><br/>Crime movie enthusiast Michael Mann has brought a real life criminal to life in this stirring biopic and found lead star Depp a role he is well suited for. Aside from his usual trademark touches, he's notably used a different style of camera lens and scope to film this in, giving it a more cutting edge, modern day feel. In the end, though, it all comes down to whether his approach works and on this occasion, sadly it hasn't.<br/><br/>The film feels empty, with a lot of scope and vision, but precious little to offer in the way of genuine depth and character. There's lots going on, all of it flashy and stylish, but somehow it all stays completely uninvolving. Which is wrong, considering all the talent involved. Depp is competent as ever in the lead role, bringing the right mood and style to Dillenger, while Bale also leaves no stone unturned as his adversary, taking us into a nose dive world of 30s law enforcement in a time before things like the Miranda Rights, where suspects and informants are beaten and made to suffer real psychological torture. <br/><br/>And what a supporting cast, with the likes of Marienne Coultiarrd as Dillenger's lover, Stephen Dorff, Channing Tatum, Billy Crudup, Giovanni Ribisi, Stephen Lang and from the Brit talent pack, Stephen Graham doing a fine New York accent as Dillenger's sidekick Baby Face Nelson. None of it really works, though, a big dreamer of a film that aimed for greatness but punched well below it's weight. **"

","What can I say about this movie? I can say I liked it, that's for sure! There were a lot of great scenes in this Johnny Depp movie about John Dillenger. This movie delivered the goods, that's for sure. I liked that part at the beginning when Pretty Boy Floyd was running through an apple orchard and was shot by Christian Bale at long range. I was surprised he died so soon though. Of course John Dillinger was very classy and clever to boot. I liked that one part where he was standing in the hotel near the coat rack and the patron wanted his coat. Johnny Depp slapped him on the back of head! What about that part where he is in jail and escapes? That was pretty cool also. I am a fan of the old gangster movies and this one did not disappoint. If you are going to this movie expecting to see major violence, don't get your hopes up. Also, I hated that fat boy that beat up Johnny's girlfriend with a phone book! How dare he did that! I was hoping that he died."

The story line was not too whacked out of history, and it kept you interested throughout the movie.<br/><br/>If you had to complain, I would say, as others did, the romance section took a little too much of the film with less relevance, but not enough to distract from the over all movie.<br/><br/>If your expectations are to watch a good movie, then its a definite plus.

","OK, Public Enemy, starring two of my favourite actors, Johnny Depp and Christian Bale. Where to start. In total, I liked the film, the acting was great, there was action, unfortunately there was the token love story. However, my dislikes for this film is that once again, there is absolutely no originality. It's another hollywoodien historical version of a truth directed and written in a way that the audience sympathizes with the Bad guy, John Dillinger, played by Johnny depp. Now I know that he was meant to be like a modern time Robin Hood, but this man killed dozens of cops, robbed banks etc and yet the film makes you side with him, even I sided with him. Christian bale, unfortunately had too small a role as the FBI agent assigned to the capturing of Dillinger, but (other than his opening cliché scene) when he was on screen, he was excellent, as per usual. This film is just typical directing and writing clichés that has been done a hundred times before, the anti-hero (gets shot in the arm, shows no pain) hollywoodized into a demi-god who is portrayed as being such a nice man, the FBI agent (bale) whose opening scene is shooting a guy with a rifle from like, 200 miles away, showing HOW GOOD he is, the women, who are either the easy type, or the (slightly) complicated can't make up her mind type. OK, result, I'll give it an OK, because, if you like brain fodder that's just going to tide you over for 2hrs20mins, then you'll like this film, if you are expecting something new, then don't bother, you've seen it all before."

","Public Enemies is one of the best films of 2009. Michael Mann directs this film with his usual brilliance. The performances by Johnny Depp, Christian Bale, et al, are exceedingly good. It is Mann's direction that takes the cake though and it is indeed shocking that this film did not receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Film and Best Director instead of the mediocre The Hurt Locker. For me this is Michael Mann's best film since Heat. Everything is handled with such care which is difficult to do, considering that this is a period film.Johnny Depp gives one of his best performances as John Dillinger. Christian Bale impresses with each new film of his. His performance as Melvin Purvis is suitably restrained. The screenplay is one of the strong points of this film. The shootouts are exhilarating without being unrealistic. Watch out for that superb sequence involving a shootout at a lodge.

","I find it very hard to dislike basic dramas when Depp is in them. His talent is to often wasted on movies of a comic book type. This is your basic retelling of the Dillinger criminal hero of the 30s. I liked the story line. Its hard to tell the life of such a famous character in 90+ minutes and you have to fit a lot of stuff into the movie so you also tell history as well as the personal story of the character.<br/><br/>It's a sad story of a somewhat decent but violent criminal(Depps role) who becomes the target of governmental change in policy. The story is told in a way that you see Dillinger as a political target as the mob is forming into a business entity and the beginning of federal enforcement on a local level. Though one might find pity in how Dillinger is made the scapegoat, one has to remind themselves that he was an arch criminal and had to be stopped. But the rebel in oneself might want him to escape with his woman to a far away place.<br/><br/>Depp gives humanity to Dillinger and Bale does a very good job as the hunter."

","The film starts off very promisingly, and I was really invested with it in the first 40 minutes. I thought they were really great, but it was not long that I started feeling the film was not as compelling as it needed to be. The film does have some really great scenes, most notably the action sequences. They were impeccably shot, perfectly directed. The film overall does have very good directing by Michael Mann, but the screenplay needed more intriguing drama. A film like this needs to be keeping you at the edge of your seat throughout, and this film did not. I did admire the impressive set designs, the flawless costumes, and the gritty cinematography (which I thought was actually very impressive). The cast was also great. Johnny Depp was very impressive, giving one of his best performances to date. Christian Bale was good, but nothing remarkable. Marion Cotillard also shined through. Just like in her other film of the year, Nine, she proves she is one of the best rising talents and proves she is a worthy Oscar winner. Here, she is strong and I felt for her character the most. She does the most with her screen time, and Depp and her really were great together. She was particularly great in the scene where she is held captive to give information on John Dillinger's whereabouts. Overall, I did like the film, I do admire it, but it could have been better."
"GloreMag","4","0","0","7 February 2010"," Care for an explanation Mann?
","Come on! What went wrong? This film was very hyped for the first half of the year and fails miserably to live up to it, honestly, it's awful. I'm going to try very hard not to sound all that one-sided but I will admit that it will be difficult considering that the subject of my review is a rushed, meticulous and inadequate depiction of a criminal mastermind, John Dillinger.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I have admired some of Michael Mann's previous works. I thought that Heat, although long, was hugely entertaining where Mann's character development of two Hollywood starlets at the time, Pacino and De Niro was great. Here in Public Enemies the characterisation was disgracefully poor. <br/><br/>To continue an investigation into Mann's inconsistent portfolio of direction, The Insider was a great film. Not explosive, not a thrill-ride, but a greatly compelling and powerful picture not dissimilar to Heat in the sense that we understand and enjoy the characters. In a nutshell, Ali, Miami Vice and Collateral were OK, not fantastic but not nearly as grossly disappointing as Public Enemies.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp plays John Dillinger, a criminal mastermind who specialises in robbing high-chain banks blah blah blah. He, of course has his group of minions who collectively produced equally underwhelming performances (The only thing that impresses me about Stephen Dorff is that he had a fling with Pamela Anderson). On his trail, sort of speak, is Melvin Purvis, who is played by Christian Bale with a wonderful blend of strange expressions, wooden one-liners and of course, his notoriously annoying on-screen voice. <br/><br/>One scene that stands out for me is the substantially unengaging exchanges between Bale and Depp when Depp is in his cell blabbering on about something along the lines of you wont catch me or i'm going to escape from this cell, you'll see, I can't really remember I was that bored. Where this scene should have been riveting, energetic and smoothly played out by the two actors, the alarming lack of chemistry on-screen relegates the episode to Depp pushing his face in-between the bars whilst Bale looks on with a dopey smirk and chipping in one or two lines. Honestly, it left me in disbelief.<br/><br/>It stated on the Trivia section of the title page that Bale prepared vigorously for his role by meeting with the real Purvis' son and friends. *Claps hands* Job well done Christian!<br/><br/>The film does have its positive attributes, but they are grossly outweighed by the negative ones. I enjoyed the sets, some of the music and the costumes (bear in mind these are usually insignificant aspects of a film) and the performance of Depp was acceptable, memorable in comparison to Bale.<br/><br/>Overall, this film was a colossal waste of talent, money and potential. If you're looking for great Johnny Depp films, look elsewhere, maybe Blow or Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. If you're looking for a great Michael Mann film, consider Manhunter, The Last of the Mohicans, or Heat and if you're interested in a great Christian Bale where his performance is outstanding, there isn't many. Perhaps American Psycho or the Empire of the Sun.<br/><br/>P.s Pay close attention to the poster of the movie. See Johnny Depp's mischievous smile? Yeah, it's telling you that you're a fool if you come to see this film. <br/><br/>4/10. I hate myself for paying to see this."

","Bryan Burrough wrote what is one of the leading books on the war on crime when he wrote ""Public Enemies: America's Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of The FBI, 1933-1934"". His transitions between the different fronts on the war made for a story that moved fluidly from one point to the next. And it told such a colorful story that even non-history buffs would enjoy it. When he wrote the book from which this movie was adapted, there was a reason he titled it ""Public Enemies"", rather than Public Enemy. Burrough's book focuses on the entire crime wave of 1933-1934, thus its subtitle. The big-screen adaptation of such an outstanding book does only a disservice to Burrough's thorough, painstaking research and writing.<br/><br/>In writing his book, Bryan Burrough focused not only on John Dillinger, but on Dillinger, Bonnie and Clyde, Pretty Boy Floyd, and the entire set of outlaws hunted by Melvin Purvis and his band of agents would laid the groundwork for what would eventually become today's FBI. Director Michael Marin, and co-writers Ronan Bennett and Ann Biderman have taken Burrough's extensive research and tossed it out the window, in favor of a single storyline that fails to fully outline the war that led to the creation of the original FBI.<br/><br/>In its defense, making a movie that fully followed Burrough's historical non-fiction would probably take far too long in movie, time. But in taking as many liberties as this work did only hurts the story. What's more, as abruptly as it began, the story fails to establish any real back story on Dillinger. It doesn't tell the story of how Dillenger become the outlaw that Americans actually came to adore, almost like a rock star.<br/><br/>Hollywood has made a habit of adapting books to movies for as long as memory serves. In some instances, Hollywood has somehow managed to successfully make the transition. But sadly, with Public Enemies, this movie has proved that sometimes, movies simply should not be adapted into big screen features. It has proved that this is one story that is far more enjoyable on the written page, than it will ever be on the big screen."

","Incredibly lousy gangster yarn. On a technical level, it's one of the worst releases I've ever seen. The film was shot on digital cameras that look like they were bought at Best Buy. It's murky and downright hideous to watch, dark as Hell with laughable, anachronistic hand-held camera work. The audio has a lot of problems, as well. That all might be tolerable if the movie was otherwise good, but it's far from it. Many critics have written that the film wants to de-mythologize the '30s gangster yarns. This film's idea of de-mythologizing John Dillinger (played by Johnny Depp) is to make him a complete bore. The actual story sets him up as a kind of tragic hero, so in no way does it actually try to ""de-mythologize"". It's all into the myth. The G-men are also de-glamorized, and likewise are completely boring. None of the actors bring much to the proceedings. Depp and Marion Cotillard are extremely boring as the central couple. None of the other gangsters pop out at you. If you gave me a line-up with all the gangster characters in the film, I couldn't tell you who the Hell was playing, say, Baby Face Nelson. It's pretty bad when Christian Bale gives the only halfway decent performance in your film. He brings the same methody crap to this one as he does to every movie, and is as bad as ever. But at least his character has a little bit of life to him, unlike everybody else in the movie. This was an absolute disaster. I'm not a big Mann fan, but he's made a few good to great movies. This is by far the worst he's ever put his name on."

Minor meaning for instance that the famous woman in red was wearing a different color. Does that make it worth the 2 hours you have to spend to get to that moment? No. These tiny new things don't affect the basic story that's been done better almost every single time it's been done before in various formats.<br/><br/>Attempts to make Dillinger into some kind of true love story aren't convincing and slow the story down.<br/><br/>Though many names are dropped of other gangster pals in the film none are explained in a way that will make any sense to someone who isn't a big Gangster buff already. The whole thing feels like a cliffnotes version of a story that then you take the test and find out all the questions on the test aren't in your cliffnotes that you wasted time reading.<br/><br/>There are many but not no exciting shoot outs in this film and in between not much that tells you anything deeper about Purvis or Dillinger other than the failed attempt to make Dillinger out as a one woman man--which by the end it's clear he isn't.<br/><br/>Recreations of some of the scenes at the real locations again may be fun for the buff, but recreation is a good word it all feels passionless and dry. The shooting on HD and the style of the audio even seems dank thin and slip shod. Perhaps an attempt to have some documentary energy to the film. It has none, the HD is murky frequently you can't see into the actors eyes and most of the night and action footage looks like home movie material. Very little music and then rather ponderous music where you don't need it. Director of photography has worked with Mann before but seems to have no sense of how to make HD look good. If you ever wonder what THE GODFATHER would look like shot on HD here it is and it's a contrasty unforgiving look with some green tones and total blackness and blown out video look coming and going. HD, this time, is not up the the job for this high contrasty look.<br/><br/>Depp doesn't make much of an impression, Bale comes off better but he's not even in the film for the long mounts of time that are spent on the non love story aspects. It sort of seems that Purvis story would have been more interesting, or at least more of him to balance out the story.<br/><br/>Not as ugly look visually that Miami Vice had in director Mann's hands but this is a way long shallow slog and frankly pretty dull movie. Really poorly editing and oddly shot; it's a mix of hand held and locked down shots that don't justify either use or cut together well.<br/><br/>Warren Oates starring version remains the best by far."

I know.<br/><br/>Let's start with the good things. Depp was awesome as most of the time, albeit a bit limited in the space he was given as an actor. But it was quite refreshing to see him as something else than a pirate in what felt like a decade. (I liked em but... you know...) So was Bale, whose role was all in all cut a bit short for my taste. We need more Christian Bale movies. Him in the lead... no costume... Machinist anyone?<br/><br/>The sets and costumes felt authentic. And I do get a certain thrill to see cars of the 30's... let alone guns and nightclubs and music (sadly not enough of the latter in this one). Sort of Road to Perdition like.<br/><br/>Well onto the bad which is basically one thing and that cost this movie three stars in my eyes (would've probably been an 8/10 otherwise).<br/><br/>Camera. Excuse the language but the camera sucked for 70 percent of the movie. Now I guess this was an artistic choice, like making it feel more documentary... like. Let me tell you something. That approach works for three kinds of film. Things that didn't happen or probably won't happen (Blair Witch, Cloverfield, Rec, District 9), Action Movies (wichevers just on at the moment) and DOCUMENTARIES!!!<br/><br/>It doesn't work for Hybrids. It especially doesn't work for movies with Stars in it we've all known for quite a while playing out a story we've sort of known for quite a while. I buy a documentary style camera, if: A: I don't quite know where we're headed and B: I shut off my brain at the start of the movie or C: I don't know almost every face on screen.<br/><br/>None of this is true for this movie. The whole shaky-hand camera-over the shoulder-limited to non-existing depth of field - forcibly none color-corrected (but still color-corrected) scenes in this movie just ticked me off. I was in the movie for about thirty minutes, where everything was still stylized Hollywood goodness, and it felt like something like Gone with the wind for a while. You know, like an old movie, like something we all know. Sink into it and enjoy, just go with it. Like something we all love once in a while. Even the first two robberies still were filmed that way, and all was good. Then the story took a turn for the worse for Dillinger an suddenly (and I MEAN SUDDENLY, we're treated to shaking hell described above, almost up to the end) the final two scenes are stylized again, and thats a good thing but only remind me of what might have been an instant classic for me.<br/><br/>Well its not. For about two thirds of the movie I was just thinking: ""Keep that damn camera still for once you bloody bastard or at least put it on a rail!!!"" thus ripping me out of the movie, thus ruining the whole experience, thus minus three stars... and I'm still generous here."

","I was looking forward to seeing this movie since I first heard of it. Usually I won't see a movie just because of their actors, but in this case two of my favorite actors were up against each-other and that in a movie based upon a true story. That couldn't go wrong I figured, this had to be a great movie.<br/><br/>It wasn't.<br/><br/>The opening was OK, even though I rather have movies that start out slow. After that it just went downhill. The movie jumped from scene to scene and I had the constant feeling of having missed something, constantly hoping that things would become clear later, but that didn't happen. It was a simple linear story and it felt like it was told with multiple pages being skipped constantly. The love-story part felt very fake, unnecessary, uninteresting and even though it was probably meant to show who Dillinger was, it failed to do so. They could just as well put up a bullet-point list of his characteristics and it wouldn't be much less interesting. This already made me want to fast forward quite early in the movie.<br/><br/>And about the acting of both Bale and Johnny. It was boring. Somehow I got the feeling they were both bored too and couldn't hide that 100%. Even the scene where they first stood face, which I was looking forward too, was also very disappointing. It was more of a stare-off, while you'd expect them to have to say a lot to each other. I can understand that they couldn't have made much more from a shallow script, but it makes me wonder why they accepted playing this movie in the first place.<br/><br/>About the rest, the shots, the sound. Even though I saw a few comments on those I thought they were good, and made me watch as far as I got. The sound dynamics were annoying though, from whispering soft to incredibly loud and back again, but that seems to be the standard of movies these days.<br/><br/>Anyway, even though I understand it's not at all historically correct, the story might have had an OK ending. I just couldn't watch anymore after being thrown in yet another one of the many long unexciting shoot outs. Wanting something to be good can in many cases give you the idea something is better then it actually is, but in this case it was not enough to even keep me watching it. And a movie has to be very bad for me to turn it off, I usually finish everything.<br/><br/>So my advice is to skip this one, you're not missing out on much."

","Everyone tells you not to compare it with Heat, but it's almost inevitable. Of course Heat is the superior movie and Public Enemies can only lose if compared to it. Apart from the fact, that we have the same director here, we have some similar situations.<br/><br/>Two actors that are considered to be top players in their generation (De Niro & Pacino with Heat and Depp plus Bale here). While Depp (almost) lives up to that comparison, Bale fails to deliver. It might also be the fact, that his role is much smaller than the Pacino counterpart, but he's still less effective. There is one big scene where both of them collide (in the prison), which could be seen as a counterpart to the coffee scene from Heat. A great scene here and there, but while Heat explored Pacino and his motivations more, we get nothing from Bale. What drives him, his passions, his faults/flaws. And Heat had Val Kilmer. Public Enemies has a few great actors, but no one equals the Impact Kilmer had on Heat (even Dorff, in one of his better roles in recent years, can't reach that).<br/><br/>While all this might give you the feeling that the movie isn't really good ... it actually is. It's a pretty good movie indeed. It just can't reach ""Heat"" ... but then again, which movie can? And while I myself wasn't as aware of the real-life person Johnny Depp is portraying, I'm pretty sure Americans know him better and therefor the movie itself works better for them. Mann doesn't have to fill every little aspect of Dillinger, if people already know what happened (more or less). So it wouldn't be a bad thing, re-watching the movie, with the knowledge what went down in ""reality"". :o)"

","Some genres are constantly renewing, because they appeal to pieces and bits of our imagination that never wither, despite the political context or the ideological moment we live in. Such are the cases of the date movies, horror, or mystery. Others come and go, and every come back depends largely, to my view, on what the public demands in the specific moment of the movie. Those are the cases of the western and the gangster film. This is, i think, because both genres always deal with extreme heroic (or anti-hero) characters. Those characters always stand for something, usually selfless, usually en formed by a superior concept of moral, that exceeds the ""law"", and digs into what really matters. Right now we are living through something the media calls crisis, and which, apparently, has to do with mismanagement, corruption, something about those who have some (or a lot of) power using their superior position to take away from the blind people, those who right now struggle to keep the few they have, while the powerful get away with it. This is the story line that common people accept as the summary of what is happening right now. That's why it is highly desirable to make now a film about a man like Dilinger, something who in other times, of deeper depression, became the hero for the unhappy people. Again, today as in those days, people feel unsatisfied, and need guiding lights, not coming from the upper unworthy classes, but from next door. That's when we have such guys portrayed as heroes, and the cops being the bad guys. Twenty years ago, Untouchables presented quite a different view. Cinema reflects life, without being life.<br/><br/>Now, there's more to this film than the mere pertinence of its story. Michael Mann is an interesting director, one who really knows how to create spectacles through which we can look at his worlds like he wanted us to. He builds his films not on the narrative devices, which are always linear and usually predictable. Instead he makes an interesting mix of working characters, and building a mood out of them. In his films the characters do not exist as pieces of the world within. Instead they set the ton of that world. They don't exist in a world, the world exists within them. We, as audience, are wrapped by that world, as if caught by a snowing ball, that started rolling much before we started watching it. Mann uses, for this effect, the careful framing of details, the detachment from the establishing shots, which exist but do not drive the mood. That's why we have car mirror details, reflections, carefully photographed hats. We have that because John Dilinger tells us we live there.<br/><br/>Two powerful scenes to be noticed. One is when Dilinger sneaks into the police department investigating him. It clearly sounds as an inserted piece of invention into a real story line, and so the scene gives us nothing new in terms of narrative development. But it is a great piece of visual/sound adequation. The other scene is the final sequence, starting in the theatre and going to the very end. Dilinger gets in, sided by two prostitutes whom we know squealed on him. They watch a gangster film, starring Clark Gable. From than on we inter cut between scenes of that film, Depp's gazing at it, with a premonitory look, and the police outside the theatre getting ready to get him. All this is en formed by the music. There is a game of Gable's film, projected onto Dilinger's feelings at the moment, and there is the police, leaded by Bale's character, projected into us, viewers, who gaze at Dilinger knowing what will happen, while he looks back at us, announcing that he also guesses what will happen, for the film ""told"" him. This simple game of correspondence, competently hampered by the music fills the tension. Great. The ending, with no music, and the directness with which the policeman reports Dilinger's death to his lover is as contrasting as it is wrecking. This final sequence is precious.<br/><br/>One major complaint, however. Mann shoots HD, and he is really exploring the medium. But because hd captures so much image detail, it is harder to elude the viewer, every editing or camera or actors minor flaw is enhanced to much bigger proportion than it used to be with film or dv. This film is filled with moments which just look poorly edited. I think this is only noticeable if you watch it on the big screen, so the film will probably gain something distributed for home viewing. Anyway, it distracts.<br/><br/>My opinion: 4/5<br/><br/>http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com"

","Depp and Bale as Public Enemies ""But the best rejoinder to Public Enemies is Michael Jackson's Smooth Criminal video, which I watched again after the singer-dancer's inevitable, untimely death. It's a tommy-gun gangster fantasia with a touch of Guys and Dolls, and it's everything Public Enemies isn't: madly inventive, genre-bending, a passionate tribute to the artist as outlaw-loner.""<br/><br/>See nymag.com, daily, movies, 2009, 06, The_incidental_pleasures_of_pu.html<br/><br/>I can not remember so many restless fans at any big budget motion picture as this one. People got up for bathroom breaks, cell phone calls and greasy smelling popcorn.<br/><br/>But that is not the story. The story of Public Enemies is not the smooth and stoic good looks of Johnny Depp and Christian Bale either. The story is writer/director Michael Mann.<br/><br/>Mann has after all, created some enduring pieces of colloid art. He pitted Tom Cruise against Jamie Foxx in Collateral. He gave us Will Smith in Ali. He exposed Big Tobacco in The Insider with Russell Crowe.<br/><br/>But most importantly, Mann brought the heroic epic of great American literary writer, James Fenimore Cooper, to the screen with an incredible performance by Daniel Day Lewis in The Last of the Mohicans.<br/><br/>It is that masterful blend of music, courage, Madeline Stowe's good looks and the sheer beauty of a raw, untouched wilderness - all of which are ripe with the potential for a rich, prosperous future - that Mann attempts to recapture with Public Enemies.<br/><br/>Billie Crudup, who we saw in Almost Famous, gives a performance as a young, tough J. Edgar Hoover, with ever present Clyde Tolson by his side, which should give a serious notch up in his career.<br/><br/>So like Mohicans, this is three grim, determined men striving for their objectives, against all odds, regardless of cost. Unlike Mohicans however, this epic suffers.<br/><br/>Here there is no Stowe or wilderness beauty. Marion Cotillard gave a Oscar winning performance as singer Edith Piaf (2007), but her talent is wasted here as Dillinger's girlfriend. With a few exceptions, she just does not have the lines or the beauty to vault this over the top as another extra-ordinary Mann epic.<br/><br/>Depp? Of course, he is wonderful. Both he and Bale enjoy long close-ups that should make their agents happy. Yet there are little to endear either the Dillinger or FBI man Purvis characters to us. As Dillinger, Depp is no charming Warren Beatty, for example, in Bonnie and Clyde. We don't see his youth or scenes with his mentor.<br/><br/>Same with Bale. Mann uses Bale's narrow jaw to indicate Purvis' resolute determination to catch the bad guys, even if it means using techniques that a modern, enlighten citizenry finds squeamish, possibly immoral. But we never learn anything personal about Purvis. Otherwise, Bale does NOT have a lot of emotion or catchy lines either.<br/><br/>Here the musical score does not uplift the tale. It fills quiet scenes with heroic feeling, only to be punctuated with the incessant pop-pop chatter of Tommy-guns. Not even an appearance and song by smooth jazz great Diana Krall can lift the music of this film.<br/><br/>Lest you think ""the lady doth protest too much,"" this is still a good film. I simply don't think it is worthy of a $10 go-see-it-now on the big screen ticket. Better make it a rental. One where you can go for bathroom breaks, cell phone calls and greasy popcorn without missing much."

","Last night we saw the film PUBLIC ENEMIES with Johnny Depp as Dillinger. Depp played him as an affect-less murderer who is without interest except for his spectacular bank robberies. From 1945 I remember DILLINGER starring Lawrence Tierney which moved a reviewer to say ""-- a flat cipher, his motivations murky --"" Maybe Depp took his cue from the same film. DILLINGER begins in a movie theater where a film about John Dillinger is being shown. At the end of the movie clip, Dillinger's father is brought on stage. He tells the audience he tried to raise John properly and doesn't understand how he went wrong. I am certain that this was the inspiration for Woody Allen's bank-robbing biopic, TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN. In a biographical interview Woody's parents are wearing nose glasses and the father says, ""I tried to beat God into him!"" The documentary then resumes."

","Public Enemies was screened last night (Thursday Feb. 12) in Sherman Oaks, Ca. Going into it I knew what the movie was, who was in it and what the story was more or less about. First, the movie ran about 2hrs 40mins. Probably an hour too long. If anyone is going into this film expecting to see Johnny Depp in another masterful performance, you'll be left empty handed. And when it comes to Christian Bale, who drops tons of weight for ""The Machinist"" then puts on 60 pounds to play Batman right after, and who is as serious an actor as they come, appears for the first time, you're left asking yourself... ""who is this? why is he here? and why do i care about anyone in this movie? To the unfortunate end, you never get these questions answered. <br/><br/>There is not one single stitching of character development with ANYONE. You don't know who anyone is, except Dillinger and Bale's character. The movie is called ""Public Enemies"" but you never get a sense of what that means. You never see the newspaper headlines, you never see the PUBLIC'S perception of him or his gang and the movie botches, at ever turn, the 3 main stories its attempting to tell. (1)The story of the start of the FBI (with Billy Cruddup as J. Edgar Hoover), (2)the end of the days of robbing banks with the beginnings of prohibition and gambling coming in. (3)And the fact that the mob is upset with Dillinger because the newly formed FBI puts into law that anything over state lines is now a Federal crime. This is turn, turns the entire mob against Dillinger. Their enterprises are heavily thrown off track due to this. But you get one scene with Frank Netti that' suppose to explain this??? <br/><br/>Bottom line is this; this movie tried to be something it wasn't. Michael Mann is at fault. When you see the movie, don't complain to the theater about the ""projection"" problems. There aren't any. Its the type camera that Mann has become accustomed to, and it has a VERY cheap, video look to it. And for the love of God, take your Dramamine because the swishy- bouncing, rocky, jerky camera crap will make you wish for the Blair Witch. You are basically dumped in the middle of the story about a bunch of stuff you don't know or aren't familiar with and are expected to just tag along, but all it ends up feeling like is coming in an hour late on an A&E Biography on Dillinger. This is not the Christian Bale or Johnny Depp you know. It's not them at all. They showed up, said some lines and went home. Michael Mann should consider hanging his spurs."
"amexspam","1","3","8","13 July 2009"," I'm not ready for my closeup
","The main flaw of the movie is the unbelievable overuse of extreme closeups. It's as if you are forced to view faces, bushes, walls, guns, horse chests (not heads, mind you)and most of the world from a vantage point of 4 inches distance. In addition, the director frequently swung the camera from point to point - like a bad home movie - inducing vertigo. The second problem is most of the characters of the supporting actors were not developed. There were people I wanted to know better but the director left them two dimensional. But the main reason for my vote of 1 is with the cast assembled and the locations used this could have been an excellent movie. Instead it looks like it was directed by a first year film student."

Somehow Prettyboy Floyd, Babyface Nelson and Frank Nitti get thrown into the ""story,"" casually and for no particular reason. Why they left out Machinegun Kelly, Ma Barker and Bonnie and Clyde is a mystery, and with Frank Nitti in the mix they might as well have given us some Elliot Ness, too. Overblown, Hollywood-style fight scenes? Oh, yeah, everyone and his dog was carrying a sub-machine gun (hmm, in real life I thought it was all Tommy guns with those round cartridge cases during the 30s, but what do I know?), and these were not run-of-the-mill guns, they had ammo and firepower and Dolby noise enough to take out a tank. Bwammo! bwammo! The overkill was next to laughable. A movie with heart - a brutal cop who tried to beat a confession out of the killer's moll is on the point of plugging Dillinger in the back but pales and quivers and looks like he wants to cry when the bad guy turns, looks him in the face, and gives him (shudder) a look. Now that's high drama. Finally, something has to be said about the annoying camera work, shaking and jumping, pointing this way, then that, framing half-faces - and the editing with constant quick-cuts so that for long sections nothing is on the screen for more than 3 seconds. It's one of the worse movies I've seen in a long time."

The script writers gave the story a good balance of action and love interests. The casting was excellent, and I believe Christian Bale will become Hollywoods next mega start.

"Jasonjlewis1","5","3","8","3 July 2009"," Lacks Character development
","Public enemies had a lot of potential. It did a great job at setting the scene for the time period and the acting was very good as well. However, the plot was repetitive and did not do a good job at developing the character's or the motivation behind the characters.<br/><br/>John Dillinger had a lot of good qualities. He was loyal to his friends and loved ones. He wasn't a thief against people. He was against kidnapping or harming the common man. His issue was with the system that put him in jail for 5 years for a $30 theft.<br/><br/>His romantic connection was a bit forced and seemed underdeveloped to warrant the level of dedication and love that he and Billie had for one another.<br/><br/>In addition, the internal turmoil that Melvin Purvis felt for the seemingly unnecessary murders that occurred during his pursuit of John Dillinger bothered him. People were getting tortured, beaten, and murdered for the sake of justice. The people seeking justice became just as bad as the criminals. His struggle with this could have been further developed.<br/><br/>I really wanted more character development. It was just one chase scene, escape scene, or gun fight after another. It got to be redundant and those that I saw the movie with seemed bored.<br/><br/>I'm surprised this movie is so highly rated."
"novayk4","6","3","8","3 July 2009"," Good movie but very boring
","The good points of Public Enemies were the costumes, the soundtrack (gosh yes the soundtrack is amazing and I'll discuss that) and the gunfights. However, the overall impact of this movie left me continuously aching to leave the theater and do something - anything - else with my time.<br/><br/>I didn't like the two key actors. Bale stars in this movie as Bale. Depp stars in this movie (guess...) as Depp. Bale's ""same acting in every movie"" was tiresome and I felt very detached from Depp's character only until the last scenes in the film (the fact that his character, John Dillinger, was constantly referred to as Johnny was a huge disconnect for me during the film as the actor's name is, of course, the same).<br/><br/>Not only could I not empathize with either of these two characters almost entirely, but I felt this way with every actor on screen. Every character seemed to be identified and then pushed aside for the next scene just as I was almost at a point where I could force myself to connect with him/her. The acting was remarkable at its best, but the director had it in mind to intertwine so many different actors with so many overlapping traits that the uniqueness of each character was lost.<br/><br/>Now, this is fascinating: bad acting typically kills any movie, but Public Enemies was fantastic and epic during some of its runtime.<br/><br/>Oh-my-gosh the movie's music was AMAZING. Whatever dullness I was gleaning from the lead char's was throttled by the soundtrack. I'll be downloading all of these songs from iTunes; that's how fantastic it was. The soundtrack alone was able to keep me in my seat during this flick.<br/><br/>Overall, a 6/10. I would rate a movie higher that impressed me so much with gruesome, detailed deaths and such a breathtaking soundtrack, but that's not to say Public Enemies isn't worth seeing. It is, and make sure you get a loud theater, just that I wasn't ready for such a movie."

","I had high expectations for this film, and they were not met.<br/><br/>I will say that the film does a good job of establishing the time period, as well as showcasing some strong performances all around. You can also give the film praise for having a strong visual style, but I found it distracting at times (too much hand-held for a big screen).<br/><br/>What was wrong with this movie? Ultimately it bites off more than it can chew. Even in a 2 hour movie, I felt that none of the plot lines were given much time or emphasis. The romance was pretty quick and felt ""written in"" (although the actress does a great job, and Johnny does too of course, but their chemistry starts off very forced). Bale's character isn't given nearly enough to do, and we never learn more about him than we already knew in the trailer. Even Depp himself seems to be hidden from the audience a surprising amount.<br/><br/>I respect the filmmakers for trying to tell a story without over-reliance on a script, and it shows in the strong physical acting and direction in the movie. However, for a movie that doesn't have any clear character arcs, continuous romance, or lots of action, we simply need more meat in this story. I doubt if the script (as is) couldn't have fit into a 90 minute film.<br/><br/>Bonnie and Clyde is much better, and sadly this film can't escape its show, even with great original performances and a strong visual style."
"DonLogan","9","3","8","1 July 2009"," A return to form for Mann that signals the future for period films
","I have read a number of comments that are critical of Mann and Spinotti's use of HD photography in the film but I believe it is ideal when one considers Mann and his overall 'agenda' as a filmmaker. Watching films such as 'Theif', 'Manhunter' and 'Heat' it is clear Mann is a director who strives for authenticity and for realism and by using video rather than film he can achieve this:<br/><br/>'...the DV made it feel like you were right there in 1933. You could reach out and touch that drop of rain on the black enamel paint of that car. That's what I wanted. I wasn't interested in nostalgia. I wanted the immediacy, you know, 11:17pm on a Tuesday night in 1934.'(interview with Mann, Sunday times) This quote essentially sums up Mann and the film itself. Unlike other depression era films such as 'Road to Perdition' where beautiful film stock adds to a nostalgic and romantic view of the time, Mann's film, with its frankly astonishing cinematography, brings an immediacy and authenticity to the era that I have personally never witnessed. <br/><br/>In typical Mann fashion, exposition is hardly present. Like all of his films, Mann drops the audience immediately into the action almost as the characters have already begun their journeys and time is metaphorically and literally running out. This notion of time and being dropped into action without exposition is typical of Mann. In 'Thief' the film begins with an extreme close-up of Frank (James Caan) breaking into a safe and he is already a professional thief with years of experience. In 'Heat' the films begins as a heist is set in motion with no explanation as to why and who is carrying it out. Essentially, Mann is documenting criminals and as audiences we are being given just a slice of things they have been doing for years. It is in this slice that we witness these characters as time runs out for them.<br/><br/>'Public Enemies' is a bold piece of art from one of America's finest living auteurs. The cinematography, action sequences and music are superb. Depp as Dillinger is wonderful, a memorable performance and the finest I have ever seen him deliver. The only weak aspect of the film is Christian Bale's performance, which is somewhat average. This does not and cannot detract from the one of the great crime films of this decade. The film is a return to form for Mann, certainly his best since 'The Insider' and with its unique juxtoposition of HD video and period piece it signals the future for period films."
"Lazertron","4","4","13","1 July 2009"," Lazy, loud, and underdeveloped
","The first sequence promises that the film will be something new, smart and exciting and thereafter never meets that expectation. This film is wrought with platitudes, lazy writing, confusing action, and worst of all no real insight into the cat and mouse play and mentality of Melvin Pervis and John Dillinger. Furthermore, the most interesting aspects of the story, the camaraderie of the criminals and their careful planning before each heist, is almost entirely ignored. The film settles to force a trite love story down our throats while all of the characters are conveyed solely through what they say about themselves. Basically, the film is lacking what is called ""conversation"" which is poorly replaced by monologues and proclamations.<br/><br/>Another significant disappointment is that this film introduces few new things to the mythology of John Dillinger. There was a film in the 80s I believe called ""Dillinger"" which was an hour shorter and conveyed all of the relevant events of ""Public Enemies"". The only real difference between the two is that in the former a fabricated love story is absent and replaced by convincing acting and character depth. There is no sense in ""Public Enemies"" that John Dillinger is confronting the disorder of the Depression, no sense that he represents a departure from the status quo of the times, and no sense that any of it really matters in a meaningful way. The FBI exist because of John Dillinger, Hoover achieved the power he did because of John Dillinger, the nation found him to be a hero, none of which had anything to do with a girlfriend who gets slapped around for harboring fugitives and lying to investigators about a thief and a murderer.<br/><br/>One final point, John Dillinger kills not a single person in this movie for reasons I can only assume relate to inspiring false-pity. While this film could have given depth and insight into an almost folk-hero, it resigns itself to forced-love, loud and confusing action, and, as Michael Mann always provides, poor cutting and silly camera usage.<br/><br/>Skip and wait for DVD"

"overcranked","10","3","9","3 July 2009"," Public Enemies
","Public Enemies tells us the story about America's first war on crime and the pursuit of John Dillinger by the fledgling FBI. The film picks up four years into the Great Depression, which was a time when many people were out of work and standing in soup kitchen lines. The film begins with what appears to be John Dillinger, played by Johnny Depp, being taken to prison, but we soon find out that it is really a part of his plan to bust out some fellow criminals. Meanwhile, Melvin Purvis, played by Christian Bale, successfully hunts down Pretty Boy Floyd, and due to this success is tapped by J. Edgar Hoover to lead a task force to capture Dillinger. This is the story that the film centers on as we see these two men play a game of cat and mouse.<br/><br/>Throughout the film Michael Mann utilizes a lot of hand held camera work, which puts us right into the scene with Dillinger and Purvis. Also the look of how some of the gun battles with lighting and camera work gives the film almost the same look as a war documentary. It is almost like you are there with Dillinger dodging bullets and racing to avoid the police. The lighting is very dark and moody for many of the scenes which gives these scenes a feel similar to old gangster movies from the 1930's and 40's. In fact near the end of the film there is a Clark Gable film playing in the movie theater that Dillinger has gone to for a night out. I think that many of these old gangster movies were on the mind of Michael Mann as he made this film.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp delivers a wonderful performance as the lovable outlaw and pulls you in with his charisma very quickly. He plays Dillinger just as I would assume him to have been in real life. Dillinger became somewhat of a folk hero in America since his exploits in the 30's stealing money from banks and not the banks customers. While these stories may or may not be true Dillinger is portrayed in the film like a kind of rock star to the common man. Christian Bale also delivers a great performance that is very different from what many people dubbed as an ""arrogant"" character in his other summer blockbuster. Bale comes across as a determined man that will stop at nothing, within the law, to catch Dillinger. Bale is very effective when he gets to play in roles where he has to be motivated and stern, not just told ""look as serious as you can about everything."" Public Enemies is my favorite movie so far this summer and it is captivating. The scenes are shot beautifully. The lighting fits the mood quite well, and on top of that the sound track is great. When Dillinger robs a bank we get this great Blues track and fits the swagger of the men walking into the bank. If you've sat through some of the bad movies this summer, like Transformers 2, then Public Enemies might be just what you need to wash that bad taste right out of your mouth.

","Contrary to the opinion of the previous commentator, this film was an execrable mess. It was completely ahistorical, to begin with. In the year 1934, when three of the biggest strikes ever in the United States were called and the country was in ferment due to the Great Depression, this context didn't receive so much as a mention. Nor was it explained why the ordinary people were cheering John Dillinger as a hero. It was because he worked against the state and returned money that he took from the banks to the ordinary people who were being screwed out of their money, much as we all are today.<br/><br/>Depp, Christian Bale and the other actors should be ashamed of having participated in such a farcical rendering of the Great Depression and of the famous criminals that emerged from the financial devastation of the country.<br/><br/>The FBI and Hoover were rightly portrayed as the enforcers of capitalism and the police state, but this seems only to have been inserted into the film for violence value. There was no genuine analysis by the filmmaker of the true meaning of this American gestapo and the fact that it not only went after bank robbers and gangsters, but also union men, strikers, and ordinary citizens who dared to protest against government policy during the Depression.<br/><br/>What a shallow film. And the lengthy scenes of violence did not advance the story one bit. They seemed to be there to pad out the excessive length of this travesty.<br/><br/>What a piece of crap. I'm glad that I got a free ticket or I'd be even more disgusted. There are no filmmakers today creating anything meaningful about the history of this country or how it relates to the crisis we are living in today.

Dillinger in pursued in Public Enemies by appointed agent Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale), who is determined to bring him to justice, despite the inadequacy of the rest of his squad. Throughout the film Dillinger also meets and romances a young woman named Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard), who tells him that she has had nothing exciting happen in her life. She is taken in by Dillinger's lifestyle and his commanding control over her.<br/><br/>Adapted from the book Public Enemies: America's Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI, 1933-34 Michael Mann's new film suffers from many of the same problems that plagued his screen version of Miami Vice. Public Enemies promises several talented actors but wastes much of their experience and potential with a flat script that opts for action rather than a thorough examination of Dillinger's psychology. We learn very little about Dillinger throughout the film and much of the dialogue in the script is uninteresting and doesn't provide Johnny Depp with the chance to exude the same amount of arrogance that the film commands. For one of the most charismatic actors in Hollywood he is strangely flat in this role, with a largely monotone voice and an effort to only look cool. What persuaded Dillinger to rob banks and to continue to do so amidst the increasing danger, is something the film refuses to answer. Christian Bale tries hard with little dialogue and his robotic nature fits more firmly with his military-like precision and determination to bring down Dillinger. Marion Cotillard is solid as Dillinger's lover Billie Frechette, but like many of the characters in the film we never understand her commitment to the gangster. There is perhaps only a single line of dialogue that hints at her attraction, when she tells him that she has never done anything exciting in her life. For a relationship that forms such a significant portion of the film, it feels overly simplistic. David Wenham, Giovanni Ribisi and Channing Tatum also star, but have very minor roles. The significance of such flat characters is that it weakens the emotional impact of the film. Once Dillinger reaches his fate outside a movie theatre, we do not know how to feel for someone we knew so little about.<br/><br/>Had the film been told from Purvis' perspective, it would of at least had more motivation. As it stands there doesn't seem to be any real point to the narrative and the film quickly becomes like a series of anecdotes about Dillingers crimes. The narrative resides almost monotonously between the bank robberies, the FBI chasing Dillinger or his escape. Given that the film was shot on digital most of the action scenes - despite the hand-held camera work - are actually quite intense, with some exquisite, booming sound effects. Yet none of these sequences reach the heights of Mann's best moments, like the club scene from Collateral. It is also disappointing that in Mann's direction he rarely captures the irony of Dillinger celebrity. We never understand why people in the street wave to him as he is taken away in a police car. Or when Dillinger walks into a police station and examines the photographs of himself on the wall, we can only ask why he did this. What should have been a great scene exuding arrogance and a rich sense of irony is left flat because of a nearly empty room and a lack of danger.<br/><br/>Despite a lengthy running time of nearly two and a half hours, there are also some scenes that feel strangely compressed, suggesting that along with some of the brief roles of the actors, that the film may have been significantly cut. Many of the bank robbery scenes are quite short and there is little exposition at the beginning of the film. A moment where J Edgar Hoover is demanding help arrest the gangsters is sown together with his immediate presentation of Melvin Purvis to the public. Similarly, Pretty Boy Floyd only has a single moment on screen before he is shot dead at the beginning of the film.<br/><br/>Public Enemies with both its cast and director demanded a more sophisticated screenplay. The film has opted for the easiest route, turning Dillinger's life into a action film, refusing to answer the hard, perhaps almost impossible questions, of what fuelled his ego. Mann seems more interested in style rather than biographical elements or questions of celebrity, making this a far simpler and less impressive film than it should have been."

","He's the master of the shootout. Wherever there's banks to be robbed, gun chambers to be emptied, or bodies to be riddled with bullets, Michael Mann is your go-to guy. A director of slick, stylish thrillers since the early 1980s, his pictures have often been tainted by their own knowing trendiness – and 'Public Enemies (2009)' is certainly no exception – but, damn, can the man engineer a shootout! Mann's craft reached its creative peak with 'Heat (1995),' memorably pitting Robert De Niro against Al Pacino, but his work in the new decade has not been without interest. 'Collateral (2004)' was a thrilling role-reversal for leading man Tom Cruise, and the turgid, aimless 'Miami Vice (2006)' was at least partly redeemed by an excellent climactic shootout. Why tell the story of John Dillinger? Perhaps Mann was simply entranced by the idea of a half-dozen Tommy Guns blazing at once. His approach to the material isn't exactly graceful, but, in his own way, he's done it some justice.<br/><br/>For about a year during the Great Depression, John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) was Public Enemy #1. A multiple murderer and bank-robber, he escaped from jail on two occasions, and – along with such outlaws as Bonnie & Clyde and ""Baby Face"" Nelson – dominated national headlines with his audacious and charismatic escapades. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, still in its infancy under director J. Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup), struggled repeatedly to keep up with Dillinger, who had acquired something of a ""Robin Hood"" image in the public eye. It fell to cool, methodical F.B.I. agent Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) to apprehend the fugitive dead or alive, and on July 22, 1934, he finally succeeded. Depp's cocky portrayal of Dillinger is charming and entertaining, but the film expends little energy in exploring the man himself, content with vague allusions to Dillinger's loyalty towards colleagues and his affections for a pretty French girl (Marion Cotillard). At times, Mann seems very tempted to glorify his central criminal, painting the F.B.I. agents (especially Hoover) as incompetent and conceited.<br/><br/>And now for my most predictable complaint. Despite the film's strengths, 'Public Enemies' is marred by Mann's distinctive brand of stylisation – most specifically, his decision to film in high-definition digital video. While I am not averse in principle to the use of digital video in a period-piece (Fincher's 'Zodiac (2007)' used the technology quite well), I feel that a director's use of equipment should not distract from the story he is trying to tell. Used wisely, digital technology is able to capture images every bit as good as traditional 35mm film, but Mann couples this digital video with a shaky hand-held camera. The result is not unlike an episode of ""The Bill."" This stylisation – which worked so well in 'Collateral' because of its contemporary urban setting – is so unconventionally anachronistic that it wrenches the viewer from the reality of the film: in a moment, I was suddenly aware of the director and his cameraman crouching in the corner of the room, filming an actor playing a role. In his pursuit of gritty reality, Mann paradoxically exposes his hand to the audience."
"EijnarAmadeus","7","2","5","27 July 2009"," A character-film who is up for it.
","At the end of Michael Mann's new film 'Public Enemies' we see bankrobber John Dillinger, played by Johnny Depp, smiling wryly at a cinema screen where Clark Gable is acting out as a gangster whose about to be executed in the electrocution chair, as he's passing by a fellow criminal's cell he says ""Die like you live; all of a sudden"". It's a rock & roll cliché; live fast - die young. But Dillinger sees no tomorrow, when checking up on the lovely Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard) he rapidly fires his biography and tastes of life in the matter of seconds, as he says; what more do you need to know? And what more does Dillinger need to know than life - right here, right now. He's turned into a alternative 1920s Robin Hood when the Great Depression is lying heavy on US society; when robbing a bank for hundreds of thousands and raising those Tommy-Guns high, he quickly but importantly tells a bystander whose emptied his pockets to put his dough back in, it's not his money they're after. John Dillinger, who's enormously interesting biography is sadly little apparent, is here portrayed as a romantic, runaway boy with looks to kill and loyalty that goes beyond, he sticks it to the boss and lets everyone see his principles of life and how it should be. And with Johnny Depp performing, it's all pretty great I have to say. The character is complex, his emotions are dark and hidden, and Depp turns all his calibers down to a minimum to achieve this undercurrent wildness, restlessness and sorrow in his eyes - at his opposite there's FBI-agent Melvin Purvis, a strictly conducting lawman who goes face-to-face with anybody who questions his authority; played out by Christian Bale, also he turns out a mellow performance, mute and straight-faced. Audiences may recall Mann's 1995-classic 'Heat' when these two opposites of the law go chasing one another, but where Pacino and De Niro understood each other, Depp and Bale are the complete opposites. Still, also Depp's Dillinger feels the heat around the corner when authorities catch up with his girl, Billie. And it's here Mann triggers heavy, the romance between Dillinger and Billie are important matters, and why not? Dillinger's striding for life and all its goods, and what's better than the love for another a human being? The director has been flirting up these alleys before (Heat, Miami Vice) but has never achieved the same tenderness that he does here, and although it's not better than anything he's done before, it's different, and thereby interesting. Now, although the film's PR and cast & crew has been tightly remarking its historical accuracy, everybody who's read a few articles about Mr. Dillinger and the times surrounding him knows that there's several flaws throughout the film - for my taste that's not very important, what's important is that Mann has created another crime drama with timeless themes. Shot with an absolute brilliance by Dante Spinotti, amount of work put into the hand-held camera-work, editing, sound, production design, costume and locations are stunning - you won't hear a machine gun fire this loudly or see the night so bleakly light anywhere this year, in other words; the craftsmen-work are top-notch and are already strong contenders for the technical categories in the upcoming Oscars 2009. Powerfully realistic, but still with a feverishly undertone of living life like a dream, this is Michael Mann's best film since 1999's 'The Insider'."
"ewoud_51","8","2","5","27 July 2009"," Great direction, great acting
","I think that Public Enemies is a really good movie. It might not be the instant-classic a lot of people (including me) hoped for, but from the first minute, I knew that Public Enemies is a lot better than most films in cinema. It's not hard to tell why: first, there's Mann's excellent direction and mise-en-scene and second, there's the level of acting, which is really high. Especially Johnny Depp: and so, I'm glad to see him in a film like this and not in a mediocre blockbuster (such as Pirates of the Caribbean). Johnny Depp is really incredible as the famous bank robber, John Dillinger: this is a movie character that you won't forget. Although Depp draws most attention, I must not forget Marion Cotillard: the French, Oscar-winning actress shows that she easily can cope with roles in major American productions. I have to add that I was a bit disappointed in the character of Melvin Purvis. This is not the fault of Christian Bale - his character is simply too flat (all we know is that Purvis wants to catch Dillinger - and you don't even have to see the movie to find that out). In my opinion, that's a shame,'cause an actor like Bale deserves better roles than this one - think not (only) about the Batman-movies, but (espacially) about The Machinist and The Prestige. I do hope to see him in such movies in the future. But let's not forget the great story, the great Dillinger-character and of course the excellent direction of Michael Mann. Mann uses the blackbird-motive in a great way and, although some scenes (in the forest, for example) are too quick, he shows his experience throughout the whole movie, especially in the epic and just fantastic ending scene. This is a really good movie."
"ClaytonDavis","9","2","5","17 July 2009"," Johnny and Mann's best in years...
","Michael Mann's Public Enemies is definitely one of the best films of the year and probably the strongest of his career. Taking into account Heat (savagely overrated), The Insider (his only Oscar nominated work and definitely worth it), and Collateral (which fails for me on multiple levels), when you place Enemies next them, one must wonder what critics and audiences didn't get about the film. <br/><br/>It was by far Johnny Depp finest dramatic turn of his career. This would be a role I would love to see Johnny at the podium receiving a gold man for. Marion Cotillard is much of the anchor of the picture as she is a beautiful presence, igniting the screen with every word, tear, and smile. Billy Crudup who takes on his role with much ease and makes it seem effortless (which is his downfall for this awards season I presume) takes on his minimal screen time and takes charge. The worst part of the film, unfortunately is Christian Bale who's flat acting and seemingly useless role (which might be the screenplay's fault) does nothing more for the picture than a 30's automobile.<br/><br/>I expect big chances in editing, cinematography, acting nods for Depp and Cotillard, and a possible Best Picture nod for Public Enemies. Oscar take note, this is something of a revolutionary picture.<br/><br/>***1/2/****"
"kimberlymhn","5","2","5","16 July 2009"," Does not do justice to the story of Dillinger - inferior to the Milius version.
","The biggest failing of this movie is how it fails to really convey the desperate situation America was in during the depression. The economic state of the nation was one of the main reasons Dillinger turned to crime and also why he was admired by many as a modern day Jesse James who stole only from the hated banks. Of course this view is romantic and erroneous considering the deaths he was responsible for but to many Americans, he was a hero. Michael Mann fails to show how big a celebrity Dillinger was at the time, to the extent that when he was being held at Crown Point jail after his capture, the female Sheriff Lilian Holley and other officials posed with him for photographs as if he was a film star! Holley is played by the wonderful Lilli Taylor who like everyone except for Depp gets way too little screen time or character development. We are not shown her reaction to Dillinger's escape or what happened later - she was unfairly blamed and fired from her post with many claiming the escape would not have happened if a man was in charge at Crown Point. We also are not shown what happened to Dillinger's accomplice Herbert Youngblood, who in reality died in a shootout with police a few weeks later.<br/><br/>Another part of the real story that Mann does not exploit was the friction between J. Edgar Hoover and Melvin Purvis. Both men used the media extensively to draw attention to their activities, but when Hoover felt Purvis was getting too much attention, he worked to undermine him to the extent that Purvis left the FBI sin 1935. Christian Bale flits in and out of the movie and as mentioned we learn next to nothing about him. The other members of the Dillinger gang are largely anonymous hoods in Public Enemies unlike in the 1973 movie 'Dillinger' where the likes of Harry Dean Stanton, Richard Dreyfuss & Steve Kanaly give excellent performances. The 1973 John Milius version of the Dillinger story, huge liberties are taken with the facts, such as having Pretty Boy Floyd & Youngblood in the Dillinger gang but it aces 'Public Enemies' in every way. Warren Oates was perfect as Dillinger while Ben Johnson's cigar chomping Purvis burns with quiet rage while in pursuit. Milius's take on the story is as lively and energetic as 'Public Enemies' is slow and lifeless."

","PUBLIC ENEMIES (2009) *** Johnny Depp, Christian Bale, Marion Cotillard, Billy Crudup, Stephen Dorff, Channing Tatum, Rory Cochrane, Stephen Lang, James Russo, Giovanni Ribisi, John Ortiz, Peter Gerety, Leelee Sobieski, Shawn Hatosy, Matt Craven, Diana Krall. Filmmaker Michael Mann's ambitious but at times stalled take on America's gangsters during the Great Depression rightly focusing on charismatic fugitive outlaw John Derringer (Depp, showing the right amount of swagger and ice-cool control – his in-movie-theater brief self-satisfied smirk is worth the price of admission) and his gang trailblazing a crime-spree throughout the country much to the chagrin of up-and-coming Fed J.Edgar Hoover (a clipped-deliver, take-charge Crudup) whose prime choice, the relatively green but determined Melvin Purvis (pallid yet engaging Bale) is truly put to task. Mann manages the gunfights with supreme skill and the chase sequences with enough energy to keep things rolling merrily along until it gets bogged down with its own momentum of trying to be a great film (it's not, but a close cigar folks). Cotillard is incandescent, as Dillinger's flame that ignites his will to live despite the overwhelming odds."
"rlnutt","3","2","5","5 July 2009"," Public Enemies... eh
","Simply put, well acted, but poor editing. Fight scenes were WAY too long and they seemed to just go on and on and on and on... you get it now.<br/><br/>The film editor could have cut out most of the abusive scene with Dillinger's girlfriend getting slapped around by the fat Fed. Also, they could have completely left out the sequence where she lies to the fat Fed to make him chase his tail... completely unnecessary for the story.<br/><br/>The whole character of Giovanni Ribisi was unneeded and having them there took away from the movie and made it about 30 mins too long.<br/><br/>They set up the final killing scene in what seemed to be actual time... come on guys, you had superb talent and a decent script. This could have been an Oscar contender if edited correctly. As it is, it was the most boring shoot 'em up I've seen in many, many years! Wait for the DVD!"
"deltajvliet","8","2","5","2 July 2009"," Borderline Great
","It's right on the cusp of greatness; a couple moments lean towards merely good, others topple over into the realm of near perfection. The killing of Dillinger outside the theater and the second jail break, especially the intense ""c'mon, turn green!"" stop light scene exemplified the latter. The score and choice in soundtrack weren't bad, either. <br/><br/>Michael Mann was certainly ambitious in this project. Sets, costumes, even dialect seemed to be meticulously planned and executed. The scope is vast. The performances are solid. Everything is there for it to be an excellent movie, but what keeps much of the film from greatness is a combination of one dimensional characters, an attempt by the film to be some sort of overly long, somewhat slow masterpiece a la Once Upon a Time in America, and the occasionally drab photography. <br/><br/>What drove Dillinger? Who was he? What made him tick? These questions aren't satisfactorily answered in the film. Depp does a commendable job, but we only ever see his one-note exterior. Purvis is similarly one dimensional, seemingly just there to be the yin to Dillinger's yang. I feel Mann did a better job of fleshing out cop and crook in his magnum opus Heat; the characters here feel just somehow more generic. Props to Crudup, however—he is a great J. Edgar Hoover. <br/><br/>The movie clocks in at 2 hours and 20 minutes. I've got no problem with a longer running time, in fact it's more for your money, but the movie just could have been a little more punchy. Think The Departed. As it is, I just feel the movie drags sometimes. <br/><br/>Mann appears to be one of the biggest directors leading the charge to Digital. I've never had anything against it, in fact I thought it was used to excellent effect in both Collateral and Miami Vice. And while there are some good visuals in Public Enemies, there are other moments of washed out, drab photography. One of the biggest distractions for me was the motion blur, often indicative of HD during pans. Some of the hand-held camera-work seemed out of place, as well. And I've heard others criticize DV's use here simply because it's a period piece, and the two don't seem to belong in the same room together. Whatever it was, Mann might have done well to revert back to film for this one. <br/><br/>I don't mean to go on about the negative. In fact, it's a credit to the movie that it's limited to these three things. I might be biased because it was partially shot in my home state and I was fortunate enough to work on set for a day, but I think when all is said and done it's a genuinely good film. Maybe even great."

","After seeing an excellent trailer for this movie, I was excited to see what appeared to be a good 30's era crime action movie. I was wrong. After such great works as The Aviator, Miami Vice, and the Kingdom, Mann proceeded to mix all of these styles together and make a mildly disappointing movie. The camera work was smooth one second and jerky the next. The movie was about 45 minutes too long, and Mann could not decide whether or not to make the movie historically perfect or entertaining. This movie was good, it just dragged and at times seemed eclectic. The best I've heard it described was ""The Assassination of Jesse James meets Miami Vice."" At first I thought Depp was a good cast as Dillinger, but as the movie rolled on, his accent got worse and worse. Bale continued to you variations of his Batman, much to my dismay. The most important miss was the ""action"" scenes. They were not exciting, poorly shot, and anti-climatic.<br/><br/>I gave it a 6/10 because of the slow moving plot, and mediocre acting dragged down a great story and loads of potential."
"PyroSikTh","8","5","20","1 July 2009"," Heat, but better.
","I think there is no doubt in most peoples minds that Heat was a fantastic film. No means perfect, but pretty darn close. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say Public Enemies is Heat, but better.<br/><br/>Acting was good on all parts from everyone. Matching, if not surpassing that of Heat. The realism was accurate to the last detail. I don't know what it was like being alive in 1933, but I sure believed I was there. At times, I even thought this was a documentary. The camera work was fantastic and definitely unique. I've heard many bash the use of digital, but it really isn't that noticeable after a short while. The angles, shots and cinematography was awe-inspiring. Character development was right on the money, although I'd like to have had more on Melvin Purvis. The amount of character development was a major thing that puts it above Heat in my opinion. I often found Heat concentrated more than necessarily on developing the characters, even in the late stages. A good half hour could've been cut from Heat by reducing the development of each character, without it affecting to the final product much. The music and general sound also put it above your average film. It was sparse on music, but when there was music, it was used extremely well in all the right places and situations. The effects of guns and footsteps, and especially atmospheres in a room full of people was spot on. I'm guessing Mann opted to record the sound of what was going on as it was being filmed and including as much of it as possible, which is usually frowned upon it seems, but it really creates a mood and atmosphere, really makes you feel like you're there.<br/><br/>However, although the relatively amateur techniques work, it does at times feel like an amateur movie. For this reason alone, I give it 9/10 rather than 10/10."

","Considering the tremendous star power of the cast and the fire power of the story I was expecting a much more gripping film. In the end it just petered down to another ordinary flick. Nothing to take away from the stars themselves mind you, Depp was suave, Bale was his usual seriousness and Cotillard I thought was fantastic. However, on the whole the movie fizzles out. Rat-a-tat of guns and the a bank robbery here and a chase there. Nothing stands out. There was a lot of potential in the movie but somehow it was lost in the presentation aspect. Minimal dialog and lack of character development add to the woes. Marion Cotillard is the saving grace of the film."

","Take two great actors(Bale and Depp), a great story(John Dillinger's life), a good director(Mann) and a Oscar-winning actress(Cotillard) and what do you get...A Complete Mess.<br/><br/>Public Enemies centers around the life story of John Dillinger; including his rise to prominence, his love affair with Frechette, his death and his pursuit by Melvin Purvis.<br/><br/>Very and I mean VERY little works in this movie.<br/><br/>Jonny Depp and Christian Bale give two of worst performances in their careers. Bale has been dull in other roles but this is ridiculous, and usually you can expect Depp to add something to a role and give it a life all it's own, there is none of that here. He sleepwalks through the film like he can't wait for it to be over, a sentiment I shared.<br/><br/>The love story between Depp and Cotillard is completely forced and there is hardly any explanation for why they love each other. They just meet go eat at a restaurant and then they're together.<br/><br/>All the bank robbery scenes were out of nowhere and just seemed to be in there because they felt like there had to be some in the movie. As if Michael Mann just said ""alright throw in a bank robbery here.""<br/><br/>Possibly worst of all to me was the portrayal of the police department. I'm always annoyed when Hollywood acts as if the police are the bad guys and criminals are just trying to make an honest living. The police came off as being incompetent and mean, while dillinger was this untouchable mega-criminal. In one scene Dillinger strolled right through the department that was looking for him in a room filled with his pictures and asked the cops, who were all inexplicably sitting by a radio listening to a game, what the score was.

Johnny Depp is one dimensional. The movie is devoid of humor. There are no likable characters. There are too many bank robberies that are identical to one another. The movie also has a visual problem. There are continual extreme close-ups of the characters where all you can think of is ""Why am I being asked to pass judgment on the quality of the actor's skin?"" A bad movie is one where all you can think of is when is this going to end. Because everyone knows how this is going to end, I found myself delighted when Dillinger decides to go to the Biograph Theater to take in a ""picture show,"" where he is gunned down by G-men.

"mxgzx01","6","2","6","4 July 2009"," Everyone seems to be rating the film based upon hype instead of analysis.
","The acting is what saved this film. Johnny Depp was great, which is what prevented it from seeming as if it was shot by a mediocre film student.<br/><br/>I was surprised to find other reviews in which they stated the audio sounded muffled. I too noticed this but attributed it to the cinema. However, perhaps not. The mixing for the dialogue was bad. I couldn't understand some words being said and at times I literally tried my best to lip read. It was distracting. However, perhaps it was some cinemas or it may not be the same upon a DVD/bluray release. Thus, I won't factor the audio issues into this review.<br/><br/>Now, I spoke of distractions. The biggest distraction was the cinematography. I'm certainly not the first to complain about the digital cameras used; however, my complaint is slightly different. I typically liked how the shots looked. The lighting of the night scenes was great. The problem was the excessive use of hand cameras. Obviously this was an attempt at ""putting you in the action"" and heightening the action. There were numerous shots over people's shoulders, in an attempt to make it seem as if you were standing behind them. But this attempt failed.<br/><br/>The major sign of excessive use of hand cameras came during the shootout at the bar with Nelson. This is where the cinematography broke down. There was constant camera jitter, bizarre shots from the ground looking up at the characters, and excessive closeups. Frankly, it was reminiscent of Rec and The Blair Witch Project, which is a bad thing when considering the type of movie we were meant to see. In both of those films, the viewer was aware that the character was using a portable camera. With that understood, it allows the viewer to be transported into the film--into the action. With Public Enemies; however, there is no real justifiable purpose. It's unnecessary to simulate a first person view to draw a person into a movie. Instead, this should be done with brilliant acting, a great script, and beautiful cinematography. The best filmmakers have been doing this for as long as the medium has existed.<br/><br/>Ironically, the opposite of the intent was achieved. Instead of being within the action, you are made aware of the camera. What was meant to draw you in, instead dissociates you from the film. At times I felt as if Public Enemies was more of a video game than a film.<br/><br/>Ignoring the cinematography and the sound issues (yes, that's challenging), the film would likely have received an 8. I would have preferred a greater back story/additional character development; however, I understand the way it is. It is in-keeping with the way Dillinger describes his past to Billie--a short statement of facts without painting any sort of picture.<br/><br/>As I stated in the beginning, the acting was good; however, it lacked the sort of indistinguishable spark found in past Johnny Depp films. It is certainly not his greatest; however, overall it was enjoyable. I left the cinema with the feeling of, that was great, that was fun! What the heck were they thinking with that awful cinematography? That was fun! So on that note, it's worth seeing, even to learn how NOT to shoot a movie. Take notes film students. Take notes."

","When I first saw the commercial to this movie I was more than anticipated to go watch it on the opening night; however, there was a bit of disappointment filled in me after it was over. To me, the movie just didn't quite sit right. I'd kind of compare it to trying a new item on the menu at a restaurant. A bit like seeing the item on a menu that sounds and possibly looks delicious but after you're done eating it, you say to yourself ""It was okay but I know I will never be ordering that ever again."" It wasn't so much that the acting was bad, more along the lines of the angle of the shots and the camera movement to say the least; also a few scenes in there that make you question the storyline and how it really should have unfolded."

","I was kind of disappointed of this movie because I expected more of it. There were many flaws and some historical inaccuracies about this movie, and in the end it seems like the message of the movie is to make this Johnny Deep character gangster a hero, who never was because he was a criminal gangster. Anyway, the plot was good and the visual effects too, with the costume as well, but the real issue here is not the message of the movie, since every filmmaker has the right to make the movie as he wants, but the lack of something there, like the characters don't show much emotion when they have to. Johnny Depp definitely shouldn't have a gangster character paper because it was just not good. He didn't seem like a gangster. And his wife, Marion Cotillard, definitely she doesn't look Indian, come on! And the policeman beating up the gangster's lover... did that really happen? There seems to be some inaccuracies there. I hope I'm wrong but for me it looked like that. In the end, just an okay movie."

"Maziun","2","1","2","20 September 2014"," Another disappointing movie from Michael Mann
","After ""Miami vice"" this is another bad movie that Michael Mann made lately. I was expecting something like a mix between ""Heat"" and ""The Untouchables"" . I always had a soft spot for movies set in the 30's . Add to that a cast involving Johnny Depp , Christian Bale and Marion Cottilard and no wonder that my expectations were high.<br/><br/>Ugh. Where should I start ? First of all the movie looks UGLY. I HATED the use of digital camera. It was already bad in ""Miami vice"" and ""Collateral"". Here it completely destroys any mood . The atmosphere of the 30's is gone , despite nice costumes and art direction. I couldn't forget that I was watching the movie because of that f***ing digital camera. Not to mention that the action scenes look terribly fake and lack any excitement.<br/><br/>The screenplay is rather bad. The movie never gives us any good reason to care for Depp. His character is rather unlikable from the beginning to the end. The whole Robin Hood theme is never explored. Bale is stuck with a role that is completely dull . He doesn't have too much screen time and Mann doesn't really seem to care about him . We only get a post epilogue information about Pelvis that I couldn't care less about. I also found it hard to care for Cottilard's character for some reason. The story itself is never particularly interesting or surprising. There is one stupid scene with the police station.<br/><br/>Depp and Cottilard are OK , despite the fact that their characters are VERY underwritten . Bale gives a bad performance , but in his defense his character is so boring and uninteresting that I felt sorry for him. I've heard that Bale was in conflict with Mann during making the movie and maybe his limited screen time and ad performance is a result of that ? The opening jail scene and the ending scene are quite nice and the best thing in the movie. Everything else is just filler. The result is one boring movie that can't be compared to ""Heat"" or ""The Untouchables"". It is however slightly better than ""Miami vice"". I give it 2/10."

","Depp might be one terrific actor. But not all of his movies would turn out great because of that. This is a clear example of that.<br/><br/>I didn't even watched until the end. It was terribly boring. There weren't action sequences. The acting was bad, even Depp was lousy. I mean, he only acted as the bad guy/smart villain/hero and that was pretty awful. Bale was OK I supposed. He isn't a terrific actor but he certainly shows effort. But I blame all that on the awful script. Not to mention that was poorly directed.<br/><br/>The plot was really bad, and it developed in such a slow-paced form that bored me to tears. It was so supposed to be about bank robberies, but I only saw two of them, and they were both uninteresting. The dialog was bad as well. I didn't feel the connection between characters, so right past the middle I turned the DVD player off and began doing something else.<br/><br/>The other aspect that I disagree with is the glorifying of Dillinger. He was depicted almost as a hero, and he was nothing but a criminal. That was a bad call if you ask me.<br/><br/>I don't know if the ending fixed the terrible first hour and a half. But if the ending is the only good thing, I prefer to watch something else."
"colinrgeorge","4","1","2","6 April 2010"," ""Public Enemies""
","Dillinger biopic ""Public Enemies"" is an oddly disconnecting experience, and at two and a half hours, takes ample time to say remarkably little about the man, the Dust Bowl, or action film-making. Director Michael Mann's latest is a wet pile, a structureless mass with no discernible character arc and next to no story progression. The sequences are cyclical and redundant, and the performances are too average to elevate the material beyond its inherent mediocrity.<br/><br/>Dillinger (Johnny Depp), the depression era Robin Hood, is written and performed like a thousand better period gangsters, recalling Warren Beatty's Clyde in Arthur Penn's ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" but without the interesting sexual apathy. Depp's Dillinger is one-dimensionally smug, and while effectively charismatic, never convincingly human. Opposite him is antagonist Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale), the agent tasked with neutralizing Dillinger in the FBI's first war on crime. Bale has again been cast in a hyper masculine role, but does nothing with it. His performance isn't ""Terminator Salvation"" bad, but Purvis doesn't pop. The bottom line is the script never feels as smart as the people it's portraying.<br/><br/>The whole film is saturated with a sense of arbitrariness that makes even the shootouts dull, despite their volume screaming to a pitch that would make Peckinpah duck and cover. The sound is consistently inconsistent, in probably the single most embarrassingly unfinished mix I've heard in a major theatrical release. You can hear the chops in the sound bites, the level of ambiance rising and falling with the dialogue, and changing altogether between angles in the same scene.<br/><br/>One of the more controversial aspects of the film's technical design was Mann's decision to shoot using HD video in favor of film. One can infer the intention was to imbibe the period piece with a modern feel, like Tak Fujimoto's work on the HBO mini-series, ""John Adams,"" but the results here are nowhere near as successful. The whites are blown out and the darks are muddy and bland, and when combined with the shaky-cam action aesthetic popularized by the ""Bourne Identity"" and its sequels, ""Public Enemies"" becomes an ugly, disorienting mess.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Mann's film is tedious, indulgent, and dull. There doesn't seem to be any singular thematic intention behind the piece, and it ends up being the sort of movie where you check your watch on a bi-hourly basis. It's a definite disappointment from the director who's previously proved adept in the action genre, and any given sequence from his 1995 film ""Heat"" is more memorable than ""Public Enemies"" at its best.<br/><br/>Individual moments and certain scenes work well, but they never work together, and the film is an eternal thematic plateau. At the end of the day, there's very little to say about a film that says so little itself."

","Recap: Already notable bank robber John Dillinger manages to free himself and his friends from a State Prison in a spectacular escape. Following this Dillinger and his gang go on a robbing spree, gaining notoriety as he goes. At the same time he is trying to build a relationship with Billie Frechette a young woman living in Chicago. But every steps he takes is closely followed by Melvin Purvis, the star agent of the emerging FBI. Dillinger and the law enforcement often end up in gun fights, and Dillinger's list of allies becomes shorter all the time. In the end he is forced to team up with violent but equally famous robber Baby Face Nelson, the first step to his demise.<br/><br/>Comments: A very good and high paced action thriller, based on the life of ""public enemy number one"" John Dillinger. The story is not so accurate historically, but the reason for these misrepresentations are mostly to make a more entertaining story, which succeeds.<br/><br/>Michael Mann is directing, which is a good thing, since Mann is talented of how to shoot and present gun fights on film. This was something he did in Heat fifteen years ago, and there are a few similarities between the gun fights in Heat and Public Enemies. The main thing is that they are plausible, with and effort made into detail.<br/><br/>The movie does not have much suspense though, as I was familiar with at least the main events in the life and death of Dillinger, and the movie is true enough not to alter that in a major way. Hence no surprises. But it doesn't really need to surprise, the pace and action does more than fill that void. In fact it makes an easier movie to enjoy, it is entertaining just to sit back and watch.<br/><br/>7/10"
"tsheridan94","5","1","2","9 February 2010"," Another great movie from a year of great movies
","2009 was a good year. At least, it was in the cinema. With the exception of a select few, such as the second Transformers, Surrogates, and G-Force, there weren't really any bad ones. And there were some greats: The Informant!, The Road, Up, The Hurt Locker, and of course Avatar. Another name to be added to this list is Public Enemies, from director Michael Mann. Of course, I wasn't surprised. Johnny Depp does tend to pick great movies, although I don't plan on seeing Alice in Wonderland later this year. <br/><br/>The part I enjoyed most was the way Michael Mann built up suspense, and there was plenty of that, when the ending was already a given. That's the problem with movies rooted in fact: the ending is a foregone conclusion. Some movies can overcome this, though, as Public Enemies did, and to an even greater extent, Titanic. (Although I'm a huge James Cameron fan, so maybe it's just me.)<br/><br/>The other great thing was the cinematography. During the daytime, it looked almost fake, a little too period to seem real. It looked just like a Hollywood set, even in the real historical sites. At night, however, everything changes. The film comes alive. The nighttime scenes are where the energy is. Michael Mann's no fool, He knows this and takes full advantage of it, pounding relentlessly through wet streets, or outside a certain Wisconsin hotel.<br/><br/>This is the greatest scene in the movie, no question. The build-up of that tension steadily rises, the threat growing larger and larger. It's obvious something is about to happen, it's just a question of when and how. This is one of the better formatted movie scenes of the year, and would get the entire movie at least five stars all by itself.<br/><br/>2009 may also be considered the year Stephen Lang became famous, and for good reason. He's a phenomenal actor. Hollywood has finally rewarded his performance by giving him major roles in The Men Who Stare at Goats and Avatar. His performance in Public Enemies, while not a major role, still commands attention. Stephen Lang has a very pronounced stage presence. He uses it to great effect.<br/><br/>Michael Mann is very fit for this genre. Public Enemies dispels any doubt of that. And while not the best movie in 2009, (that's a very hard title to claim) is still very respectable and worthy of a watch, if not several."
"erikpsmith","4","1","2","3 January 2010"," Book Was Brilliant, Movie a Dud
","I'm probably a little different than most of the people who saw this movie in that I read the book upon which it was based. You really have to read it in order to understand the opportunity that Michael Mann squandered.<br/><br/>Bryan Burrough's ""Public Enemies"" was a brilliant book -- the first time I've really seen anyone tie together the full story of the ""crime wave"" of 1932-34, and the massive national manhunt for the ""public enemies"" that created the modern FBI. Judging by the notes in the back, it seems there might have been one other author who attempted the same task back in the sixties (and wound up inspiring the film ""Bonnie and Clyde"") but Burrough had the benefit of internal FBI files. Comparing them against the newspaper accounts of the time, and weaving in the recollections of the few survivors (notably Alvin Karpis), Burrough seemed to put together the full story for the first time.<br/><br/>It is dramatically different than the story that is generally known. Let's just say that J. Edgar Hoover and his G-men were waaaay out of their depth at first -- but over the course of about a year and a half they learned from their mistakes and established a somewhat competent national police force that could track fugitives across state lines, and respond quickly and fairly effectively when suspects were sighted.<br/><br/>It's a dramatic story of bank robberies, kidnappings, gunfights, car chases and police corruption, involving a cast of characters we know mainly by legend today -- Dillinger, Bonnie and Clyde, the Karpis-Barker Gang, Pretty Boy Floyd, Machine Gun Kelly, Baby Face Nelson, and a supporting cast of hundreds.<br/><br/>The author apparently got started on this work as a miniseries for HBO, and then sorta lost his way or something -- the Internet is a little unclear on this -- and then he finally decided to write a book instead. We're all the better for it. Read the book. It's terrific.<br/><br/>And then somehow it landed in the hands of Michael Mann, who had to figure out how to turn the sprawling story into a two-hour movie. How did he do it? He didn't bother.<br/><br/>The movie is a travesty of the real story, every bit as distorted and inaccurate as all the other movies and books that Burrough set out to challenge. We see it in the opening minutes, when Pretty Boy Floyd is gunned down, and then we see Dillinger happily roaming the countryside with his tommygun. Floyd was gunned down months after Dillinger.<br/><br/>And if you know that fact, you know that much of what follows has been made up. Fact is, the movie has only a nodding resemblance to the truth of that Midwestern crime wave. It makes Melvin Purvis the hero, while the book makes him out to be incompetent. It restages the ""Little Bohemia"" siege in a way that fails to convey the far more interesting story of what really happened. Dillinger has his brains blown out at the Biograph but somehow manages to offer some poignant dying words. So on and so forth.<br/><br/>Now, I understand that a filmmaker has the ""right"" to take a little license with his source material. I understand that he can't tell an epic story in two hours, and he probably has to dispense with some of it. He also has to find a hero somewhere in it all. In an enormous story like this one, he has to find its spine, twist and reshape it and make it cinematic. All those points I grant.<br/><br/>I'll also admit that Mann is a stylish filmmaker, and all his flamboyance is in evidence here.<br/><br/>But my gosh -- there was a terrific story here, and neither Mann nor his screenwriters managed to see it. If there had to be a ""hero,"" it might have been Hoover himself, whose frank, blunt and somewhat self-serving words (from his internal memos) might have offered a subversive commentary on the whole affair. There's more to it than that, but trust me, the story is dramatic.<br/><br/>Instead, what we got in this movie was yet another rehash of the Dillinger story, every bit as distorted and inaccurate and just plain wrong as every other Dillinger movie. Really, if you're going to tackle a story that's been done before, you ought to do something new. There just wasn't much point. Mann had the opportunity to break new ground and tell a story that has never been done before. He blew it.<br/><br/>Let's hope that someday someone makes that HBO miniseries."

"pfgpowell-1","5","1","2","2 January 2010"," Two and a half cheers - at least it's got Depp in it
","Oh dear, I have just read three reviews by professional critics who have probably forgotten more about film-making than I shall ever know - including the by now not only venerated by venerable Roger Ebert - and I disagree with them. So what does that say about my judgment. Not a lot really, I am bound to admit. Ebert especially admires Michael Mann's art, his attention to detail, his obsessions with getting the little things right, and it has to be said that Public Enemies doesn't show you Hollywood's notion of the Depression, it seems to show you the Depression. So why do I find myself only able to give the film two cheers, despite the attendance of Johnny Depp, who can act the pants of most of the competition? All I can say is that I found it rather an old-fashioned film despite the hand-held camera-work and the special effects. To me, though obviously not to Ebert and the others, it never really settled anywhere, yet seemed at times, especially the 'death scene' to be shot through with a somewhat spurious significance. Potentially interesting aspects of Dillinger's life were touched up but never examined. In a way it reminded me of Scorsese's Aviator about Howard Hughes: both amble along from beginning to end, but - well, why exactly were they made (apart, of course, to get the punters paying top dollar and keeping the moneymen happy?) In Public Enemies we have an obviously corruptible FBI evolving into the force it became under an obviously corruptible Hoover, we have the Mob casting Dillinger adrift because he is 'bad for business', we have his status as a 'folk hero' and a latter-day Robin Hood, yet these are more or less touched upon in passing. None is investigated, though doing so might have given the film rather more depth. I got rather confused by the gang members and who they were, but perhaps that is just my fault. Then there is the man himself: depicted as something of a fatalist, it would be interesting to know what drove Dillinger. And if we can't have the truth, well why not make something up - it's done all the time and is known as art. The central love affair between the man and his moll is also, to put it bluntly, rather uninteresting and I, for one, was not in the slightest moved by Billie Frechette's anguish. I should add that I was rather underwhelmed by Heat and the emphasis on having the two stars acting together (a follow-up intended to cash in on having De Niro and Al Pacino act together again was, I understand, something of a damp squib). So there you have it: you can take the pros' word for it and regard this as a great film. Or you can listen to what I say and take such claims with a pinch of salt. But go and see it anyway, if only for yet another great Depp performance."

","On paper, ""Public Enemies"" looks like a promising venture. Fans of Michael Mann's ""Heat"" know that he can spin an engaging crime yarn and with Johnny Depp & Christian Bale in major roles it seems like a can't miss. Unfortunately, this exploration of John Dillinger's life in crime comes up short.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp can't be faulted here as he capably carries the film. The film also features good work from the other stars (Christian Bale & Marion Cotillard) along with solid support from the rest of the large cast, including Billy Crudup, among others.<br/><br/>Where the film falters is in the script. The story is somewhat overlong and meandering and I also find that it treats Dillinger too favourably while not really capturing what made him tick. It's certainly less compelling than, say, Arthur Penn's romanticization of Bonnie & Clyde.<br/><br/>Michael Mann's direction is well done, though, and the film is quite nice to look at. Musically, the film doesn't really stand out but that's not a major concern.<br/><br/>In the end, ""Public Enemies"" is a decent gangster flick that falls short of expectations. Depp's performance and Mann's direction make the film worth watching but they only offer a taste of what could have been."
"mjswaney","4","1","2","21 December 2009"," Letdown
","With such strong a strong cast in the main characters, Depp and Bale, I had my expectations set high right from the beginning. I found myself siding with the villains as the movie progressed, specifically with Dillinger, constantly hoping that he would prevail over Purvis. Depp was very good and he successfully managed to portray Dillinger as a ""Robin Hood"" type figure; however, we never see the good nor the bad prevailing in the end.<br/><br/>The plot was a continual cliff-hangar that came to no real conclusion. At the end of the movie, I found myself in awe of how I had just spent the past 2 hours watching a movie that had built up such a storyline and let it come crashing down like a house of cards, only to have no real ending. The ending reminded me of The Departed, similar in a way that it leaves the audience with no real sense of closure, with more questions than answers. It's as if the directors became tired with the storyline and decided to conclude all of a sudden in the easiest way possible. I constantly found myself checking to see when the movie would end, believing that there would be a great hook that would take me by surprise. <br/><br/>For those of you who do not wish to receive an spoilers do not read further. I make the allusion to The Departed because at the conclusion, I felt as if the easiest way to end the movie was for everyone to die--quite similar to this movie. Throughout the movie I began to grow a bit of sympathy for Dillinger as the rest of his crew and loved ones die or fade away, hoping that he would manage to prevail simply for that reason. I couldn't find any purpose in the storyline as a result of all the deaths because I felt left with a single moral, don't rob banks, and no sense of enjoyment. <br/><br/>All in all I wouldn't recommend the movie for those hoping for any sort of twist or turn. The plot is entertaining but pointless in the end. I apologize if the comment seems scattered, it's my first user comment and I felt it was necessary to write because of how agitated I am for having watched a movie with such potential only to end so loosely and easily."
"thinker1691","8","1","2","14 December 2009"," "" When You can't use the very best, you must in desperation, use what you got ""
","There are a small group of great directors and Michael Mann is among the very best. When he decided to make a movie of the exploits of the 1930's era gangster, I believed he would be the right one to do it. Assembling what seems to be the finest cast available, I like so many others, thought, you can't go wrong with them. The Movie is called "" Public Enemies "" and is based on the early history of the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the F.B.I. and the fading glory of America's most notorious gangsters. At the top of the F.B.I. list however was Public Enemy number One, Mr. John Dillinger (Johnny Depp). Other notables like Baby Face nelson (Stephen Graham) and Pretty Boy Floyd (Channing Tatum) were also hunted by the fledgling Federal Bureau. The film centers much on the turmoil between Lack Luster J. Edgar Hoover who had more skeletons than most and Special agent Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) who outshone his boss. It also highlights Dillinger and Billy Frechette (Marion Cotillard) and their costly relationship. Although it the last years of the famous gangster's life, the movie stick pretty close to the facts, including his betrayal at the bio-graph theater. The film does contain sufficient drama and gunfighting actions to keep an audience interested, but there is something missing when one gets a superb cast and is kept waiting. Maybe it's was left in the history books? ****"

","Johnny Depp and Christian Bale star in a film that could've and should've been the best movie of the year. Besides Wolverine, Public enemies was the movie I wanted to see the most this Summer. What movie lover didn't? It sounded great. We have Johnny Depp, one of the greatest actors out there playing John Dillenger. Shooting people and robbing banks. We have Chirstian Bale from my favorite movie The Dark knight playing Melvin Purvis, one of the cops of many trying to hunt Dillenger down. We all know it smelled like a masterpiece. We thought it would be a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Then America saw it. Unfortunately, the air went out of that balloon. Critics and America liked it, but we knew there was nothing Oscar here. That is a shame too. I think it deserves some Oscar buzz. I did like it. It just wasn't what I expected it to be.<br/><br/>Depp indeed does do a great job as John Dillenger. In the 30's, him and his men robbed banks all around the place. So during the time of the great depression, he robbed banks and the feds, one including Melvin Purvis(Played by Christian Bale). Dillenger soon falls in love with a woman named Billie(played greatly by Oscar winner Marion Cotillard). AS Dillenger and his men age, their robberies and their schemes get a little weak. That is something that I liked about this movie.<br/><br/>Public enemies is no doubt a good movie. But people who are expecting great will be a little disappointed. I was a little disappointed. I expected it to be a little more badass than it was. There is a lot to admire about this movie. Depp and Cotillard's performances are great. The action is great. The story alone is great. The cast is great. I just think that Bale's character doesn't really have that much to do here. I think Bale forces the accent a little. <br/><br/>I also think that this movie is a little bit slow. Public enemies is going to be remembered for Johnny Depp and Marion Cotillard because of their great performances. Michael Mann's Public enemies isn't as good as you'd think, but I think it does deserve some Oscar buzz, and you should see it.<br/><br/>Public enemies:***1/2 out of ****"
"brownah18","8","1","2","6 December 2009"," Lets take a trip back to a criminal named John Dillinger back in the 1930's!
","1933, it is the fourth year of the great depression and for John Dillinger (Johnny Depp), Alvin Karpis (Giovanni Ribisi), and Baby Face Nelson (Stephen Graham) it is the golden age of bank robbery. Agent Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) is assigned to track down and capture Dillinger. Purvis also is the Special Agent in charge of the Chicago field office. A declaration on the United States first war on crime is declared to capture every dangerous criminal throughout the U.S. starting with Dillinger. J. Edgar Hoover played by Billy Crudup is helping directs this movement of putting a stop to criminals.<br/><br/>Two great actors in my book go head to head in this cat get mouse thriller. In a way, this movie reminds me of ""Catch Me if You Can"", in which a kid Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) starts to make fraud checks making up fake identities and being chased by Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks). One trying to out-whit the other and not be caught doing what he does best which in that case was getting money from fake checks and getting away with it. Love is a powerful thing and when it comes into affect for someone you start to put away your defenses really and become more peaceful rather than dangerous. This movie is a great adaptation of a true story off John Dillinger's life in the 1930's. This movie has a good plot too and should keep you intrigued from start to finish."
"aschein81","4","1","2","3 October 2009"," Underdeveloped and slow...feels like a Terrence Malick film
","I must say that I am quite surprised that this film has an average score of 7.5 out of 10. Apparently today's movie going audience has fairly low standards on what they expect to see in a film with this kind of star power and budget. Given the acting talent and directing talent behind this film, one would think that they could have spent more money on a coherent script with a focused beginning, middle, and end. Let us not forget that the most important part of any film is the quality of its story (i.e. the script). Yes, having great actors, directors, and special effects can help, but without a good story they simply won't be able to do much.<br/><br/>My main problem with this film is simply that it does not have a coherent story for the audience to follow. It is supposedly based on the true story of Dillinger's life, yet normally in these types of biopics/docudramas there are dates at the bottom of the screen every 10 minutes or so to not only let the audience know that the event truly happened, but also give us a timeline of the events so we can feel things progressing towards a 3rd act. In many ways this film is lacking a 1st act; it simply starts with Dillinger escaping from a prison and then we see him robbing banks for most of the film. This film would have benefited immensely from having the first 15 minutes or so focus on his youth and early years, allowing us to see why he chose this line of profession and therefore allowing us to sympathize with him. Instead, we never really sympathize/care about either Dillinger or Purvis (Bale's boring, one-dimensional nemesis) because we know nothing about them.<br/><br/>This film also never really feels like it is going anywhere in its 2nd or 3rd acts. There is no rising action or any suspense leading up to any kind of 3rd act showdown. Compare this with the way the story in American Gangster is told, a much better cops and gangsters film. We see the private lives and motivations of both Crowe and Washington in the beginning, then as the film goes on we can see how they are eventually going to meet up late in the film, and when they finally do the last 20 minutes or so of the movie is simply exhilarating. The middle section of this film just has no plot. Dillinger's girlfriend disappears from the film for about an hour, then ends up playing a large role at the end? WTF? I started noticing just how incoherent the story was during the 10 minute long shootout scene at that cabin up in Wisconsin. While I watched the film I started to notice just how long that action scene was going on for, and it sure appeared that Mann was just trying to shower us with gunfire so we might forget that the movie had no story. It worked for about 10 minutes, as that scene is quite entertaining, but the other 2 hours of the film simply don't add up.<br/><br/>I know that Michael Mann is a talented filmmaker, and I know that he is too smart to make a boring movie intentionally. That being said, this movie's slow pace and lack of story made it feel like a Terrence Malick film...the New World comes to mind! Lots of cool, crisp visuals, the characters are always acting in the present moment, but no suspense or interest in plot whatsoever! I think Mann was aiming to make it like a Terrence Malick film...more of a poetic, artsy feel. If you love those kinds of films then you'll like this, but I think the New World is a good sleeping pill!"
"B-Rizza","2","1","2","14 September 2009"," This film is an absolute shocker
","This film had so much potential but was a complete waste of time. The cinematography made the film look like it had been made by 1st year film students, and bad ones at that. The audio mix was so unbalanced you miss certain dialogue points, even in the cinema. The lighting was all over the place, over and under exposed. From what I could tell, it seemed as though the film was shot digitally, which leaves you with a handy-cam feel, not something you want in a 1930's flick. The story line is virtually non-existent, as well as the character development. There are so many director flaws, from mini Cheddars (new packaging) for sale in the shops, to characters not speaking into telephone mouth pieces. I can't say anything good about the directing of this film, at all.<br/><br/>With that aside, Johnny Depp gave a good acting performance. Christian Bale puts on the worst acted accent you will probably ever hear, but his acting apart from that was not bad.<br/><br/>10 people walked out of the cinema while I was watching this film, which needs to tell you I'm not just crazy, and I watched it to the end, unfortunately.<br/><br/>If I had it my way, Michael Mann would be giving me two and a half hours of my life back for the disaster."

","Public Enemies, which deals with the real-life story of John Dillinger, the most notorious bank robber, isn't as great as people are making it out to be. But it's worth a rental.<br/><br/>The acting was pretty good. Johnny Depp, the main star of this movie, carries the whole thing. I wasn't really paying any attention to Christian Bale. But Marion Cotillard, who plays John's love interest did a pretty good job.<br/><br/>At first I thought this movie was really good, but afterwards I thought about it and I thought that there were bits and pieces that were exciting, but most of the time, I was bored and staring out into open space. The action is cool, but there is only about 10 minutes of it in the entire film. There wasn't much of a story, and I'm not familiar with the story of John Dillinger. The setting was cool, and the way everyone was acting all 30's was pretty accurate.<br/><br/>Overall, if you are a die hard fan of Johnny Depp, you're gonna love this. I am a big fan of his and I enjoyed his performance. If you are a Michael Mann fan, you will also love this. But if gangster movies aren't your cup of tea, then skip this one. I would recommend that you watch this on DVD or TV, because it wasn't anything you need to see in theaters.<br/><br/>Rating: 5/10"
"Dr_Coulardeau","6","1","2","6 September 2009"," Could have done a lot better -- for an adult audience
","The film is perfectly disappointing because the editing is often too slow, after the opening scene of the prison escape. And that very fast makes the film slightly humdrum and even boring. Then John Dillinger is pathetically dramatic because he is at least ten years late on his time. He plays Bonnie and Clyde four years after the Depression. He is all the more pathetic because he is even given some advice by some of his old friends and crime-colleagues who are following their time, history. Now prohibition is finished and alcohol is out, organized crime wants to turn crime into a business, as clean as clean can be. So no drugs, no prostitution, but the exploitation of gambling which is always a high activity in a difficult period, especially since the poorer among us generally gamble to believe or prove that they are not born losers. John Dillinger remains a loner who wants to play crime as an adventure, maybe even a romantic adventure and he runs into history, the new police methods and he is fast abandoned by everyone and those who remain with him are decimated in no time by the police. Clerk Gable is a lot more convincing in the film John Dillinger sees at the end before being killed at point blank. Pathetic I said. But Mann missed another train. He alludes to the political situation by naming Roosevelt once, hinting at the communist menace once and quoting Mussolini once as a model of the modern fight against crime. He could have done a lot more and better by entering the social and political context of the time and behind John Dillinger. He sure got his gloves off, but not to dig some kind of unknown truth, just to give a rather flat picture of that criminal. In our societies, when a rather long crisis develops, a marginal fringe of people would get into such criminal adventures to over-compensate their frustrations in life. Pathetic I said, and pathetic it is.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 12 CrÃ©teil, CEGID"
"Polaris_DiB","6","1","2","21 August 2009"," Technique in trade
","People, especially critics, were all up in a tizzy because Michael Mann shot this movie in HDV and it's a period piece. This doesn't actually matter unless you're the type of person who believes that the world pre-1960 existed in tones of brown, like most period pieces are shot. That said, the hand-held cinematography was uneven and the editing was pretty poor, indeed, but that has nothing to do with the camera itself, which captured images that looked great.<br/><br/>As for the story itself, it was pretty good, though like many stories of its type it ended up actually suffering for the love side-plot, which helped stretch the movie to roughly about 20 minutes over its justifiable playlength. Still, the acting was superb and there are some pretty surreal action scenes, plus great prison escape sequences. It was also nice seeing Johnny Depp not play someone quite so flamboyant, kinda a throwback to his Donnie Brasco character but with variance. Most important, the sub-plot involving the technological, ethical, and social changes occurring in America at the time and their interrelatedness was very interesting.<br/><br/>For Michael Mann lovers, this is probably another win. For everyone else, I can't say I wasn't entertained. The violence might get to some people but neither side (Dillinger's crew and the FBI) are romanticized better or worse than the other. Like in Heat, you kinda want both sides to win.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"
"webmaster-3017","6","1","2","4 August 2009"," HK Neo Reviews: Public Enemies
","Tagline: Depp is exceptional, but nothing really happens <br/><br/>Review by Neo: I am disappointed. Basically, the line before this summed up the whole movie. Public Enemies is one of my most anticipated films of the year. The trailer looked tight, slick, interesting, historic and bombastic. However, as the credit rolls, the film is clocked far too long (almost 3 hours of running time) and the very fact that nothing really happens. True, some may argue that all real life 1930s bank robber –John Dillinger (played sublimely by Johnny Depp) did was robbing banks. I pose the question, does it really require three valuable hours of screen time to visualise the tale? Sure, director Michael Mann is going for the being the real for the realist stake, but by the end of the film, the audience does not feel for a single thing for Depp and with three hours of prior investment, it is bounded to disappoint, even the most patient of human species.<br/><br/>The movie goes like this: Johnny Depp is a serial bank robber who roams around the country of USA, for one mission – to rob banks and escape from jails. In the process he met a beautiful Marion Cotillard and hook up with her. Basically the film is about the life of a bank robber who constantly outsmarts his police counterparts with an underlying passion for robbing banks and the girl in red.<br/><br/>As mentioned before, the film fails by not only being too simple, but rather far too realistic for its own good. If the film clocked just 2 hours, then perhaps it is still plausible, but the fact that it requires 3 hours of longevous running time to express something so simple, it feels more like a waste of time. That's not to say that director Michael Mann did a bad job, as the direction can easily be described as simple and effective and some scenes especially the numerous bank robberies and chasing scenes are crucially well-staged. However, the film just fails to connect and after investing 3 hours, one would really expect a lot more.<br/><br/>After all these cons, I guess you are probably wandering if this movie is really worthy of a review. I must admit that I was rather impressed by the performance of Johnny Depp. Not only does he resemble the real-life bank robber, John Dillinger, he is probably the only reason why I was able to stay awake for the duration. Depp easily outshines fellow co-star, Christian Bale (as the head copper chasing after Depp and his gang). It is not an understatement to claim that Depp have menacing charisma and irresistible screen presence. The manner and the way he picked up Marion Cotilard were cheesy yet extremely effective and memorable. I still recall, the moment Marion claims: ""I don't even know you"" and Depp smartly replies: ""I like fast cars, whiskey and you, what more do you need to know?"" Now that's a rare moment of cinematic magic and perfect comic timing. I do still strongly believe that it takes a character and the calibre of Depp, to pull a line like that so seamlessly. The only flaw here is really the manner and the way the film ended, with the audience lacking in any sort of emotional attachment to Depp's character. However, to me personally, I do not believe it is right to push the blame to Depp and rather attribute the blame towards director Mann instead. A wondrous and catchy display from the dependable Depp and the chemistry between Depp and Marion is just realistic and naturalistic enough to be believable.<br/><br/>Christian Bale is a brilliant actor with a crappy voice, but here, he is simply overshadowed, out-classed by the inflatable Depp. As the police counterpart, Bale has the determination and desperation of the required part, but just somehow fails to shine. It is a good performance by all means, but just nothing stunning or memorable. Marion Cotilard is a classic beaut of the French Cinema and her display here is both captivating and perhaps the most humane of the pack. Cotilard was last seen in Hollywood starring alongside Russell Crowe in A Good Year, portrays a character with some degree of emotional depth. The scene in the interrogation room is both brave and confronting. Not to forget, Depp and Cotilard are a fine couple and the fact that both are each other needs, made them all the more convincing.<br/><br/>All in all, Public Enemies is by no means a total failure, with some fine acting turns from Depp and Cotilard and adequate support from Bale. The film fails to hit its mark by simply being too realistic for the audience to become involved in any of the proceedings. Director Michael Mann, usually have an excellent track record and films like Collateral, Aviator and Heat speaks for itself. Here, Mann has lost that humane touch, by resembling too much to the real-life story. True, Dillinger at its very centre of its core is only a guy who strive and thrills himself by robbing banks and bedding women, but this is a cinematic experience, not exactly a semi-documentary. The result is leaving the audience exhausted and frustrated, by the time the credits begin to hover. In fact, I was left quite empty, disappointed and the feeling of ""nothing really happened"", therefore given the three hours duration; it is probably not too self fish for demanding a little more  (Neo 2009) <br/><br/>I rate it 6/10<br/><br/><ul><li>www.thehkneo.com</li></ul>"

The movie is perfectly set in the 1930's with an excellent costume design from that age. The cast is awesome. Johnny Depp is the perfect John Dillinger, a role that fits him very well, his performance was great, Christian Bale as Melvin Purvis is almost perfect and Marion Cotillard although her role wasn't that big, she made very important for the movie.

"Jonny_Numb","5","1","2","19 July 2009"," Soulless Disinterest
","All the elements are in place for a can't-miss masterpiece, to the point where the generic title (""Public Enemies""? seriously?) seems to be misdirecting us away from the inherent awesomeness that just has to be contained within. The cast? A central trio of bankable faces (Johnny Depp, Christian Bale, and Oscar-winner Marion Cotillard) rounded out by a sprawling cast of notable character actors (Stephen Lang, Giovanni Ribisi, and Stephen Dorff, to name a few). The director? Michael Mann, who has made a name for himself as a meticulous craftsman of cinematic worlds of cops and robbers. Add a period setting pulled from factual events, and the formula for critical praise and box-office success would seem minted. But like a bank robbery gone awry, ""Public Enemies"" never quite connects: while certain sequences are nothing short of brilliant (two separate jailbreaks come to mind), the characters themselves never transcend one-dimensional types, which, for a film that runs 140 minutes, is simply inexcusable. In his most one-note performance since the 1995 bill-payer ""Nick of Time,"" Depp slaps on a generic Southern accent and a sharp smirk as John Dillinger, whose fearless criminal audacity is ultimately buried under the weight of Mann's frantic technique. Bale suffers the same fate as Melvin Purvis, a committed G-Man who comes across as a gloss on his ""3:10 to Yuma"" character, albeit with all the character's complexities stripped away. And Cotillard is little more than pretty window-dressing in Mann's typically masculine world. At first, there is some intrigue to the director's technique: obviously using digital video to film a period piece set in 1933, and using claustrophobic close-ups to pinion the viewer within the action, Mann wants us to be accomplices to his anti-heroes. Unfortunately, for as good as Dante Spinotti's cinematography is, Mann's relentless shifting, sweeping, and shaking becomes such a nuisance that it begins to actively erode any entertainment value ""Public Enemies"" may have; factor in the fluorescent-bulb quality of DV (and its ugly grain in darker scenes), and you have a film of beautiful scenes and images that is a literal pain to watch. But therein lies the paradox: if we feel nothing for these characters, then even the most beautiful imagery would go nowhere toward redeeming ""Public Enemies"" as a whole."
"acidjazz-2","6","1","2","11 July 2009"," Most Potential, but Biggest Disappointment of 2009
","To sum this movie up, it should have been about a bank robber that leads a group of thugs around the nation robbing banks. Unfortunately, we are instead mistreated to a half baked love story that never fully develops. It is hard to believe that the lovers are as connected as the movie wants to portray because they are never together for more than 5 minutes. The characters don't feel real, and unfortunately it's a stretch to say that you will form a connection with them, Dillinger being the exception.<br/><br/>This movie tries to focus on too many things and never really finds a groove. On the positive side, the gun fights are spectacular and worth the price of admission, just don't expect to be wowed by the story. As a huge fan of the genre and the time period, I'm very disappointed that a movie with a huge budget, and perfect cast failed to produce an unforgettable tale about the some of the most interesting subject matter in American history."
"dkiel","5","1","2","10 July 2009"," Poorly executed, ""flat"" direction of otherwise great actors - a lot of gripe
","I cannot understand the Michael Mannns choice in shooting Public Enemies in close up Dogma 95 style, with hand-held cameras, ultra closeups throughout the film. If you shoot a film like that, you gotta give room for your characters to develop their on screen persona.<br/><br/>Through Michael Mann's direction both Johnny Depp (Dilinger) and Christian Bale (FBI agent Melvin Purvis), delivers cardboard flat uninteresting characters, utilizing both, otherwise great actors imho, very very poorly.<br/><br/>When doing a film about such a iconic era, as the thirties, it clashes with the up close and personal style in the film. There's no chance to look at the scenery, the sets, backgrounds etc. Of course you get a very personal look of the film, but then it could just as well have been set in contemporary times. Its a shame, because it looked like they really did put a lot of effort into portraying the roaring thirties, certainly the cars look great :)<br/><br/>Other than that, the audio editing Really sucked. Audio dropouts several times (that I noticed), varying levels throughout, attuning volume abruptly to accommodate speaking etc.<br/><br/>Also I feel the editing was somewhat botched. As other posts noticed, there's a great cast of actors (Giovanni Ribisi, Stephen Lang, Stephen Dorff and others) who you almost don't see in the film. To top it all off, I don't think the action scenes were very well edited, a lot of the fluidity were lost in shoddy editing.<br/><br/>I still think it wasn't a total waste of time going to the local cinema and watch it. Time specific pieces like that, with a healthy mix of Jazz, violence, broads and Tommy Guns always sparks something in me. But this wont get anywhere above a 5 star rating from me."
"jaredmobarak","6","1","2","10 July 2009"," Bye-bye blackbird  Public Enemies
","I think Michael Mann is one of the good ones; even subpar fare like Miami Vice still seemed to contain what could have been a good film, hidden inside, just a few more edits away. So, when trailers for Public Enemies started dropping, with two stalwarts in Johnny Depp and Christian Bale, I was ready for a return to form. Unfortunately that is not what showed on screen. Instead, Mann once more seems to have overexerted himself by producing a bloated product with too many dead areas, virtually filming a vanity piece for Depp rather than a truly captivating tale. Comparisons to Ridley Scott's American Gangster kept entering the back of my mind, both derivative tales that try to be more than they are—perfectly adequate does not a classic make. John Dillinger is definitely an intriguing figure, a bank robber with a heart—sort of—but with a runtime over two hours, how often can we watch him rob a bank, risk his life, and get captured? The repetition becomes too much.<br/><br/>It's a shame because, once again, there is a lot to like here. I feel Mann needs to step back and reevaluate his movies, taking a fresh look and seeing how he can excise all the superfluous fluff preventing the work from truly shining. The opening scene is fantastic. You assume it will begin with a bang, but in a bank, not at a jail during broad daylight. With the tone set and a rapid pace, I was ready for a thrill ride. However, the following scenes soon brought the speed down to the level it would stay for the duration. His chauvinism and unceasing confidence win over thieves everywhere as well as the heart of Frechette; it sadly did not win me over. Depp is great as Dillinger; the question becomes whether the character itself deserved such an epic tale. Giovanni Ribisi's crook arrives early on with a proposition of a big score for retirement, why must we have over an hour of filler before finally getting back to that plan? Maybe Mann felt we needed to see Dillinger's hubristic ways slowly destroy him, but starting the film without backstory and throwing us directly into the action is a measured choice, we as an audience expect to see his fall, we have no allusions that he will survive and ride out into the sunset. Starting so late in his ""career"" tells us the end is nigh, there is no need to prolong it.<br/><br/>And then there is Bale. Again, like Scott's longwinded opus of crime with Russell Crowe's detective role, while the character of Melvin Purvis may be the more interesting of the two, he is second fiddle at every turn. We all know the kind of badass Dillinger was, as well as his demise, but what about Purvis' conflicted mind when it came to killing rather than catching the criminals he hunted; what about the events that would ultimately lead to his own suicide? Bale is pushed to the background, utilized only as a villain to Depp's actual villainy. His shining moment comes with his ending Pretty Boy Floyd's, (I thought that was Channing Tatum, and it is), reign of crime—the first scene with him—a moment with absolutely nothing to do with Dillinger. The moments with he and Billy Crudup's J. Edgar Hoover fall flat, touching upon the bureaucracy that was letting these miscreants run free on the streets, but never approached the intrigue that the bad guys had. The jailbirds are just fun to watch as well as being a who's who of familiar faces.<br/><br/>I guess my main gripe is in the title—Public Enemies. Well, where are the stories of everyone else? Okay, Floyd and Baby Face Nelson are included, but to what end? The first is shown only at his death and the other only as a loose cannon shooting anything in his path, (although I did enjoy Stephen Graham while eating dinner and being questioned in his hotel room). Mann should have called the film Dillinger and just made it into a biopic rather than pretending it was this huge crime drama about America's most wanted during the Great Depression. The film is at its best when Depp is on screen, especially opposite the wonderful Marion Cotillard who shows what got her the Oscar in 2008. It may be a thankless role, playing the waif, but she instills in Frechette strength of character, a longing for honesty even though she has involved herself with a bank robber. Depp shines in his relationships with cohorts and friends, never wanting to let any of them down  ever. Right from the start we see this, we see his eyes once a member of the jailbreak takes it upon himself to bludgeon a guard. There was not supposed to be any bloodshed and that incident ultimately leads to a friend's death, something unacceptable to him.<br/><br/>Amidst the long-windedness and repetitive story structure lie some pretty impressive art direction and an aesthetic that portrays the 1930s to perfection. Depp's performance shows the notoriety he sought—it wasn't about killing or the rush of danger—he just really loved the spotlight of celebrity. His image was what mattered most, to the point where he allowed customers at the banks he robbed to keep their money. While not anywhere near a Robin Hood figure, he kept his spoils for himself; there really wasn't any malice in Dillinger, unless it was towards the police shooting bullets his way. Mann did a great job showing how America took to this man, not a murderer, but a showman, watching it all play out with wonderment rather than fear. Scenes of him holding a press conference upon his capture and seeing the awe in Emilie de Ravin's face when she is taken hostage express the glamour I believe Mann strived for. It's just a shame that the story surrounding that image was so dull to sit through otherwise."
"agmoldham","5","1","2","9 July 2009"," Good rather than great
","I must admit that I have a big problem with Michael Mann movies. His movies are extremely stylish and it always seems like every single shot is carefully considered and crafted. His films look great, but I always find this very distracting. Rather than sitting back and enjoying the movie, I find myself considering the lighting and camera angles.<br/><br/>Anyway as per usual Public Enemies looks extremely good on the big screen. It tells the story of the early FBI investigation of John Dillinger, the gangster who was popular with the public. Christian Bale plays Melvin Purvis who is tasked with hunting down Dillinger played by Johnny Depp. The leads are played quite nicely, but you are never drawn into any of the characters. I can't help feeling it should have been more engaging, but it looks great on screen. It's classic Mann."
"hrstar24","7","1","2","9 July 2009"," This movie is like Dillingers life: short, fast, and loud.
","The 1920s/30s would be an exciting time period to live in if you're involved in crime. It was a time full of gangsters like Al Capone, Baby-face Nelson, Pretty boy Floyd, and of course John Dillinger. These criminals were more famous than celebrities and lived like kings, if only for a short while. This was also the birth of the FBI, and the police weren't afraid to use brutal tactics to punish lawbreakers. So brutal that folks like Dillinger were revered as heroes to the public, a modernized Robin Hood.<br/><br/>Director Michael Mann (Heat, Miami Vice) tries to do this time period justice with his new film Public Enemies. It focuses on the most famous bank robber, John Dillinger (Johnny Depp), and the FBI agent charged with hunting him, Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale). This film covers only the last year of Dillinger's life, but it is by far his most interesting year. Dillinger escapes from jail, twice, and commits dozens of bank robberies with the likes of Baby-face Nelson and John ""Red"" Hamilton.<br/><br/>I'll go ahead and get this out of the way, Public Enemies is not as good as other gangster movies like Scorsese's various films or Mann's own Heat, but that doesn't mean it's bad. Johnny Depp is once again brilliant in his portrayal of Dillinger, and it also helps that he looks spookily similar to the man. It is quite obvious that Mann chose not to make this yet another romantic legend of Dillinger, but instead it's almost a documentary focusing on showing what the famous robber was really like. An example of this is that unlike the urban legend of the ""lady in the red dress"", she was actually wearing a simple white shirt with an orange skirt. He wasn't a peoples' hero stealing from the rich and giving to the poor, but a cunning thief and a cold blooded killer. Mann also quickly establishes that Dillinger cares about nothing except what is happening at that moment, like he says in the film, ""We are having much too good of a time today to even be thinking about tomorrow."" Michael Mann continues to show his prowess at creating extraordinary gun fights, and there is a shootout about every 15 minutes. The sound mixing is so well that it feels like they are shooting old Thompson machine guns right next to you. The sets are also extremely detailed and accurate, and Mann even filmed the famous gunfight in the Wisconsin forest in the exact spot where Dillinger fought off and escaped the FBI, but it's hard to see these things because the movie is paced like Dillinger's life, fast and loud. It's also worth noting that the entire cast does a great job in this movie, especially Christian Bale and Marion Cotillard.<br/><br/>It's almost like a double edged sword for Mann, focusing on the facts and not the legend, because he had to sacrifice good character development and script. Almost all the other characters and their relationships in the movie seem really frail, since they lack scenes that help set up who exactly they are. The main relationship between Dillinger and his girlfriend Billy (Marion Cotillard) seems really forced and is difficult to connect with. As accurate as the movie is, it does change a few famous deaths around to fit in the movie (since in real life they were killed after Dillinger), and this doesn't work well. At the end it makes Dillinger seem a little weak and all alone, instead of the powerful criminal mastermind he actually was.<br/><br/>Overall, Public Enemies isn't perfect, probably won't get an Oscar best pic nomination like some were hoping for, but its still a good flick. Unlike the other hyped summer movies like Terminator Salvation and Transformers, this is actually one film that I want to see again.<br/><br/>7/10"

","I went to go see this at midnight on the opening day. I was really excited, I used to live near Crown Point, IN last year where the jail break scene was filmed in the original jail house. Depp played his role fantastically! It was worth the two and a half hours just to see his great and funny acting. However, I thought it could have included some more bank robbery scenes and less of the love story. I mean we know Dillinger as this famous bank robber. I thought this would be more of an updated version of the original Dillinger, but it was not. Overall, it was good, but not worth seeing at a midnight screening. Bales' character, Purvis, I thought could have been extended a bit more. I thought the there was a lot missing from him. He didn't meet the good guy image like Eliot Ness in The Untouchables, which I was hoping this movie would lean towards. There was a great shoot out scene and the ending just makes you upset, nothing like the '73 version. This is a good movie if you want to get a idea of a short period in his life."
"Deckard-16","7","1","2","8 July 2009"," Strangely underwhelming
","Maybe this movie suffers from comparisons with THE HURT LOCKER which I had seen 2 days earlier, but I found this highly anticipated movie static & unmoving.<br/><br/>How could you go wrong with putting down $7.50 seeing Michael Mann direct a period gangster piece with Johnny Depp & Christian Bale going toe to toe? (By unable to stop the constant urge to compare it to a non-stop intense movie about an Army bomb squad in Iraq?) Because this movie like his last one, Miami VICE, never really gets going. It has fine performances: Depp as Dillinger, Cotillard as his dame & Bale as G-Man Melvin Purvis are all very good. However my favorite performance was Billy Crudup who gives ""his"" J. Edgar Hoover a wicked effeminate flair. (Forgive me --or not-- for not enjoying Hoover played as bit of a poofter.) <br/><br/>Mann is not a grab you by the throat artist (like Paul Greengrass or, evidently, Kathryn Bigelow). His best films (THIEF, THE INSIDER, HEAT, COLLATERAL) seduce you. This one doesn't although it tries very hard.<br/><br/>Like all Mann movies, PUBLIC ENEMIES, is put together with a great deal of care, informed with great intelligence (that even permeated his pulp masterpiece COLLATERAL) & has atmosphere to burn. It just doesn't quite come together as anything more than occasionally involving. Also the digital photography ruined some shots (it worked in COLLATERAL, but it didn't work in ...VICE & it doesn't work here).<br/><br/>Mann has hit grand slams before, but this movie results in a ground rule double."
"J_Macho","6","1","2","8 July 2009"," The good (cast), the bad (story) and the ugly (videomedia and editing)
","This comment may ultimately sound harsh, though I enjoyed the movie and the exceptional cast.<br/><br/>One may argue that ""Public Enemies"" is really nothing more than a remake of Michael Mann's '95 cult-hit ""Heat"" set in 1930'ies America. Although that would be an overstatement, there are some truths supporting the above statement.<br/><br/>Parallel protagonists on opposite sides of the law and a lover caught in between wanting a subtle life and loving a criminal. Topped with public wars between gangsters and the police/FBI fought with automatic rifles (m16 rifles and the like in ""Heat""), (Tommyguns and pistols in ""Public Enemies"").<br/><br/>Character portraits in ""Heat"" were superb and you ended up cheering for both Pachino and De Niro. The cast of ""Public Enemies"" is equally talented but characters end up shallow and quite dull in comparison. Marion Cotillard's Character is really the only one you end up feeling sorry for.<br/><br/>Vague characters aside, the lead actors are fantastic - in the prison scene with Depp and Bale they show off skills that only few actors possess. Marion Cotillard is wonderful and equally talented.<br/><br/>Characters and plot are vague and dull but the movie is saved by the cast.<br/><br/>BUT......Why oh why Michael Mann did you choose to shoot this on HDCAM/XDCAM/whatever-CAM? Locations, cars, costumes etc. reek of the thirties and are truly amazing - But all of these things get spoiled by the ""Oh look at me shooting this big blockbuster on a family camera worth 200$"" feel that this movie leaves you with. Colourgrading is horrible and editing too....I mean closeups are fine, but not 90% of the time. Film is far superior to Video even in this digitally-defined age we call present. The video-look alone made this movie seem at least 4 hours long and had me waiting for it to end. Horrible choice Michael Mann....Horrible.<br/><br/>See this movie for the acting, if you don't like; Depp, Bale or Cotillard - don't bother..."
"moviemanMA","9","1","2","7 July 2009"," Gangster's Paradise
","In true Michael Mann fashion, he has given the 1930s a reboot with his action infused, crime drama about the rise and fall of one of America's most notorious Gangster's, John Dillinger. This film has all the clothing, cars, and guns a film about the 30s could ask for. I've heard this film called an action movie, but really it's not. Granted the action is top of the line and possibly the most memorable aspect of the film, but it's not a complete action-packed extravaganza.<br/><br/>John Dillinger was the result of the gang scene from Chicago led by Al Capone during the prohibition era. Dillinger started somewhat small and grew to national fame, catching the attention of the FBI for his lightning quick robberies and evasions from law enforcement. He was efficient, skilled, and ready for anything. He could pick up sticks and be gone within minutes. This film is a great cat and mouse chase through banks, city streets, and back roads as the law tries to put a stop to the country's ""public enemy number one.""<br/><br/>To start with the cast you have to look first at Johnny Depp. I've read that Depp was truly excited about this role, feeling really well connected with the character of John Dillinger. He is cool, collected, and knows exactly what his character is about. First and foremost he plays a gangster. Regardless how you might feel about him, he is a bad guy. He might seem like a Robin Hood of sorts from time to time, but he really is a bad guy with manners.<br/><br/>To be honest I expected a little more from Depp. He doesn't really play up the character too much. Maybe I'm just comparing it to his recent performances as a pirate, demon barber, and chocolate factory owner, all of which are over the top. It's almost like his character from Donnie Brasco. Nothing over the top, but a solid performance. His actions speak louder than his words, and some of his dialogue is pretty amazing.<br/><br/>Moving on to some of the surprises in the cast, I was very impressed with Christian Bale as Agent Melvin Purvis of the FBI. His southern accent and old fashioned approach make him a very unlikable but slightly admirable character, especially with his rifle. Alongside Bale and even more impressive was Billy Crudup as the head of the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover. He looked perfect for the part, his voice was outstanding, and his overall presence on screen was much like that of Hoover; intimidating. He added some much needed support from the cast.<br/><br/>Academy Award Winning actress Marion Cotillard (La vie en rose) gives a fine performance as Depp's love interest Billie. She didn't blow me away like in La vie en rose, but she still did a good job especially with her American accent. She played someone who was part French and there is just a hint of the accent, making her character more believable. Other than that she did just enough.<br/><br/>What Michael Mann film would be complete without a mind boggling shootout? Mann's debacle of Miami Vice left a sour taste in my mouth for several reasons. He has regained my trust here and in large part to his use of weaponry and special effects. The guns are real, the sounds are deafening, and the action is intense. It doesn't meet the standard Mann set with his film Heat, featuring one of the greatest shootout ever filmed, but this has one of his best. There are no wasted bullets here. Each shot is carefully aimed as if they were really trying to do some damage.<br/><br/>Another feature of the Mann experience is the camera work. He always makes on a beautiful looking picture. The camera is a little too jerky for my liking in this movie, but on the whole the shots and angles are perfectly set up, bringing close to the action, forcing us to watch the mayhem and intensity of the scene. It's not just the action that looks incredible. The car scenes, dinners, and all of the in between scenes look stunning as well. It's a testament to the art director as well as the cinematographer.<br/><br/>It's not the best gangster film I've seen, but it's one of the most original films of the genre. There wasn't a whole lot wrong with the film. It has a fantastic cast, great soundtrack, and amazing effects and action sequences. It runs a little too long but nothing too lengthy to handle. It's a must-see for the summer, and keep your eyes peeled for this one around award season."

"demented_peruvian","7","1","2","6 July 2009"," Re-romanticize the de-romanticized
","Michael Mann has been able to tell complicated tales in expert form before, with masterful attention to detail and performances. In ""Public Enemies"" he keeps the latter but fails to tell the right story, choosing to do a standard old fashioned Hollywood film (with great gunfights). The book that this was adapted from is about the FBI and how it came to be successful, despite its multiple blunders, during a time in which the United States was no better than a third world country. The tales of the villains (the public enemies of the title) at the time are told to in part de-romanticize the crime figures but also to de-romanticize (or de-Hollywood-ize) the FBI. Mann goes the opposite way. He creates not only a Hollywood-type lost soul criminal in John Dillinger, but also a ridiculously idealized Melvin Purvis, the Chicago special agent in charge. Mann wants to make him into an Elliot Ness of ""The Untouchables"", when per the details in Brian Burrough's book, Purvis was rarely involved in the raids, missed or blatantly ignored many leads, and screwed up many operations - particularly the raid on Little Bohemia, portrayed in the movie as extremely successful, when in fact the FBI only managed to harm innocent civilians and lost all the gang. Many ideas credited to Purvis in the film were ideas of other agents. This is not just dishonest but it takes the fun and intelligence out of the tale.<br/><br/>Mann is not ignorant of the details. What in turn is amazing of ""Public Enemies"" is the great length to recreate many scenes, which Mann and his crew deliver perfectly. Thus it is obvious that Mann chose to willfully ignore it to create his own romantic vision of Dillinger and the FBI."
"bramb600","8","1","2","6 July 2009"," A bit slow, but good overall.
","It stars Johnny Depp and Christian Bale. This movie takes place in the 1930's and is about John Dillinger who was a bank robber and the last 18 months of his life. Johnny Depp plays Dillinger and he was a very good choice for the role because he looks very much like him, but not as much as Leonardo Di Caprio would have. Since Johnny Depp has done so many great roles, I can't say that this is his best but it's just another great role for him and a great performance. Maybe it can fall in his top ten.<br/><br/>Christian Bale plays Melvin Purvis and spends the whole movie hunting down Dillinger and trying to put him behind bars. Christian Bale is actually a great actor despite his recent years. The Dark Knight was a great movie, but it wasn't because of his performance. It's great to see that he's not using the Batman voice anymore like he was using in Terminator: Salvation.<br/><br/>Everyone else was solid.<br/><br/>This in definitely a great movie, but unfortunately it is a little bit flawed. The gun battles are amazing and the gun shots are very loud and realistic like it's supposed to sound. If there's something you can expect in a Michael Mann directed film, it's that it will have great gun shot sound effects. If you don't like loud noises, I don't recommend it.<br/><br/>However, there is this one gun battle that takes place in the forest that's probably about 15 minutes long. Way too long in my opinion and I started getting bored at that point about an hour and a half into the movie. But, it managed to pick up near the end.<br/><br/>A major complaint that I'm hearing is the constant use of HD video. The entire movie is actually shot with hand-held cameras which is said to have a negative effect on the film. What these cameras did was make several parts of the movie much more blurry when you would like to be able to see, darker and and whole lot noisier. Personally, I wasn't bothered too much by the use of the cameras. They actually are able to make you feel that you're part of the action, which is great. They are still a bit unnecessary, because the movie could have been shot with film, but I didn't enjoy the film any less because of it.<br/><br/>Also, this movie had a very good soundtrack. It seemed to go very well with the visuals and was a great selection of the best tunes of the 30's, which I am not familiar with.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed the movie and I would give it a 7.5/10, brought down because it was slow for about 25 minutes but it managed to pick up again. You'll be entertained, but if you actually want to learn about the life of John Dillinger, that's not what you'll get. What you'll be seeing on the screen is only his time robbing banks. If you really want to learn more than you can browse Wikipedia, which is always available. That's my review of the film and I was helpful."
"maian1-1","7","1","2","4 July 2009"," Less ''Heat'', more ''Warmth''
","This review originally appeared at www.a-mighty-fine-blog.blogspot.com Public Enemies was never meant to be a film. It was originally set to be made at HBO as a mini-series, and if my viewing of it told me nothing else, it's that television would have been a much more natural fit for the story of John Dillinger's last year, the woman he loved and the man who tried to catch him. It is very episodic in nature, with no real through-line to connect them other than, obviously, Dillinger himself. There is just so much that could be done with this story that, even at two hour, twenty minutes, the film winds up feeling truncated.<br/><br/>To his credit, Michael Mann does try to cover a lot of ground in what time he has; we get a glimpse into the birthing pains of the FBI, the megalomania of J. Edgar Hoover (played with relish by Billy Crudup, sporting the broadest of 1930s announcer voices) and the creation of a surveillance society. These fascinating ideas, though, are ultimately only mentioned in passing and are never explored. Similarly, there is no sense of the economic turmoil that America was going through at the time, and therefore little context for why Dillinger would be consider such a folk hero. And it would have been perfectly possible to convey this without interrupting the story or disrupting the drama; Bonnie and Clyde did it in 1967.<br/><br/>The greatest victim of the film's attempts to encompass so much in too disparate a manner is the character of Melvin Purvis, played ably by Christian Bale. I say 'ably' and this should not be considered a slight against Bale; he's not fantastic because the part he has been given is not fantastic. Purvis could be an obsessive trying to get his man, or a conflicted good 'ol boy struggling to contend with his more violent colleagues, but there is so little scope for his development in the film that he winds up being a two-dimensional good cop.<br/><br/>Contrasted with Purvis is Dillinger, who is given ample room to play around in. In his depiction of Dillinger, Johnny Depp, as well as Michael Mann and his co-writers, Ann Biderman and Ronan Bennett, do something very interesting. Instead of romanticising and mythologising Dillinger, the film-makers choose to portray him as a cold, efficient and ultimately bad man. Sure, he's charming and has a certain amount of wit to him, but the film suggests that this was all for the cameras and the public, that Dillinger was putting on an act in order to curry public favour. It's there in his assertion that he cares what the public thinks of him, in his declarations that he's ''here for the bank's money'', not that of its customers (even though it's all the same money) and in his decision to visit the office of the very people trying to catch him.<br/><br/>Even the look of the film serves to underline this un-romantic view of Dillinger. Rather than shoot the film in a nostalgic way, Mann shoots the film in an incredibly modern style, using digital cameras and an almost entirely hand-held technique, making for a nice contrast between the period trappings and the urgency of this technique. The film has a verite feel to it, one which is exemplified by its fast and loose action sequences. I was particularly impressed by the way in which bullets were used in the film. The lack of music in most of the shoot outs made each of the impacts sound especially loud and the sound design for each impact made them feel much more powerful and intimate than in most films. In your average film, bullets ping; in Public Enemies, they bang, producing a much more visceral experience.<br/><br/>The only flaw in this aesthetic is the way in which the film portrays Dillinger's relationship with Billie Frechette (the luminous Marion Cotillard). Their relationship is overly sentimental and is at odds with the tone of the rest of the film, which is resolutely hard-edged in its notions of Dillinger and what he represented. I'm not saying that this element of the film is sub-par, it does make for a nice change from the bank heists, shoot outs and prison escapes that make up much of the film, just that it was an element that stood out from the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Public Enemies is an impressive feat in terms of what you can do with digital film-making and as an example of what can be done with period films to make them feel fresh and relevant, but it's too compressed in its ideas and this causes the whole to suffer. Add four hours, divide it into six parts and it could have been something really special. As it is, it's an above average gangster film, but with the pedigree of those involved it should have been so much more."
"lazyaceuk","6","4","18","29 June 2009"," Too much, too little, too late
","I was very keen to see this film after all of the PR advance I had read. The film looked great and the music fully completed the film. Sadly, Michael Mann forgot to include very much story in and around the action.<br/><br/>Both Johnny Depp (Dillenger) and Christian Bale (FBI Agent Purvis) work well in their roles. One scene in particular when Purvis visits Dillenger after the latter has just been captured is neatly played. But you get little else from their characters as both of these actors has to find a moment when they aren't brandishing some form of killing machine or in a car chase. There are probably more lines in a Steven Seagal film.<br/><br/>And this is why to me the film is a waste of talent.<br/><br/>We have no back story on Dillinger, other than a throw away line about his mother dying at three and his father beating him from a young age. We start the film with a breakout gone wrong and innocent people being butchered by Dillinger and his crew. And yet, partly down to Depp, in my view, as the film continues you begin to sympathize with Dillnger and his fight against Purvis, who seems to lead a less able rabble than Dillinger at times.<br/><br/>I have made no mention of Marion Cotillard, who plays Dillinger's love interest Billie Frechette. Frechette probably has the most frustrating time of all. Plucked from her acceptable life as a cloakroom attendant she gets 'pulled' by Dillinger, spends most of the film waiting fro him to outrun the FBI and when they finally get together she gets picked up by the Feds and beaten and abused. But through it all Cotillard battles through making the best of an underwritten part.<br/><br/>The pay off of the film is quick well executed with the standard 'slow mo' as Dillinger is gunned down. But by then I would have taken him being run over by a truck if the film could have ended sooner.<br/><br/>This film very much disappointed me. I will probably rent it when it goes on rental just to see what I missed. But I think it's Mr Mann who really did the missing this time around.<br/><br/>6/10"

Edgar Hoover's (Billy Crudup) chosen agent to find Dillinger, uses his smarts to get associates to rat on him, and some ""tough"" heavy artillery to bring down the pop culture hero.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp in Public Enemies is about as distant from an Oscar playing gangster Dillinger as he could get playing a pirate: he underplays one of the most infamous bank robbers of the Depression as if director Michael Mann told him to hide while the feds were tracking him for spilling milk.<br/><br/>Although other attempts to portray this rogue in film and TV have fallen short as well, you'd think the director of Manhunter, Heat, and The Insider could come up with a more exciting rendition because Tommy guns just don't an interesting movie make anymore.<br/><br/>Saving the film from complete boredom is the relationship between Dillinger and his love, Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard), because both actors are capable of subtlety: The characters dance around each other, especially Billie, who is reluctant to hitch up with a ""most wanted"" guy. Although Depp never shows much emotion, Cotillard makes a fine reluctant lover, developing her love to the point of a devotion that happily endangers her with the feds. As for Mann, he has always peopled his films with difficult, frustrating loves, in a sense saving himself from being compared to Michael Bay.<br/><br/>""He could be the man sat next to you!"" So says the announcer about Dillinger on the 1930's movie screen as he uncomfortably tries not to be noticed. He should have paid attention to his nerves: a movie house will be his undoing.

","Now this is not a movie that most women like. I do not want to sound like a misogynistic prick, but it is true. Little women will not like this movie, can not like this movie. Some chicks and bored housewives made the mistake to watch it in the hopes of some sufficient drooling over Johnny's magnificent behind, or Christian Bales' newly trained abs. Maybe see some skin, and aspire for a sweltering hot sex scene!!! Oh their frustration. Sorry ladies, wrong movie. This is the real thing. But is not just tough men, bank Robberies, lots of shooting and blood. No, it is much more than that.<br/><br/>Public Enemies is a journey back in time. It is a tale of great Americana. Michael Mann's camera ""searchlights"" and final shots are a directorial marvel. Every shot is well thought and delivered flawlessly. There is no big story, no long dialogs, no great action lines. Little attention is given to ""the depression"" as the story flies over the lyrical dancing of the camera. The script is weak, but the magic is in the picture. Like a great piece of music with few lyrics. And talking about music. Mr. Man's ingenious strikes you hard the way he uses music. The right moment, that moment, the perfect moment. And Billie Holyday's voice comes to complete the trip under your skin.<br/><br/>Although there are a lot of actors worth mentioning in this film, like Giovanni Ribisi (whom I by the way adore) as Alvin Karpis, Billy Crudup (exceptional talent) as J. Edgar Hoover, or the lovely Marion Cotillard, as Billie Frechette; I'd like to settle my comments on my two favorite actors. Christian Bale's fierce power in every twitch on his face. He descends into the part - even though small – and makes it his own. Only his presence tells a story, his body language his charisma. A right choice for the part. A right choice. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp. One of the parts he played in his fingers like a silver dollar. Not Oscar worthy perhaps, (even though he deserves it  again) but a faultless one none the less. No effort. No over-acting. No wavering. Real. Touching. Beautiful. Poetic. Like the movie.<br/><br/>Now, this was the second movie I saw within a month about America's most infamous criminals. (The other being The Assassination of Jessie James) Both men had something in common. People loved them. They had this Robin Hood attitude that made them who they are and kept their place in history. And they were both caught not by their pursuers but because they were betrayed by their own. The movies have something in common as well. They are both describing with not so many words, the heart of America. From their innermost poetic nature, to what it could have been, should have been, must have been. Movie enthusiasts and especially to this genre are going to enjoy every moment of it. Such elegance, such integrity, such visuals! <br/><br/>Michael Mann has chosen right in every possible aspect of this film. All the actors riveted into his direction. Into his close ups and almost ceremonial frames. The chase scenes fascinating, the violence brutal yet emotional. The shooting, the machine guns, the intensity of bloody scenes, the roughness of times, the disloyalty. A two-and-a half-hour movie that seemed too short.<br/><br/>The clothes and sets. Magnificent! Astounding! Splendid! The city looks so authentic; a slight sigh of longing can burst out of your chest. All those cars, all those beautiful, gorgeous cars!!! From the guns to the traffic lights. From the shoes to all those magnificent haircuts. These people did an admirable job!!! I applaud! <br/><br/>Michael Mann's use of colors is mystical. You sink into the movie as if intoxicated by some heavenly drug and for some moments you think there are no colors, but they are all there, assorted perfectly in this great trip, this great movie, this great classic (to be), this great Americana!!!<br/><br/>If Michael Mann is not leaving with an Oscar this year I will eat my hat."
"orlisgirl1131977","2","2","7","13 July 2009"," Not worth the time of anyone who wants to be entertained.
","Personally, I believed this movie had huge potential but fell really flat. Firstly, and probably most importantly--characters! Where were they? Why should I choose one side over the other? Was the corrupt Bureau actually worth its weight, or was John Dillenger a 30's almost- Robin Hood, stealing from the rich to give to his cronies. I went into this movie totally excited--Johnny Depp and Christian Bale in a gun-slinging', bank robbing', shoot-em-up movie? Sign me up! But by the time the movie had started it's second hour, I was completely horrified. Where were the qualities I was supposed to relate to? Who was the person I was actually supposed the care about? In the end, the only person I could care about was Billie, and her minimal role as the short and sudden lover of John Dillenger was hardly a necessity to the movie. Hers was the only character who had any sort of depth--that is, if a rain puddle has depth. Depp and Bale left me feeling confused and very, very bored as I struggled to understand what exactly the dynamic of this movie was. Not everyone knows the story of John Dillenger. I certainly didn't. (And, sadly, still don't.) I understand Dillenger's role as an icon lasted a relatively short time, but that does NOT mean that his character had to be completely and totally flat. And as for Purvis, I didn't understand who he was at all. He hunts Dillenger like a madman, shoots a young man down in an orchard, and then carries poor Billie to the bathroom after his own men interrogate her too roughly? WHO ARE YOU? None of the characters helped me understand who they were or why they were loved/hated. Next, the camera angles and use made me feel like I was watching a badly made home movie starring Cousin Johnny and Uncle Christian. Motion sickness anyone? Try and make the movie feel like a professional, please. If I wanted to watch the camera swing and shake like it was doing the Hand Jive I'd have filmed the movie myself and posted it on YouTube. No thanks. My vote? Don't waste your time. I felt that Depp and Bale were unfortunate to have been cast in this movie.

","Michael Mann is a guy I've looked up to for some time now. He is indisputably one of the greatest film makers of our time and has provided the world with some ground breaking films. Let's forget 2006's hiccup that was the Miami Vice movie and feast upon his latest offering, Public Enemies. But is Mann turning up the heat, or is it collateral damage.<br/><br/>Based on author Bryan Burrough's ambitious tome Public Enemies: America's Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI, 1933-43, director Michael Mann's sprawling historical crime drama follows the efforts of top FBI agent Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale ) in capturing notorious bank robber John Dillinger. A folk hero to the American public thanks to his penchant for robbing the banks that many people believed responsible for the Great Depression, charming bandit Dillinger (Johnny Depp) was virtually unstoppable at the height of his criminal career; no jail could hold him, and his exploits endeared him to the common people while making headlines across the country. J. Edgar Hoover's (Billy Crudup) FBI was just coming into formation, and what better way for the ambitious lawman to transform his fledgling Bureau of Investigation into a national police force than to capture the gang that always gets away? It was the movies that killed John Dillinger -- Gangster No. 1 until he was gunned down outside a Chicago theatre after taking in the pictures one hot night in 1934 -- and it was the movies that brought him back to life. More than once. But this time it's different. This time Michael Mann is in charge. This is undoubtedly a Michael Mann film. From the intense close ups to the thrilling soundtrack its clear who's running the show. And boy if he doesn't do it near perfectly. This is masterful direction on his part; each scene is pitch perfect and balanced to the point that there isn't a speck of dirt on camera, in this aspect Public Enemies soars. Unfortunately the film does have some technical issues, none of which are large enough to take you out of the movie, but at times the audio editing is, jumpy to say the least. One minute we have guns blazing defining anybody sitting in the aisle seats, other times speech is misheard as the characters speak lines so softly it's easy to misinterpretation.<br/><br/>As far as the look of the film, it's absolutely phenomenal. Shot entirely on digital, which seems to be Mann's new forte, the picture looks crisp, clear and utterly classy. Sporting some unparalleled cinematography that encapsulate 1930's Chicago, there no denying that Public Enemies is the best looking film of 2009. The acting is nothing below extraordinary with favourite Johnny Depp and Christian Bale recovering from the rough patch they been through recently. This is them back on form and better than ever. Oscar Winner Marion Cotillard delivers a solid is underused performance.<br/><br/>Verdict: Public Enemies shows Michael Mann's steady recovery from 2006's Miami Vice, there are a couple of casual bugs, the sound can be dreadful at time but for the most part Public Enemies shines as one of 2009s brightest gems and could be up for some serious awards come Oscar time. The running time may scare some and with it being a Michael Mann film it's definitely not for everybody but for thoses who appreciate his style of movie making, this is all for you. A stunning, sumptuous sensation that acts as one of my favourite films of 2009."

","I saw this movie as a second choice, since the picture I meant to see was sold out at the movie-theatre, but although not being my favourite genre, I really appreciated it. The myth of John Dillinger is brought to vivid life by Johnny Depp who hits the sign, by offering a truly strong and deeply convincing performance. We do not come to know much about this rob-banker, except he loves robbing and planning robbing banks, he is a highly professional man, and committed to his job, he never retreats, he never gives up, he is honest and sincere, that's what makes Billie Frechette fall in love with him. I really liked her character, very intensively interpreted by Marion Cotillard: at the beginning she appears as a fragile woman, in search of protection, but as the story progresses, she proves strength, in the way she stays next to her man in the most tragic moments. Although we do not see much about their relationship, although they do not say much to each other (Dilliger once says to her: ""I like baseball, movies, good clothes, fast cars and you. What else you need to know?""), they are deeply in love, being their love founded on sincerity from the beginning, and the only moment, a very touching one, when Dilliger laughs (he generally shows a hard, almost insensitive face) is when he gives her the fur-coat as a present. The movie is very well built, the original and expressionistic use of camera-work makes everything sound very realistic and involving, although sometimes too indulging in violence. The script is very intelligent and made alive by a talented cast. And, let me address to the female public, Johnny Depp in a white shirt and a black suit is really worth the ticket!"

","i saw the trailer for this film long before it came out and was blown away by the trailer alone. but what the trailer did was, it gave me the impression that it was a good, exciting action film with Johnny Depp and Christian Bale, two of my favourite actors. so i went in with high hopes, but as soon as it started i got the sense that this film was so much more then an action with good acting. it was a film that as i say ""knew what it was doing"". The film was shot on many different locations so to move fast they used a small HD camera to film. this for many people almost ruined the film for them, but for me it only added to the realism in the direction and performances. you are in 1933 with John Dillinger and Melvin Pervis...you aren't in a cinema watching a film. i would give this movie a solid ten as it is a landmark and a break through in the world of film. I hope i'm not alone in my opinion. thanks for reading."

","I saw the movie this evening, and was expecting a good movie because of the trailers I'd seen, and because of the other info I had read online about it. It far exceeded my expectations! Johnny Depp's portrayal of John Dillinger was perfect -- Depp really buries himself in the role, and plays a very plausible, believable Dillinger. Christian Bale was good as Melvin Purvis. One of the actors (I don't know his name) grated on my nerves, but that was his role -- and he played it very well; kind of the man you love to hate. I may see the movie again with a different group of friends, and will definitely purchase the DVD when it becomes available."

","Johnny Depp is very capable in the role of John Dillinger. He's a great actor, but besides Depp and a fine supporting role by Bale, there's not all that much which is great about the acting in this movie. The movie feels very conventional to me. It's good but it's never special. This is not to say the movie doesn't have good point. The set pieces are all very top notch as well. This is a very good movie to look at, everything looks authentic 1930s.<br/><br/>But there have been movies like this before, movies about convicts on the loose with lots of firepower and a hatred of the police, Bonnie & Clyde is one excellent movie about this topic. It's similarly based on a true story although there is a lot of artistic license being used.<br/><br/>I never felt that kind of excitement in Public Enemies. There's lots of shooting but that seems to have taken the precedent over any character development.<br/><br/>I would have liked to get to know Christian Bale's character more as well as some of the other officers in the then newly created FBI trying to catch Dillinger. Dillinger's comrades also seem to get a once over.<br/><br/>Depp is good as always and it's nice to see him in a different kind of role for him (something outside of a Tim Burton film) but the story felt like it could have been a lot better. We've all seen shootouts captured on screen before but this movie should have been more about the characters than their actions."
"raimund-berger","3","1","3","13 October 2009"," Dead in the water
","I didn't even know this film was by Mann when I felt I've seen the whole shlock before. There's one of the most prominent contemporary male actors set up as a gangster and violently introduced by a ensemble shooting sequence, and there's another set up as his cop antagonist. So it was about 20 minutes into the film that I felt I was watching ""Heat"". As I learned afterwards I actually was. Apparently Mann, who's ""Heat"" effectively is a literal remake of one of his own films already, isn't quite finished yet recycling the setup.<br/><br/>There are deviations though, and crucial one's. First off, this film presents even more of a male world. Bale's character comes without woman, so the whole Pacino/Venora marital conflict is cut out. On Depp's side, an alibi romance is thrown in while given no time to develop. And although they tried to give it a ""Titanic"" style ""I'll always be there for you"" touch and use that for the only tragic turn the film could possibly offer, by having Dillinger fail on that promise, the twist just falls flat.<br/><br/>Even worse though, in contrast to ""Heat"" the male leads are lacking in character. Remember De Niro being set up as the ""loner"" and promoting that life style as a philosophy of total detachment? While suffering at the same time from his desire for having someone to be with and thus living through an inner conflict which ultimately leads to his demise? Well, in this film you'll be looking in vain for something comparable in Depp's character, and the same applies for his counter part. In fact, it's symptomatic that the only person who will have something to say about the life of a gangster is Clark Gable, in a film in film sequence. Which doesn't speak for the movie's authenticity though, but is rather due to a wrong choice of material. Because, apparently, there just isn't much to say about Dillinger, as a human being.<br/><br/>Finally, the story line doesn't really have high and low points. It's all downhill right from the start. Dillinger escapes prison, makes a few scores but get's increasingly cornered by the cops, captured, escapes again, get's cornered even more and eventually dies, losing his friends on the way. That's all there is. In fact, even the orchestration of the escape and heist sequences is lackluster, something you wouldn't exactly expect from a Mann film.<br/><br/>On the bright side, the times of throwing a uniform blue tint over a film are apparently over, which is quite a relief. There's of course some heavy color filtering going on here too, but it varies between green/brown/orange tones. And at times, you even get a feeling of looking at actual whites and blacks. This certainly deserves some congratulations.<br/><br/>Then, the sets are great, we got to give them that. Unfortunately we hardly have time to enjoy them. And this time it's not that much the incessant camera panning and hand-held runabouts which cause havoc. It's actually the editing which ruins everything down to the acting. As you know, to enjoy something the eye needs time first to explore and then to rest upon it. And for an actor to act, he needs room and time to expand in. Well, the editors gave us and them neither.<br/><br/>To conclude, while this film tries to pick up on De Palma's ""Untouchables"" in material and style it fails in just so many regards. In consequence, I can recommend only that you at most rent the film if you feel an urge to form your own opinion. It'd be safe to entirely skip it though and maybe watch it on TV sometime, on a slow evening ten years down the road."

","""Success is dangerous. One begins to copy oneself, and to copy oneself is more dangerous than to copy others. It leads to sterility."" - Picasso <br/><br/>Perhaps burnt by the hostility directed toward 2006's ""Miami Vice"", director Michael Mann strips 2009's ""Public Enemies"" down to its bare essentials. The film initially seems to be another ""Heat"", another ""The Assassination of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford"", but eventually it becomes apparent that Mann's chief concerns are action and mood; a series of thriller set pieces drenched in rich HD atmosphere. <br/><br/>The film's big themes – the worship of celebrity, the romance of mob life, the growing power of the FBI and the uneasy relationship between personal rights and national security – are touched upon only fleetingly, Mann more interested in the sound of gunfire, decor, poses, the cut of his cast's clothes and the colour of skylines.<br/><br/>As expected, the film has several great sequences. A midnight gun fight, a botched police raid, a trip to a theatre, two exciting prison escapes and an eerie sequence in which gang leader John Dillinger (played by Johnny Depp) visits an empty police station, all help to keep we the audience engaged. But other than such sequences, the film is strangely thin, and its central romance so derivative as to be intrusive. Elsewhere Mann's signature - characters who possess an existential longing for escape - seems trite, his climax is ruined by poor CGI blood, and his anti-hero's tragic tale is so conventional as to be comical. <br/><br/>Still, it's interesting to watch as Mann's style evolves further into a sort of minimalist functionality. Mann's crime films have always adhered to genre clichés, sticking fairly close to conventions. Aesthetically, however, his films have become far more bizarre. He's begun gutting his films of as much back-story, subplots, dialogue, introductions and prehistory as possible. The busy multi-strand epics of ""Heat"", ""The Insider"" and ""Ali"" have also been slowly phased out, jettisoned in favour for something ethereal.<br/><br/>His films have always had a unique atmosphere – strong night time photography, extreme focal lengths, cool musical tracks, off-centred compositions, elliptical editing – that's why he's so popular. But in removing comfortable plot beats and embracing a sort of muted minimalism, Mann is pushing toward something far more liquid. He essentially now directs big-budget, art-house movies, the poetics of a Kar Wai Wong or Wim Wenders applied to mainstream action blockbusters.<br/><br/>The problem with Mann, however, is that his delicious style is occasionally used in the service of rather ordinary stories. A stupid tale poetically told will always amount to stupid poetry. And as ""Public Enemies"" shows, Mann perhaps doesn't know where to go next, applying his new style to material and themes that he and others have fully explored.<br/><br/>Consider one scene late in ""Public Enemies"". John Dillinger visits a theatre to watch ""Manhattan Melodrama"", a 1930s gangster picture which stars Clark Gable. Like Mann's ""Public Enemies"" and ""Heat"", ""Manhattan Melodrama"" revolves around two strong characters on opposing sides of the law. But whilst ""Melodrama"" makes it clear that the actions of its criminals are abhorrent (just punishment was a requirement of the Production Code at the time), Mann's films treat their criminals with melancholic brush-strokes. We're not asked to condemn Johnny Depp in ""Public Enemies"" or DeNiro in ""Heat"", merely to shake our heads with the sad realisation that ""a life of lawlessness"" and a ""life of normalcy"" do not mix. In both films it is then the intrusion of the domestic, the regular, the family, the woman, that dooms the criminal, and not crime itself. Both lives are incompatible, and the greed of the gangster is ultimately his greed in wanting to have a piece of both worlds. <br/><br/>And aren't all of Mann's films (with the exception of ""The Keep"") about the incompatibility of professionalism (be it criminal or otherwise) and family (be it relationships or some moral, social responsibility). In ""Ali"", a boxer strives to be the ""best boxer in the world"", a desire which clashes with his domestic and personal life. Likewise Pacino and Deniro in ""Heat"", Crowe in ""The Insider"" and Caan in ""Thief"". What makes ""Manhunter"" and ""Miami Vice"" his most interesting films is that, in a sense, they represent opposing sides to Mann's thematic concerns. William Petersen in ""Manhunter"" achieves some measure of happiness by cutting himself away from his professional job, living out that ""happy life on the beach"" that literally every other Michael Mann leading man wishes for (an existential longing that goes back to the very first film noirs). ""Miami Vice"", in contrast, finds its characters in a state of total numbness, lost in a world in which human connection seems impossible and in which everyone is a creature of transience and a tool of functional anonymity. <br/><br/>So ultimately, what Mann does great is this: he marries the kind of existential masculinity of Melville to the way Antonioni's characters feel eternally uncomfortable in the places they inhabit. Couple that with a desire to copy the aesthetics of the sensualists (Malick, Lynch, Wai Wong etc), and you have one sexy film-maker. The question is where next can he go.<br/><br/>7.9/10 – It's hard to take such a familiar tale seriously, especially after directors like Altman so thoroughly autopsied them. Makes a good companion piece to ""Dillinger"" (1945), ""Thieves Like Us"" and ""The Public Enemy"" (1931)."

","Decent Michael Mann movie. Kept me riveted to the chair as I was watching it, and I don't demand much more of a movie.<br/><br/>A few points of gratuitous criticism, though:<br/><br/>*The movie takes a few too many liberties with history; I realise this is not a History Channel documentary, but it should at least loosely adhere to the real order of things; to point out one rub, we see Pretty Boy Floyd getting shot at the beginning of the movie, although he was actually killed after Dillinger.<br/><br/>*Most of the movie is shot in digital video, on a Sony HD video camera; I was disappointed. The images were grainy and too contrasty, and even skewed -- circles looked like ellipses. The few scenes shot on regular film were a visual relief. Basically the cinematography was crap.<br/><br/>*In one scene a fed beats a girl and is wrestled down to the ground by his boss. I found that scene unbelievable and gratuitous -- after all, innocent bystanders are getting killed, and a hard-as-nails cop takes umbrage against a gangster moll being roughed up?<br/><br/>*Unlike shown in the movie, Dillinger was dating other women than Billie Frechette; e. g. the girl he went to the Biograph with was his actual-life girlfriend.<br/><br/>*Unfortunately, the movie makes no mention of the Great Depression and the economic circumstances it was set in. In the current economic crisis, many people would have liked to see more of the situation in a previous one.<br/><br/>*A few scenes didn't gel. For example, I could have sworn that Dillinger got shot dead in the Little Bohemia shootout scene, and in the next scene he's jumping around. Maybe I'm just slow.<br/><br/>What I really did enjoy were the cinema gags. For example, Dillinger sits in the cinema when the lights go on and the voice from the silver screen tells viewers to look left and right if their seatmate is John Dillinger.<br/><br/>I also liked the detail of Dillinger going with the times and sporting a (badly cut) Clark Gable-moustache at the end of the movie."

","This movie was not good. Plainly put. I went to see this movie at Scarborough Town Centre on a Tuesday where the admission is only $5 (Tuesdays only) and i still regret wasting my money, but mostly my time.<br/><br/>Where the movie falls short is in the writing/directing. The actors all do a fine job. Depp portrays Dillinger proficiently. Bale portrays Purvis adequately, but a surprise for me was Billy Crudup as J. Edgar Hoover, where the voice impersonation really brought me back to the 1930s. The main actress in the movie, Marion Cotillard, was poorly placed and should not have been in this movie. She is a french actress (in real life) and her french accent is clearly present throughout the movie (though she does try to mask it, but very very poorly) and I found it to be extremely annoying and distracting. She does explain that she is part french in the movie itself as a way of excusing said accent. But why go through the trouble? The director should have just gotten an American actress, or someone who could speak with an American accent appropriately.<br/><br/>There is a slew of actors and actresses you will recognize from across the entertainment spectrum. Being an Entourage fan I was pleased to see Dom and Nika Marx if only for a few scenes.<br/><br/>Overall the movie felt bland, it did not register with me on any emotional level. As a gangster flick it did not glorify the gangster lifestyle that the whole Dillinger posse indulged in, like in Blow or Goodfellas or Scarface and the love story was particularly lame, showing Dillinger falling head over heals over a girl he met in a restaurant and then sacrificing life and limb to be with her. If this was really the case with Dillinger in real life he must have really had some psychological issues.<br/><br/>What else should I add? Oh the best part of this movie, the kickass guitar pieces (which reminded me of the Firefly soundtrack), which really jazzed up the scenes they were present in, but these scenes were few and far between and the film would have been way better if they included it more. There was not much background music throughout the movie actually which is what kind of made it feel bland.<br/><br/>If you are a Depp/Bale/Crudup fan then see this movie. If not then don't, save your money and wait until its available out of cinemas. Trust me guys I know movies and this one was just not good. Hell I registered on this website just to write this review to warn you guys.<br/><br/>Dustin's verdict: Don't see."

I cannot believe that this has such a high rating on IMDb and also on many other review sites, etc. Maybe if I were more familiar with the actual case of John Dillinger the movie would've been more interesting from a historic perspective, but then again isn't that the point of the movie itself - to tell the story regarding this case and be entertaining? In short - good cast, actors played their best (till what the script allowed them to do), camera - horrible, soundtrack - misguided (at times there was no theme or anything and just the background noise, which usually is improving realism, but in this case was done very inappropriate like), etc... I do respect Michael Mann's work, producing many great movies, but he might want to stay away from directing."

"lotus_chief","8","1","3","11 July 2009"," Good film. Another success for Mann; Depp is an amazing actor
","Just saw this today; as I was pretty eager to see it. Michael Mann directing, and Johnny Depp, one of the great actors of today, in the leading role. The length didn't bother me, as I was engrossed in the film throughout. The acting all around I thought was very good, and there isn't enough I could say about Michael Mann's direction. Ever since Heat and The Insider, I've become a big fan of his; and he doesn't disappoint here. The HD shots are pretty amazing, and he wows us again with his mastery of shootout scenes.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp..boy has he grown on me the last few years. What a great talent he is; I can say with great confidence that he is one of the finest actors of our time. When I saw how much of a fan I was of his performance in the first Pirates of the Caribbean, (and that's saying a helluva lot), that made me realize just how talented he is; and boy does he give a great performance here. I couldn't see anyone else play this role with the same subtlety, confidence and sheer excellence as Depp. After seeing the poster for this film; with his sly grin holding the Tommy Gun, I just knew I was gonna be in for a treat seeing him in action, and he definitely didn't disappoint. He was just perfect in the role. Christian Bale was very good as well; more voice manipulation from him. He was very convincing and a good balance for Depp. Another great talent. The leading lady was very good as well; she has a innocent sexiness about her, and it worked very well. The film took a little while to really get going, but once it did, it was relentless. Another point on the shootout scenes; there's something about the way Mann does them that's just incredible. The lack of music, and the sheer deadliness of the sounds of the weapons make it seem so real.Mann executed them perfectly yet again.<br/><br/>The few reviews I read for Public Enemies before watching it for myself complained that they (the critics) didn't learn who John Dillinger really was. Well, I can live with that. This wasn't exactly painted as a biopic like, for example, Ali or Ray. Seeing Michael Mann's name attached to this made it obvious to me that it was gonna be a crime saga picture, a la Heat & Collateral. The sugar on top was that its the story of John Dillinger's last days as the infamous hardened criminal. For what the film WAS, I can appreciate it and enjoyed it. Its a snapshot in time of a person's life. Simple. It seems like the critics wanted more preaching, or to do deep into Dillinger's psyche and motives. My question is: because you DIDN'T get that makes Public Enemies a bad film? I totally disagree. Michael Mann is one of the best directors out there today, and has achieved success yet again with his latest offering. The fact that he didn't delve more into Dillinger's life, what made him who he was and what made him tick has not (and should not) have any negative impact on the work of art that he's given us. And that's exactly what it is.a work of art."
"PhillipmarlowePE","4","1","3","9 July 2009"," Disappointmet
","I want to love Public Enemies and Johnny Depp as Dillinger but Michael Mann refuses to allow me such pleasures. His ""style"" of hand held film-making does not work here. It is a clash of genres. Unlike ""The Untouchables"" by DePalma. Classy, elegant film-making even with a David Mamet script that was overly simplistic at times. ""Just like a wop to bring a knife to a gun fight"" while we knew Sean Connery was going to get blown away it still made me feel for the guy. This film makes me feel noting for Depp or Bale. In fact, it makes me angry at both characters for being semi-idiotic. And on top of it is the full on hand held photography combined with the rock and roll score. It just doesn't make sense. Depp had the chance to get his Oscar here but Mann blew it. His ego must drive him to be felt in every frame. ""Hey, here I am, I am the director"". ""Look at me!!!!"" It's a shame. F you Michael Mann. You are lucky you've come this far. Go to church and thank God you still work."
"cutmaclass","5","1","3","6 July 2009"," Good Intentions, Unrealised
","The first most notable failing of Public Enemies is in the fact that it isn't engaging as a period piece. We're brought with Depp from an Indiana Penitentiary, to a safe-house outside of Chicago, then to a night-club where we meet the hastily-introduced character of Billie Frechette (Cotillard). There are no connecting scenes, no pauses given for the audience to take in a world that doesn't exist solely in the head of the director. Here, Michael Mann's knocking on our door, pleading with us to believe that we're in 1930's Chicago, and skeptical movie-goers will generally not buy. Fortunately for Mann, half-way through the movie, an investment into the world will reveal itself to be a good one. It's just unfortunate that such a basic element is neglected from the get-go, implying that there was a lack of time or thought given to the film by its creators, who amateurishly gave an A-list movie a goofy and awkward C-list first impression.<br/><br/>Further holding the movie back is the fact that it was shot in HD Digital Video. While there have been period pieces - parts of Fincher's Benjamin Button, for example - to benefit from the advent of digital video, Mann certainly ignored them when searching for his inspiration. The biggest offense here lies not in the digital video itself (the clarity of which further removes some of the believability of the period), but rather with the hand-held camera-work, which leaves the camera shaking in parts that would benefit from the added drama of a still camera. It's as if Michael Mann liked the hand-held effect so much in filming action segments that he decided to just do the whole thing that way. I believe Mann's intention was - and I'm paraphrasing here - ""to make it like you're in the room with the characters."" On the contrary, I felt more like I was in a room with big-budget actors and a cramped film crew, removing me even further from the already-flawed sense of genuineness. Also at fault here is the indoors and night-scene lighting; if this movie were shot in black and white, every office scene would be completely white and every night scene would be completely black. There was some definite haphazardness in this regard.<br/><br/>The movie's saving grace is its final half, in which the film is simultaneously much broader in setting and much tighter in narrative. However, it is important to note that this is relative. Once you've finally gotten over the fidgety camera-work and stared at the screen long enough to believe it, you'll find that the acting and writing - though certainly not terrible - are thoroughly unremarkable. One gets the sense that there are, in fact, real characters hiding behind the facades on screen, but the film can never take an adequate break from bank robberies or ambushes to flesh out the tortured mind of Melvin Purvis (which the movie simply rubs in our faces at the end, explaining that he ended up killing himself twenty-five years later). Oddly enough, the film is longer than average, even without necessary character or setting development, leaving me questioning exactly how the movie was seen as a viable screen story before Depp or Cotillard were attached.<br/><br/>Public Enemies is a solid story, made worse by the disappointing use of A-list actors, a well-known director, and all the bad decisions that they made together. One of my key tools in judging a movie is asking myself, ""Would it be better if it were remade by a different director and crew?"" As far as Public Enemies is concerned, the answer is yes. Ultimately, the concept was lucky to be green-lighted by Hollywood, and it really deserved to be treated by a film-maker and cast who cared more about it than the crew who ended up at its helm. A shot and a miss."

","Well, after the disappointment of Miami Vice I had high hopes for a rebound. After all, Michael Mann made a legendary and stylish cops and robbers movie in Heat, and Johnny Depp and Christian Bale should at a minimum provide an entertaining night at the movies.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Public Enemies fails to deliver. I was pretty much in the same neutral emotional state from the first frame to the last. What's missing is detail which would make anything you're seeing interesting. Period detail, plot detail, historic detail, even actual image detail. All are absent. (You are given WAY too much pore detail, though, due to the movie's continuous, annoying use of close-ups -- again detracting from any perspective.) Rather, the whole movie feels like a big, slow montage.<br/><br/>You're never given enough historical context to understand the meaning of John Dillinger in American society, or why we might care; you never get a sense of how long his crime spree lasted; his bank jobs aren't laid out with any specifics; there's no genuine sense of smart cat and mouse. On the other side, you never get a strong sense of FBI methodology, what motivates Purvis, or anything that differentiates any of the supporting characters from any others. Or what it is that Dillinger's lady loves in him. There's just no...detail.<br/><br/>Also, fairly shockingly for a Michael Mann film, it looks terrible, especially the nighttime sequences, which look taped, like an episode of COPS. I don't know how an aesthete like Mann could be satisfied with it, but as a moviegoer, I wasn't.<br/><br/>The movie was also marred by an overbearing, repetitious, near-constant score. No, really. It never lets up -- a clue that what's happening on screen isn't moving enough on its own.<br/><br/>The good news is that despite being given so little to work with, Johnny Depp is credible and enjoyable. Christian Bale was fine too.<br/><br/>Public Enemies wasn't as bad as Miami Vice, but like that movie, characters and topics are presented as though you should be interested and believe in them by default, not because they earn your interest and belief. Like they did in Heat.<br/><br/>In sum, I don't know how you can make a movie about a legendary bank robber and fail to make it exciting. But that's exactly what Michael Mann has done here. Bummer."
"screamingfoot","6","1","3","5 July 2009"," What happened to good cinematography?
","I've been a huge fan of Mann's since Miami Vice and Spinotti is one of my favorite DPs.<br/><br/>That said, I find myself struggling to understand the aesthetic for the cinematography of this film. It's underlit, with a lot of pure black dominating the frame in almost every scene. Night exteriors are severely underlit and even night interiors lack detail in shadow areas to the degree that it just looks like a mistake.<br/><br/>The hand held camera work is shaky, but not shaky in a good way. Many closeups and medium shots of people delivering dialog have sudden spastic shakes and just are generally awkward. I'm a huge proponent of hand held shooting and thought The Constant Gardner was a very good example of this style of shooting while this film had a lot of ugly camera work in general that I would never expect to see in a big budget studio film.<br/><br/>The overall ""look"" of the film with its TV news-video feel was off putting and made me feel (constantly) like I was watching a low budget film shot on some old analog video camera. When I take the time and spend 10 bucks to see a movie in the theater, I want it to LOOK like a movie, not a student film. <br/><br/>The skin tones were hideous, looked very harsh, and screamed VIDEO every time I saw a closeup of an actor. <br/><br/>Did Mann and Spinotti spend only 1/10 of their lighting budget and pocket the rest?<br/><br/>Are Mann and Spinotti ""breaking new ground"" with a brave new gritty approach?<br/><br/>I just don't know."

","Liked this movie a lot. I always enjoy Johnny Depp in his roles, specially when he is playing in such mafia/action movies which have some love and feelings in them. Might say that the ending was little bit predictable but its only because the story of John Dillinger is well-known. For me personally the action part or the shooting part was a bit too long, I prefer that such things are not so much shown in the movies but given to watchers some other way. Marion Cotillard has always been my favourite and can't imagine anyone else playing better this role."
"Desertman84","10","1","4","3 October 2012"," A Must-See John Dillinger Movie
","Based on author Bryan Burrough's ambitious tome Public Enemies: America's Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI, 1933-43, director Michael Mann's sprawling historical crime drama,Public Enemies follows the efforts of top FBI agent Melvin Purvis in capturing notorious bank robber John Dillinger.It stars Johnny Depp and Christian Bale together Marion Cotillard, Billy Crudup, Stephen Dorff, Stephen Lang, Jason Clarke, Stephen Graham, Rory Cochrane, Branka Katic, Channing Tatum, Giovanni Ribisi and Shawn Hatosy. Set during the Great Depression, the film chronicles the final years of the notorious bank robber John Dillinger as he is pursued by Federal Bureau of Investigation agent Melvin Purvis, and his relationship with Billie Frechette, as well as Purvis' pursuit of Dillinger associates and fellow criminals Homer Van Meter and Baby Face Nelson Also,it was written by Mann, Ronan Bennett and Ann Biderman.<br/><br/>A folk hero to the American public thanks to his penchant for robbing the banks that many people believed responsible for the Great Depression, charming bandit Dillinger was virtually unstoppable at the height of his criminal career; no jail could hold him, and his exploits endeared him to the common people while making headlines across the country. J. Edgar Hoover's FBI was just coming into formation, and what better way for the ambitious lawman to transform his fledgling Bureau of Investigation into a national police force than to capture the gang that always gets away? Determined to bust Dillinger and his crew, which also included sociopath Baby Face Nelson and Alvin Karpis, Hoover christened Dillinger the country's very first Public Enemy Number One, and unleashed Purvis to take them down by whatever means necessary. But Purvis underestimated Dillinger's ingenuity as a master criminal, and after embarking on a frantic series of chases and shoot-outs, the dashing agent humbly surmised that he was in over his head. Outwitted and outgunned, Purvis knew that his only hope for busting Dillinger's gang was to baptize a crew of Western ex-lawmen as official agents, and orchestrate a series of betrayals so cunning that even America's criminal mastermind wouldn't know what hit him.<br/><br/>This is a film worth seeing as it adheres to the historical facts of Dillinger's well-documented tapestry of brazen daylight heists, gritty shootouts and improbable jailbreaks.It was a thoroughly detailed and engaging crime epic, which traces the criminal exploits and pursuit of infamous gangster.It is a competent and technically impressive gangster flick with charismatic lead performances especially from Johnny Depp and Christian Bale.Although Mann wasn't able to recapture the greatness of Heat,this remains a must-see."
"sadgwebbregister","2","1","4","24 July 2009"," Mann is loosing his touch
","Mann seems to be working backwards from Thief instead of improving over the years.<br/><br/>Public Enemy seems like a remake of many of other Michael Mann movies, and is so full of Mann standards that he seems to work off of a checklist of things his movies must include instead of a script. Must all Mann films include the scene where the ""Good Guy"" and ""Bad Guy"" tell each other they respect each other, but will kill each other if they have to, a scene where the 'good' bad guys kill/threaten to kill the bad guys that don't follow some code, a scene where the cops run out of the room after hearing of a tip on where the bad guys are going to be next, the huge shootout and getaway of the main bag guy so that he later has a more intimate death? <br/><br/>Why must Mann, who made the peerless ""Thief,"" insist on using video tape to make movies? The interspersed scenes stand out and look like they were shot on VHS. This really looks bad and is utterly distracting in a period piece. Why would any part of a movie taking place in 1933 look like something shot on a camcorder instead of film? It was SOOOOO distracting.<br/><br/>Also distracting were a weak scripts such as when Bale's character allows torture at one stage and then later, as a plot device, discourages it. Is he Hoover's toady or not? Either the screen writers or Mann decide to leave this unresolved, even though it's a key part of the plot until the last quarter of the movie.<br/><br/>I couldn't enjoy the acting and wide variety of characters due to the ridiculous use of video over film. It's like Star Wars Prequels... Mann and Lucas seem to have surrounded themselves with yes men instead of producers who wanted to make good movies."

I was bored through the entire film. The characters were very poorly developed for a 2.5 hr film. Maybe I'm being to critical, but I think Michael Mann crash and burned on this one.

Watching the movie was like running through a forest the only thing you see is a flash of objects as you pass. Stephen Graham (Baby Face Nelson) was awesome also just a great character you love to hate a very convincing role.

"gregeichelberger","6","1","4","4 July 2009"," Despite inaccuracies, 'Enemies' is a decent film
","As both a film critic and a student of history, I always find myself watching movies a bit keener when the subject matter is based on ""a true story."" And the newest Universal effort, ""Public Enemies,"" directed by Michael Mann (""Collateral,"" ""Miami Vice""), is certainly supposed to be based on facts - of some sort.<br/><br/>And while the layman on the street may not know the condition of crime in the early 1930s, I'd like to think that - thanks to some intense reading and studying - I do.<br/><br/>The film, starring a great cast including Oscar nominee Johnny Depp, Oscar winner Marion Cotillard (""En Vie La Rose""), Christian ""Dark Knight"" Bale and Billy Cruddup (""Big Fish""), among others, tells the last year of the life of notorious Midwest bandit/murderer/bank robber John Dillinger, the nation's first Public Enemy No.1.<br/><br/>Unlike the 1975 made-for-TV movie, ""Melvin Purvis, G-Man,"" where Warren Oates played him more psychotic and gregarious, Depp's Dillinger is more brooding and introspective. There's a brief explanation of his hatred of the law (""I held up a grocery store in Mooresville, Indiana, and got 10 years for a $50 dollar take,"" he says to reporters).<br/><br/>That's the first inaccuracy. In reality, he and a partner clubbed the store's owner with a lead pipe and got away with $550.<br/><br/>Anyway, the picture opens with Dillinger and members of his gang, including Homer Van Meter (Stephen Dorff), John Hamilton (Jason Clarke) and Harry Pierpont (David Wenham), breaking out of the Indiana State Penitentary at Michigan City and then robbing a series of banks in Chicago.<br/><br/>Dillinger meets and falls in love with Billie Frenchetti (her real name was Evelyn, but I won't quibble here), a hat check girl of dubious repute played by the lovely Cotillard. The chemistry between the two is very strong and the love feels genuine, but I couldn't wait for their loves scenes to end so we could get back to the film.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover (a very fine performance by Cruddup) installs Agent Melvin Purvis (Bale) as the new Chicago bureau chief, mainly based on the fact that Purvis has just killed Charles ""Pretty Boy"" Floyd. The only problem here is that Floyd was killed on Oct. 21, 1934, almost four months AFTER Dillinger died and it wasn't just Purvis who felled him but several East Liverpool, Ohio police officers, as well. <br/><br/>Dillinger is arrested and imprisoned in the Crown Pointe, Indiana jail run by a woman, Sheriff Lillian Holley, who claims it's the ""strongest"" gaol in the state. it isn't and Dillinger adds to his legend and promptly escapes using a wooden gun. He robs more banks, but the feds are following his every move. Still, Purvis and his agents make mistakes which allow him to escape over and over again.<br/><br/>At the Little Bohemia resort in Wisconsin, FBI men seemingly have him trapped again, but instead the G-men kill a couple innocent guys and Dillinger gets away yet again. In this sequence, the agents do kill Van Meter and George ""Baby Face"" Nelson (Stephen Graham), but once again, the chronology here is off. Van Meter was killed in St. Paul, Minnesota a full month AFTER Dillinger, while Nelson was shot by two agents (whom he managed to kill himself) in the outskirts of Chicago on Nov. 28, 1934.<br/><br/>There is also a sequence where Dillinger walks into a Chicago police station and visits the ""Dillinger Patrol"" office, snooping around and even conversing with some of the officers there before walking out. Whether this really happened or not is speculative, but it seems pretty far-fetched to me.<br/><br/>While this was quite irritating at times, I nevertheless managed to put these rather huge mistakes in the timeline out of my mind because the acting, direction, period costumes and set designs were so well done. Depp, Cruddup and Cotillard really shine here, and there is no doubt one or more of these will be nominated for some kind of award later on.<br/><br/>The final scenes leading to Dillinger's death (and I'll issue a slight spoiler alert even though most people know that he did indeed die) at the Biograph Picture Show in Chicago are riveting, however, and have a slight ""Godfather,"" ""Untouchables"" vibe.<br/><br/>Another admirable effort was the work on the soundtrack, which even though feature some modern artists doing 1930s tunes, had some Billie Holliday to make things better. And, with 10 Best Picture nominations instead of five, look for ""Public Enemies"" to get a nod, as well.<br/><br/>Despite some flaws (aside from the ones I mentioned), this is still a noteworthy picture for several reasons. It's a period piece that will appeal the the public, not unlike ""Bonnie & Clyde,"" ""Chinatown"" and ""Untouchables"" (although it is nowhere near as great as those pictures), and it may interest younger film fans to read up and research these so-called ""true"" stories.<br/><br/>And that cannot hurt at all."

","""Public Enemies"" is what I would call ""a typtical Hollywood film."" Typical in that it glorifies the criminal and makes the cops out to be mean and vicious.<br/><br/>Like Mann's ""Heat"", we supposed to feel sympathy for the criminal because he can't be with the women he loves Kilmer/Judd and Depp/Cotillard,, who by the way, in my humble opinion is average lucking and nothing to write home about look wise. Well, let me tell you, here's a good way to assure that you spend the rest of your life with the person you love, ""don't commit a crime."" After seeing this film, a friend of mine said that Dillinger is ""only"" credited with filling four four people. Well, I think the friends, relatives, and children of those ""four"" people wouldn't think Dillinger a saint. And what about the other people that Dillinger may not have killed but were killed by others during one of his ""fold-ups""? Today, Dillinger would be just as responsible as the person who pulled the trigger. However, according to Mann, we're supposed to feel empathy for a a criminal who kills, robs, shoots, and, well, is not the kind of guy you bring home to granny for dinner. Let's stop glorying the criminal and stop villianize the cops and maybe, just maybe, the world would be a better place.<br/><br/>On the technical side, TOO many close-ups, Bale is flat and could have been portrayed by any level of actor, in some case better, and Depp and the other actors are good.<br/><br/>Want to restore sanity to the world? Stop making the bad guys good and good guys bad and revert to the truth. Dillinger would kill you at the drop of hat if you got in his way, the police will risk their life's to save you. FYI, Michael."

Michael Mann is truly at his peak and Public Enemies proves to be his best piece of cinematic brilliance yet. shot in glorious HD, Mann brings a new inspiration to his already hugely bold status as one of the best crime drama director's working today. Running in the same streak and coollness as past gangster epic's such as Scarface or The Godfather, Public Enemies roar's through it's long running time of two and a half hours without letting up the pace or action.<br/><br/>If Depp doesn't even get nominated for his brutal as well as charming character as John Dillinger i will be mad.

"SmithWrite","3","1","5","6 July 2009"," Other than Johnny and Marion, a complete mess
","I had great hopes for this one because I'm a huge Johnny Depp fan. But within just a few minutes, I was wondering if I was going to make it through the movie considering that the bobbling camera made it seem more related to ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""Cloverfield"" than its trailer, which promised a Michael Mann experience (clean visuals, good shots). Most of the time, it seemed the film was shot by a Dillinger gang groupie doing a ""YouTube"" piece with badly framed shots, shots from over people's shoulders, and shots made with the camera moving so weirdly that it was difficult to know what the viewer should focus on. Combine that with poor sound, and just figuring out what was going on became a challenge.<br/><br/>In addition, although I understand some artistic license can be granted in terms of historical accuracy, this one went out of its way to confuse the time line (especially as regards to what happened to gangsters other than Dillinger).<br/><br/>Overall, the film lacked focus. If it was about public enemies in general, than why the concentration on Dillinger to the point that other gangsters seemed like bit players? If it was about the clash between Dillinger and Purvis, why not give Christian Bale more to work with regarding character and motivation than simply looking stony-faced? If it was about the role of the FBI and how it changed during the era, then why not fully develop that theme instead of having just a couple of throwaway scenes? Instead the much-too-long running time was spent on things ""relevant"" for the times (i.e., is torturing a legitimate interrogation technique?).<br/><br/>I give kudos to Johnny Depp and Marion Cotillard for making the most of what they had to work with and pulling off some very watchable scenes. But next time, perhaps the director should concentrate on making a really good Michael Mann movie instead of a movie that seemed to be deliberately breaking every rule that usually characterizes a Michael Mann film."

","I have been waiting weeks for this movie to come out, finally seeing it last night. It did not live up to my hopes at all.<br/><br/>The characters are one dimensional. We never get any insight into what motivates Dillinger and his crew, apart from money. The supporting cast has little material with which to distinguish themselves - all the members of Dillinger's gang are basically interchangeable men with guns. One highlight is the character of Billie - she draws a lot of sympathy and the audience can feel her desire to get her and John away from this lifestyle.<br/><br/>Aside from a brief mention in the opening titles, the suffocating poverty of the great depression is never seen. The depression provided the context for these outlaws and why the public embraced them as folk heroes, leaving it out of this film is a serious oversight.<br/><br/>**SPOILERS BELOW** <br/><br/>Another big problem are the historical inaccuracies, which - if more true to the source material, would have enhanced this movie greatly.<br/><br/>Dillinger's breakout from the Indiana jail is well-paced and a great scene in the film, but Mann neglected to reveal the greatest real life detail of all - the ""gun"" John used to take his initial hostages was made of wood.<br/><br/>In reality, the shootout at Little Bohemia was brief, and all the gangsters successfully escaped. It was a huge embarrassment for the FBI, who lost one of their agents and killed several innocent civilians and Purvis nearly resigned because of the fallout.<br/><br/>There is plenty of material in Dillinger's life from which a fantastic movie can be made. Regrettably, this is not that movie."

","I saw this at a midnight showing with some friends. It's a good movie but could have been so much better. The main complaint is that Christian Bale's character for how much screen time is given isn't that interesting.He's very one dimensional where we only see one side of him. It isn't Bale's fault that he wasn't given much to work with on the character. Comparing this to Michael Mann's classic ""Heat"" where he focuses on the criminals and the cops chasing them. This feels very weak where Al Pacino was shown in different lights from father and husband to a dedicated detective. Christian Bale's character could have been any generic cop and given far too much screen time for someone with no personality.<br/><br/>A lot has been made about the digital HD camera used in filming. It is hit or miss throughout the film. Sometimes it looks great especially during some of the daytime scenes. Than sometimes during a few of the nighttime shootouts you'll think your watching a re-enactment on TV than a movie. Also at first what I thought was problems with the theater's sound system I saw it at, it seems that it wasn't just mine where during a few scenes it seems like the character's dialogue is cut off or too quiet. <br/><br/>Still this film is still a solid effort with Johnny Depp doing a good job as the charismatic Dillinger to what Michael Mann does best which is crazy shootouts. The film has some memorable scenes but the film as a whole is in the category of not being bad but at the same time will be forgotten a few months from now. So overall good but clearly it was trying to be ""Heat"" in the 1930's and it just didn't pull it off as well."
"Quinoa1984","6","1","8","1 July 2009"," ""What else do you need to know?""
","This is one of those rare cases where a director actually gets in the way of his own best intentions. Michael Mann is a smart director, sometimes so smart that one can see other movies pale in comparison to his distinctive voice and style. But he's also gone the way of David Lynch and Robert Rodriguez, shunning celluloid for digital video (you can say HD but you can't fool me, it's *digital* and it's *video*) no matter what the project may entail. His run in the new medium, this time DoP'd by a former Mann collaborator (previously amazing work in The Insider), started promisingly enough with Collateral, then he took a decent detour with Miami Vice, and now we come to this, a period piece shot and edited with an equal amount of professionalism and amateurish-ness that is hard for the mind to boggle with.<br/><br/>Maybe there will be a lot in the audience that won't notice it. And yet for every scene here or there that is brilliantly shot, or a scene where the drama becomes intense and everything gels, there are many scenes that feel rushed, with some compositions way too over-exposed or just looking, well, like a video as opposed to some blockbuster gangster picture. And maybe it's partly my fault for ""not getting it"", so to speak, that this is the way that movies will go into. But where-as Lynch's use of DV is like out of a surrealist's laboratory, and Rodriguez provides a clear sense of visual effects, Mann's skills as a director of drama and action seem amiss from the looks of Public Enemies. Too often I found myself being pulled out of the narrative, however loose it sometimes was, with digital 'noise' and uneven lighting got in the way (i.e unnecessary sound and bits of information that HD picks up naturally).<br/><br/>But hey, what am I doing going on about all this technical stuff. The question really is this: is Public Enemies worth seeing? Yes and no. No for the technical reasons I mentioned, not to mention some scenes going on for a little too long (it's appropriately epic at 2 1/2 hours) and for some lack of character psychology or development save for Dillinger and possibly Cotillard's Billie. Yes because it is an enveloping bank robber saga more often than not, and it features more than a few pieces of really terrific acting. Some criticism has fallen the film for there not being enough narrative 'focus', but on its quasi-conventional terms in the scope of the gangster movie, there is a compelling story in there, somewhere.<br/><br/>And Johnny Depp - he's so on here that it's hard to see him when he's 'off' really, and he makes this Dillinger a striking force, charismatic and suave, with that glint of danger always there, and a certain devilishness that he makes this real-life ""folk-hero"" his own (my favorite of this kind of quality Depp brings comes when Dilinger sneaks into the HQ of the Dilinger-Manhunt station and nobody recognizes him). In a way Depp helps to project a similar slick panache the film carries, and between him and a couple of exciting/incredibly bloody shoot-outs, it is at least a curious viewing to see him. Bale, too has his moments, if a little more straightforward in the two-dimensional Melvin Purvis. Big points also go to a great caricature of a 30's figure of J Edgar Hoover by Billy Crudup. And, lastly, Cotillard in her first big Hollywood starring role following her Oscar win is impressive, if only in the last few reels when the intensity builds on her vs. Dillinger vs. the FBI.<br/><br/>So what is Public Enemies? It's not a return to form nor a total embarrassment. It's got the fabric and texture of the 30s, the costumes, the sets, the locations, the cars down very well and the look of the film, crystal clear and muddy in a single scene, contradicts this. It's got a purpose, but its soul is contaminated in an odd way. Mann can be commended for giving a try at taking his digital technology in a ""period"" piece, but at the end of it all, when the final line it uttered, the results are 50/50 at best."

His filmography is focused on ""stories pitting criminals against those who seek to put them behind bars"" which I previously watched and enjoyed in Heat starring Pacino and DeNiro.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp blended well into the character of John Dillinger a notorious and charismatic bank robber.

"tabuno","8","0","1","20 January 2019"," Compelling and Gripping But With Weaknesses
","12 July 2009. Until the very end, this movie had enough technical weaknesses to become a disappointment in terms of how great this movie could have been. Yet, it delivered enough to make this a quality period police drama. Michael Mann who directed MANHUNTER (1986) starring William Petersen in a CSI movie predecessor delivered the sharp, colorful, and even more grit. But the series of technical oversights had the potential to drag this movie down. (1) African music near the beginning of the movie seemed at odds with the American time period. (2) The shaky photography at times during the first third of the movie where the characters are seem bouncing up and down, out of focus was distracting and distancing. (3) The were a number of shots during the first third of the movie where the characters are heard but not seen talking which almost felt like they could have been dubbed. (4) There relational development between Dillinger and Billie didn't quite seem to have sufficient screen time to really cement the relationship. (5) The introduction of a new FBI agent from another office later in the movie was underdeveloped (who seemed like an early form of FBI profiler). (6) The high tech FBI gadgetry didn't seem to provide a direct connection with the sudden second arrest of the Dillinger. (7) The interplay between Christian Bale and Johnny Depp was never really given a strong emphasis like HEAT (1995). (8) The night time raid was also awfully artificial with an impossibly bright lighting set scheme which might have been much for successfully darkened (as in a horror genre) to heighten the fear element. (9) The interrogation of the severely injured cohort and his subsequent disposition (whether he lived or died) was left too unclear. (10) Billie's interrogation scene left out the physical humiliation shot that would have provided an even more outrageous emotional reaction. (11) The actual demise of Dillinger in the movie was surprisingly confusing and awkwardly shot.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the whole tone of the movie, the strong underplayed performance of Johnny Depp kept a strong, underlying sense of heightened tension throughout the movie. The shot fights were actually even more compelling that the blockbuster, extravaganza, special effects driven TRANSFORMERS: THE REVENGE OF THE FALLEN (2009) in which the sound effects and the you are there realism was potent and riveting. Emotional and intimately intense with excellent physical action, this movie is one of the strongest of the year. 8/10."
"classicsoncall","7","0","1","4 October 2018"," ""I'm John Dillinger. I rob banks.""
","In 1973, American International Pictures (AIP) released ""Dillinger"", with Warren Oates in the title role and Ben Johnson as FBI Agent Melvin Purvis. The rest of the cast included Harry Dean Stanton, Geoffrey Lewis, and Richard Dreyfuss, with Michelle Phillips as Billie Frechette and Cloris Leachman in the role of Anna Sage. Wouldn't it have been great I thought, if those actors were available for a modern day telling of the Dillinger story. I guess I'm partial to an earlier era in film making; there was nothing wrong with Johnny Depp and Christian Bale, it's just that I felt there was something missing to this story of some of the most infamous gangsters of the 1930's. <br/><br/>I did key in on one of the comments made by John Dillinger (Depp) to his new girlfriend Billie (Marion Cotillard), that being people making judgments about others depending on where they came from instead of where they were going. That was kind of insightful and a good heads up on where Dillinger's time and bank robbing talent was going to take him. One of the things that made Dillinger a hero of sorts, was how he let bank customers keep their own money, a trait that was also honored decades earlier by outlaw Jesse James. Cut from the same cloth, Dillinger targeted banker fat cats that he pursued with confidence and not a little arrogance.<br/><br/>As a fan of gangster dramas, I was happy to catch a nod to James Cagney, who helped initiate the popularity of the crime genre in film with 1931's ""The Public Enemy"". And since I haven't seen it yet, I'm inspired to look up the 1934 film ""Manhattan Melodrama"" that Dillinger took in at the Biograph right before Purvis's boys took him out for good. I don't pretend to find it credible that a hard case like Charles Winstead (Stephen Lang) would have delivered that 'Bye, Bye Blackbird' message to Billie Frechette, but it made for a bit of melodrama in it's own right.<br/><br/>Probably what struck me more than anything in this picture was seeing Johnny Depp in a role where he wasn't wearing a pirate outfit, Indian war paint or a pair of Scissorhands. I guess I'm just not used to seeing him in a 'normal' role, as if there was anything even remotely normal about a Public Enemy Number One."

"ryanmcdonald1682","7","0","1","11 October 2016"," Entertaining and fun, but short of deep and moving.
","If anything can be said about Michael Mann's Public Enemies, is that it is hardly a sensationalized version of John Dillinger's life. Depp plays Dillinger as having a good time robbing banks and breaking people out of prison, but the film itself doesn't portray these acts of crime and violence as fun, daring, or morally acceptable. Depp's character never stops to celebrate his victories or dance in glory. Unlike The Godfather or Goodfellas, where the audience is rooting for the criminals the entire time, Public Enemies does not take the same stance. Instead the movie portrays the tragedy of a man who has no other vice then to rob banks and the consequences of those actions.<br/><br/>Christian Bale plays, Merlvin Purvis, a newly appointed FBI agent assigned to hunt down American's number one public enemy, John Dillinger. Again, the film does not try to glorify the hay days of the 1930 and the fun and excitement one might get from day to day gun battles in the street. Purvis is a torched character, who seems to long for something besides massacring criminals on the street, in a sense he feels genuinely afraid of Dillinger – or afraid of failing to arrest him.<br/><br/>Like Mann's film Heat, this has a dramatic narrative and laced in between are hard hitting, and terrifying at times, gun battles. Where in other films, characters might be dodging bullet left and right, here Mann creates greats tension in the feeling that anyone of us might get shot. Many of the angles from the gun battles are looking down the barrel of a Tommy gun – like a third person shooter game. Mann does tend to keep the camera a little to close to the action and drama on screen. It would have great to see a few more wide angles. However, the aesthetic of the film is how close and shoulder lever the camera always is in respect to the characters, creating of feeling of being a part of the action or another character in that location.<br/><br/>This film is certainly a great film, with rich characters that probably are best brought to life through Depp and Bale. The only fault to this film, is that narrative it holds it's character entirely at arms length. Unlike Heat or The Insider, where we are drawn into the characters and their psyche, this film never lets us in. If it were not for Depp and Bale, we might even be a few more steps back then we all ready are. The perspective for the audience isn't as an audience member but as an observer who might be there watching them now. Public Enemies does have great acting and a lot of violence. It is entertaining and fun to watch, however Mann who usually puts out A+ material, falls a little short here. But still, Public Enemies is better than many of them films out there today."

"Kings_Requiem","9","0","1","23 March 2015"," Another Epic crime yarn from Mann.
","Michael Mann has done it again. This man is a genius when it comes to the epic crime saga. It started back in 1995 when he released the masterpiece 'Heat' which blew the world away with it's amazing acting and fantastic memorable shootouts. Then in 2004 he stuck with crime in L.A. and came out with 'Collateral' which again featured great acting and some memorable action sequences. He was back at it again in 2006 with the film version of the 80's TV show 'Miami Vice', which admittedly wasn't as good as the previous two, but still had some engaging action scenes. 2009 came along and Mann decided that for his next project he would tackle the story of infamous bank robber John Dillinger and once again doesn't disappoint. <br/><br/>The story opens in 1933 with John Dillinger (played by Johnny Depp) and his crew breaking out of prison in Indiana. So right off the bat Michael Mann is showing off his skills as a director by staging this prison break and including a mini shootout between the gang and the prison guards. This film is a true team effort though. Not only is the director at the top of his game, but the actors are all uniformly excellent. Johnny Depp completely absorbs the role of Dillinger and literally becomes him. Depp has always been one of the greatest character actors and once again can do no wrong. Christian Bale plays the role of FBI agent Melvin Purvis and is also quite good. Bale has become the go-to- man for movies over the past few years. Batman, Terminator, 3:10 to Yuma, and many more on his resume. Leading or Supporting, it doesn't matter, Bale can handle any role and in this film he becomes Depp's equal as the two go back and forth throughout. Dillinger toys with Purvis by narrowly escaping him a few times before being caught which sets up a fictitious showdown between the two at a prison. Though the scene isn't nearly as good, it does have a lot of similarity to the now infamous coffee shop scene from 'Heat'. Just to see Dillinger and Purvis go back and forth even for just two minutes was really something to behold. <br/><br/>The supporting actors in this film play small yet important roles. Stephen Dorff, Giovanni Ribisi, Marion Cotillard, Stephen Lang, & Billy Crudup. Dorff and Ribisi play members of Dillinger's gang, Crudup is very good as FBI head honcho J. Edgar Hoover, & Cotillard is pretty good also as Dillinger's love Billie Frechette. Actors of such caliber as Johnny Depp and Marion Cotillard really bring out the emotion in their characters and make us as the audience feel for them and even though this is a true story and we know how it ends, we still kinda wish they end up together. Stephen Lang's character ends up being the one that fires the fatal shot that finishes off Dillinger as he was walking out of a movie at the Biograph Theater in Chicago. <br/><br/>In the end it all comes back to Michael Mann, who almost perfectly crafts the story of John Dillinger in a way that blended fact and fiction quite seamlessly. While it did have a few historical inaccuracies; that doesn't take anything away from the achievement of Mann and the actors. They all do the story justice and really transport us into the world of the Chicago area during the depression era of the 1930's. 'Public Enemies' doesn't quite reach the heights of Mann's masterpieces 'Heat' and 'The Insider', but that doesn't stop him from staging huge shootouts that try to rival the ones seen in 'Heat'. And this does continue to show that Michael Mann is a cinematic genius when it comes to the epic crime saga and I can't wait to see which crime world he decides to tackle next."

It is very pleasant for the spectator who is at the same time touched by these scenes but at the same time under pressure because of the action. Nevertheless, I would have liked to know a little bit more about the context of the story, and more precisely about the characters.

","Unlike many other gangster movies Depp's Dillinger isn't one-dimensional and hardened to the core. He just refuses to comply to the fact that he is from poor circumstances and therefore has to accept to be a persona non grata in the playgrounds of the rich. Depp does a superb job in putting these emotions across and makes his Dillinger funny and likable, as well as violent and dangerous. He dresses sharp and regards his time on earth as a game.<br/><br/>I would say this movie is about revenge. Or maybe lust for life and rage for the injustices of pre-defined life paths handed to you at birth.<br/><br/>There's also something harder to define that gives this movie a radiance of its own.

He had found and bought the seats and installed them each and every one. Perhaps he had been a bit too enthusiastic, for there were far more seats than they ever would need. But it was the mood that counted. The experience of a 'real' theater, but at home.<br/><br/>Maybe we ought to open the place once in a while for the public or invite guests? I could even ask a little bit of money, just to cover the expenses. Henry twiddle as hairs on his chin, the hairs were part of his short beard, that covered only his chin, and started planning. The beard had made Kristl burst out in spontaneous laughter. He had just smirked back at her. He was on the ball with current trends and styles - he had just bought a Nexus with 32 Gb- while Kristl was stuck in a past so impossibly backward that they had not even known mobile phones, let alone handhelds. How did they survive! Kristl had proudly announced that she still used her Samsung X620. Which she had shown to him to proof she wasn't making things up. Henry had gasped. Like that was from 2005 or something. With her communism, her pink eighties look and old mobile, Kristl was already a relic of a bygone age. <br/><br/>""Kristl, we're living in the 21st century now.. when are you going to catch up?"" Henry had exclaimed.<br/><br/>""I like collateral. I think it's one of his best movies. With Tom Cruise as that sharp dressed killer. I like that movie,"" Kristl said, ""A role that fits him like a hand does a glove.""<br/><br/>""I missed that a bit in this movie. That Mann thing. As if he isn't able to play work that out in a movie that is not set in the here and now, like most of his movies. ""<br/><br/>""It still has these touches. Like it is hard to see what the difference is between the cops and the robbers in methods and, well, collateral damage,"" Kristl said.<br/><br/>""There is a lot of shooting. Mann likes those choppers. Tatatatatatata.""<br/><br/>""And violence in general. There is even a woman being beaten up. You don't see that much in movies."" ""It was an entertaining movie, with a lot of violence, a small romantic side story, but little else.""<br/><br/>""The strange thing is that the whole story is mostly made up. It's not the real story of John Dillinger.""<br/><br/>""And that is strange?""<br/><br/>""No, it is not strange to divert from history, but usually it is because the 'real' story needs to be turned into a movie, sometimes because it wasn't that interesting or the 'real' story just doesn't fit well into a movie. But the fact is that that the real Dillinger story seem interestingly enough, so why make up your own story? For instance the role of his family is downplayed by this movie, to the point of not being important at all. And the movie suggest he an one important love interest, while he seems to have many loves. Again the question pops up: At what point becomes the 'real' story so distorted that calling it Dillinger seems pointless. I mean, why not make it: a movie based on a true story, instead of suggesting it is the true story?""<br/><br/>""Perhaps because that sells better?"" Henry laughed.<br/><br/>""No doubt. It is the bottom line isn't it?""<br/><br/>""The real test would be the portrayal of the characters involved. Dillinger and his adversary Purvis. Or his love interest Betty. I felt I never got a grasp on them. You never quite got an idea of what they were about.""<br/><br/>""Like in collateral? I mean with only two characters Mann had time to develop them, and given that Fox and Cruise, even Cruise, can act well, the story works. For me."" Kristl said.<br/><br/>""Despite Johnny Depp? If you look at Dillinger in the documentaries you see that he is a good looking man who has kind of charm. A catchy smile. Depp plays him as brooding dark figure. No fun at all. It is a pity he did. And the actor playing Purvis, Dillingers adversary, doesn't make much of that character either.""<br/><br/>""It's a nice movie, the kind you look at to be entertain and then forget, it is not one of Mann's best and has nothing much to add. No doubt there will be a new Dillinger movie as this movie isn't actually a Dillinger movie.""<br/><br/>""Maybe they remake that other movie and call that one Dillinger.. the one with Clark Cable,"" Henry mused.<br/><br/>""You mean Manhattan Melodrama?""<br/><br/>""Now how do you know that?""<br/><br/>""Looked it up. Maybe we should have a look at that one, some day.""<br/><br/>""You mean.. a black and white movie from way back?"" Henry said.<br/><br/>""Yes?""<br/><br/>""No way..Let's wait for a remake.""<br/><br/>""If there will be any.""<br/><br/>""Then we look at something else.""<br/><br/>""Pity, guess that will rule out the Third Man as well,"" Kristl said.<br/><br/>""Well, I make an exception on occasion. Because it's your favorite.""<br/><br/>""Thanks.. you're a sweetie.""<br/><br/>""Uhmm.""<br/><br/>www.meritcoba.com"

","This film is based on the life of the notorious gangster John Dillinger. He was a famous bank robber in the mid-thirties. This period was also called ""America's Golden Age of crime"". His gang robbed four police stations and two dozen banks. He escaped from jail twice.<br/><br/>Like I already said, the story take place in 1933 so the whole movie is in this style. This is the reason why I think it should be in the list of 'Greatest Films of All Time'. They created such a good atmosphere as a result that it seems lifelike. It's like you're dropped in this period. This is mainly due to the perfect choice of music. An example is when in the beginning, suspect John Dillinger arrives in a plane, it's with the song 'Black heart' by Calexico. The feeling that you feel when you listen to that song, describes exactly the circumstances: fear and sinister. Also they have made a great choice of clothes and scenes.<br/><br/>The lead actors are Johnny Depp (John Dillinger), Marion Cotillard (girlfriend of John Dillinger) and Christian Bale (FBI bureau chief). I think nobody else could have done it better. The way Johnny Depp impersonates the person of John Dillinger is really phenomenal! The producer made good decisions about the close-ups of Johnny Depp. His facial expressions make the film more realistic. You can feel and see what he's thinking. <br/><br/>Also the chemistry between him and Christian Bale is very good. Bale is hunting on Johnny Depp and he succeeds almost a few times. But when you see the arrogance between the two, you already know it isn't over yet.. They are playing cat-and-mouse games all the time. It's very nice to see the two acting in the same movie. Of course it's still a Hollywood production so it needs some romance. Because of that, there is the role of John Dillinger's girlfriend, which Marion Cotillard is wonderfully suited. John Dillinger had nothing to lose, except now. The romance becomes one of the most important things in the movie. It is all about his vow to show up for her, to protect her. Against what? Against the danger of being his girl. Will they stay together? Will they survive? You have to see it yourself! One thing that I need to mention is that the movie is well-researched. I already knew a lot about one of the most notorious bank robbers in America. The things they have used in the movie are all correct. Of course it's still a Hollywood production so they add things to make it more attractive. I think Michael Mann (producer) has made a wonderful film again! A beautiful action movie with a golden acting duo : Johnny Depp and Marion Cottilard."

","I was getting rather annoyed that this film had been available to watch for some time and I hadn't got to it yet, because I knew it was based on the true story of infamous criminals, and I was looking forward to see it very much, from director Michael Mann (The Last of the Mohicans, Heat, Collateral). Basically, set in the 1930's, i.e the Depression era, in Chicago, FBI agent Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) is promoted by J. Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup), after killing Charles 'Pretty Boy' Floyd (Channing Tatum), and he is assigned to lead the hunt for notorious bank robber John Dillinger (Johnny Depp), who has been challenging the law with his gang, and is considered Public Enemy #1. During his series of bank robberies Dillinger meets and woos Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard), and even after he reveals his identity she falls for him and they become inseparable, and Purvis leads a failed ambush on the hotel he believes Dillinger is in, Baby Face Nelson (Stephen Graham) kills an agent and escapes with Tommy Carroll (Spencer Garrett). So Purvis asks Hoover to bring in professional men to bring in most wanted criminals, dead or alive, including Texan lawman Charles Winstead (Stephen Lang), the police, after a fire breaking out in Tucson, Arizona at Hotel Congress, arrest Dillinger and his gang, the leader is transferred from Indiana to Lake County Jail in Crown Point by Sheriff Lillian Holley (Lili Taylor), he and his gang do however make their escape with a fake gun, but Frechette is under surveillance, so he cannot see her, and the associates Frank Nitti (Bill Camp) refuse to help. Following a Sioux Falls bank robbery, joining Baby Face Nelson, Dillinger and Carroll being shot, and Carroll having to be left behind, the gang retreat to Manitowish Waters, Wisconsin and the Little Bohemia Lodge, and following low haul he wants to free the rest of his gang, Harry 'Pete' Pierpont (David Wenham) and Charles Makley (Christian Stolte), from prison, but 'Red' Hamilton (Jason Clarke) convinces him it is unlikely he could do so. Carroll is tortured to tell where the gang are hiding, at Little Bohemia, Dillinger and Hamilton separate from the rest of the gang, with Winstead and Clarence Hurt (Don Frye) chasing them through the woods, Hamilton is fatally wounded and later dies, Nelson, Ed Shouse (Michael Vieau), and Homer Van Meter (Stephen Dorff) hijack a car and kill Purvis' partner Agent Carter Baum (Rory Cochrane), they are chased but Purvis manages to kill Nelson and the rest of the men. Dillinger meets up with Frechette and promises her that he will commit a robbery that will pay enough for them get away together, but after she is dropped off she is interrogated and beaten to tell where her love interest, Purvis and Winstead eventually intervene to get the answers, and Dillinger meanwhile is joining Alvin Karpis (Giovanni Ribisi) and the Barker Gang on a train robbery, but he receives the message from Billie that she is in jail, and not to attempt to get her out. Anna Sage (Branka Katic), acquaintance of the criminal, is enlisted by Purvis to set Dillinger up, or be deported, she and Dillinger see a film at the theatre, and afterwards Purvis makes the signal to surround him, he is shot dead after spotting police and before pulling out his weapon, and Winstead hears Dillinger speak his final words, while Purvis goes to inform Hoover he is dead. Frechette is told by Winstead the last words John Dillinger said, he said ""Tell Billie for me, 'Bye bye Blackbird'"", she cries remembering that it was a song that was playing when they first met, the final words on screen inform that Purvis quit the FBI in 1935 and killed himself in 1960, and after release Billie lived the rest of her life in Wisconsin. Also starring John Ortiz as Phil D'Andrea, Emilie De Ravin as Barbara Patzke, Leelee Sobieski as Polly Hamilton, James Russo as Walter Dietrich, Shawn Hatosy as Agent John Madala, Domenick Lombardozzi as Gilbert Catena, Peter Gerety as Louis Piquett, Carey Mulligan as Carol Slayman and Matt Craven as Gerry Campbell. Depp gives a terrific performance as the short-lived but highly notorious and relentless gangster Dillinger, Bale is equally terrific moments as the FBI agent trying to track him for either lawful punishment or death, Cotillard gets scenes of captivating chemistry being the love interest to the wanted man, and many supporting cast members do a great job too. I will confess that I didn't understand all the technical stuff going, some of the dialogue was a little slow compared to the exciting action and gun fight sequences, but the era is captured perfectly, the criminal and law activities are portrayed well, and all in all it is a rather thrilling ride, a most watchable period crime drama. Very good!"

","The producers of this film would like you to think it is a modern version of the Untouchables, but anyone who has seen this film will tell you it's far from it. It's not that Public Enemies was a bad movies, but a lot of people panned it because they expected a lot more from a 100 million dollar movie, starting Johnny Depp and Christian Bale, and they have a point. The story was flawed right from the beginning because the true story behind it really wasn't that interesting. The filmmakers tried to get people to watch it, by saying that Dillinger and Purvis were comparable to Capone and Ness, but that's not true. In reality, they had almost no interaction with each other and in the movie, whenever they were together, all they did was shoot at each other. There wasn't any chemistry between them, because their supposed rivalry was a fictions element added to an otherwise true story. The film should have focused on infamous bank robber, John Dillinger, but instead it focuses on the FBI hunt for him and his life on the run, long after the bulk of his crimes had been committed. Johnny Depp portrays Dillinger in an attempt to go back to being a legitimate actor instead of a Disney puppet, and he fails miserably. This guy can be one hell of actor, when the role fits his personality, but John Dillinger does not. Depp is an emotionless mess of mumbled lines that almost completely destroy the film. Thankfully, Christian Bale was much better and far more interesting. Public Enemies had big expectations, an all-star cast, and a huge budget, but it turned out to be an average film. That's what had people so upset, because had this been an independent film, they would have been okay with it. The fact that Public Enemies was billed as the next Untouchables, but fails to deliver even a single memorable scene just destroys any credibility the film had going for it."
"Theo Robertson","7","0","5","6 September 2013"," Style Over Subtance But The Style Is Good
","I caught this on ITV4 last night and came in to the film not knowing anything about but a gangster film starring Johnny Depp and Christian Bale based on the true story of the FBIs attempt to catch John Dillnger does make for a good premise . One thing that did strike me was that the number of gun battles did remind me somewhat of HEAT though unlike that film this one seemed to concentrate more on the action sequences rather than the character interaction . After all Depp and Bale aren't really on the same plain as DeNiro and Pacino . I felt slightly stupid when the end credits rolled and the caption Directed By Michael Mann appeared <br/><br/>In some ways PUBLIC ENEMIES is a more glossy , action packed version of HEAT but it's more of style over substance . Not necessarily a criticism because when you've got style this good what is there to complain about ? Not much because the high digital cinematography is genuinely impressive . One wonders though if the decision to shoot it in this style is to hide the fact that from a narrative point of view is entirely down to the structure is too close to HEAT for comfort . We get scenes where a femme fatale is arrested and the protagonist has to drive off with tears in his eyes and lots of shoot outs with extras hiding behind cars etc . In truth there's nothing here you haven't seen before but is very well done it doesn't matter very much"

","I couldn't hear a damn word they actors said in this movie. This film had the worst sound I have yet to experience. The dialogue was very muddy as if the boom mike was wrapped in cotton wool. The background ambiance was overpowering to the point of annoying and the gun shots were deafening. Micheal Mann is not my style of director and I dislike his writing. So why do you ask , did I set through this movie? Johnny Depp is why. I find him fascinating to watch and love his acting and delivery. But even Johnny couldn't bring life to this script. A decided lack of character development and to many characters overwhelmed the screen many times so it was difficult to determine who was who in some cases. I will not recommend this film."
"thenotsomiserable","9","0","1","26 November 2012"," Surprisingly engaging, stylish and well cast
","I entered the watching of this film with scepticism. I wouldn't say that American gangster films would be my genre of choice. I certainly didn't expect the film to make much of an impression on me.<br/><br/>I didn't know much about the background of John Dillinger, but straight away I wanted to know more and was reading up on the background.<br/><br/>I was beginning to think that Johnny Depp had pigeon-holed himself with the slightly tedious performances in Tim Burton films of late which fit an increasingly samey formula. It was refreshing to see him play a part that broke away from the norm and seemed more of a challenge. He was convincing and witty as this smooth, intelligent and charismatic character.<br/><br/>This film is well paced and beautifully shot. The characters were well developed throughout. Although Depp's character was the main focus, the emphasis on his loyalty and care for the other members of the gang transcended through and made me care about each of them. Focus shifts to other individuals at crucial points and there are strong performances from Stephen Graham and Giovanni Ribisi.<br/><br/>Christian Bale is well cast as the moralistic and idealistically hopeful cop. You sympathise with the difficult decisions that he is forced to make and sigh with relief when he steps in to put a halt to the mistreatment of Billie (played by Marion Cotillard).<br/><br/>The build-up of tension increases as you watch the situation unravel for Dillinger and his gang. I couldn't tear myself away for the final third of the film. Despite the fact that I knew what the conclusion would be (having been reading the timeline on the johndillinger.com website) there was no way I could not see this film through to the end.<br/><br/>Possibly a slightly romantic view of gangland criminals of the 30's, I don't know enough to make this judgement- but it doesn't matter as this film feels original and is a pleasure to watch. To sum up, this film was surprisingly engaging and the kind of film I wanted to discuss after I'd seen it- now I just need to make my friends watch it too!"

","The Feds try to take down notorious American gangsters John Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson and Pretty Boy Floyd during a booming crime wave in the 1930s.<br/><br/>As a native of Wisconsin for 31 years, I was a bit proud to have this film shot in Columbus, Oshkosh and Manitowish. I have walked these streets, seen the sights. Heck, I've spent many hours at the coffee shop and comic book store in Oshkosh where a scene was done. But sadly, the finished product is a disappointment.<br/><br/>The movie begins with too much ""shaky-cam"". It is not artistic and it is not effective. It is more annoying. And from there, it sort of devolves. Johnny Depp, as much as we may love him, is not John Dillinger. He neither looks like him, nor is he the right sort of personality. Christian Bale made an alright Purvis, though.<br/><br/>I also found the movie to be an insult to the book. While it may be ""based on"" the book ""Public Enemies"" (which is an excellent book), it deviates so widely from it that this is more fiction than fact at times. The Little Bohemia incident is exaggerated, including a car chase that happened in a completely different time and place. Billie Frechette's role is enlarged, giving the film a romantic angle it should not have and creating this myth that she was beaten or was the subject of a secret message.<br/><br/>The most egregious change is the scene with Dillinger walking into the so-called ""Dillinger Squad"" office. While it may well be true that he once entered the same building as the police department, he certainly never walked up to the police and started talking about baseball! The plastic surgery part of the film is removed, and Frank Nitti's role is increased. We also get much more Phil D'Andrea than probably necessary. Dillinger had minimal interaction with the Mafia. To try to inflate their part (without even adequately explaining who they are) is just a mistake, making the story convoluted and even more in error.<br/><br/>If you like gunfights, this film is okay. But for a story, action, and a good Dillinger... I recommend seeing the movie ""Dillinger"", directed by John Milius. It is the supreme telling of this story."

The cool calculated gangster, big difference with his usual roles, pirate, chocolate factory, etc.. Depp makes the movie, you can see a gangster in him, determined, calculated, ruthless but a bit of a romantic too. It's a real crime movie, well played, good sets, determined police/fbi. So why only a 9, well, it does miss a little bit, the whole J Edgar Hoover thing and the upcoming FBI could have had a little bit more depth. But then again, it's not really about that, it's about the gangster. If you like a bit of gangster style movies, you like 30's atmosphere, bit of action, OK, lot of action but in a realistic manner, go and see the movie, be entertained, I was."

","This is a great period piece/crime movie. It brings a contemporary movie feel to the dusty old 1930s. The tommy gun action is just as exciting as anything in a modern-day shoot-'em-up.<br/><br/>It's a chapter from the pages of history, when J. Edgar Hoover's FBI made an effort to wipe out America's most dangerous criminals. The parallel stories of bank robber John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) and G-Man Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) show promise, but aren't entirely fleshed out. Dillinger sees himself as a romantic anti-hero and enjoys the celebrity that comes with being a notorious outlaw. But the walls are closing in, thanks to no-nonsense Purvis, Hoover's ace bloodhound.<br/><br/>Depp's Dillinger is a sympathetic character and Hoover's G-Men (the ""good guys"") are often painted as ruthless thugs. Bale's Purvis is a bit of an exception. But the feds seem to be out to spoil poor Dillinger's fun and the final confrontation seems totally unfair. That's not to say that Dillinger and his cohorts weren't dangerous troublemakers.<br/><br/>Set in 1934, there's some interesting historical background stuff that the movie touches upon. These were the days before the Bureau Of Investigation was renamed the Federal Bureau of Investigation. J. Edgar Hoover was shaping the department into an elite crime-fighting organization with a new scientific approach. The film shows that Hoover still had to prove himself, and there's some tension between administrator Hoover and field man Purvis. (Purvis seems to be the one who organizes Hoover's inexperienced and initially inept agents.) The 1935 film G-MEN (starring James Cagney) supposedly did a lot to boost the FBI's standing in the public eye.<br/><br/>There's also a little glimpse of Frank Nitti's post-Capone Chicago syndicate. (Nitti also featured in 2002's ROAD TO PERDITION.) There are other nice period touches, like the jazz songs, Will Rogers on the radio, the early Looney Tunes cartoon, and the vintage Yankees-Cubs broadcast (although several details seem to be technically anachronistic). And, for historical reasons, the 1934 MGM film MANHATTAN MELODRAMA (with Clark Gable, William Powell, and Myrna Loy) features prominently in a key scene.<br/><br/>I love classic movies from the 1930s, but I know many people stick to more modern fare. I think it's great to see the 1930s period brought to life for today's audience. It's cool to see these cops & robbers tales play out in a way that won't be dismissed as ""dated"" or ""boring"". PUBLIC ENEMIES should appeal to fans both of James Cagney flicks and of modern crime/action movies."

","I love this movie for so many good reasons; great cast, subject matter, really talented director, Johnny Depp and Christian Bale in the same movie (Bale will always be American Psycho's reason for the stupid book having ever been written, my opinion) playing Good V. Evil and without really glamorizing either side, etc. My biggest smile while watching this film really comes from it's portrayal of agency (FBI in this case) dudes in a decidedly cold, psychopathic and wholly believable light , due to it's rarity actually and if torturing and beating people is heroic in anyone's American dream they must be agency themselves. The scene in which Pretty Boy Floyd is actually hunted, or chased down unarmed by Purvis in what appears to me as more of an orchestrated target practice by the terrified expression on Floyd's face (not an actual historic account, but metaphorically building some character development for our FBI characters here as they have no personality beyond extreme vanity) although he was actually the bank robber of that period that was most definitely shot down in cold blood. I've done my share of light research on the subject and the nutty trivia isn't necessary. Dillinger was never convicted of murder. Why wouldn't people find his death (and the whole crime scene was tampered with so much that it couldn't have been accidental)while (I guess he should have been more careful?!) out at the MOVIES? Hmmm...good thing I don't make scripts and produce movies as my version would suck, surely. The subtlety and obvious real interest in the really intriguing details, while allowing so many details to be historically inaccurate because nothing has really changed that much for America's big crime and punishment perspective, even with the internet.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is one of the most gifted actors of our time. Christian Bale was cold as ice and every bit the psychopath without the dancing and chainsaw. As far as the many noted scenes where cars, signs and other markers of the time like popular music and type fonts; details that were purposely done as the film called for to maybe show that the story could happen any time and now, rather than as a documentary would require. I think the sheer number of them should get the point across to most who like film, yet some just don't get how that stuff conveys actual messages that are somehow undetectable to those who might keep the thing from being made, so long as that message is wordless and coupled with friendly interviews (why wouldn't anyone do so for research anyway?)and lack of conspiracy theories or obvious moral questions. Actually, it wouldn't be very good and some website already said the same thing with way less work, by a CIA agent! The Hoover impression was both perfectly creepy and hilarious at the same time."

Dillinger gets what he wants, women, fine clothing and accessories. He funds all of these things by robbing banks and remaining 5 steps ahead of the inept police force at all times, often by crossing state lines where the local police are powerless. Dillinger revels in the notoriety that comes with being a renowned criminal, and is savvy enough to realise limiting their actions to robbing banks – and not taking hostages or killing innocents – is the key to maintaining public sentiment.<br/><br/>(Christian Bale is) Melvin Purvis: the new leader of a taskforce picked to hunt down the most dangerous of criminals. Purvis is confident, analytical and incredibly determined. Purvis has a solid track record of tracking high profile criminals and either bring them in or bringing them down. Unfortunately the rest of the police force aren't similarly well-equipped to handle such important police work, which is part of the reason Dillinger and gang remain free men.<br/><br/>Public Enemies follows the activities of these two men over a period of time, mostly Dillinger it needs to be said, as they cross paths and attempt to outdo one another in a high stakes game of cat and mouse.<br/><br/>Dillinger's weakness for the finer things in life provides Purvis and his squad with a vulnerable point when Dillinger decides a young Katy Perry lookalike is to be his new woman, which he announces to her by informing her ""You're my lady"" and I'm only just paraphrasing. Dillinger's determined loyalty to this young woman means that he is constantly coming back to be with her, something the cops learn early in the piece and anticipate.<br/><br/>When the Mob become more than a little upset that Dillinger's activities are drawing the ire of too many law enforcement agencies from all over the country they put the heat on Dillinger and tell him to lie low, and that previous safe houses are no longer available to him or his men. Now more out in the open than ever before the smart thing to do would be to move away or give the game away – but that wasn't the Dillinger way While it must have been fun to fang around in those old big black towncars with guys holding tommy guns standing on the skirting boards and hanging on for dear life it just isn't that gripping as an audience member.<br/><br/>Similarly running around shooting thousands of blanks at other actors while wearing cool hats and long trenchcoats might have been a blast for the actors, it just doesn't relay especially well on screen.<br/><br/>This is exactly the same problem that faced Ridley Scott's Robin Hood; when you tell the same story again and again it just gets a little stale. At worst that results in Robin Hood, but unless you change the mix up or add something new to proceedings the best result is what we see here, a solid period drama that is better than you think it might be – but exactly what you thought it would be.<br/><br/>No-one stands around gawking at the miracle of Compact Discs anymore. Although it was a design breakthrough at the time technology and time has moved on. There are newer, cooler and flat out better things out there.<br/><br/>With Public Enemies Michael Mann showed us a CD and expected people to react like it was the Japanese launch of the ipad.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 5.5 / 10. At one point Dillinger gets bored and on a whim walks into the police station and into the very department assigned to hunt him down. If that is supposed to be ""based on a true story"" then so is Avatar.<br/><br/>Aside from that Public Enemies is solid, well acted, too long – and bland."

","This is not a great film - but a great looking film. Great sceneries, great wardrobes. Johnny Depp fits for his role perfectly. He is convincing as the famous gangster boss but not as great as Christian Bale as his hunter. Some have called his performance ""wooden"" which only shows that he's misunderstood as an actor completely by some people. He's not wooden at all, he draws a great portrait of an obsessed man who does not allow himself to much emotions. That he looks breathtakingly smooth in his suits does not hurt either. Marion Cotillard is also great. This film is no great piece of art, but it's easy to watch and has great acting in it."
"TheUnknown837-1","10","0","4","29 November 2010"," ""Public Enemies"" could very well be the best bank robber biopic since ""Bonnie and Clyde"" and may be even better
","Let's use our imaginations for a moment. Create an alternative reality universe in your mind, something I think all of us do whenever something does not go according to plan or to preference. Like the Academy Awards for 2009. I was completely dissatisfied with that list for one fundamental reason. If I could have changed that list, I would have removed ""District 9"" in the Best Picture category and substituted for it, Michael Mann's marvelous ""Public Enemies."" Not only that, but I would have given it the Award itself. I have not seen ""The Hurt Locker"" yet (I hope to soon, because I'm told it's very, very good) but I do sincerely think ""Public Enemies"" was the best film that I saw last year. And yes, I saw ""Avatar"" too.<br/><br/>""Public Enemies"" is a mostly accurate screen transition of the story of John Dillinger, the notorious bank robber who rose to the top of the F.B.I.'s most wanted list during the 1930s. He is played by Johnny Depp (in one of the actor's finest performances) as a cynical, clear-headed man with no other desire than to push for what he wants. Yet, as we discover, he's still just a human being, when he falls in love with Billie Freschette (Marion Cotillard) and takes her on his gun-blazing, bank-heisting journey. Meanwhile, of course, there is a government agent, Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale, one of his best performances as well) determined to hunt Dillinger down by all means necessary. Not exactly an original setup, but with any great film, it is how director Michael Mann and his cast and crew execute the project that makes it work so well.<br/><br/>""Public Enemies"" may very well be the best bank robber biopic since ""Bonnie and Clyde"" and maybe even better. Even though it has a sort of obligatory setup with ostensibly standard characters (a bank robber, his moll, and a government agent) it is done with such energy and such raw power that it nevertheless absorbed me right from the beginning. Watching ""Public Enemies"" I felt very much like I was one of the people in the holdup banks: unable to take my eyes or strict attention away for just the slightest second.<br/><br/>One of the things I admired most about the movie was the way it handled its characters. Turning what could have been stick figures into fleshed-out, three-dimensional human beings. For example, Dillinger is not a hardheaded killer impervious to emotions. There are parts to him that are more than subhuman, if just barely. He is devoted to those around him, and most of all to Billie and their story is really one of the more touching romantic subplots that I've seen in a movie for a long time. The reason? Because watching them together, I really got the sense that they were in love. Whereas other movies throw these in obligatory and without any passion, I did not see an actor and an actress going through the motions of rehearsed dialogue, but two people who loved and cared about each other and were willing to put themselves on the line for each other. And also, I like how the government agent, Melvin Purvis, does not turn out to be either a sheer genius or a bumbling fool. He's a conflicted, troubled individual himself. And I also like how the movie touches on the subjects of partnerships being torn apart (e.g. mobs splitting from the robbers). In addition, there's a particular FBI agent played by Stephen Lang who, although important, is not rushed into taking up one of the leading roles. Somehow, by suppressing his screen time, it makes his important moments in the film so much more powerful. It's like a documentary.<br/><br/>Mr. Mann is a very talented director. He knows how to shoot a movie well. The action sequences in ""Public Enemies,"" in particular, are tense and exciting and they go on to great lengths without wearing out. This is not the Hollywood fantasy land where the protagonist scores a direct hit every time he shoots but the band guys can empty machine gun magazines in the direction of their target and never come close. There's one scene in particular, which stretches on to great lengths because it acknowledges these realistic scenarios, and it's utterly gripping. But also Mr. Mann knows how to coordinate his actors and his camera, taking note of what he has to and excising what he does not.<br/><br/>But perhaps the best stronghold are the performance. As I mentioned before, this is one of the best performances that Mr. Depp has ever given. Oliver Stone was right when he guessed the young actor he cast in a bit role in ""Platoon"" would one day become a big star. Mr. Bale redeemed himself in this film from his lackluster, drained performance in ""Terminator Salvation"" and proved once again what a talented actor he is. Ms Cotillard is certainly a beautiful-looking woman, but she's also a professional who excels at communicating passion. She's more than just part of the scenery and her denouement is one of the most haunting, yet beautiful images in recent movie history. Bit parts are played by Stephen Lang, Billy Crudup, Stephen Dorff, and Stephen Graham (a lot of Stephens in this cast, eh?).<br/><br/>Is there anything I don't like about this movie? Well, I am not particularly moved by the digital photography of the picture, but that's a minor detractor. As Bosley Crowther said, movies should be assessed on their ""dramatic architecture, not the hocus-pocus of the eye."" And the dramatic architecture here is excellent. Unfortunately, the Academy Awards (and many people, I'm shocked to see) did not think so. Rex Reed and I seem to be virtually alone on this one."

"ajs-10","5","0","2","6 June 2010"," Gangster films were never like this when I was young!
","I haven't seen a gangster movie set in the 1930's for quite some time and so I was interested to see Michael Mann's take on the genre. It wasn't quite what I expected; it's very long and goes into a lot of detail about the life and times of the main protagonist, John Dillinger. But here's a little about the plot before I continue.<br/><br/>We begin in 1933 with John Dillinger busting his gang out of prison. An audacious act that gets J.Edgar Hoover, the head of the F.B.I., to assign a task force, lead by Melvin Purvis, to track him down. Several bank raids later, Dillinger meets and falls in love with Billie Frechette, a half French, half Native American girl. They are soon parted as Purvis and his team close in on the gang. There is a lot more, and a few other noted gangsters of the period do turn up in the narrative, but those are the main points of the film.<br/><br/>As we'd expect with a Michael Mann film, this one is technically very well done. Lots of shoot-outs, bank heists and car chases all very professionally performed. As far as performances go, I thought Johnny Depp as Okay as John Dillinger and Christian Bale did a good job as Melvin Purvis. I thought Marion Cotillard as woefully underused as Billie Frechette, although we did see what she can do briefly towards the end of the film.<br/><br/>Over all I found it far too long with scenes that started to drag towards the end. It's an interesting story that could have been done so much better. I didn't really engage with any of the characters, I found them all a bit two dimensional apart from maybe Billie Frechette. So I'm afraid it's not really recommended, but if you've got a spare 140 minutes to kill, maybe it's for you.<br/><br/>My score: 5.4/10"
"lewiskendell","7","0","1","5 June 2010"," A Greatest Hits version of the life of John Dillinger.
","I really wish Johnny Depp would play ""normal"" guys like this more often. His acting talent is more apparent when he's in a role that's not defined by eccentricity. The guy made a fine Dillinger, I must admit. <br/><br/>Public Enemies breezes through the more interesting parts of Dillinger's criminal career, without getting bogged down in any origins or psychological justification for his behavior. He was just a man who liked fast money and the things that came along with it. This isn't a historically precise, complex character study, it's just an entertaining romanticization of a very notorious man.<br/><br/>Along with Depp, you have a plethora of talent actors and actresses who are either in love with Dillinger, helping him, or trying to bring him down. This is a seriously impressive cast, from headliners like Cotillard and Bale, to small but appreciated cameos from Emilie de Ravin and Carey Mulligan. There's a great actor everywhere you look, in Public Enemies. That's one of the many things to like about the movie. It brings the ""summer blockbuster"" feel to a genre that isn't normally associated with that idea, and it does it well."

Yes I absolutely do, the more I watch it the faster pace the film seems, something I would recommend to those who found it to boring The cinematography is purely realistic. Bright and in our eyes as if we were there. The great Mann doesn't try and put us in our own time and gloss up the cinematography to make distanced from the era.<br/><br/>The sound is loud with it's Rat-a-tat ness that also strips away the space between you and the film. Some don't embrace directors ditching celluloid, I for one am sold on it, I guess that makes me luckier We are there, everything is visible and it's something once use to and watched again really works.<br/><br/>Another treat is our lead character (and John Dillinger is quite one indeed) is enigmatic. His drive is a furious one that fuelled his bank robbing.<br/><br/>To quote Empire Magazine Johnny Depp underplays John Dillinger to perfection. And he does, no clichéd Cagney Tribute. Dillinger feels real and out there all at once. We see his tears and vulnerability along with his balls of steel livin in the moment life style.<br/><br/>Once his mind is set on something.

"revival05","6","0","1","26 April 2010"," Chicago never looked better, but Michael Mann has made better films nonetheless
","Stanley Kubrick apparently once said that a film isn't a photograph of reality, but photograph of a photograph of a reality. In Michael Mann's Public Enemies, Johnny Depp is playing real life bank robber John Dillinger sitting in a movie theater watching Clark Gable play a gangster in a gangster movie. That's an actor portraying a gangster in a movie that a gangster played by another actor is watching in another movie. That's a photograph of a photograph of reality, an especially common phenomena in gangster movies. I don't think any gangster movie can avoid it's own mythology.<br/><br/>And then, Public Enemies is still a gangster movie that attempts to be as naturalistic as possible. Based on a book by Bryan Burrough it's a visual spectacle of authenticity. The details are there without Mann making a fuss of it. It ain't the South of Gone With the Wind, it's simply the 30's as good as it gets in any film. In this surrounding the actors can only do it as straight as possible. Together with all of the other characters, Depp's Dillinger is peeled down until he's just a human being, walking and talking and robbing banks. We are not watching a myth come to life, nor are we spending time on the psychology couch with him. When he courts the woman of his choice (that's the kind of man this is) she attempts to make him go away by pointing out that she doesn't even know him. He says, almost annoyed, just to get it out of the way: ""I was raised on a farm in Moooresville, Indiana. My mama ran out on us when I was three, my daddy beat the hell out of me cause he didn't know no better way to raise me. I like baseball, movies, good clothes, fast cars, whiskey, and you... what else you need to know?""<br/><br/>So, John Dillinger was excellent at robbing banks and even better at jailbreaks and that's about it. If a man like him would ever need to be a movie hero he would have to be played by Johnny Depp. He's ideal and immediately makes him inexplicably likable. This is the best quality of the film, and it's also it's weakest point. He's not likable in any romantic sense, but he's not somebody you get angry with either. It's a Rise and fall-story of an American gangster, but there's no emotions involved. The great counter-example is Christian Bale playing Melvin Purvis, the Special Agent assigned by J. Edgar Hoover to track him down. He is paradoxically cold and thorough and, great as Bale is, we understand his character even less. In fact, these two characters seem disjointed from each other as if they are both inexplicably doing something pointless for no reason. It's especially a bit of a letdown when Michael Mann have been such an expert in the past dealing with the psychological problems of destructive masculinity. The biggest comparison that comes to mind is of course Heat, the gorgeous and intelligent cops and robbers-film where Robert De Niro and Al Pacino were to meet up face to face. At times, Public Enemies inevitably feels like an unofficial prequel or remake and it does fall short by comparison. There was psychological strength and emotional heaviness there that Public Enemies deliberately avoids. What it does instead is filling the screen up with great tech stuff. Any fan of film making should see this film just to witness professionalism working in sheer, eclectic delight. Well disciplined dialog scenes are intercut with hand-held DV and delicious editing make any viewer watch these characters move along with delightful ease. Right down to casting choices, the film is in many ways impeccable - Anna Sage, the woman who eventually betrayed Dillinger, is played by the wonderful Branka Katic who was unforgettable in Emir Kusturica's wonderful 1998 comedy Black Cat, White Cat. Someone certainly had to convince someone with that choice.<br/><br/>Public Enemies is a little tricky. It's not a bad film, but it's not entirely worthwhile either. It's a good looking film - and well dressed, with Depp and Bale in 30s suits - about a gangster who's neither Tony Montana nor a real person. We've seen it before, but on the other hand it has been done a lot worse in lesser films. At the same time: It's a good film, but Heat is better."
"bsimon-9","7","0","1","25 April 2010"," Mann is back
","Mann is back, back on his chronological track of men and gunpowder, amidst which you can distinguish that this time, a little more than before,a back-flash into the darkness of history, and a trying earning of applause<br/><br/>That's doubtless an ever good experience to see the challenge a gangster-addicted director tries to overrun on the narrow screen, let alone the indulgence of the cast, which burns up my modest expectation by the easiest way; yes, you can count on the taste of blood-rocking glimpses razored down from corners of Depp's eyes, but that must eat your heart out to see the Batman and Piaff flank the Pirate in old Jazz.<br/><br/>The tempo and temper in the first half hour are still as sharp and clean as the shot could be from the behind of camera against Mann's aiming eye. He never loose his lens hair-thick away form his action-loaded guys. But as road runs noisy and crowded, something there, something thinner. There better be an umbrella in the stormy bullets, I have to say, to rest a room where the characters' soul can breathe in adequate air in case the physical elbows away the chemical. The same between two men as before, the Insider runs out, Heat down to hot.<br/><br/>Maybe the little bit of heavier involvement of the opposite sex dissolves down the complexity of men. That cliff-cut goodbye for a girl comes to shy in hilly slop. It stops to function mirror but mate in the meaning of its own for the lady along side of the uncompromising tough hero. That's a pleasing new in Mann but plain in the genre.<br/><br/>Plenty of measures from style to plot are applied in the end to save density and richness and they work in an efficient way, still sharp and clean. That's safe to say good, however, we opt to reserve our regret as long as it is by Mann."

People will definitely enjoy the details and efforts that was put in the actual locations, props, weapons and costumes but the noisy production track and the very noticeable ADR really kills the flow.

This is the information you go into the theatre with and that's about all you leave with. The movie stumbles from scene to scene, with no coherent connection between events and characters, I was constantly left wondering who people were and why something had just happened. <br/><br/>Despite the above criticism, Public Enemies is not a bad movie/preview and it ticks all the boxes needed to make a great movie/preview ; A-List actors – CHECK, Big Budget – CHECK, Accomplished Director – CHECK, Famous Historical Figure – CHECK, Love Story – CHECK, Big Action Scenes – CHECK, Batman & Willy Wonka II – CHECK. The list goes on and it is an entertaining, if unsatisfying viewing experience. <br/><br/>So why wasn't this movie awesome, well if you know nothing about any of the characters it is unlikely you will care what happens to them. Amidst all the jail breaks, bank robberies, and strangely edited love scenes it seems as though there is no time for character development, a few quips from Depp and screams from Bale is about all you get to flesh out the characters. Was the audience supposed to automatically relate to the characters based on the actors resume? I would liken Dillinger to a combination of Don Juan & Donnie Brasco, where Purvis was basically a deep southern version of Batman minus cape & Batmobile. I'd love to mention other characters but they were to unmemorable, pretty boy something?<br/><br/>On the Fruit-Meter, Public Enemies get the ""WATERMELON"" - Big, Bold, and Flashy, goes down smooth, but once you've finished eating you realise there wasn't much substance to it.<br/><br/>MART-FLIX PUN-FUN - Tommy-guns and big action can't ""bale"" out movie which suffers from lack of ""deppth""...terrible"
"Locut0s","7","0","1","12 March 2010"," A good movie that could have been great
","There's not much you need to know about the plot except to know that it's about the life and crimes of John Dillinger and his associates. The film is wonderfully directed and shot by Michael Mann and carries much of the same brilliance that his previous masterpiece Heat does. Mann is a master at ratcheting up the tension shot by shot, and Elliot Goldenthal's music (which sounds almost identical to that of Hans Zimmer) adds a wonderful deep plodding sense of inevitability to the film. Having said this there are some problems that prevent this from reaching the heights of say, Heat. For one I don't care for some of the casting options. Both Johnny Depp and Christian Bale are good actors who carry their characters well (though Depp is noticeably better than Bale), but they are just a little too perfect looking for these roles IMO. Heat could get away with it because it was something of a fantasy about a group of perfect criminals. Here however we are dealing with historic figures and as often happens in such cases the stars get in the way of the characters they are portraying. Bale and Depp are just too well known and their acting just not quite good enough for one to fully suspend ones disbelief. Also while the film I'm sure if historically very curate it could have used some editing to tighten things up as a film. There is a scene in the film that never takes place because Dillinger is killed before it happens and that scene is the train robbery. And while the final scene is almost perfectly shot it's almost anticlimactic in the face of the audiences expectation of a final confrontation aboard the train."
"drmetal8","3","0","2","1 March 2010"," Poorly made gangster movie
","I was very disappointed in this movie. I was shocked at how sloppy this movie was, especially being directed by Michael Mann. There is almost no attention to detail, and it's so distracting. It starts from the very beginning, where the movie puts you right in the middle of some sort of jailbreak scene... they make no attempt to explain what the hell is going on. The sound is poorly done, there are parts where the sound is overwhelming (most of the gunfights) and parts where you can barely hear what is being said. People mumble a lot, you completely miss parts. There are no time/date/location stamps on any scene in the movie. It's very hard to figure out where you are, what's happening and who you are seeing do it. The cinematography is atrocious. There are whole scenes that are just a jumbled mess. One other beef I had is the casting of too many similar-looking people. There are so many middle-aged white men in this movie, you can't keep track of who's who. I really wanted to like this movie, but I just didn't. Poorly done."
"usncking","10","0","3","19 January 2010"," One of the best gangster movie I have ever seen
","The reason I feel this movie is one of the best gangster films is because of the fact it is a true story. In most gangster films there are these glorified fake mafia or mob members that are these larger than life characters who get everything and seem to only be on edge at the end of the movie. This movie portrays the real life of a gangster who has to constantly be on the run. John Dillinger didn't have some mansion to fall back to or a team of lawyers who kept him out of jail no he did it all by himself, the only nice things he possessed was good clothes fast cars and big guns. This is what a real gangster had and this is what the movie portrayed and that is why i feel it is a great gangster film.<br/><br/>Also the actors and performances were excellent and really made you feel like you were witnessing the events as they happened back in the 1930's."
"rbnn","3","0","1","17 January 2010"," Unsubtle
","Overly dramatic and stylized account of Dillinger.<br/><br/>Too many unsubtle reaction shots and way too many close-ups. For example, when Dillinger is watching the movie, his reaction shot for a long time in close-up is shown to the ominous words of the actor he is watching.<br/><br/>Movie is badly harmed by its score, which is unoriginal and way over-scores and over-dramatizes key moments, constantly soaring and telegraphing emotions.<br/><br/>In between the over-dramatizations, there were a large number of gunfights followed by ""meaningful"" dying declarations.<br/><br/>To me, this movie seemed like an excuse for the actors to ham it up.<br/><br/>Cinematography had the shiny Mann style, but the framing was simplistic, with focus on only one thing, and anyway that style is not too credible in depicting the somewhat messy time period."
"btzarevski","8","0","1","2 January 2010"," Oscar for Depp...Top Marks for the rest
","OK, firstly Johnny Depp is once again outstanding; he deserves an Oscar for a long time and his performance as Dillinger adds more meat to that.<br/><br/>Depp stars as John Dillinger, a 1930's bank robber who rises to be hailed as America's Public Enemy No.1 hotly pursued by Agent Purvis (Bale). I'll not go into too much detail as you must see the movie, however, I will tell you that the movie follows the story of Dillinger and his many daring and brave robberies and jail escapes while dealing with his personal life and problems.<br/><br/>Many people call this movie shallow and that it is missing a certain 'it' factor but I disagree. The movie is based on a true story which cannot be enhanced to be more entertaining with dramatic twists; Dillinger is Dillinger and is portrayed as such. Granted, there are a few historical differences (times of death, affairs etc) but these are not noticed unless you read about Dillinger and are petty.<br/><br/>Depp's performance is superb and definitely boosts the movie, the cinematography is also really good as is Bale's performance. All in all this is a very entertaining, interesting and gripping movie with a few minor hicks that are easily overlooked when weighed against the good points.<br/><br/>I personally enjoyed one of the soundtracks, Ten Million slaves by Otis Taylor and this was played at the most appropriate places and really adds to the atmosphere; yet another plus point.<br/><br/>8/10 and definitely recommended"

","This film proved two things: Johnny Depp can act, and Christian Bale can't. We all know Depp is a natural, who succeeds in any role. Now we also know for sure that Bale (who throws tantrums on the set while people are trying to work) is also a natural--at being stiff and grim in any role he gets. So that is pretty much what you have in this film. The rest of it -- the story, the style, the schtick, are all Mann and I do love it so. He's a director whose cinema style I appreciate because it pulls at my soul. No I don't know why but I love the moral intensity that just oozes from the visuals he creates.

"JoeB131","Null","0","2","25 December 2009"," Flawed history
","A little background before I go on. I used to vacation in the little town of Manitowish Waters, where the Little Bohemia lodge is located. A key part of this movie is centered in the Little Bohemia shootout. (The scenes in the movie were actually filmed there!) <br/><br/>The prelude is that Melvin Purvis tortures a mortally wounded Dillenger confederate for the location of his hideout. In reality, the wife of owner Emil Wannatka mailed a letter to the FBI ratting out the gangsters. Now, I realize that this scene was done for dramatic effect, but what was the effect here? The whole movie seems to reflect on modern complaints that liberal Hollywood seems to have with the Government- there is wiretapping, officials (mostly J. Edgar Hoover) abusing authority, torture of suspects, etc.<br/><br/>Now, I give them credit for actually using the actual site and calling the town ""Manitowish"". (In reality, the town of Manitowish is about six miles north. Manitowish Waters was at that time known as ""the Town of Spider Lake"" until the town fathers realized in the 1940's that wasn't the best name to get tourists visiting.) <br/><br/>The history gets sloppier with the actual shootout. In the historical version, all the gangsters got away, a G-man was shot by Baby-Face Nelson on a nearby road, but it was a complete fiasco for the FBI. In the movie, all of Dillengers' accomplices are killed, including Nelson. (Nelson, in fact, survived Dillenger by a few months). Pretty Boy Floyd was also killed in the first scenes of the movie, even though he, too, was killed after Dillenger.<br/><br/>Dillenger was the first string Gangster. These guys were kind of the number two and three guys.<br/><br/>I think the producers figured that modern audiences wouldn't go for an accurate portrayal of events, and wanted to see as much ordnance as John McClain or John Rambo would dish out.<br/><br/>But the biggest flaw in the movie is that I didn't care about Dillenger or any other character as a person. I could have cared less if the FBI caught him or not. (Of course, knowing the did kind of took the suspense out of it for me. )<br/><br/>A final note. DIllenger and his sort get glorified in movies when there is economic trouble. THey robbed the banks, and people hated the banks in the 1930's and hated them in the 1970's when movies glorifying these people were made. The fact this sort of movie makes a comeback now says a lot."
"DylansFearFiles","9","0","3","14 December 2009"," John Dillinger Finally Is Presented Accurately
","John Dillinger is one of the gangsters of the thirties who captured the hearts of Depression-era Americans and still does. He represented the people's hate of the banks and lawmen. John Dillinger was also a charismatic Indiana farm boy, who people weren't used to in the 1930s.<br/><br/>Michael Mann's latest masterpiece is another film about cops and criminals but this time based on a true story. This is about the 13 months of fame that John Herbert Dillinger (Johnny Depp) reigned before his death outside of the Chicago Biograph theater on July 22, 1934. The film also follows the story of Special Agent Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) as he hunts down the charming bank robber in the Depression-era Midwest.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp's performance in Public Enemies is something else and Christian Bale is also very good. Depp's portrayal of Dillinger is more realistic and true to history that Warren Oates in the (also great) 1973 film, simply titled ""Dillinger"". The movie has cinematography and a soundtrack that totally blew me away. Also, Marion Cotillard's performance as John Dillinger's sweetheart Billie Frechette broke my heart.<br/><br/>Michael Mann still has not left his ability to create atmosphere in his films. Heat and Manhunter are other examples of his great atmospheric masterpieces. He is back now with this exciting film.<br/><br/>The only real complaint I have it right below: The film focuses so much on John Dillinger that it doesn't seem to tell anything about the true causes of J. Edgar Hoover's (Billy Croodup) War on Crime or other criminals of the era. The other criminals I would like to have seen more of include Baby Face Nelson (Stephen Graham), Alvin Karpis (Giovanni Ribsi) and Pretty Boy Floyd (Channing Tatum). The Kansas City Massacre is also something that needed to be told about because this is a key event in the connecting history of the Public Enemy Era.<br/><br/>Overall, Public Enemies is probably the best film I have seen so far this year and I don't expect to see better.<br/><br/>10/10"
"imdbbl","Null","0","1","11 December 2009"," Depp is great, the film not so much
","The difficult 1930s is a time of robbers who knock over banks and other rich targets with alarming frequency. Of them, none is more notorious than John Dillinger, whose gang plies its trade with cunning efficiency against big businesses while leaving ordinary citizens alone. As Dillinger becomes a folk hero, FBI head J. Edger Hoover is determined to stop his ilk by assigning ace agent Melvin Purvis to hunt down Dillinger. As Purvis struggles with the manhunt's realities, Dillinger himself faces an ominous future with the loss of friends, dwindling options and a changing world of organized crime with no room for him... Michael Mann's Public Enemies is a very mediocre piece of work. First and foremost, I think the viewers will be surprised by the "" look"" of the film. Apparently it was shot in HD/digital video which should mean a sharp image but the end result is still and lifeless. The sound is also very odd as if it hasn't been worked at all. Both questionable choices by the director. The story feels rushed and loose and the narrative isn't focused which is a shame because this is an interesting and compelling story that could have been made into a great film. Another flaw is the fact that besides John Dillinger and Billie Frechette, all the other characters are two-dimensional and poorly written. The best thing about Public Enemies, is undeniably, Johnny Depp. He is terrifically charismatic, stylish and suave as Dillinger and a pleasure to watch. The role fitted him like a glove, and without Depp the film would have almost no interest. Marion Cotillard was lovely as Billie Frechette, on the other hand, Christian Bale was very wooden as Melvin Purvis, the man in charge of hunting down Dillinger and his gang, resembling his performance in his latest film, Terminator Salvation. Overall, I think Michael Mann is to blame, Public Enemies seemed to have all the right ingredients to be an epic gangster film however, the director made some odd choices and I question his vision. And according to rumors, so did Depp. Maybe, it was their disagreement that caused the film to be so uneven.<br/><br/>6/10"

","This Film is tied with with Michael Mann's other greatest film titled Heat. Don't listen to any criticism about the characters being shallow or there not being enough character development throughout the story. I let all that detour me for a while but I have just recently watched this film and all I can say is WOW! Depp deserves an Oscar for his role and the Film should at least receive a nomination in the Oscars.<br/><br/>To answer all cries about lack of character development in the movie.<br/><br/>1) You cannot expect 21st Century emotions to tell a 20th Century Film. You cannot argue with the fact that things were much different back then and yes that means so were people. People did their work and sometimes that was it. Very 1 Dimensional or 2 Dimensional. But it is what it is in that time period.<br/><br/>2) John Dillenger even says it in the movie for me... I believe it was something along these lines ""I grew up here, my father beat me when I was young, I like fast cars, good food, having fun and you. What more do you need to know""? That is exactly what Michael Mann delivers to the audience.<br/><br/>I am sick and tired of hearing people whine about a few things when it comes to Film. Those who complain about having to read subtitles (god forbid you have to actually read :(, and those who say ""well The movie didn't tell me every detail"", or ""I don't get it"". Are people really at the point where EVERY THING has to be spelled out for them.

"TheEtherWalk","6","0","1","5 December 2009"," Good performances, mediocre script
","Johnny Depp plays John Dillinger on the run from law enforcement, led by Melvin Purvis played by Christian Bale. Let's start with the good. The action scenes are intense and gripping, and Depp is a powerhouse throughout the film. I really feel like they developed the character of Dillinger very well. I also liked Marion Cotillard, Billy Crudup and Stephen Graham as Baby Face Nelson. There is also great cinematography, costume design and editing. For all it's technical excellence, the film has a lot of problems.<br/><br/>The script is NOT based on historical facts, apart from a few key scenes involving Dillinger escaping, and finally meeting his end. The Wikipedia page for this movie lists all the changes made, I suppose to make the film more cinematic. But in this case it really ends up working against the film. It feels too romanticized at times. Depp is essentially the hero, and is portrayed as basically a good guy who just likes robbing banks. The film is lacking in grit as a result.<br/><br/>Most of Dillinger's associates are poorly developed and get killed all in one scene to make the movie more exciting. Although it is exciting, it's not dramatic or believable. And if historical accuracy isn't their top priority, they could have made some of the robbery scenes more exciting. Another problem is the whole angle of the mob hating Dillinger for forcing the creation of new laws against organized crime. This plot line went absolutely nowhere and should have been left out. On another note, I'm not sure if it was the actor's delivery or the sound design, but it was really hard to understand what people were saying in some scenes. Not that any of the dialogue really matters, and a lot of scenes amount to absolutely nothing. Mann is going strictly for style over substance here.<br/><br/>Another place the script fails is in the character played by Christian Bale. Purvis is no Al Pacino in Heat. In fact, I can't think of one thing his character actually did besides shoot a few people. To cast an actor like Bale in a role that has almost no character development is a problem. The should have either cast a lesser known actor or rewritten his role entirely. In real life Purvis wasn't very involved with most of the events he's portrayed in, so casting him as a main player was folly unless they gave him more back story. As a result, the only real dramatic weight is between Depp and Cotillard, which was done very well.<br/><br/>Strongly acted but lacking in accessibility, Public Enemies is a frustrating film. Certainly not Mann's best film, but not his worst either. In the end, this movie is pure entertainment and nothing more."
"SebaZava","8","0","3","30 November 2009"," An old-fashioned and compelling motion picture.
","Better late than never, I guess. Although Public Enemies was released somehow late in Peruvian theatres, I admit I have taken my time to write my review, having seen the actual movie a couple of weeks before Inglourious Basterds. This has happened not because I didn't know what to write about the movie - although I have found myself in that particular kind of situation before -, but because I'm having less and less time to write reviews. This is what college does to someone who enjoys doing something that is not particularly vital for his career or every-day life, and although I'm studying something I love -filmmaking - I don't like the fact that I'm starting to write less and less reviews each week.<br/><br/>But enough of my personal life. This particular text should concern Johnny Depp's latest movie, and thus express that, yes, I did enjoy the movie, although it didn't fulfill all of my - perhaps unreasonably high - expectations. Those expecting a very exciting, action-packed and thrilling motion picture will definitely be disappointed; although the film has its share of shoot-outs and deaths, it is more of a drama rather than a thriller or action picture, and thus succeeds at telling the story of the very interesting John Dillinger (Depp) without resorting to pointless action sequences or explosions. In fact, it is somehow old-fashioned in this respect, having more in common with movies like The Maltese Falcon than with the average star-studded summer movie of the 21st century.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of John Dillinger, and actually starts with him escaping a maximum-security prison with most of his gang alive. He already has quite a reputation as one of the most successful and daring bank-robbers of his time (the 1930s) but isn't planning on stopping to do what he does best, at least not on the short run. He becomes involved with a very pretty coat-check girl named Billie Frechette (the superb Mario Cotillard) and also becomes the obsession of FBI big boss Edgard J. Hoover (Billy Crudup), who assigns agent Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) as the head of the office whose mission is to apprehend Dillinger. Needless to say, most of the film is dedicated to Dillinger's seemingly-superficial relationship with Billie, but most importantly, to Purvis' hunt of the famous robber.<br/><br/>Although director Michael Mann has proved in the past that he can be a master of tension and intensity, even when working with a not-so-great screenplay (as in the case of Miami Vice), he has decided not to turn Public Enemies into an action-fest, and I applaud him for that. He understands that, being the story of a real life figure, it is more interesting to present the film in a more dramatic, old-fashioned kind of way. Fortunately enough, he succeeds at emphasizing the drama having a particularly slow movie, although it definitely isn't as fast-paced as other movies of its ilk. Interestingly enough, it is the performances, the plot itself and the character interactions that managed to interest me the most in what was happening on-screen, not the few action sequences. Don't get me wrong - they are expertly shot - and there are a couple of very tense moments here and there - it's only that Mann hasn't made any of these sequences the real focus of the film.<br/><br/>Performances are superlative. Johnny Depp once again proves that he's one of the most chamaleonic actors alive. Although Dillinger is not presented in a truly three-dimensional fashion, Depp manages to make him a suitably sympathetic figure, a very charming and ""cool"" kind of character, without turning him into a caricature of a gangster. Marion Cotillard is, as usual, great, even if her character is nothing more than an archetypical love interest. Christian Bale is a little bland as Purvis - and his accent never managed to convince me - but that's more due to the screenplay than to his acting. As Edgar J. Hoover, on the other hand, Billy Crudup is great, and Stephen Graham (Snatch.) manages to create a truly memorable and vile character in the form of Baby Face Nelson.<br/><br/>If there's one thing that truly bothered me about the movie, though, and that, for my money, prevents it from being a quasy-masterpiece, it would be Mann's visual style. Not unlike his previous efforts, Collateral and the aforementioned Miami Vice, Mann has used digital videocameras to shoot the film - without ever trying to hide the fact that he is, in fact, using videocameras - and it doesn't really work at all times. He's shot most of the movie using hand-held cameras, and although this works during the shoot-outs or the more intense sequences, because of the ""different"" nature of the digital cameras, all the blurriness and confusion that Mann's shakiness cause can become distracting and bothersome, especially during scenes that take place at night. I don't mind Mann using digital cameras, but if he's going the digital way, at least he should try to use a less shaky kind of camera-work.<br/><br/>Visual style aside, Public Enemies is a very gripping and old-fashioned movie that should find its audience not in hormonal teenage boys and girls, but in a more mature moviegoers. It may not be as masterful as previous works of a similar nature, but due to its solid performances and emphasis of drama over action and explosions, it works as a very compelling character study of a gangster who, during his time, was lauded by the public and hated by the authorities. This aspect of public popularity is not particularly developed by the filmmakers - save a couple of scenes in which it is very evident - but Depp's performance, I think, is good enough to make the audience believe that, despite all his wrong-doings, the public would love a man like him."

","John Herbert Dillinger is still one of the most recognisable names that emerged from the 'Public Enemy Era' during the Great Depression in early 1930's America. Some say he was a dangerous criminal, a sociopath who lived to simply kill and rob. Others admire his Robin Hood-esquire quality of taking from the capitalist institutions during a period of economic crisis. Michael Mann paints Dillinger (Johnny Depp) in his latest action-blockbuster 'Public Enemies' as a man with pride, self-respect and principles – he ""never leaves a man behind"" – but adds little more to that characterisation and that is the principle fault with a very enjoyable film.<br/><br/>The film starts in 1933 as the audience are thrown straight into action typical Michael Mann style, as John Dillinger and his gang orchestrate an elaborate plan to break-out their remaining gang members still held up in prison. Following the break-out and a resulting shoot-out in which Dillinger's mentor Walter Dietrich (James Russo) is killed, we are shown the other side of the law as FBI Agent Melvin Pervis (Christian Bale) hunts down famous Depression-era criminal Pretty Boy Floyd (Channing Tatum). The film then primarily revolves around Agent Pervis's pursuit of the elusive bank robber and romantic. Minor plot points pertaining to the time period are covered briefly in-between including an incredibly strong performance from Billy Crudup as the Director of the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover, who is constantly fighting for further recognition of the Bureau's activities and power within the American system of law and justice.<br/><br/>Depp, as always, brings to life the character he is playing as he uses the little characterisation he has been given to turn Dillinger into a womanizer, a man with principles, but at the same time a human being who doesn't mind spilling blood for the greater good – the bigger picture. However, the substantial effort Depp places into the role of Dillinger cannot salvage it from the little depth Mann chooses to explore in Dillinger and the surrounding cast, which can be attributed primarily to the fact that with so many different characters involved in the minor side-stories in the film there simply isn't enough time for Mann to expose the main characters in depth. Yet, despite this major flaw in the film, Mann still manages to bring his exciting, and startlingly realistic action-set-pieces to life.<br/><br/>When the Dillinger clan is cornered in a cabin in the woods by the rabid law-enforcement officers looking for Mr Public-Enemy Number One, a brilliantly shot shoot-out takes place between the two sides of the law in which every window pane of glass broken and every empty shell-casing disposed of is startling photographed in such beautiful realism that it places there and removes you from simply being a impartial audience member to one of men holding a tommy-gun and firing aimlessly for your life. As we have come to get used to, Mann takes advantage of his skill for shooting violent-action oriented scenes, whether it is a shoot-out, a murder or the many bank robberies that we see Dillinger commit, and brings the audience closer to the action happening just in front of them. Aside from the cinematography a solid soundtrack, including Otis Taylor's brilliant Ten Million Slaves, seems to compliment the 1930's depression-era almost perfectly and is guaranteed to get you tapping your foot to the beat.<br/><br/>Mann's 'Public Enemies' is a competent crime-drama that contains just enough exciting set-pieces and charm to win over most audiences for the two hours it is on-screen, but it is by no means a flawless piece of cinema. The lack of characterisation is a serious flaw in Mann's well-layered film, while the fact that the film also plays around with history and has certain important events occurring before they actually did also takes away from the historical accurate nature of the film."

"vampiremeg","8","0","2","20 October 2009"," I think it is a pretty good movie...!
","Well, first of all, I have to make it clear that I am not an American so that by no means shall I know this character better than any American. Moreover, I believe a foreigner can be more easily attracted by this film, since he/she doesn't know it equally well as an American. And, my comments are based on the above statement and a possibly consequentially biased perspective.<br/><br/>I believe all shall agree that the casting is wonderful. Johnny Depp is the one that brings John Dillinger back to life. I was told that the director Michael Mann initially wanted Leonardo DiCaprio. Though I agree that Leonardo is also a good actor, I still believe that Johnny Depp is THE ONE. His wild and sexy charms, especially that kind of tricky smiles that hold a natural contempt against authorities, is just what we can see from a poster of John Dillinger.<br/><br/>As I watched the film, I gradually got convinced of this. Johnny has shown his understanding of the character and put on his face very naturally the multidimensional inner world of Dillinger: On the one hand, Dillinger holds unmatchable confidence in his strong executive abilities in cold blood, a defiance against then police officials, and quite a sense of narcissism oriented towards public popularity. On the other, he was a dreamer, lover and believer in freedom. Johnny Depp, with his complicated temperament and unbelievable range of roles, has nailed everything of the above.<br/><br/>Christian Bale also did a good job. I cannot understand those who claimed he was too obscure in the film. Let's judge his performance based on the character. Purvis didn't boast an out-going personality at all. Reviewing the history, we can find he was just the type of person who believed in the public good, the ultimate right, and gave his best to his job. That is why Christian Bale's controlled performance delivered a decent result, let us say ""Grace Under Pressure"". But in the Little Bohemian Lodge gun fights, Christian Bale kept shooting the gang nearly dead, with hatred glaring...This was an burst-out and a release of long-time pressure and hatred.<br/><br/>Another issue is HD cinematography. Since the director favored long scenes of gunfighting. He'd better do it by HD. Besides, the great sense of style of 30s America also needs HD to make the best of it. Still, there were so many night scenes, and the actors' movements and facial expressions need to be made clean, so HD is needed. We have to admit that HD was used because the director needed it...<br/><br/>Some viewers argued that there is a sort of inconsistency in cinematography of the film. Sometimes it looked like a master's work, and sometimes a beginner's. I guess they argued this because some scenes did look dodgy, unstable, and almost impatient, especially those gunfights. But I think there was a purpose behind it: the director wanted to make the gunfight scenes real, something you are supposed to see when you are shooting the gangs while chasing them...Yet, we have to admit that the result, when seen from the whole movie, is not so good, largely because you cannot only make the gunfights something like a documentary and at the same time the rest scenes a drama...<br/><br/>Though I love its casting, its cinematography, its fashion style, and its score, I have to say the plot is a failure, and I am pretty sure that this failure will much likely lead to the failure of the movie as a whole.<br/><br/>Just like what I stated in the beginning of this article, many Americans knew the episode pretty well. But this movie certainly didn't make them know it better. The plot can be easily summarized as ""Dillinger escaped - He robbed again - In jail but escaped again - robbed and robbed - finally got caught and dead""...I can see the movie's writers studied Dillinger's life and intended to attach importance to the most decisive moments, but we all knew them, didn't we? Even a foreigner like me can know all these from Wikipedia, let alone the Americans who worshiped him for decades...<br/><br/>But it will be unfair if we say the director made no effort to explore more of the character. Echoing what I said about Johhny Depp's great performance, I believe the director tried to show how complicated John Dillinger was as a person. But, he only did it by arranging several dialogs with Marion Coutillard, Christian Bale, and the gang friends...and these were just NOT ENOUGH. Besides, these dialogs, though pretty brilliantly written, were too subtle in their expression and not likely to be spoken by a man who robbed and killed. More clever plots that told his deep inside shall be added, and the gunfight scenes deserved to be cut...<br/><br/>As a summary, I would say this is a good film, made by supreme technical skills and a carefully-chosen casting. The fashion style, the sound mixing, the score and the controversial HD cinematography were to me fantastic, but the plot was not good, which would ultimately gave it a mediocre reception from the critics..."

","You know Gangster flicks have lost there touch over the years, they've become more and more attuned to the times and they've lost the real true sense of what a Gangster movie use to be. This film is a throwback to an Era and a style of film making long lost to time itself.<br/><br/>Public Enemies chronicles one of Prohibitions greatest and most notorious criminals. John Dillinger. This film was a breath of fresh air in the fact that it didn't use the things that have become so common in Crime films or even modern Gangster epics at that, It doesn't use pervasive language or Violence, it doesn't use strong sexuality(which in some is needed and some not so much.) and it also doesn't use constant drug use . It's done old school so that you can enjoy your time watching it while not being turned off by it at the same time, it's great on many levels It's kinetic energy and wild bank robberies and chases make it fun and really cool to watch. But what made this a great film is the fantastically crafted story and script by Michael Mann and his team it is thanks to him that this movie is elevated high above the regular gangster movie and shoots off into movie greatness.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp(who doesn't seem to stop blowing my mind.) pulls another ace out of his sleeve and makes this movie one of his best and one of cinema's best. His portrayal of Dillinger is both smart and ruthless , cunning and slick it is he who brings up the caliber of this film and makes it so great to watch unfold in front of you. Christian Bale( needs to get an Oscar.) Does exceptional as the relentless blood hound of an FBI agent Melvin Purvis, his smart and unflinchingly ruthless portrayal of Dillinger's enemy is nothing short of breathtaking and brilliant. Marion Cotillard(who I never heard of before this movie.) Is not as good as I thought she could be, seeing as she won an Oscar, she kind of dragged in some places and was kind of not the strong willed type she fit the more "" I need to be taken care of"" type, but none the less she did alright. But all in all the great cast holds up nicely and pulls no punches or stops to make this a fantastic film.<br/><br/>Public Enemies is possibly one of the year's best films(No Transformer's II does not count.) It's smart, witty, clever, dangerously addictive, well played out and exceptionally well acted. It's again, as I say, a film to be relished and admired for it's style and atmospheric sense of honor to the 30's, Michael Mann creates yet another great entry in film history and can now be looked upon as one of cinema's great directors his film is nothing short of genius and bold and if you see it I can promise you it will deliver a great movie going experience. All in all Public Enemies delivers."

"bluesman-20","Null","0","1","19 September 2009"," We're the John Dillinger gang and we're the best in the business.
","Public Enemies is a beautifully written well acted film that makes you actually long for the long ago days of the dirty thirties where Big Time gangsters roamed the country robbing banks and capturing the public's imagination. Dillinger was often called The Robin Hood of bank robbers and that was because Dillinger saw the people suffer at the hands of the banks and he went out of his way to help them. that's one reason why Dillinger was allowed to run free for so long the public LOVED him. Public Enemies captures this beautifully making Dillinger a public idol and a wanted fugitive at the same time. Mann gets the story almost right he pays attention to the little details such as the Night Dillinger is killed his signal to start was the lighting of his cigar. Christian Bale delivers a powerhouse performance that almost overpowers the Film While Depp simply Is the film. However since this is a Hollywood version of the Dillinger story facts never get in the way of the legend. This is one of the Dillinger films out there worth seeing the other being Dillinger (1973) with Warren Oates as John Dillinger and the 40's film of Dillenger. This now the only third worthwhile film of John Dillinger worth seeing and it paints an incredible picture of Melvin Purvis as a dedicated Agent determined to get John Dillinger. The Era is captured beautifully the details are in place and the story is well written with an incredible cast that is like the Dillinger gang they're the best in the business."
"alienworlds","Null","0","2","17 September 2009"," Interesting take on gangsters of the 30's
","This is an interestingly well done movie that just happens to be about gangsters. Well, just kidding-it really is a well done gangster movie-with some of the best cinematography I have ever seen in any film-quite something really-like you are standing right there with them back in the 1930's. Great shoot out scenes, and it shows what a fledgling organization the early FBI was-who by the way, adopted a picture of John Dillinger for use as a pistol target for their shooting ranges. If this film is correct, they killed John Dilinger with several surprise shots while he was walking down the street in the evening-one shot to the back of the head and one through his chest entering via his back-which is not quite the same as giving someone a trial. The acting was perfect and the scenes were well thought out. I think was worth a look."
"jzappa","7","0","1","16 September 2009"," I Would Not Care About the Inaccuracies as Much if the Film Didn't Disguise Itself as a Painstakingly Genuine Docudrama.
","Public Enemies masquerades in digital camera-work, painstakingly nuanced settings and period details that go so far as to be actual objects held by the characters in real life, the movie disguising as a hyper-realistic docudrama when it is really a complete and utter butchery of history. I would not care about the historical inaccuracies as much if the film were given a more romantic treatment by its cameras, sets and props. It is a novel technique for Michael Mann to bring his recent adoption of digital film-making to the Hollywood biopic, but it gives us every signal that we are watching dramatized history when we are watching nothing but fiction. So there have been many biopics which have taken poetic license, but why do so when the true story is head over heels more intriguing and surprising? When compared to opening the film by featuring Dillinger in prison breaks he did not and could not have been involved in, thus propelling the narrative in a fictitious direction immediately, I don't mind the script having Dillinger and Melvin Purvis meet each other; it is undeniably Mann's echo of the key scene between cop and criminal in his masterpiece Heat, in a strikingly different context. (Rather than blending into the hustle-bustle of L.A., Purvis and Dillinger talk on either side of jail bars in the middle of the sticks, in a time where men on opposite sides of the law knew the starkly defined doctrine of right and wrong too well to permit themselves empathy for each other as the two leads of Heat do in a modern age where the line is much thinner.) But consider the gunfight at the wooded lodge: In reality, over seventy exiting patrons were accosted by mistaken FBI gunfire and Dillinger's gang got away clean. Purvis was not a cool, patient hero but an under-qualified officer tormented by his constant mishaps under pressure. Mann uses it as an excuse for an admittedly spectacular Tommy gun fight between cops and robbers. As a result of his urge to force in great gunplay, every single Dillinger associate who survived him in reality is killed in the movie, all instances being completely different than the way they actually died. Baby Face's real death was a sheer phenomenon that this impatient and simple-minded film revises completely.<br/><br/>Mostly, it is Mann's focus on Dillinger's relationship with Billie Frichette that mutes its impact. Dillinger never had less than two girls at a time, whereas this film not only jacks the tear jerking romantic love-at-first-sight convention up to 100 degrees but also portrays Dillinger's legendary death purely in terms of how sad it is that the lovebirds won't be seeing each other anymore. This, too, affects true account in unnecessary and even implausible ways.<br/><br/>This is not a terrible film. Mann finds great success in bringing Dillinger's middle-class folk hero status to veritable life. Johnny Depp is not playing the clever hood based on other movie gangster performances he has seen. He fits into a kindred link with the man's earthy, down-home clarity. He plays Dillinger as a fact, and we thoroughly believe every behavioral note he hits. It is a perfect performance. That goes for every performance, in their own ways, whether they're hemmed by the script or they require something off-putting like Billy Crudup's transatlantic accent playing J. Edgar Hoover.<br/><br/>Maybe the reason Mann and his co-writers permit him to outlive his associates is because in the minds of the succeeding generations in flyover country, he has. Born and raised in Ohio, I know older people who have but a very few degrees of separation from Dillinger. As opposed to the American coasts, where the country truly is a melting pot and not nearly as much comes as a surprise or a break from the norm, the American Midwest is an incurably normal region of general traditions and populist values, where a dangerous criminal who was involved in the deaths of several police officers, robbed at least two dozen banks and four police stations, escaped from jail twice and was idolized as a modern-day Robin Hood considerably stands out against the backdrop. Thus the deeds of Dillinger and his gang controlled the attention of the American press and its readers during the Depression era, a period which led to the result of the current, more advanced FBI.<br/><br/>As an entertainment, there are so many highlights here, especially Stephen Graham's maniacal portrayal of Baby Face Nelson. Tommy may not have been named after a gun, but here we learn he unequivocally should've been. There's Marion Cotillard's prudent, humble performance as Dillinger's main squeeze, the various creatively captured Tommy gun fights and the idealistic use of Otis Taylor's great song 10,000 Slaves. But whatever rationalizations can be made for the romanticization of the Dillinger story, there simply is no reason why we should be deprived of the remarkable, fascinating and truly presently poignant true account of it, which is incomparably more engrossing."

","I saw this film in theaters during the summer, and didn't know what to expect. I was excited for the film when I first heard about it, I loved the idea of Johnny Depp, one of the best actors out there, playing the infamous John Dillinger.<br/><br/>I was disappointed when I read a review of 2 stars in People Magazine, so I thought that the film might not have lived up to all of the hype. I still wanted to see it (I usually don't agree with People) and when I read the Rolling Stone (who I usually DO agree with) of 3 1/2 stars I was sure I needed to see it.<br/><br/>The first thing you should know about this movie, is that it feels unlike any other gangster movie around, sure it has all the typical mob stuff, entourage of interesting characters, supportive spouse who you can tell is hurting deep down, and totally bad-ass heists, but this film shows the true colors of mob movies like Goodfellas, The Godfather, and Donnie Brasco.<br/><br/>In one scene, Dillinger laughs at the way Hollywood depicts gangster life while at a movie theater. The gangster life in this film is unglorified, brutal, and honest. If you come to this movie expecting giant mansions, armies of thugs, and supermodel mistresses you will be very disappointed. This movie shows the truth on America's most infamous bank robber, and the fear behind the life.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is phenomenal as John Dillinger. He understands that this is a different kind of gangster movie, so he doesn't act like everyone else in these roles. Depp could pull off a good performance by just being cocky, but Depp goes deeper, finding the man behind the fame and the fear in his eyes is just barely noticeable if your paying attention.<br/><br/>Depp is not the only great performance here, Christian Bale is the enforcer of the law with hardly any similarities to Bruce Wayne, he's dedicated to stopping crime and steps in when he sees a lack of the law within the police. Billy Crudup is almost eerie as J. Edgar Hoover, in his hunt for Dillinger. Marion Cottilard, who I was not familiar with prior to this movie was also fantastic as Dillinger's love Billie, and shines throughout the film but her talents really shows toward the end.<br/><br/>This is a fantastic film through and through, I recommend this to anyone and everyone. It may sound a little bit like this movie may take itself too seriously but there is still a myriad of hilarious moments that are there to solidify Dillinger as the biggest bad-ass of the last century."

","When i entered the theater to go see ""Publice Enemies"" I thought it was just going to be used as an excuse to get Hollywood's two biggest leading men (Johnny Depp and Christian Bale) in a movie together and sell as many tickets as possible. But I was pleasantly surprised that the movie was actually very well thought out and delightfully entertaining. It was one of the highlights of the 2009 summer block buster season for me.<br/><br/>Though I did have several problems with the movie. The problems i have include; Michael Mann is a big fan of using choppy camera motions that can be a little annoying, Christian Bale is a bit two-dimensional at times, and I couldn't understand why Johnny Depp spoke with a southern accent when John Dillinger was from Indiana.<br/><br/>But the film does have great shots of Chicago and the bank robbing scenes are executed exquisitly (kudos to Michael Mann). All in all ""Public Enemies was great for the summer block buster season. I don't know what kind of Oscar chances it has but I wish it well. (Johnny Depp is due for one)"
"dromasca","7","0","1","5 September 2009"," Michael Mann takes on Dillinger
","The gangster movies are by now one of the most well-established film genres. Born in the American reality of the 20s and 30s, as time passes they slowly become a genre that expands internationally and also reflects much about the times the films are made besides and they do so while retelling stories that have already become history and bringing to screen characters that have become legend.<br/><br/>So is Michael Mann's 'Public Enemies'. One interesting aspect this film raises is the relation between popular culture - especially cinema - and the real lives of the 30s gangsters. Before becoming heroes on screen these bad guys were inspired in their deeds by heroes on screen. A scene in 'Public Enemies' close to the final shows Dillinger (acted by Johnny Depp) taking inspiration from a screen criminal acted by Clark Gable. Earlier we see the mobsters meeting in cinema theaters, watching newsreels and cartoons, and also playing with the press a public relation game that was much part of their ego and also of their fight for survival.<br/><br/>'Public Enemies' goes far in researching the epoch, using original settings, fitting the wardrobe, weapons or music to the time it describes. From this point of view the achievement is remarkable, and it's one of the reasons the film almost never loses the grip on its viewers, despite the two hours and twenty minutes of screening which seems to have become almost standard in Hollywood lately. Well documented is also the story of the formation of the institutions that are fighting crime nation-wide as well as the relations between the bank robbers and the emerging organized crime institutions of the time. What is missing from the film is the psychological justification of the behavior of the characters. Dillinger and his friends, super-cops Hoover and Purvis (acted by Christian Bale) are just what they are - gangsters and cops, bad guys and good guys, and director Mann seems to tell us to take them as a given. A couple of lines tell something about Dillinger's unhappy childhood, mother died young, abusing father, and that's it - an average guy with great talent for organization falls on the bad side of law and life. His romantic interest with Billie Frechette (French actress Marion Cotillard, deserving a much better role) is also average, and gets a tragic nuance only in the context of Dillinger never being able to fulfill his promise to protect her - from what? from himself actually. We learn even less, actually nothing about what made tick cop Purvis in risking his life to become a chief mob fighter.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp and Christian Bale are two formidable actors and they give both memorable performances here. Depp looks bad dangerous and dangerous any moment on screen, he is also charismatic and unfulfilled. His bravura seems to hide uncertainty, his thrive of living today is determined by the knowing that there will not be many tomorrows for him. Bale is entering his character as he always seems to do in the movie she acts in, up to the feeling that he lives the lives of his heroes. The rest of the cast is OK, but the lead performances being that strong it looks like all the other are gravitating around the two.<br/><br/>In a period of crisis, with many contemporaries of ours questioning the systems that govern our lives characters like Dillinger exercise fascination. They were public enemies, enemies of the system of their time, fighting it their way. Yet, they were evil, robbing banks is not the solution for anything, same as the nowadays corrupt financial schemes are not a solution for anything. Showing the real life of such characters that became popular heroes of some kind may help in understanding this message."

","That's right. The movie is totally based on Johny Depp's brilliant performance, but lacks a lot of everything. Digital did not affect me at all, and I thought the camera work was brilliant (although I was a bit confused at first, but caught up with it). Musically, I think it passes you by; It's playing good old Rock at one point, then jumps to forced Neo-Classics or 30's Jazz (which went along quite well). Christian Bale is a total joke on this movie, as well as all the other characters (with a very minor exception from Marion Cotillard), but he is especially bad; not as an actor, but as a character. He has no depth, whatsoever, and when it tries to come out, seems too fake to be believed. Marion Cotillard has a very normal job, but never dislikable. Michael Mann, although created something I didn't like as much, scored one important objective: you love John Dillinger as much as ""the public"". Speaking of which, he fails miserably on showing Dillinger's connection to the public (you only see vague parts, rushed in) and on the love story, which is faded in a very dark tile. Although, I think one becomes in love with John Dillinger, as the character, because of Johny Depp, that invades the screen. The movie also seems a lot fictional, but you get rather confused, since it's based on ""facts""."
"mdassen80","6","0","2","3 August 2009"," Solid acting, but not a very surprising plot
","Being an admirer of Johnny Depp, I had to see this film. And again, it was a very solid performance in my opinion as John Dillinger. He wasn't the only one who shone here though. Christian Bale did just as good a job as Johnny's FBI counterpart. Furthermore I liked the (repeating)score, it fitted the atmosphere.<br/><br/>I didn't know John Dillinger's story before seeing this film. I only saw a trailer and read that John was a bit of a Robin Hood kinda guy. So for me, a plot twist would have been actually surprising. <br/><br/>I must say, looking at the story, it lacked surprises. On the other hand, the story of John Dillinger couldn't be radically changed of course. It is just the way it is. So keeping that in mind, than this is a good production.<br/><br/>If you like mafia/crime/heist movies, you'll probably think this film is at least OK. If you are interested in John Dillinger and know his story, it is probably even better. For me...I must say, I expected more of this...maybe too high expectations."
"ddelamaide","6","0","1","3 August 2009"," Crime doesn't pay
","The expression is as trite as this movie. Dillinger thought he was smarter than the G-men and he wasn't even though it wouldn't have taken much. There is no new insight into what drives a person to a life of crime, though Johnny Depp does try to infuse some humanity into the empty script he's given.<br/><br/>I think the script is the main problem here. Depp does what he can, but Marion Cotillard is heroic, making a real person emerge from the zilch she is given in the script.<br/><br/>Big actors filled many of the minor parts -- Billy Crudup shows a side of J. Edgar Hoover (the young side) that we haven't seen before. Somebody should make a film of Ken Ackerman's Young J. Edgar Hoover and let Crudup develop his characterization.<br/><br/>The digital filming shows us the future of cinema.

Bale and Depp doesn't act bad, but I don't know, seems to me like they both played a version of themselves instead of the characters they were supposed to portray. Depp looks like Depp this time, he has no wig or something, in Public Enemies he looks just like himself and that is a shame, I know Depp could have act much better, people who see this movie will agree: he's just himself, he's not Dillinger. Lawrence Tierney was Dillinger in one of the first movies about the life of JD (Johnny Depp/John Dillinger?) and he did it good, he was a real JD. Christian Bale had got the same problem: he doesn't act at all. in fact, his appearance here reminded me at the part he played in American Psycho. conclusion: Public Enemies isn't that good."

","Any movie with Johnny Depp is a must see as far as I'm concerned. The greatest actor of his generation by far, so add to that the raging 30s, John Dillinger and some tommy-guns and I'm there.<br/><br/>John Dillinger to some extent represented the end of an era. Glorification of crime under the smile of slippery bank-robber John Dillinger as the modern Robin Hood was a product of a certain era of American prosperity and then its downfall. Roosevelt and the end of the Great Depression brought about a new reality and Dillinger fell as quickly as he rose to fame.<br/><br/>To some extent this is a movie about the changes coming about. Unfortunately this momentous occasion to delve into the unbelievable mindset of the era was wasted and we got more cat-and-mouse with just a couple of flashes of analysis. Johnny Depp is brilliant as always, but his character was led into a corner with lacking character development.<br/><br/>The movie hints and suggests but doesn't actually have the courage to delve into the era. Add to that the shaky cam and semi-professional look of the picture and we are in for a disappointment. Michael Mann seems to think that a jumping picture is 'innovative' and 'adds a modern look'. As far as I'm concerned all it adds is viewer headaches. Minus 2 stars for the appalling picture that almost makes the movie unwatchable on the big screen."

Yes I made it all the way to the end but at the same time I had no idea where it was going. Yes I know it was going to the Biograph Theater, but at the same time I wasn't quite sure why. I think the problem is that the film, even at 140 minutes is not long enough. There are whole volumes that seem to be missing from the tale. Characters come and go and bend into one another. Melvin Purvis is a cypher. Outside of Depp's Dillinger and Marion Cotillard's Billie I knew nothing about the characters. The casting of recognizable actors like Stephen Lang or James Russo seem to import a bigger weight then they receive, though Russo's presence is strong enough to hang over the entire film. I really don't know what to make of it.<br/><br/>Yes you will want to see this if you have a good home theater system since the shoot outs will rattle your windows, outside of that I really don't know what to say other than if you're interested give it a try.

There is basically nothing wrong with the performances by Johnny Depp, Christan Bale and especially Billy Crudup as Hoover, but I wish that Mann would have delved a little deeper into what made Dillinger the admired and feared figure that he was.<br/><br/>We see him escaping from prison but we are essentially left in the dark about how he was able to outsmart the law time and time again. There is a scene reminiscent of the one in Heat, where Bale's and Depp's characters come face to face but afterward there is no resolution. Bale's character is oddly uninvolved with the capture of Dillinger at the Biograph.<br/><br/>Instead we are presented with the long time tradition in cops vs. robbers films of bad guys on both sides. There is an especially nasty sequence with the law interrogating a witness. On the criminals' side we get Baby Face Nelson, who is made out to be such a caricature that he doesn't tickle the funny bone at all, you merely wonder why Dillinger didn't plug him after the first heist. The movie doesn't explain why they were associates.<br/><br/>Depp is absolutely one of the greatest assets to have in a movie, but if the character he is given is so nondescript, you can't be anything but disappointed. Depp is not needed here. If Bale and Depp had switched roles it wouldn't have made any difference."

","I was reminded of the film Bonnie & Clyde in which we see a vast expanse of the great plains with grass blowing in the wind, and then a shadow of a cloud rolls across the grass creating an effect of vast isolation for the criminals. A vastness that goes on forever giving the feel that raises the question of what are the criminals escaping to? The latest film staring Johnny Depp as John Dillinger directed by Michael Mann is a decent period film with the costumes, set designs and locations but has a feel of claustrophobia. The camera never really lets us see the whole surroundings of the bank robbers or the G-Men. Everything is up close and tight with a little camera shake at times plus the characters seem to be always in the dark even when it's daytime. Maybe that is what Mann wanted, to give a feel of not knowing what is around you, of always looking over your shoulder. Depp is good as always playing Dillinger and there is never a short supply of action. One interesting scene has Johnny walking into a police station and then precedes to walk slowly around the desks looking at mug shots of his gang, and even asks a group of cops(who do not even recognize him) listening to a ball game on the radio what the score is. Now do you suppose this really happened? As public enemy number one I doubt very much Dillinger would have been that stupid or careless. In any case this is still a watchable film with good performances all around....I just wish that camera would have opened up a little bit."
"StanleyStrangelove","Null","0","1","20 July 2009"," Rent an old gangster film instead
","Public Enemies is an example of style over substance. It looks good and the numerous tommy gun shootouts are okay but that's about all you get with the film. The problem is in the story. Dillinger, played by Johnny Depp, is never explained. We learn nothing about his past. He is portrayed as a ruthless bank robber who thinks nothing of taking out cops with sprays of tommy gun fire, yet is supposed to be kind-hearted to hostages. The mythical psychopath with a heart of gold. Baloney. Depp's natural charisma is totally wasted in the film and his relationship with Marion Cotillard is not interesting. Frankly, Dillinger is a boring character. Christian Bale is Melvin Purvis who is appointed by Billy Crudup (J. Edgar Hoover) to track down Dillinger. This storyline is not interesting, as say in the Fugitive where Tommy Lee Jones and Harrison Ford play an interesting game of cat and mouse. Not in this film. Even the Hoover role is not developed. The significance of Dillinger, according to the film, is that his string of bank robberies helped in the formation of the FBI, which didn't exist previously, but the historical backdrop is not explored which could have made a good movie in itself. So we are left with multiple story lines and no details. Public Enemies is not in the same league as The Godfather or any of the Martin Scorcese films or any of the Edward G. Robinson or James Cagney gangster films. Save your money and rent an old gangster film instead. Not recommended.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp ... John Dillinger<br/><br/>Christian Bale ... Melvin Purvis<br/><br/>Billy Crudup ... J. Edgar Hoover<br/><br/>Marion Cotillard ... Billie Frechette"

","There is no story here, nothing but an incompetent script. And there's no film really, as is the case with so many big bankroll Hollywood films. Script? The story devices used are worn out and hackneyed, and poorly executed to boot. I didn't feel anything for any of the characters in Public Enemies.<br/><br/>The biggest sinner is composer Elliot Goldenthal, who must have been dipped in chloroform overnight before scoring this. I can't help but think he must have purposefully meant to insult real film composers living and dead. He rips off John Coltrane's ""Afro Blue,"" slows it down to a snail's pace, and passes it off as a theme.<br/><br/>I was shocked to see Michael Mann, the director of ""The Insider"" and ""Heat,"" appear on the screen after this clunker. Mann has completely lost his touch, and worse, his sense of who to cast in his leading roles. Not only do the actors have nothing to work with; Depp has lost his depth and magnetism as an actor. But who is there in Depp's generation who is doing great work? Neither Depp, nor Leo DiCaprio, nor Colin Farrel, have unique voices that interest the ear. They still talk like teenagers. I doubt anyone could tell who was talking if they heard just audio without a face shown. Sure, these actors have emotional resources, screen presence, but I don't hear any truth or depth of feeling in their voices. Next to their UK contemporaries, or Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon, Tim Robbins - or even Matt Damon, they are lightweights.<br/><br/>I felt Public Enemies was a arrant waste of my time. I learned nothing, felt nothing, saw nothing, heard nothing satisfying. Putting Marion Cotillard in this rotten sausage of a film after her Oscar-winning turn as Edith Piaf is a slap in the face more brutal than her character's interrogation scene. No great actress should have to endure such a waste of her talent. The same goes for Lily Taylor's cameo. Michael Mann needs to spend some time studying Clint Eastwood (""Million Dollar Baby,"" "" Mystic River"") or Sidney Lumet if he's going to get his grit back. He evidences no sense of truth in this dismal failure."

","Hollywood has tried to make history more exciting in movies. 10,000 B.C, Braveheart, 300 and even The Da Vinci Code had some social studies packed in it somewhere. Public Enemies tries to retell the story of John Dillinger, the notorious 1930s bank robber. But who could portray Dillinger? Nobody could possibly live up to play himbut Johnny Depp looks a little bit like the guy. Enter Depp as Dillinger, opening the movie being taken to prison. He later tricks the guards and shortly him and the other convicts escape. And what do you know, Johnny robs some more banks, and the rest is pretty much repeated for the whole two and a half hour runtime. It's only when Christian Bale enters the scene when the movie gets exciting. Bale plays FBI Bureau chief Melvin Purvis, a guy who is just losing his mind over the bank robber. ""He's making a mockery of the U.S justice system!"" He follows him to cabins, movie theaters, apartments, etc, etc. His role is one of the best in the movie; however not to say that the rest of the cast was bad (Marion Cottilard especially was fantastic), it's that Bale once again really gets into his role as he always does. The Dark Knight, Rescue Dawn, Terminator Salvation. Now remember questions were stirring when the posters for Public Enemies came out and Bale wasn't on any of them? Because this is Depp's movie, not Christian Bale's; he's had his fair share! What Enemies is saying is fairly simple: ""Depp is back, bitches."" Michael Mann is no stranger to shoot-em-up flicks. This is the guy who directed Miami Vice, Collateral, Heat and produced The Kingdom, Hancock and Nobody Loves Alice among many others. One thing that you notice is that his style of film-making is that of a documentarian or a Michael Bay movie. The gunshot scenes are explosive, yet you won't know who's shooting who or what. My friend even pointed out that the top of the character's heads aren't visible for nearly half of the movie. In the beginning this is kind of funky (did I just say that?), but by the third shoot-out, it's pretty damn annoying.<br/><br/>Public Enemies isn't that bad of a movie, but it's not fantastic either. It is, however, the most historically accurate movie about the golden age of crime I've seen so far. Don't rush out and see it, but don't skip out on what is yet another memorable role for Johnny Depp without Tim Burton.<br/><br/>3/5 stars."
"rjyelverton","6","0","2","13 July 2009"," Digital video hobbles novel take on crime
","So it seems that Director Michael Mann has permanently graduated from the use of film to muddy, mundane digital video. And it's a shame. In collaboration with cinematographer Dante Spinotti (""L.A. Confidential""), Mann brought us the visually lush ""Last of the Mohicans"" and ""Heat."" Even the less epic Russell Crowe muckraking film ""The Insider"" had a sharp, compelling presentation. Digital video (DV) is considerably cheaper which undoubtedly gives the director more control over the film. (Keep your film under budget and studios are more apt to stay out of your way.) DV, however, is ugly. It's pretty bad at capturing rapid movement, making action scenes less intelligible. DV is also apt to let light overpower an image and it takes away the traditional visual crispness associated with the heightened reality of cinema.<br/><br/>Mann first used DV in the Tom Cruise/Jamie Foxx film ""Collateral"" and it lent that film veracity and a feeling of ""being there."" In his follow-up ""Miami Vice,"" Mann's use of digital video underlined the vapidity of the source material rather than allowing Mann to revel in the film's glitzy, dangerous setting. The cinematography in ""Public Enemies"" is mostly tolerable, but it still hobbles the film. Take for instance a scene where John Dillinger, played by Johnny Depp declares his undying love for girlfriend Billie (Marion Cotillard) while at a sun drenched Miami race track. The camera raises dramatically for an overhead shot of the couple and the lush Elliot Goldenthal score kicks in and the moment fizzles. Digital video, at least as used by Mann, is incongruous with traditional dramatic cinema technique.<br/><br/>The film does offer a fascinating take on bank robber Dillinger. He lived his life in public and was a fascination of the press and public. He flaunted the law and seemed to live above it. J. Edgar Hoover, played by the always excellent Billy Crudup, decides to take down Dillinger in order to boost the credibility of the under fire FBI. Mann packs his film with a solid supporting cast and offers a unique take on the gangster story, but his visual technique never allows the film to take off. Some great performances; a forgettable film."
"milofromtheblock","7","0","2","13 July 2009"," Good but nowhere near the epic it could be
","Michael Mann returns to the familiar territory of the American Crime drama to explore the life and times of John Dillinger, probably America's most famous bank robber and public enemy number 1. Mann models this as a conflict between the foundations of federal crime fighting and the burgeoning criminal network of the time. Representing the side of law and order is Christian Bale as Melvin Purvis, one the FBI's most famous agents, whilst Johnny Depp plays Dillinger. Shooting in digital Mann brings his usual expertise at accuracy, authenticity and lends an epic scale to the story as well as creating a number of thrilling action sequences particularly an elongated shoot out at a country lodge. The acting is generally high calibre and both leads are excellent and Depp is admirably restrained as Dillinger when compared with his more recent wilder roles. He portrays him as a serious bank robber who knows how to foster his own mythology, one scene where Dillinger is questioned by the press allows Depp to loosen his control and play with his audience. However Dillinger's relationship to the press and the public's reaction to Dillinger is one of a number of interesting topics that the film sheds little light on rendering the near two and a half hour running time a little frustrating.<br/><br/>Mann reduces this story to a battle between two men and adds layers of stereotype and cliché where none were needed. Dillinger's romance with Billie Frechette, a solid if unremarkable turn by Marion Cotillard, is given undue focus and portrayed as the traditional doomed romance between gangster and moll. Mann continues to hint at the more interesting aspects of the story, the way Hoover manipulated the pursuit of Dillinger to get press coverage and support for the FBI, the evolution of crime and crime fighting, the public reaction to the criminals of the era. In one scene near the end of the film Dillinger enters a betting racket run by the mob and witnesses the vast sums they are taking the film briefly touches on the idea that this was the end of an era for bank robbery but, again, goes nowhere with the idea. Similarly on the FBI's side there is continued reference to the transition of tactics to a recognisably modern crime fighting outfit but it is never fully explored despite the length of the film. Purvis witnesses escalating police brutality in their attempts to capture Dillinger and is clearly affected by it but little reference is made to the impact it had on the FBI and on police behaviour in America.<br/><br/>Ultimately Mann has the characters, era and time to create a true classic of American crime but clings too close to the well worn confines of the genre and ultimately the film could really be about anyone and set anywhere and have a near identical plot. That is not to say it's a bad film, it's enjoyable and watchable but Mann had the scope and actors to aim so much higher that it is hard not to be disappointed and a little frustrated with the end result."
"Danusha_Goska","6","0","2","13 July 2009"," Beautifully Composed, but Lacks Narrative Drive
","The scenes in ""Public Enemies"" are beautifully composed. You know you're watching a film by a veteran director with a film school education. The Depression period of brand-name outlaws like John Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson and Pretty Boy Floyd, and the nascent FBI under J. Edgar Hoover, is a fascinating one, and it is recreated here with great attention to fedoras, overcoats, and vintage cars. The soundtrack is lovely and works very well with the images on screen. The film lacks narrative drive, though. It never brings its characters to three dimensional life. As much as I enjoyed all the serious fedora-wearing going on, I was tempted to walk out. There was no narrative drive or tension, and no characters I deeply cared about, gluing me to the screen.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is handsome as ever and exudes movie star charisma, but he is a bad choice for Dillinger. He's ten years too old. Dillinger and many of the other Depression-era outlaws were notorious for their youth, their life on the edges of mainstream society, and their desperation. Depp never looks like a desperate, edgy, young, outsider. He looks like a suave CEO. Christian Bale is as focused and fascinating as ever. In a very brief role, Marion Cotillard is most sympathetic as Dillinger's moll, Billie Frechette. I would really like to see a movie, based on a more powerful script, that featured this same cast.<br/><br/>The film falls into the trap of glamorizing Dillinger, turning him into a tender, devoted, poetic lover. Um  mebbe not. Dillinger had been a thug all his life, beating up other kids in school, quitting good jobs, committing petty crimes, and never learning his lesson. There were reasons why frightened Depression-era Americans, feeling betrayed by banks, glamorized outlaws like Dillinger. I suspect that the loved ones of those men Dillinger and others like him killed would feel differently. The film could have taken up that tough question – why we humans put murderers, from Dillinger to Stalin – on pedestals – but it never does."

","If John Dillinger was even half as brutal as depicted in this movie, then Johnny Depp was the wrong actor for this role. As a 1930s period piece, the movie is excellent, but that cannot be said for the story itself because the movie attempts to portray the lead character, John Dillinger, and his friends as deserving of some empathy which is entirely disingenuous. They were in fact, violent, brutal criminals who were practically asking for what they finally got. So how can one be expected to care about them? Further, Dillinger and his friends are incorrigible but there is no explanation for their aberrant behavior, leaving one to wonder why they were so violent. Not offering any explanation, the movie becomes just another cops and robbers story, but with one big difference: there are no good guys, thus depriving the audience of even that satisfaction of having somebody to root for. Johnny Depp must be given lots of credit for taking on a role that is way out of character for him, but his portrayal simply fails to project the mean-spirited, menacing nature of a man who whose very name is synonymous with crime.<br/><br/>Although Johnny Depp is a wonderful, gifted actor, when it comes to his portrayal of John Dillinger, he is no Warren Oates."

I didn't care for Christian Bale nor did i enjoy the hand held camera although it did give the movie a feeling of that era. It would have been interesting to learn more about John Dillingers life instead of little tidbits of information thrown in. There were several questions left unanswered. Who was the Ukranian(?) woman ? Was that her daughter ? In the court room scene-why even have the female warden there ? What was the point in that ?

"jayroth6","4","0","3","9 July 2009"," Public Enemies: A communist view
","On March 5, 1933 Franklin Roosevelt instituted a Bank Holiday to prop up trust in a faltering capitalism. On May 10, 1933 John Dillinger (1903-1934) and a few fellow knaves began their own bank holiday. By coincidence, Mann's recreation of that time is presented to viewers during the start of a new and unprecedented global depression. Truly, there are no new stories, only new depressions to tell them in.<br/><br/>***** Public Enemies organizes a few scenes around the conflicts between individuals in Hoover's organization. Billy Crudup plays Hoover as a supremely dismissive and epicene Mussolini-in-becoming. He acquires his sinecure by commanding newsreel cameras and such founts of propaganda sewage as Walter Winchell.<br/><br/>Mann has a genuine interest in cop institutions of capitalist rule, though I doubt he would define it this way. In Heat the cop was played by Al Pacino as a narcissist so obsessed with victory he rarely slept; the crook, Robert De Niro, as such a supremo of his craft he could only defeat himself. The final image of that film, with the victorious cop and dying crook holding hands to comfort one-another, perfectly sums-up a century of Hollywood crime dramas: always focus on the individuals.<br/><br/>***** To its producers Public Enemies must have looked like the perfect money-spinner. It would depict a great cops-and-robbers struggle; there was sex appeal and a love story (of a kind), and it explored one of the great tragic themes: a hero (in this case Dillinger) undone by his own flaws. To those who say moviegoers will not pay to see a story already filmed as drama and documentary so many times, the producers could retort that another well-known subject, the Titanic sinking, generated a veritable Fort Knox for its makers.<br/><br/>Public Enemies suffers (as Titanic and Heat do not) from centering its attention on real historical characters. Even when Mann changes facts and alters the chronology, he cannot overcome the stultifying fact that however dramatically he builds his scenes, viewers will always be ten steps ahead, waiting for him to catch up. The shoot-out at Little Bohemia Lodge might have surpassed the LA street shoot-out in Heat, but it cannot because viewers know Dillinger has a rendezvous with death on July 22, 1934.<br/><br/>The real Dillinger, like all past and future Dillingers in the real world, was a lumpen parasite lobotomized by the cash nexus. However charming the old folk songs about Jesse James and Pretty Boy Floyd sung by Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger, these crooks were cretinous individualists and reactionary to the core. They were slapped-down and executed in the streets by cops serving the institutional bandits of Wall Street as an example to others. Crime and theft are expressions of class division and conflict, but only in the most reactionary manner; Dillinger, Karpis, and their ilk aped the most die-hard and vile habits of the acquisitive bourgeoisie.<br/><br/>Christian Bale's Melvin Purvis is the ostensible second lead in Public Enemies. This is because the Purvis-Hoover conflict has been the subject of so much scholarship which attempts to portray Purvis as a true alternative to Hoover's organizational blueprint and personal rule. While liberals may pine, ""If only Purvis had defeated Hoover,"" there were no ideological or organizational differences between the men, only a conflict over pelf and place.<br/><br/>As an actor, Christian Bale has no equal in the ""stony glare"" department. Michael Mann lavishes him with numerous contractually required close-ups. But who can remember anything Purvis says? Purvis is shown to be a tyro surrounded by pencil pushers who must request help and guidance from older hands. Said hands arrive seemingly out of the past, through waves of steam from a passenger train, and look like reincarnations of the Earp brothers.<br/><br/>The movie attempts to present Purvis as the agent who defeated Dillinger, but shows us by simple allegiance to historical fact that that role was played by an agent named Charles Winstead. Throughout the second half of the film, it is Winstead who outwits, out-fights, and finally executes Dillinger. Mann telegraphs his own respect for Winstead as against Purvis by casting the fine character actor Stephen Lang in the role. (Lang is an actor Mann has employed before, most memorably as obnoxious and ill-fated Freddy Lounds in the 1986 movie Manhunter.) Winstead is portrayed as embodying all the wit and professionalism of western lawmen, much as Tommy Lee Jones was used in The Fugutive (1993) and No Country for Old Men (2007). Lang's Winstead is given the final scene, a gem after two ours of predictability. Dramatic logic would demand the Purvis character be given the final scene, as a proper emotional resolution; but since Mann must depict actual events, Purvis is erased before the movie ends.<br/><br/>***** The Dillinger Public Enemies presents is certainly the most handsome movie-star Dillinger we have had. Does every generation get the Dillinger it deserves? In the 1930s, we were given the ""mad dog"" Bogart-style version. In the 1970s, it was the electrifying and now-forgotten Warren Oates in a pseudo-John Ford style directed by John Milius. Today we get Johnny Depp, a handsome and self-knowing Dillinger who dies pursuing the ""get rich quick"" dreams that still bubble-up to bewitch the desperate and outcast in class society. (And not just the desperate and outcast.) The true remedy for crime is solidarity and class consciousness. <br/><br/>That is not the subject of summer movies. Or any movies. For the billionaire families that own and run the United States, class consciousness and solidarity will always be Public Enemy Number One."

Public Enemies opens decently with a fairly exciting action scene, but the rest of the movie devolves into a soulless, lifeless, and style-less documentary of Dillinger vs the FBI. Billy Crudup does a great Hoover, but the rest of the characters are pretty forgettable. After having to sit through Miami Vice (the movie) and this bust, I'm gonna have to say that Michael Mann's lost it.

","I wanted to love this movie.<br/><br/>Every actor in the movie was lovely, talented, and believable. The writing was dull and sparse. I don't believe that this was a movie about the icon of Dillinger. If that was the intent, then the intent was lost in the awkward filming that moves back and forth between digital and hand-held, high res and low res (i.e., grainy)...and for what purpose? The movie is mixed up. Maybe the movie wanted to be too may things, action, love story, biography...and so it failed to be any of those things.<br/><br/>I felt a loss after finishing the movie because there is no insight offered about the man or about the myth of the man. I wanted to know more about Dillinger, or at the very least, be told a captivating story, even a version of his life, or a caricature would have been better. Sadly, no story was there. A taste of each genre, each possibility, but no meat, no matter, no content. The story was presented with the depth of a child's biography or a five minute video clip.

"kgprophet","6","0","1","8 July 2009"," Documentary-style audio diminishes storytelling
","Michael Mann deliberately embraced the HD video camera as a way to shoot in a more documentary style, especially at night. He did that with success in ""Collateral"" (see my review). He evidently tried to up the realism by not only shooting with inferior video (trails from lights), but also inferior audio. I first thought I was being fooled when I first screened the movie. I thought it might be the theatre's sound system. I went to another screening (video projection) which unquestionably had the intended audio mix. My guess is that Mann wanted to mimic what a location sound mixer (which is one of my professions) would do. In this case, you would hear a line delivered very quietly. Then you hear the volume deliberately turned up much louder, as if the sound mixer was compensating for quiet talking. Along with that, the ambient audio is almost nonexistent in some cases. Once again, mimicking the poor sound you get in a low budget documentary, due to the clip-on microphones attached to the actors having a small pickup range. What he apparently wanted to accomplish was the sense we were watching ""Cops"" or something like reality TV. He chose to degrade the quality of the image to cue the audience into believing this was first person footage, like someone in the gang was walking around with a handycam.<br/><br/>But it's not a documentary. And the all too perfect production design and all too good-looking cast never take us out of movieland. Then there are the deliberate face close-ups, using the fine grain on the video to emphasise the pores in people's skin. Once again, attempting to feel real, and in this case it does not detract from the story. Seeing the weathered skin on the characters faces helps illustrate the rough texture of their lives. But in pushing the envelope in degrading the video and audio, Mann sacrifices the level of audience involvement, because the trance is broken when they notice something wrong with the audio. Same with the video, when the camera swishes around, creating obvious video trails, you start thinking about the craft instead of the characters. My main complaint is that those who do not recognise the use of bad sound as a directing decision, they will conclude that either the sound mixer did a bad or rush job, or that the theatre itself has a bad sound system.<br/><br/>As for the acting and story, Mann put together a detail filled depiction of the 1930's, as seen through the eyes of our main characters. Depp doesn't quite come off as human, only coming close when he admits that he never learned how to dance. His subsequent love interest never has any sparks. There should have been a scene with them being human, such as going bowling or something. Some of the dialogue also feels canned. Even if this is supposed to be a subdued script, the lines delivered sometimes sound cliché. I also applaud directors taking chances, but I think there is a thing as too much, such as too much shakycam (thankfully not in this case). This film has too much of an amateur look and sound for an audience to pay $9 for. I still give this film a thumbs up, especially for the terrific period work and cinematography."
"alexandra-25","Null","0","3","6 July 2009"," Surreal narcissism.
","The film Public Enemies (2009) is in its abstract sense an artistic look at surrealism within the context of narcissism. In other words the Gangster has a fascination with crime in an almost comic book like way. This is notable for the literature Dillinger, reads and moreover the Hollowood films such as Manhattan Melodrama (1934) which he watches, and which is about 'gangsters'. These gangsters are glamorised via the prism of a camera lens and the Hollywood public relations machine. That Hollywood machine manufactures stars such as Clark Gable and William Powell and juxtaposition them with gangsters and beautiful women. This is reflected back through gangsters such as Dillinger who emulate their heroes. This is further reflected back through Hollywood films until eventually the stereotyped gangster is born. In a twist of irony this is further reflected by Michael Mann's direction and Johnn Depp's acting in Public Enemies.<br/><br/>The '30s was a time when heroism was being promoted via the likes of Italian fascist Musolini and his adaptation of philosopher, Neitcher's idea of the 'superman'. As such heroism was in vogue. For the likes of Dillinger the Great Depression gave way to opportunities for his like to become the anti-hero, divesting the wealthy banks of their riches, and as such their power gained through the accumulation of money. From a Marxist perspective, the FBI and the police were therefore only protecting the wealthy bank owners from gangsters, rather than the citizens.<br/><br/>This is a film that is clumsily put together. However, it does permit an abstract reading of it. Johnny Depp looks pretty as usual, while Christian Bale was the better actor.<br/><br/>Depite a few anachronisms it was a treat to see men in Fedoras again! If nothing else Public Enemies could promote a Fedora come back, and a market for good old black and white classic cinema of the Hollywood Golden Age, such as in Manattan Melodrama, which seems difficult to get hold of on DVD at present."

Robinson in Little Caesar (1931) that opened the floodgate to a new genre of film: the gangster movie. Built over the years in categories' such as ""classic"" (The Public Enemy), ""social background"" (Angels With Dirty Faces), ""film noir"" (The Maltase Falcon), and the ""historical reconstruction"" etc, etc. It is now well and truly above reproach to say that it has earned its right into the film history vaults. <br/><br/>Public Enemies has the historical reconstruction label put upon it, and this latest outing has John Dillinger facing the music. Played by Johnny Depp with cool persona, who does quite a good job in leaving the viewer feeling a little too distant and unattached. Unlike his counterparts, Cagney and Robinson, for example, from the classic period, who oozed psychotic menace, has this modern day Dillinger looking more sedate and, at times, a sympathetic character. This is a man who, by reputation and vocation, was a bank robbing killer, here, Michael Mann has concentrated on the love angle between Dillinger and Billie Frechette, played by French beau ideal Marion Cotillard (La vie en rose - 2007). <br/><br/>John Dillinger was an evil man, but this feels that the epicentre of his crime wave has been by-passed by a love angle. Yes, we know that every good gangster needs a gangster's moll: Clyde's Bonnie, Tony Montana's Elvira Hancock and Tom Powers' Gwen Allen to name a few, while the work was being done these leading ladies were sidelined, this, Mr. Mann's Public Enemies feels more Kit and Holly's Badlands of 1973. <br/><br/>The sets are fine and the outfits, well, Oscar buzz anyone? The category ""Costume Design"" would be missing a very sharp cut if this film's Colleen Atwood were not nominated; on the other hand, it is the actual feel of lack of depth and lack of connection from the major players here, insofar the lack of detail that is given, only a smattering of information of peoples' past is ever present. This, and at other points in the movie really does feel like a pure reconstruction, akin to Televisions crime programmes, than a piece of work based on the life of John Dillinger and his nemeses Melvin Purvis. This is where this work falls flat, yes, there is atmosphere, tension and interest but the ""historical reconstruction"" label feels like it is skimming the pages of a book rather than sitting down and reading the whole thing proper.<br/><br/>It really is a crime, and to be blunt, if there were ever a film that came across as deep in narrative, tense in action, sincere at heart then, for I, it has to be Terrence Malick's Badlands. Any gangster movie, too, that contains James Cagney: The Public Enemy (1931), The Roaring Twenties (1939) and White Heat (1949) and of course Howard Hawks' masterpiece Scarface (1932). Mr. Dillinger here certainly is on top of his world but he will never reach Top of the World!"
"kgdakotafan","Null","0","4","5 July 2009"," Pretentious, unedited garbage with poor cameramatics
","What can I say that hasn't been said already? The movie should have ended long before it did. I thought the movie was almost over when I was only and hour into it. I kept suppressing the urge to walk out, hopeful that the movie would redeem itself and that something remotely exciting would happen. Nothing happened. And when something that was intended to be exciting or interesting or climactic happened, it was impossible to care because of the way it was presented. The acting was wooden, the script long and weak, the direction underwhelming, the editing non-existent, but more than anything; extremely poor home-made video cinematography.<br/><br/>The cinematography was fuzzy, shaky, and completely out of focus. Even on dialog shots where the camera should have been flat, it wasn't; this made the scenes shaky and remote. This camera style reminded me of ""Children of Men"", except in ""Children of Men"" this camera style wasn't bizarrely and ineffectively overused and every other aspect of that movie was strong.<br/><br/>Basically, it was a weak movie that only received high ratings due to its all-star cast. I found myself looking at my cell phone for the time what seemed to be every half and hour but was actually only two minutes. That's how slow it was. A colossal waste of time and money."
"moselekm","6","0","2","5 July 2009"," Two words, one name: Michael Mann
","Michael Mann makes better decisions as a producer in ratio to his outcomes with films. Allow me to explain with a few movies of his he produced that I thoroughly enjoyed compared to the movies he directed he made that I was ecstatic about. Produced: Aviator, Collateral, Hancock, and the Kingdom. Which of these did he actually direct? Collateral and I really am on a fine line of liking that movie as much as I do. To top it off he didn't help write any of those movies, however he did write the screenplay to: PUBLIC ENEMIES.<br/><br/>Public Enemies was a disappointment and I can say that if a person truly wants to learn more about the 30's and the life of John Dillenger without a book then I suggest watching History Channel's specials on Bank Robbers.<br/><br/>Michael Mann fails to truly give a heavy direction on the mind of Dillenger. Perhaps it was because no one can quite be sure what was going through the minds of the Bank Robber/Good Friend and the FBI agent Purvis. Really the only pin point thing in this movie is it's time line, but at the same time, the time line provided no real time stances on every scene.<br/><br/>Public Enemies did do somethings well. The weapons were very accurate on how they were used, the outfits and the cars were extremely accurate. Also the lines and attitudes used by each character. Michael Mann doesn't do anything close to JUSTICE to the story of John Dillenger and those surrounding him. I believe it would be nice to have seen a little opening of how John Dillenger was raised and the surrounding misfits that came about his time.<br/><br/>The movie can be waited on, it is well drawn out and you may just wish to wait for video so you can fall asleep in the comforts of your own home."
"abdoozy","5","0","3","5 July 2009"," Some movies look better with drugs.
","For this one I should have been on Dramamine. <br/><br/>With the advances in video technology, the film-free Public Enemies *looks* amazing, with astoundingly good cinematography and the appealing style that's Michael Mann's signature.<br/><br/>So why did Mann find it creatively necessary to shoot half the movie without a tripod, or for that matter without a Steadicam? <br/><br/>Hand-held shots are great for tracking through forests or following the action in a fast-moving shootout, but the technique is way overdone here. Even establishing shots, wide-angle scenes inside banks, are given the ""benefit"" of the Shakycam. <br/><br/>The film winds up being dizzying and disorienting. I guess if that's the effect he wanted, Mann pulled it off in spectacular fashion. But anyone prone to visual-induced vertigo should probably give this film a wide berth. <br/><br/>Downgraded a notch due to an upset stomach."
"fx_gent","7","0","2","5 July 2009"," Decent film, but deviates from facts of story.
","By itself, Public Enemies is a fairly decent movie that recreates the atmosphere of the time, the so called golden era of bank robberies through the escapades of John Dillenger. I especially give high marks to the recreation of some of the bank heists and shootings that took place. However, the major failure of this film is its deviation from the facts. Most of us generally understand that movies rooted in true stories will at times stray from the facts to make the story more profitable. What deeply disappointed me was how wide a deviation was taken in a number areas, especially the Little Bohemia shootout. If they had stuck to the facts, they still would have had a good film. Sadly, they decided not to. Would I recommend the film, yes. But do not consider it true fact and take the time to actually read up on what really happened."
"Jackpollins","7","0","1","5 July 2009"," A good but overlong and limited story movie
","The new drama, Public Enemies features great performances by Johnny Depp, Marion Cotillard, Christian Bale, good-looking set pieces, and an entertaining if not detailed enough story. However, it is overlong, and does not feature a good enough back story of John Dillinger (Johnny Depp). Marion Cotillard is great as his girlfriend, Billy. Christian Bale is as well good as his hunter Agent Melvin Purvis. The movie is a good escape for a summer blockbuster that doesn't feature anyone with superpowers, or even any big battle climax at the end. There are no transforming cars, no Spock, no gross-out jokes, no sappy romance, etc. It's an original summer escape from reality (although this is based on a true story.) By the end, you feel like you may have been sitting in your theater seats too long, but you feel satisfied. The performances and limited story (it's a complaint, but it also helps) make the movie more than what some of these forced crime dramas are now. I felt like I got my moneys worth, and then some. Definitely not a perfect movie, but a very, very good one. Do yourself a favor, and go see it."
"raminsabi","5","0","1","5 July 2009"," Missed the potential for something that could have been great
","Public Enemies - an intriguing crime drama set in Depression-era Chicago telling the story of one of the greatest bank-robbers, his love and how he got caught, with a great cast and a renowned director. Sounds good? It should be<br/><br/>This is a film that disappointingly fails to live up to anything it should and easily could have done, except for the one redeeming feature for which I've awarded the film three of its five stars – Johnny Depp's performance. He captures the cool, suave complex genius of the very interesting character of John Dillinger. It is a great shame his performance was held back by a lousy screenplay, as if it were not I would consider the performance a potential Oscar contender.<br/><br/>However the perfection of one performance is not enough to carry through the entire film. The primary problem of Public Enemies as a film in general was its weak plot. It was thin and boring, with little happening other than a loud gunfight every ten minutes or so, which wouldn't be terrible if either the gunfights were fun or the it had something interesting to say either with the content or the style.<br/><br/>Michael Mann had the fantastic potential of being the first director to make a Depression-era movie in the midst of the worst recession since the Depression. However we get not one indication of the fact that the events take place during the Depression. In fact, we have barely any indication it's happening in the thirties other than elements of costume and the cars they drive. In this reviewer's opinion this film instantly cries out to be shot in a 1930s style. The fact that the real John Dillinger modelled his entire existence and behaviour on films he saw after coming out of prison in 1933 after ten years should indicate the appropriateness of an old cinematic style – cheesy lines included. Yet Mann for some reason chooses to shoot the film in HD digital. It had some very nice effects – clear colours and lighting and a beautiful night scene = yet it was completely incongruous to the atmosphere of the 1930s the film should have maintained. The hand-held sharp style is meant for modern edgy intense drama, which this film was not. I don't know why nobody said to Mann before he started shooting in digital 'If you're going to make a Period film, then MAKE A PERIOD FILM!' Also the omission of any mention of the Depression is ridiculous considering the interesting concept of someone stealing huge amounts of money for self-preservation in a time when so many people have none. Even Peter Jackson's 'King Kong' had a significantly better social commentary on the Depression, and that was a movie about a giant gorilla. The film also failed to look into the interesting character that was J. Edgar Hoover – a man so committed to propriety and rigid justice when he was secretly a gay transvestite. It showed him, yet no signs of any sort that he was a remotely interesting person. This is another reason why I almost fail to see the point of making a historical film when you miss out so much of what makes the history interesting. <br/><br/>Further elements of the plot were simply ridiculous: the great love story between John and Billie was based on one two-minute scene, which is meant to make the audience believe that these two people would nearly die for each other. That's quite a suspension of disbelief for a film that's clearly trying to be realistic.<br/><br/>The performances were also quite dreadful. Marion Cotillard, who was so fantastic as Edith Piaf in 'La Vie en Rose', failed to deliver anything interesting to her part other than a weird accent. Cotillard seems to belong alongside Penelope Cruz in the branch of actresses who are brilliant in their own language but fail to act at all when they have to concentrate on speaking English. Christian Bale, who has been continually disappointing recently considering the great potential he has as an actor, gave absolutely no life or intrigue to his character of the determined G-man hunting Dillinger – he was simply a boring cop. Although to be fair to both of them, the screenplay gave them very little to work with in terms of acting or characterisation.<br/><br/>The one good scene is that in which Johnny Depp walks right into the police office supposedly hunting him, looks around, talks to people and nobody notices him. Though mostly due to Depp's performance, this was a brilliantly done scene and earns the film another of its stars.<br/><br/>However such individual things can't redeem the film from the critical ditch where it deserves to lie. Mann did seem to be trying to get a comparison between the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security – the War on Crime to the War on Terror (the idea of the police torturing the suspects illegally was particularly humorous). However, this was once again under-explored and inconsistent, as the film did seem to be continuously glorifying John Dillinger and I really can't see any American film director allowing a film to be released that even subconsciously subtly glorified Osama Bin Laden.<br/><br/>So my overall view is that while it had some good elements, Public Enemies is a film that failed to live up to the great potential it had for something really interesting."

","This review contains spoilers!! <br/><br/>When I went to see this movie, I had high hopes it would be a really good movie - especially with Johnny Depp & Christian Bale in the lineup. Although the movie was alright, it contained several factual errors.<br/><br/>In one scene, FBI agent Melvin Purvis (Bale), guns down Charles ""Pretty Boy"" Floyd. While this is factually correct, it should be noted that Pretty Boy Floyd wasn't gunned down until October 1934; Dillinger was killed in July of that year.<br/><br/>In another scene which took place at ""Little Bohemia"", Baby Face Nelson was gunned down and killed. In reality, Baby Face Nelson wasn't killed until November of 1934 and it was nowhere near Little Bohemia.<br/><br/>I just wish SOMEONE would make a movie about a gangster and show it the real way it happened and not change it for dramatic effect."

","How do you survive in the bleak Depression era of the 1930s? You make a name for yourself by becoming a full-time bank robber; at least that's the philosophy of John Dillinger, a charismatic thief and outlaw whose chosen occupation makes him a hero in the eyes of the public but a wanted man in the eyes of agency director J. Edgar Hoover. The film also traces the career of Melvin Purvis, a dedicated agent who makes it his mission to doggedly pursue Dillinger and other notorious figures like Pretty Boy Floyd and Baby Face Nelson during an unprecedented crime wave. Slow going at first, but it's vividly brought to life and the tension only grows as it nears the conclusion. Cast is solid, story holds your interest, but it goes on longer than it needs to and for a biographical film it doesn't seem particularly insightful. **½"
"v_kobiljski","7","0","3","3 July 2009"," Good story, terrible cinematography
","It's really a shame that the action sequences and scenes were filmed in the way that they were because it really killed what could have been a perfect movie. The story was engrossing and the acting was well executed, but... the way this movie was filmed was god awful. During action sequences, shot angles were strange and poorly done. At times I felt like I was watching someone's home video. There were no emotionally highlighted scenes. No pause for dramatic effect in any way. Don't get me wrong, I don't like cheesy music and drawn out pauses, but this movie had so many characters and so many chopped up shaky action sequences (thank you Bourne series for starting this trend...) that you often couldn't tell who had died and why this was an important event. The story, however, is great and I would still recommend this movie, but would not recommend Michael Mann direct anything ever again."

","I went into this expecting an outstanding film - great cast, good look and a great character to centre on. And on these fronts, it delivered.<br/><br/>However, there was something lacking - character development. None of the primary characters (Dillinger, Billie, Purvis) were interesting. If Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid were this one dimensional in their film, I never would have heard of it (having been born 20 years later).<br/><br/>This film will get a lot of attention, and disappear from our minds rapidly. The characters are not endearing.<br/><br/>The best part of the film was Johnny Depp, and his facial expressions. They told us more about Dillinger than anything else. (by the way, that's not a good thing).<br/><br/>All of the characters are stubborn, and their internal conflicts disappear in a haze of machine gun fire. Only one conflict survives: Good guy must kill bad guy because he is bad.<br/><br/>All I can say is that I am disappointed - another film with a lot of potential that tries to wow us with the adrenaline of the chase scene and of the gunfire."
