","Being that the story is about kids who want to go to see their favourite band, you know that in the end they will somehow get to see the show.  It's a question if you enjoy the ride to get there.  And I did.<br/><br/>Although being a teen comedy (which always means an obligatory puke scene), and some physical comedy which was a little distracting, this film was just fun.  The film works cause everyone can think back to the days in high school when you worshiped a band, played their music, and would DIE to see them play live, and this film captures that feeling perfectly.  It also captures the era perfectly with the music, cars, good soundtrack, and the pot shots at of course... disco (Did you see those SHOES the disco chicks were wearing??).  And of course it was VERY funny in places (I thought my jam sessions were bad...).<br/><br/>Also the film had me guessing as to what would happen, sometimes I thought it was predictable, then it switched gears and surprised me, particularly the ending which was so perfectly sweet!!  Perfect music high school camradare done wonderfully.  Even though I am not a fan of KISS, everyone can think back to the time when your fav band was your TRUE means of salvation.<br/><br/>Rating 7 out of 10."
"EdRooney","Null","28","32","29 July 1999"," Calling Dr. Love
","""Detroit Rock City""<br/><br/>Darth Maul, Austin Powers, Tarzan, John Travolta, Julia Roberts, Cartman, James West, and killer sharks... What else would summer 1999 require? KISS. That's what we need. With all the teenager movies stinking up the multiplexes recently, the only relief is a film featuring the Knights In Satan's Service. Recalling ""Dazed And Confused"" and channeling ""Rock N' Roll High School"", ""Detroit Rock City"" is a heaping portion of good fun. Filled to the brim with energy and acted by a cast of clever actors who probably can't even shave yet, this new music-packed comedy might just be what the doctor (Dr. Love, that is) ordered.<br/><br/>KISS fans might not be too happy to hear that the band isn't in the film for more than 5 minutes. Director Adam Rifkin (""The Chase"" and the pathetically forced ""Dark Backward"") and writer Carl V. Dupre have made a film not about KISS, but about four teenagers from 1978 Cleveland who drive to Detroit to see the band in concert. Everything from religiously fanatic mothers (The great Lin Shaye), to money-stealing bullies, and even some Disco lowlifes try to stop our heroes as they trek to see the world's greatest band. Once in Detroit, the friends split up to find opportunities to scam their way into the show. It is also in Detroit where each teen learns a very important lesson about life, and just how much KISS rocks.<br/><br/>Leading the group is Edward Furlong. Last seen in John Waters's ""Pecker"", Furlong has opened up greatly in the past couple of films. In ""Detroit"", Furlong gives his best performance to date. I've never seen him so loose on-screen before. Working with James DeBello, Giuseppe Andrews, and probably the most expressive teenage actor working today, Sam Huntington, they each deliver just the right amount of teenage apathy, yet make each one of their characters endearing to the audience. It's enormous fun to watch them on-screen together. You don't come around such a young cast that works so well together too often. Other players include the eternal vamp Shannon Tweed, Natasha Lyonne(""Slums Of Beverly Hills"") in yet another role that cannot seem to tap into her talents as much as I would like to see, and even a girl fittingly named Beth played by the wonderful Melanie Lynskey(""Heavenly Creatures""),<br/><br/>It's quite obvious from the brilliant opening credits that Director Rifkin is out to have some fun. He brings back the 1970's with wonderful widescreen lensing, a dab of split-screen, and a soundtrack crammed with classic rock hits. One after another, the music fills each scene with such vibrant energy. After getting so used to the pre-packaged soundtracks that frequently don't have anything to do with the movies that feature them, it's refreshing to see film and sound live in holy matrimony for once.<br/><br/>The camera swings and moves with alarming speed. The colors pop and squeak. The era is evoked gently and without(much) sarcasm. ""Detroit Rock City"" is one of the few films that seems to be the product of genuine love for the era and the music. It's a bright film with an enormous amount of good will. Whatever Rifkin has forced upon us before has now been forgotten.<br/><br/>If I had to make once complaint about ""Detroit"", it's the typical use of drama to justify the movie. You've seen it time and again, the film you love crashing to a halt so the lead character can make some death-to-the-ears speech about freedom, love, or any other mundane belief. It never ceases to stop any film, and it brings the kinetic ""Detroit"" to it's knees for about 5 minutes. The picture is bright enough to not have to include any dramatic weight whatsoever. It's seems like a screenplay conceit, and probably is. Yet another film that's too self-conscious to really kick back and fire on all cylinders.<br/><br/>New Line cut a great trailer for this film. The ""Mad"" magazine-style poster was also a genius choice. ""Detroit Rock City"" is silly and sometimes childish, but it never stoops to the constipated laughs of ""American Pie"" or the plain ugliness of other similar ""boy"" intensive teenage comedies. ""Detroit"" is often sharp, always silly, slightly tasteless, but a seriously rocking late summer film that makes up for the usual garbage that litters August. You wanted the best, you got the best.--------- 9/10"
"mattymatt4ever","7","47","57","20 April 2001"," This movie rocks!
","I really don't see why this movie tanked and why it is hated by many.  Maybe its poor box office performance was due partly to its R-rating, being that it appeals to a predominantly teenage demographic.  But I found it to be funny, entertaining and downright awesome!<br/><br/>This is not a nostalgic piece.  Other than the music, this film's characters seemed to be fished out of contemporary society.  So the older viewers might not enjoy it QUITE as much.  I have to say, my only disappointment was that Kiss only got to perform once, at the very end.  Other than that, this is just a wildly funny comic ride with good performances from the main cast, as well as the supporting--Lin Shaye stands out as the ultra-protective, Bible-toting, chain-smoking mother who regards Kiss as ""Knights in Satan's Service.""  Joe Flaherty, of SCTV fame, also has a funny cameo. <br/><br/>
What can I say?  I laughed a lot.  I bobbed my head to the music.  I had fun.  That pretty much does it for me.  <br/><br/>My score:  7 (out of 10)"
"MetalGeek","Null","21","24","1 December 2006"," Hilarious, and Not Just For Kiss Fans
","I was a huge KISS fan for much of my teenage life (finally seeing the original band on their 1996 Reunion Tour was one of the highlights of my life, as I was too young to witness them in their '70s heyday), so DETROIT ROCK CITY was mandatory viewing for me when it first hit video. I would've loved to have seen it during its short theatrical run, but sadly, this overlooked movie tanked at the box office and disappeared within a week of its release, which astounds me to this day, because even if you're not a KISS fan, any rock and roller past or present should be able to relate to this story of musical fanaticism, no matter what band(s) you might be into.<br/><br/>The film does share many similarities to an earlier classic, 1979's ROCK N ROLL HIGH SCHOOL (starring the Ramones), but thanks to the more liberal time period in which it was made, DETROIT ROCK CITY is a lot more foul-mouthed and raunchier, which may have cost the producers a PG-13 rating, but it just fine by me... after all, real high school kids don't say ""darn"" and ""heck,"" they spew the F-Word liberally into every sentence! Anyway, our story revolves around four high school misfits circa 1978 whose main goal in life (other than playing bad covers of KISS songs in their basement rec room) is to finally see KISS live in concert at Detroit's Cobo Hall arena. When one boy's fundamentalist Mom discovers the ""demonic"" concert tickets in her son's jacket and burns them, it sets the four friends on a quest to figure out how to get into the concert at all costs, and they set a hilarious series of misadventures in motion along the way. In no particular order, the boys run afoul of a gang of disco-loving toughs on the highway, get mixed up in the middle of a convenience store robbery (thwarted by a Stretch Armstrong doll!), take the stage in a male strip joint to win money for tickets, get their car towed from the mean streets of Detroit, and rescue one of their own from a Christian boy's school. The film's eye candy quotient is filled very nicely by a cameo from Shannon Tweed (real-life companion of Kiss' Gene Simmons), and there's even a tender moment of teenage romance as one boy loses his virginity (in a church's confessional no less!). All this madness is set to an irresistible hard-rockin' soundtrack that features not only Kiss but other 70s titans like Blue Oyster Cult and Ted Nugent. Do the boys finally make it to Cobo Hall to see their heroes? I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen it yet, therefore I highly recommend that you check out this overlooked comedy gem. DETROIT ROCK CITY is a hysterical trip down memory lane for anyone who's ever cranked up their favorite song extremely LOUD...and as Kiss themselves once said, if it's too loud,you're too old. Thankfully I'm not too old to enjoy this movie!!"
"triple8","Null","42","52","5 December 2003"," One word:Rockin
","I liked detroit rock city for one reason and one reason only. I am a metal fan and this movie brought to the big screen the adrenalin fueled craziness that is Kiss and hard rock music in general. Anybody looking for ""depth"" in this, has the wrong movie. I like all types of movies and sometimes I like my movies deep. But not all the time. Sometimes I want to smile. Sometimes I want to be entertained. This movie does that and it does that well.<br/><br/>I think the bottom line is, if you are a Kiss fan or fan of hard rock in general you will love this. If you are not such a fan, but still open to movies where the sole purpose is to entertain you may like it. But if you hate Kiss or have no interest in their type of music in general your more likely to have no particular interest in this. Me, I thought it was great! Kiss forever! Rock and Roll all night!"

","My summary says it all. This movie did rock! It had funny characters, a funny story and an awesome soundtrack, especially Van Halen's Runnin' with the Devil.<br/><br/>The story is set in Cleveland, 1978. Four boys, Hawk, Jam, Lex and Trip who are part of a rock band named Mystery which is modeled after their favorite band, KISS. They bought tickets to see them and go on a road trip to Detroit and get into many misadventures dealing with an angry mother, some tough jocks, some disco freaks, a stolen car and an attempt to win money.<br/><br/>This movie was Eddie Furlong's second best(T2 was the first) and it was a takeoff for the other guys. The only thing I would've changed was the mood, it seemed just a little dark for my taste but it was still an awesome movie. 9/10"

","I thought this movie was fairly entertaining, the performances were good,especially Edward Furlong and Sam Huntington, although the character of Jam's mum was a little overdone. I thought the soundtrack to the movie was good also, it added to the film. I found myself comparing this movie to 'American Pie', due to its physical humour.

Edward Furlong and all of the other actors were excellent in their roles.<br/><br/>I laughed most of the time when the boys caused accidental trouble on the road or at the concert.<br/><br/>There's really not much to say about this film because I love it so much. What I can say is that if you love the actors who portray the four boys, KISS, the plot where they are determined to get into a concert and never give up, and stereotypical kids getting high and drunk, having sex and loving to rock hard to KISS music, this film is definitely for you.

I felt like I relived a part of my life while I watched it (in 9 parts on youtube! -- god bless the internet).<br/><br/>The IMDb ratings scale needs to go to 11 for masterpieces like this.

"thebigmovieguy","Null","5","9","30 July 2003"," The killer soundtrack itself is worth a viewing !
","""Detroit Rock City"" has the best soundtrack I've ever heard in a movie which includes songs from ""Kiss"" (Detroit Rock City, I stole your love, Love Gun, etc), ""KC and the Sunshine Band"" (Boogie Shoes), ""Hot Chocolate"" (Everyone's a winner), ""Joan Jett""(Love Hurts) and many more. The soundtrack carries the movie along a fun ride especially if the songs are already familiar to you.<br/><br/>""Detroit Rock City"", written by Carl V. Dupré and directed by Adam Rifkin, is the story of four high school kids and fans of Rock & Roll band Kiss. They're all ""potheads"" (said Natasha Lyonne's character) and have their own band where they worship Kiss! Hawk, the lead singer with a badass attitude, Jam, the mama's boy who plays the drums, Trip, the dumb stupid guitar player and Lex, the serious dude.<br/><br/>***SPOILER***<br/><br/>The story takes place in 1978 where the four friends are about to go see ""Kiss"" in concert live from Detroit when Jam's mom burns their tickets and sends him to boarding school. Hawk, Trip and Lex get a hold of other tickets from a radio contest and try busting their friend out to leave for Detroit for the concert. But when they actually arrive, they learn that they can't have the tickets while there's only a few hours before the concert and there's no way they'll miss it. So they each go their separate ways. Hawk enters a dancing contest in a strip bar to find money to pay a Kiss ticket form some street guy. Jam is caught in the streets by his mother whose leading a manifestation against Kiss and finds an unexpected romance as he confesses at church. Trip tries to mug the wrong kid for a Kiss ticket and gets in trouble with the kid's big goon brother who forces him to rob a convenient store. And finally, Lex wanders around the stage where Kiss are about to give their concert, hoping to escape the security guards and enter. The four friends meet again only a few minutes before the concert with only one last shot to see Kiss on stage. Wil they succeed ?<br/><br/>This movie is highly entertaining, not only for the music but also for the funky styles and events which occured during the 70's. It's the time when Disco and Rock & Roll were rivals in music culture which is used in many jokes like ""Disco blows dogs for quarters, man!"" and ""The Village people! There a fag band!"". The characters, maybe a little under developed, often find themselves in goofy situations where they'll do anything just to see a concert. Good performances by Edward Furlong, Sam Huntington, Giuseppe Andrews and James DeBello delivers a hilarious comedy for either teens or grown adults who've lived through the seventies ! My older cousin once had a haircut like Trip and laughed out loud when he watched this movie. Finally, a simple plot to a simple movie makes it worth a good viewing. Watch out for the music too ! 8/10."
"Punk19","10","3","5","3 July 2006"," The truth revealed
","Along with other things that impress me, this has to be at the top of my list. I would have never known it if this movie was tossed at me from a garbage can. <br/><br/>This movie focus's on four young teenagers who are completely crazy about KISS. Lex (Giuseppe Andrews), Trip Hurudie (James DeBello), Hawk (Edward Furlong), and Jeremiah 'Jam' Bruce (Sam Huntington) are a tribute band named Mystery to the awesome music artists only known as KISS. But soon the fun goes to spoils due to Mrs. Bruce (Lin Shaye), Jam's mother, who finds the KISS tickets and torches them. Now the four friends have to take a trip from a boarding school to Detriot. Jam confronts his mother and sets her straight, and the four boys get what they wanted to see.<br/><br/>With this movie we get to see all original members of the KISS band, Peter Criss, Gene Simmons, Paul Stanely, and Ace Frehley and we get to see Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley's longtime companions. I had to give this movie a perfect ten because it just reflected what us teenagers had to go through to see our favorite bands perform. I'm glad that this movie was made for one reason, the reason to teach our parents that what we listen to isn't bad."

","Four inseparable high-school pals and members of the KISS Army must overcome numerous obstacles so that they can 'rock and roll all nite' with their musical heroes in concert in Detroit (Rock City).<br/><br/>Late-'90s teen comedy Detroit Rock City is a bit like the band KISS itself: it's not high-brow art, and there's stuff that works and stuff that doesn't, but in the end, the name of the game is pure entertainment and fun, and in that it succeeds. It might help if you're a fan of the band and are familiar with the tunes that accompany the action, but even if that's not the case, the film's breezy nature, likeable characters, and easy-going '70s vibe make it a perfect film to chug a few beers to (or some 'cold gin').<br/><br/>The film's head-banging foursome are played by James DeBello, Giuseppe Andrews, Edward Furlong and Sam Huntington, who work brilliantly together, and they are given able support from two of my favourite actresses, Natasha Lyonne and Melanie Lynskey (as Christine and Beth - geddit?). Director Adam Rifkin directs with an energy and obvious enthusiasm for his subject matter, and in turn draws inspired performances from his young cast (most of whom weren't even born in 1978, when this film is set).<br/><br/>The funny stuff isn't all grade A material, but, just like KISS's classic '70s albums, it's definitely more hit than miss, with some stone cold winners along the way (Furlong puking into the pitcher gets me every time). As a long time fan of KISS myself (1984-present day), I might be a bit biased, but I would say, so long as you don't have 'great expectations', you won't be disappointed."

There's something about him that simply irradiates happiness in my way, and he's great in this, so are the rest of the boys, each and everyone get their own moments in the movie, which is important in order to let everyone's own setbacks be resolved according to each character's personality.

Gene talks about himself as usual and promotes upcoming toys and ventures that he's working on.  I know he likes himself, but WOW!<br/><br/>There are some funny bits in the movie, Furlong is on the giving end of those.  His bit in the nightclub is very good.

","Sometimes you get exactly what you expect.  A film produced and by and as a vehicle for a rock band in the middle of a comeback is not to be expected to rank high in artistic merit- and in this case it certainly doesn't.  In fact, as expected, the soundtrack is a much better investment than the movie itself, which like the 70's rock and roll lifestyle it attempts to portray, is characterized by excess, drugs, and over-the-top antics, but unfortunately is not nearly as much fun.  Utilizing a script by Carl Dupre horrible enough to make a fellow screenwriter cringe, and wasting the talents of Edward Furlong, the sole highlight of this rock and roll period piece gone wrong is the music, most notably the elaborate recreating of a 1978 KISS concert."

","I was in my early 20's in 1978, the setting of this movie.  Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, etc. were the prominent rock bands and although the music of Kiss was great, I clearly remember that they were not considered to be ""cool"" by rock fans.  Kiss enjoys more popularity today than in the 70's.<br/><br/>The four main characters were great in their roles, although too much 90's talk made it's way into the script. In the 70's the f word was used, but not every other word, like it's used today.  Jam's mother was way over the top--what was the deal with all the Catholic-bashing?  I realize this was for comic effect but there were so many blatant errors out of the mouth of Jam's mother who was a misguided but devout Catholic (""holy"" confession?  I think they were confusing it with holy communion!).  Jam's mother was funny but too much screen time was spent on this and it became boring.  Mothers standing outside of Kiss concerts with megaphones?  Gimme a break.<br/><br/>Have no recollection of Kiss being portrayed as evil?  People were still shivering over Charles Manson and his followers and worrying whether they would be getting out of jail!  Most people were confused about the make-up and theatrical stuff of Kiss but figured if some people liked it, sobeit.<br/><br/>This has been the ONLY film about the 70's that got the styles for guys exactly right!  Guys wore either long, straight hair or a shaggy cut molded very close to the head, and clothing:  army jackets, plaid shirts over ""baseball"" t-shirts (white shirts with rounded dark blue collars), jean jackets, etc.  Those who followed disco tried to look exactly like John Travolta in ""Saturday Night Fever.""  There needed to be more cigarette smoking which was really ""in"" (you were a minority if you didn't chain smoke).  Smoking inside concerts was also permitted.  (The country was still ""free"" back then.)  Only a few mistakes on the girls:  platform shoes went out of style in the mid-70's and had made way to strappy heels and Candies. But the permed hair, rabbit-fur coats, etc. were right on the money.<br/><br/>Many funny scenes (the domino bathroom stalls; Hawk's debut as a dancer; Trip's brainstorm to beat each other up); many far-fetched ones (a security guard who chases kids; love in the confessional; a 40-year-old knock-out coming onto Hawk); but a movie most teens today who have openness with their parents will enjoy--""Did that really happen, mom?"" (Most frequently asked question -- about disco -- a small minority followed disco which quickly faded out.) <br/><br/>Parents, not for kids under 16!"

Then, the entire plot basically revolves around Jam, and his friends Hawk, Lex, and Trip doing just about anything to go see their ""gods"", otherwise known as KISS.<br/><br/>A great movie with a killer soundtrack, and I consider it to be the greatest movie ever made. Adam Rifkin really outdid himself on this one."

","I can remember when KISS made an appearance on one New Year's Rockin' Eve program with Dick Clark on TV. Amazingly, they did ""Detroit Rock City"" and I had respected KISS's craziness in America's rock era ever since.<br/><br/>I had to see the film two times to figure out that ""Detroit Rock City"" was about 4 teenagers in the 1970s era who want to make a ruse to see a live KISS concert in their area. I realized that one of the teenagers was acted by Edward Furlong, who made a big smash in the movie Terminator 2--Judgement Day.<br/><br/>All 4 teenagers believed that seeing a live KISS concert is like being a Muslim going to Mecca; that is to say, they think of witnessing a live KISS concert as a very important pilgrimage for being very strong KISS fans.<br/><br/>Before there was Burning Man, there was KISS. Every KISS freak who saw their live shows had got what they wanted and more. You see it in the opening credits of the flick as you see a montage of some of KISS's colorful record albums, along with some of the antics KISS is famous for---the sticking out of tongues and letting them tremble---the fire-breathing---and of course, the band's famous face mask outfits that were a big attribution to the Halloween holiday. KISS's garb even dwarfed the leather jacket garb worn by members of Judas Priest, one of the several heavy metal bands that made a big stand in the 1970s.<br/><br/>KISS had been known for songs like ""Rock and Roll All Night"", ""Love Gun"", and, finally, the title film of one of their famous songs. <br/><br/>The movie title ""Detroit Rock City"", I speculate, is probably the place that KISS became famous for...in a city that brought us Motown. I am also a grammar freak, so the title should have said ""Detroit: Rock City!"" The first KISS concert in Detroit was actually in Cobo Hall, in January 1976, just before America's big Bicentennial.<br/><br/>And you want fireworks? KISS has fireworks (which even included real fire effects)....plenty of them! Every KISS freak has seen a ""pretend July 4th atmosphere"" the band creates. Especially in 1974, seeing a ""Kissology Part I"" DVD during the Midnight Hour show, I may have witnessed the first use of KISS'S stage fireworks at the end of ""Black Diamond"", in addition to the explosions, the drummer seemed to throw parts of the drumset away from the riser that magically rose in the air from the stage. The song ""Firehouse"" had the KISS lead singer at the end of the song use a fire stick which he would blow one end of it with his mouth to create a fire effect usually seen from a dragon, and then stick the fire stick on the stage and leave it alone; and add to that, the fire engine sirens come in.<br/><br/>Add to that the sacrificial guitar slamming, the famous giant KISS logo behind the band in moving strobe lights, and even the use of real fire---and you have the craziest rock band creating perhaps the loudest rock show around."

All the great songs of the late 70's that I listened to as I drove around with my high school friends are here. Did we end up at a concert without tickets? Yup. We hitch hiked 10 miles to it, we were outside the fence and some other people tore part of the fence down. As they were being arrested, we jumped through the hole and ran. The cops caught 1, but 2 of us made it to the crowd and stayed for the concert and the drugs and...Back to the movie. It's the music. It's the time. So my only question is: Why would they put music by artists not from that period in the credits? If a band is going to cover a song like the ""Boys Are Back In Town"", it should be as good or better than Thin Lizzy or don't do it, and that's a very hard song to do better. Why not just play the original during the credits? You know, movie about the 70's with songs from the 70's in their original glory. So watch the movie. Have fun watching it. Enjoy the music.

It's not nearly as pointless as some would say, and those who call it that are all too obviously missing the message at the end, because it is loud - and - clear. This film is just about freedom, yes that false illusion of first world, middle-class kids' freedom but real freedom still in breaking away from the routine, the order established, not because yay rebels, but because it's so much fun and all kids want to do. The rush, the exhilaration, this movie transcribes those powerful emotions so contagiously, what with the exceptionally strong soundtrack, powerful scenes, the ultimate sacrifice... this film is just beautiful cinema, and honestly I wouldn't even begin to argue for it. If you didn't like it, there's no need to even start the topic. We're just too different, and that's okay, but it's far beyond constructive discussion at that point. Pure nostalgia, and it touched kids from much later generations than the KISS era, myself included. So much adrenaline, emotion and nostalgia.

","Detroit Rock City (1999): Dir: Adam Rifkin / Cast: Edward Furlong, Sam Huntington, Lin Shaye, Natasha Lyonne, James DeBello: It resembles the hilarious Rock N' Roll High School in look, era and madness that celebrates KISS through the hysteria of its fans in this maddening comedy. Detroit represents destination, reputation and enthusiasm. Inspiring setup follows four high school teens on a road trip to obtain KISS tickets after the protesting mother of one of the boys burns their previous tickets. High energy farce that breaks more rules than it should. The portrayal of Priests and religious figures is offensive. Directed by Adam Rifkin with hysteria satire that remembers the mentality of music and the so-called rules. Lin Shaye steals scenes as a protesting mother. Her opening scene is priceless with an interrupted evening but the rebellious defeat may require discernment. Sam Huntington plays her son seeking escape, which he finds in union with his friends and their love for KISS. Edward Furlong plays the ring leader who strikes more trouble than needed. Natasha Lyonne plays a hitchhiker whom they saved. KISS make the promising appearance on stage with their phantom face paint and a knack for revealing the tongue. One can argue the morality of the rebellious nature of the teens that seems to be applauded but it also examines an era that knows no shame. Score: 7 / 10"
"bryank-04844","9","0","0","11 August 2015"," 'Detroit Rock City' is one of those films that is always welcome on my television at home.
","Over the years, we have seen a wide variety of coming-of-age stories on film, but nothing quite like 'Detroit Rock City'. While this film has all the aspects of a true coming-of-age film, it also has a ton of very adult situations, which ultimately made this film rated R. We've seen a group of kids find rich stuff, look for a dead body, build a tree house, and even shoot a homemade movie based on 'Rambo'.<br/><br/>It wasn't until 'Detroit Rock City' in 1999, where we had a group of four burnout teenagers literally do whatever it took to score KISS tickets, which included stripping, robbing a store, fighting, and even drugging a preacher with magic mushroom pizza. While this movie didn't do to well at the box office, it became a huge cult hit on home video and continues to garner laughs and a spectacular soundtrack some 16 years later.<br/><br/>'Detroit Rock City' centers on a teenager named Jeremiah or ""Jam"" for short, whose single mother (Lin Shaye) rules over the household with a God fearing iron fist. She makes him tuck his button down shirts into his khaki pants for school and would never allow him to listen to anything more dangerous than The Carpenters. Little does Jam's mother know that he secretly loves rock n' roll, especially KISS, and is in fact a drummer in a KISS cover band with his three friends Hawk (Edward Furlong) , Lex (Giuseppe Andrews) , and Trip (James DeBello).<br/><br/>These friends are not necessarily the friends you would bring home for a family night dinner, as they are always stoned, dirty, and destructive. That being said, they are true and loyal friends to the end, which is what this film is all about. Jam has four tickets for him and his friends for the KISS concert that night, but unfortunately his mother finds them and burns them up in front of everyone. This causes all four friends to ditch school and try to score KISS tickets by anyway possible, but due to their lack of intelligence, it proves more difficult that it really should be.<br/><br/>Whether it be fighting off disco douchebags, saving a girl from two rapists, winning money in a strip contest, even outrunning a fat Elvis security guard, or having sex for the first time in a sacred place, these four friends will stop at nothing to see KISS and protect their friendship to the end. The movie is completely silly and has some very gross out moments, including two gallons of puke and one hell of a bloody fight in the street. That being said, 'Detroit Rock City' is as genuine as it is funny, and even though these kids might not be the brightest in the bunch, they would be friends I'd like to have.<br/><br/>It's so exciting that all four members of KISS signed off on this movie. Not even that, each member had a ton of creative input that went into this production as well as cameos. Speaking of cameos, there are a ton of them here, including Shannon Tweed, Ron Jeremy, Joe Flaherty, Natasha Lyonne, and Melanie Lynskey to name a few. Everyone does a great job in their roles here, and seems to have an amazing time on screen, no matter how over-the-top it can get. 'Detroit Rock City' is one of those films that is always welcome on my television at home, because it's highly entertaining, hilariously funny, and has an excellent soundtrack."

","KISS isn't known to be the most giving band in the world. Sure, you get your money's worth, but don't expect anything more or something like a free autograph or a ""hi, how are u doing"" from the last remaining original members without taking out your wallet first. That seems particularly true these days, where the band still produces tours and albums on the sole premise that most fans are completists, who cannot suffer holes in their collections. So, ""Detroit Rock City"" was one of the last few cases where the fan had the feeling that this was produced by band & fans for fans and not only for cash.<br/><br/>Sure, I had rooted for this film when it came out and sure, as a kid I had my room plastered with KISS-posters, wore KISS-Make-Up during Halloween and religiously bought most things that bore the distinct logo (despite the design being altered in Germany, because it resembled the SS-Runes a little too close, suggesting that Mr. Chaim Wietz and Mr. Stanley Eisen were Nazis). Got my dad to smuggle me into ""Runaway"", despite being a few years short of admission (and I didn't want to go see this film because I'm fond of Tom Selleck). Thinking of it, my parents probably bought Gene Simmons a new Cadillac, despite nowadays I'd hope that this money went into the pockets of either Ace Frehley or Peter Criss.<br/><br/>By the time ""Detroit Rock City"" hit the cinema, it had pretty much been clear to even the hardened fan, that 90 percent apart from the music was hype and that the two founding members had begun to view their band more of a cash-milking-cow rather than a vehicle to transport good music. But why drop a lifelong habit? Like Richard Linklaters ""Dazed and Confused"", Adam Rifkin was able to capture the feel and air of the time ""When KISS ruled the world"", which is only one aspect that makes the film work. Though by the time I was old enough to get into the concerts KISS had already taken off their iconic make-up, one could really get a feel of what the great KISSteria must have been like. Then there is the humour: I'm not easily moved to laugh tears at slapstick, but I have to admit that a heartily laughed more than once. The priest and the mushroom-pizza, the clash between KISS-Fans and Disco-Guidos or the Hawk stripping for cash, it all made me crack up. As a bonus, there are plenty of KISS Insider-jokes, from the names of the protagonists to the dialogue; it should be abundantly clear: Adam Rifkin knows his KISS.<br/><br/>When talking to the fans, the issue of a sequel would invariably come up. Despite still being a fan-boy deep inside, rationality keeps saying that this just wouldn't work – as little as KISS worked after 1982. What would people like to see? Our four protagonists being in college and moaning the fact that KISS has degenerated into a run-of-the-mill Glam band during the 80's? Having settled down to a blue-collar-existence and taking their kids to see the KISS-reunion in the 90's or having to witness the gold-digging sham that KISS has degenerated to in recent years? No, it's good that ""Detroit Rock City"" is (and will likely remain) a one-time-thing – could be a lesson there for Simmons and Stanley.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Avant-garde director Adam Rifkin has successfully made a teenage film that shows passion, urgency, and desire all in a believable state. The story of his film Detroit Rock City works because we like these characters even though they are odd and strange outcasts, and because the story's central point of focus, KISS concert tickets, seem to be so easy yet so difficult to obtain. It's a simplistic story made complex because of heavy factors; like age, overprotective moms, and disco Guidos.<br/><br/>The four boys are do-it-all Hawk (Furlong), party-boy Lex (Andrews), loudmouth Trip (DeBello), and insecure Jam (Huntington) who love to rock out, work soft, play hard, and smoke marijuana. They have a garage band called ""Mystery"" that mirrors the band they idolize, KISS. After much trouble they look to have their eardrums blown off at an upcoming KISS concert, but because of Jam's overbearing mother, the tickets are gone and so are their hopes for the best concert ever.<br/><br/>Though by sure luck, Trip calls into a radio show, answers the obligatory KISS question, and wins the four boys four tickets and backstage passes to the same concert. So now, they break Jam out of a boarding school his mother placed him in and are now resuming their plans for the best concert ever.<br/><br/>Rifkin clearly knows how to have a fun time. He seems to know how it was to be a teenager who loved sex, drugs, rock and roll, and loud music. All the boys start as cookie cutter stereotypes, but it isn't until the final act of the film where they go off on their own that we see the true side of everyone of them.<br/><br/>The fatal mistake Detroit Rock City made back when it was released in 1999; it cut off its main audience. Because of its R rating, used to fully utilize the language and drugs true to the youth, certain High Schoolers who I'm sure mirrored the behavior of the individuals portrayed in the film weren't allowed to see it without a parent. But how could you make a PG-13 Detroit Rock City? I just don't see it.<br/><br/>This also occupies one of the best film soundtracks I've heard in quite sometime. Yes, lots of KISS songs are played to amuse the fanboys, but songs like ""The Boys Are Back in Town,"" ""Highway to Hell,"" ""Iron Man,"" ""Jailbreak,"" ""Rebel Rebel,"" and more are all snuck in. Detroit Rock City doesn't just stoop to the level of all KISS, all the time. I sneaks in other easily recognizable rock tunes to please both the fans of the band and rock fans in general. No assembly of knowledge on KISS is required to enjoy this film. It's a centrist kind of film.<br/><br/>Now if only the ending could've been more. I dare not spoil it, but it feels like something was thrown on the cutting room floor too early. It feels vacant, void, and abrupt. Detroit Rock City is an eventful camaraderie of enjoyable characters and amusing events that please the most persistent and choosy buddy comedy fan.<br/><br/>Starring: Eddie Furlong, Giuseppe Andrews, James DeBello, and Sam Huntington.

","To really like this I need to work at it. The walls of the girls' Jericho did not fall until the third session of filming that particular scene, some things take work. <br/><br/>There are also two rather special historic commentaries on my DVD and I assume that proper late 70's rock fans are likely to know of those. <br/><br/>This is from a time that was not too good from my view, personal disaster, but there was some good rock and roll on the radio. Buying a few, very few, LPs, USA speak albums?, KISS was there. Not the best but among those that stood out as among the best. The classical music that stood out for me included Carmina Burana and I would have interpreted its influence on me in a different way to how this feature uses that piece, for me I was more waving a red rag at bulls that did not appear to be bulls. <br/><br/>There is a lot of violence in this story, but other facets too. Round our way most seemed to use more subtle forms of violence on big babies but this does give some variations of that, sort of. I found it easy to get ground down, those years. Some get trouble from all sides. <br/><br/>* <br/><br/>The commentaries point to KISS having been targeted by some fundamentalist Christians who considered the band to be agents of the devil, their music something that these fun C felt a need to attack. My difficulty is with how the feature interprets that. <br/><br/>The feature shows Catholic mothers and priests as agents of the anti KISS. They are very much in parody form. As an ex Catholic I do find the expression to be not in tune with the wide variety in that church. The bits with priests are mostly too way out for me to be able to take, I need to jump over those. The exception as the bit where Beth notices her love going into the church. Inside the church a problem, despite Beth's acting. There are several features where I would really need a personalised copy and this is one of them. I need deletions. <br/><br/>The Catholic mothers, particularly the mum of Jeremiah, a different thing. First time round that felt way too bad but that reaction soon calmed. More viewings also allowed me to notice how her idea of child care appeared to be influenced by ways of dealing with a pet dog. Not a warm sort of way as with Hermione and her Crookshanks, more a Ron with Pig as shown in the novels. Pig expected to do things on a Must Do basis, otherwise no love. This is parody, but it could be noticing something rather relevant in some of the fundamentalist Christian worlds. I find that it is there in other worlds too but maybe one only notices if one is a big baby. I would expect Harry and Ron to not survive well in the modern world and JK Rowling and Warner do have ways of saying that. The ending of HP7 novel is very modern speak. <br/><br/>So, some fundamentalists attack and this feature shows a response by the Rockies, them attacking back, but doing that in an upside down way. By going with the flow of trying to sound evil? By these four fans waving goodbye to most any sort of sense? The world moves away from fundamentalist understandings about such as the ten commandments and this shows everyone diving into disease as the alternative way? So, this is just a feature, one that took me some getting used to. It is not about reality in the fullest sense? <br/><br/>Could be that in any type of fundamentalist belief there is a failure mode of there being no leeway. Believe, no other option, no freedom to think. If one feels a longing to drop out there can be no good way to do so. Most characters in this story remind me of that sort of thing. There will be different interpretations, though. <br/><br/>* <br/><br/>This feature has lots of good music on the soundtrack. I play it because of that. Just I do experience a problem with the foreground, most scenes that include priests, and deletions are the only solution that would be liable to work for me. This is a story about the walking dead, KISS as a setting for that."

However, there is a turning point in the film where the characters turn from naieve and likable, to cruel, calculating and really unfriendly.<br/><br/>The fact that the characters become so distant from being likable ruins the movie.  The payoff in the end isn't even worthwhile.  The viewer is sitting there wanting the last 45 minutes of their life back. <br/><br/>
There is only one bright spot in the movie.  Lin Shaye (who played the riotous Magda in the above-fore-mentioned Mary) is a brilliant actress who plays a mom that you can't help but feel for.  Lin is spectacular. Unfortunately, her character gets forgotten in the writing, with the mom having no closure in the film.<br/><br/>Rifkin leaves too many loose ends dangling at the end of Detroit Rock City, and this is the part that really upsets me.

It is like we are watching MTV if it could be programmed by people who want to rawk rather than teeny-boppers. How fast are we going to demand that movies go before they become incomprehensible?<br/><br/>By the way, I love KISS.  KISS Meets the Phantom of the Park is an awful film, but at least it is about them.  This film is about these boys and their lame, male-fantasy coming-of-age story.  The best part was the opening credits, where we get to hear KISS and see cool stuff from the 1970's.  The rest is just awful.  Even their performance at the end sucked because it tried to squeeze all the highlights from a KISS show into one song.<br/><br/>The performances were all o.k.  Edward Furlong is a fine actor, but he is just earning a check here.  The other teens are all unremarkable except for Lyonne, who is always worth watching.  The photography is standard while the editing, as mentioned above, is awful, almost as bad as a Michael Bay film. The soundtrack is fun, but I feel like I am listening to a radio station because they switch songs s often.  Films seem to have forgotten how to use music.  Anyway, not much works.<br/><br/>The great KISS film will be a concert film.  It is the only time that Gene Simmons allows the band to not be a marketing ploy.  On stage, they are great.

It wouldn't surprise me one bit if they watched the show and took notes. When I went to see this movie,it had already been out for weeks and had less than wonderful raves but still I just ""had"" to check it out (and i'm not even that big of a KISS fan,my brother is but even he opted out.)<br/><br/>I honestly felt,as i watched this,like I'd paid full price for an extended episode of ""70's Show"". The lead boy might as well have been Eric Forman and the others could be Michael Kelso,Casey Kelso & Steven Hyde. The bible thumping mother who bands together with other protesting parents against the impending KISS concert,is to me a female version of Red Forman.<br/><br/>Just like parents and clergy back in the late 70s,adults thought that the four letters in the groups name stood for ""knights in satans service"" and that their whole thing with the make up was part of an evil kin of worship. The lead teen's mother discovers his tickets to the show and burns them! Now he and his friends have to jump through hoops to get into the show. These two factors make up the whole of the story.<br/><br/>Some things are funny,like having to deal with a younger boy in Ace make up,while the song ""Popcorn"" by Hot Butter plays over the scene. <br/><br/>When they go into a strip club and one of them tries to win money for tickets by stripping himself.<br/><br/>The battle between parental guidance and teen rebellion should have been played more for laughs,than in the semi-serious fashion it was. Although many families did go through this back then,for a comedy,overall,it interferes with the humor and the fun.<br/><br/>To sum it up in quick fashion.there were a few things I liked here;what few funny moments there were;the music;the nostalgia. Otherwise,the rock bottom idea of (allegedly) copying a TV show & the other detracting factors I've mentioned,make the film something I might only watch again,if I really was in the mood to see it once more. <br/><br/>(END)"

","Somehow, I managed to miss seeing Detroit Rock City until just a couple weeks ago. Man, was I missing out because this is the funniest movie I have seen in a long time. Okay, so the humor isn't exactly mature, but virtually every scene there was something that made me laugh out loud. It's a simple premise, 4 friends, for the 3rd year in a row, are about to miss seeing their idols KISS in concert. What follows is the Excellent Adventures of Lex, Hawk, Jam, and Trip. Every actor fit perfectly with their character, and it was just a fun, funny movie. I actually watched it every day for a couple weeks. I could see it over and over again and still find it hilarious! Not to mention it has a killer soundtrack. If you want a movie to just have fun with, this is it!"
"kissgirldomino","10","2","5","5 June 2006"," You gotta see this at least once!
","Detroit rock city is an awesome movie. I'm a huge fan of KISS. I would do everything that those teenagers did to go to a KISS concert. KISS is so awesome. They have the best stage show. No other band in the world has that cool of a stage show its an unforgettable experience. I would definitely go to another KISS concert. But they are also every pricey too. I burned myself out on this movie because I watched it so much! I watched it at least everyday! If your a KISS fan you will definitely love this movie. It is a must see at least once movie! (Or more). When I was younger and I was still in my girly stage and I didn't like KISS back then I still loved this movie. You have gotta see this movie. YOU WANTED THE BEST YOU GOT THE BEST THE HOTTEST MOVIE IN THE WORLD DETROIT ROCK CITY! WITH THE HOTTEST BAND IN THE LAND IN IT KISS!"
"wildblondbeauty","10","2","5","23 November 2003"," Great Movie!!!!

"gazineo-1","3","2","5","23 August 2001"," Rock Trash!
","Unfunny and boring comedy about the adventures and struggles of four friends to get tickets for a Kiss show in a big arena in Detroit. The movie tries to restore the atmosphere of the late seventies but fails miserably. The electric soundtrack is the only great point here but even the rock group Kiss seems pale and tired in the last scene. I give a 3 (three) for this one."
"jacob.rosen","3","2","5","23 October 2000"," For KISS Themselves Only
","Made about twenty years too late, this still could have been a pretty funny little picture if someone had told writer Carl V. Dupre to include a little knowing subtlety to balance the crude sophomoric humor. Four teenage headbangers set off on a quasi-road trip to Detroit to see their idols KISS; there isn't a whole lot for today's kids to relate to and with the slavish devotion the film pays to the band (bassist Gene Simmons is one of the film's producers) there isn't a whole lot for older filmgoers either. There's only the likability of Edward Furlong (the ""Terminator"" films) to carry it, but that's not nearly enough. Perhaps the biggest offense is the waste of Farrelly Brothers favorite, Lin Shaye."
"Boyo-2","6","2","5","28 June 2000"," Fun to begin with, less so later on
","I enjoyed the set up for this movie more than the delivery.  Most of the slapstick is very funny but there is less of it as the movie progresses. All the acting is great, especially by Edward Furlong.  I was in high school in 1978 and I saw a KISS concert so it brought back some memories and songs I have not heard for awhile.  There are other artists on the soundtrack, for those of you so inclined.  I enjoyed the movie but it was no big deal."
"Peach-2","5","2","5","27 January 2000"," There's a better film here.
","Detroit Rock City seems like it is totally incomplete. The film never gets rolling in the right direction.The comedy isn't very funny and the characters you never really care for at all. I think that the characters should have at least met their idols, instead they just make it to the concert and that's the end of the story. I wish they could have went into more detail about Mystery, the band that the main characters play in and perform in their basement. It would have been interesting, more so than watching four characters do really crazy and stupid things just to get a ticket. There's a better film here."
"Rusty-61","Null","2","5","23 August 1999"," I liked this movie better the first time I saw it...
","...when it was called ""Rock N Roll High School"".<br/><br/>I still am not sure whether the moviemakers meant this as a ""tribute"" or just a ripoff. Before I even saw the movie, I saw the poster and trailers, and figured it out. I could go on and on about the similarities, but if you've seen RRHS you know exactly what I mean, if you haven't, you probably are already mad at me and stopped reading. <br/><br/>I'm not a big KISS fan, so I didn't get into that part. It was worth a matinee though. The kids who played Trip and Lex were especially good, the kid who played Jam got on my nerves for some reason, just the guy's face.<br/><br/>
On the negative side, the movie had some pretty predicible moments. There was some gross-out humor that was unnessacary, just nasty and seemed tossed in to jump on the recent trendy grossout bandwagon. The movie ended too suddenly. The 70's retro stuff was a little too contrived. (I hate when they go out of their way to mention and show 8 track tapes and happy face logos, etc) Most of the ideas were stolen from Rock-N-Roll High School. Edward Furlong just sorta gives me the creeps for some reason, maybe I read too much about his personal life and it affected how I see him even when he's acting. The dialogue needed work. Stupid Blair Witch Project take-off print ads.<br/><br/>On the plus side, there were lots of twists to the plot that I didn't expect. There were a few Ramones songs used to great effect on the soundtrack (the more I think of it, the more I think the filmmakers, or someone involved anyway, were Ramones fans). Lex is a dead ringer for Dee Dee Ramone in the late 70's. The kid who played Trip was pretty talented and funny. Good period detail and costumes. Cameo by Ron Jeremy (another trend lately, but so far it hasn't been run into the ground yet). Some good laughs, and some satisfying moments. You do feel for these kids and want them to get in to the show...we all can identify how bad we wanted to see our favorite band live in high school. And hey, it's not supposed to be Citizen Kane, so why not go and enjoy yourselves? You could do worse.<br/><br/>I could see how this would be, like, the ultimate movie to a KISS fan, just like Rock and Roll High School is to a Ramones fan. But let's face it, if RRHS had never been made, the filmmakers defintely wouldn't have come up with this movie on their own."
"Cobbler","Null","2","5","16 August 1999"," ""Incredible Hulk"" Episodes Were More Entertaining
","I was hoping to like this one. I remember having contests with my brother when we were little, trying to touch our nose with our tongue, like the KISS guy.<br/><br/>Needless to say, I could never do it.<br/><br/>The film was occasionally entertaining, but also overbearingly crude and at times, moronic. I thought the main characters were jerks, save for Jam (Sam Huntington), who was the most ""human"" person in the flick. Huntington does fine work and made me look forward to his next role. But many of the dramatic situations made no sense, KISS was barely in it, and the flashy directorial style was too much to handle. I also got tired of Shaye's one-note work as Jam's crusader mom and the broad, stereotypical characters. But I did appreciate the manic energy and just-wanna-have-fun attitude. 6/10."
"Travis69","2","3","10","2 December 2003"," Detroit Rock City
","Now this is a bad movie if I've ever seen one. In one of film's greatest years, 1999, Detroit Rock City contends with Runaway Bride and Wild Wild West for the bottom spot in a barrel of junkies. The plot is masterful. Four scrawny high school youngsters finally have their chance at seeing the hard rock theatrics of KISS forthe third year in a row. So when their tickets are toiled by an ultra-religious, chain-smoking mom, the pals scramble themselves in getting to Detroit, and I'm sure you can figure out the rest.<br/><br/>
Well, not exactly; the movie does go to extreme measures in explaining how the four band members (no, not Gene, Paul, Ace and Peter) go about getting these tickets: losing your virginity in a confessional; saving a smoked-out bimbo and your mom's Volvo (from the Soprano's Steve Schirripa, nonetheless); preventing a robbery in the midst of botching one for a 12-year-old's debt; and of course, stripping down to your bare essentials for MC Ron Jeremy after shuttling a full blender with bourbon-leftovers. Sounds funny, doesn't it? Perhaps Detroit Rock City does have a point with all this tomfoolery in how extreme sometimes these fans can go. And we do understand this movie is a comedy; it is supposed to be filled with slapstick. But does Detroit Rock City aim to the proper audience? It is rated R, meaning the only way prepubescent adolescents-the audience as I see it, to which many will eventually hail this one a classic-will voyeur is through illegal terms.<br/><br/>Detroit Rock City also fails at giving itself the late-1970's touch. The camera's texture quality is way too clear and way too bright, missing the necessary flair from films like This is Spinal Tap and Sid & Nancy. This would've allowed audiences to feel `more at home' with the times. Simply costuming kids into pre-90's grunge-wear and settling others into `disco infernos' does not do the trick. Environment does mean something you know; I doubt Detroit looked this glamorous in '78. If there's anything positive coming from this movie it's the kick-ass soundtrack of hard late-70 to early-80's rock. Van Halen, AC/DC, you name it, it's all here. Of course we can't forget KISS, the band aptly subjected throughout.<br/><br/>
What the film noticeably fails to manage are questions concerning why the Knights of Satin's Service (it's really just KISS) were so frowned upon by moms around the nation. Sure, the loud rock and devilish makeup might be a part of that; encouragements for youth to explore themselves and have a good time might be fair reasons as well. But, what is KISS saying in the music we hear throughout the film towards this highly rebellious group? What separates these anthems of `rock[ing] and roll[ing] all night and partying everyday' from the rest of the music? Most likely, these questions will remain in a music communication class and not in the films that should answer them, simply because it is KISS and they rock and we must do everything in our God-forgiven power to see them.<br/><br/>

","Detroit Rock City is one of the worst movies i've ever seen. Not only does it lack a decent script, but the actors filling the roles are so bad it's painful. Or maybe it's not the actors' faults, but instead it's their characters. The scattered direction and blatant ripoff of I Wanna Hold Your Hand don't make it any easier to swallow. The only inkling of a redeeming quality is the brief snippet of Kiss in concert. If you must rent it, spare yourself the agony and fast forward to those last 5 minutes."

","In 1978, four desperate teenage KISS fans (Edward Furlong, Giuseppe Andrews, James DeBello, and Sam Huntington) want to see their favorite group live in concert and will do anything to get tickets.  Occasionally funny, but very dumb bubble gum comedy gets out of control leading to ridiculous ending. Even die-hard fans will be bored.

What I got were annoying characters ( if I had to hear Trip spout more stoner stupidity I was going to scream) and mind numbingly stupid subplots (can anyone actually suspend disbelief long enough to buy Edward Furlong drinking until he fills a pitcher with vomit, then dancing onstage in a male stripper contest then being picked up by Shannon Tweed, and getting paid for sex?).

"Polaris_DiB","5","1","2","1 September 2008"," Silliness, Nostalgia, and kitsch (I mean, KISS...)
","This is a pretty decent coming-of-age, road-trip, dumb male friends, stoner, flashback to an era of kitsch movie. It's pretty simple: four teenage friends in a band want to go see KISS pretty much more than anything in the world, and they're pretty much willing to fight mothers, hall monitors, bullies, other metal heads, disco-lovers, and kindly church-going folk to do it, meanwhile employing such tactics as stripping, fighting, spiking pizza, getting girls, and sicking dogs to do it. The Joke, as it were, is that it's 1978, it's Ohio, and these young hooligans just want to smoke pot, get laid, and see their favorite band live for once in their lives.<br/><br/>One thing that's kind of annoying about these nostalgia flicks is how focused characters that represent the generation are on a single influence. In this case, the plot revolves around KISS, and yet there's a certain level to which it really is questionable that these kids have nothing else to talk about. Except for in-jokes and a melange of era rock music, there's really not much world-building that gives this movie a particularly late-70s aura. Instead, it's pretty much a single punch-line: remember when KISS was cool and parents thought they were Satanic? Wasn't that funny? Yeah, yeah, it was.<br/><br/>But still... you get to see Edward Furlong, pre-American History X, post-Terminator 2, throw up into a pitcher. You get to see a kid hold off an armed robber with a Stretch Armstrong. There's no end to silliness and laughs as long as you're willing to deal with mostly stupid characters and remember those glory days when you thought KISS was awesome, too (or, if you're like me and weren't around then, imagine it based on this movie's representation of it). Oh, and being from a place like Ohio helps. No, really.<br/><br/>There are better movies with the same kind of humor out there, but that doesn't necessarily mean that this movie should be discarded. For what it's worth, at the moment it's in discount bins practically everywhere and can be acquired for some cheap entertainment with friends and beer pretty much whenever you want. I wouldn't necessarily pass it up if silliness, nostalgia, and KISS music is what you're into.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

I can't think of a single person that would have risked life and limb or worse being grounded to see them. <br/><br/>Definitely not ""Dazed and Confused"" a far better period movie.<br/><br/>The writers were probably the same people I mentioned earlier and that would tend to explain this film.<br/><br/>Check the dollar bin for the DVD."

"abyoussef","7","1","3","21 June 2006"," Full of timeless nostalgia. Precious adolescent memories.
","by Dane Youssef<br/><br/>Now here is a film that is designed to preach to the choir. Well, not so much preach as praise. ""Detroit Rock City"" is a movie that plays out like a throwback to those wonderful days when... you and your friends lived on a steady diet of junk food, teenage smarmy... and great music. <br/><br/>You and your buds had your own band (in the garage, the basement or the backyard) and you had a dream that someday, you'd be up there rocking and rolling for a living.. just like the very bands you worshiped religiously. Some of you made it come true. Made it to that side. Got to live out your dream and was paid the same worship you gave your elders. Most of the others just grew up, and... well...<br/><br/>That's a lot of what ""Detroit Rock City"" is about. Thankfully, it's really not one of those ""topical"" movies that just showcase a flavor-of-the-month band in a starring role like ""Spice World,"" ""Cool As Ice"" or ""Crossroads."" Films like those feel so passé' and ancient in a week or so. When people go to those movies, afterwords, they just ask themselves, ""What was I thinking? God, so dorky! So lame! So embarrassing! Eyecch!"" <br/><br/>He's just like me... they're just like my buds. They sound and think just like us... Jeez... some things are timeless.<br/><br/>The cast is first-rate. The look and sound is so flawless, it's... And the music is all there. Director Adam Rifkin gives this an MTV-music video style of cinematography. And Carl V. Dupre' writes like he's about the age of the boys himself. It's almost like one of our heroes wrote it. Well, in a way, maybe they did.<br/><br/>""Write what you know. Tell your own personal story."" --- Old Writing rule <br/><br/>The screenplay is the very definition of originality: entirely composed of stolen elements from countless other movies--""American Graffitti,"" ""I Want To Hold Your Hand,"" ""That '70's Show,"" ""Clerks,"" ""The Full Monty,"" ""Footloose,"" ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand,"" ""Dazed and Confused"" and probably a lot of others. And the character of Trip is obviously lifted from the Kevin Smith movies. <br/><br/>Of course, let's face it---there's nothing new under the sun and most filmmakers (at least 9 out of 10, anyway) are making movies just like the ones they grew up with. The movies that made them not only want to be filmmakers, but even before that---made them film lovers.<br/><br/>The scene-stealer's in the film are Sam Huntington as the sweet-natured, weak-willed, yet most lovable of the whole bunch, Jereimiah ""Jam"" Bruce and Linda Shaye as his God-fearing, bible-thumping, holier-than-Jesus mother. <br/><br/>The usually reliable Edward Furlong isn't nearly as good, and his role is much more on-par with that of the forgettable ""Pecker,"" rather than the stand-out performance ""T2."" James DeBello is a lot of fun as Trip, but not quite Jay from the Kevin Smith films (which kinda feels like that's what they were going for). And newcomer Giuseppe Andrews unfortunately gives the weakest performance as the pessimistic worry wort Lex. <br/><br/>Porno legend Ron Jeremy himself appears here is an amusing cameo as the disco club MC. And Former Playboy Playmate Shannon Tweed has a thin and underdone role as the older woman ""Mrs. Robinson"" who picks Hawk up at a bar. The type of role she plays in the movie is nothing new for her (and certainly not very interesting), but the original scene (which was cut for length) had a lot more to it, and it really shouldn't have been trimmed out. <br/><br/>The boys (and the cast) feels realistic and genuine. Like the cast of ""That '70's Show,"" they're not just wearing the vintage clothes and hairstyles. They genuinely seem to embody the era. The actors, the clothes, the cars, the music, the lingo, the spirit... this is a movie than genuinely feels authentic. <br/><br/>Although, it's not quite flawless, as precious few movies are (People aren't perfect, life isn't perfect. So why would movies be?) The direction is a bit too much a lot of the time. A little goes a long way, and it seems like Rifkin is indulging himself with fancy camera tricks. And it borderlines on motion-sickness and migraine-inducing at times. <br/><br/>And Dupre's screenplay has a lot of trite', warmed-over and and pedestrian comic material, and kind-of-a cobbled together plot that never feels like it's coming from it's source. The characters are great, and so are most of their lines, as well as some of their moments... <br/><br/>There's a great bit where Trip conjures up a hair-brained (at best) scheme to snake a KISS ticket and gets himself in the worst possible scenario. It's fun watching him try to dig his way out. <br/><br/>This album deserves to go quadruple-platinum and sell more copies than anything Michael Jackson or the Beatles ever did. It's a must-have for anyone who remembers the era fondly or just loves the music. It's retro-cool. The only real problem, as I see it, which kept ""DRC"" from being a classic in the tradition of ""Animal House"" or ""Rock 'N' Roll High School"" is that... well, it's never really sends up the decade or that age very much. Nor does it to that for any of it's targets (cruel teachers/parents, disco-fans, over-zealous, Bible-thumping Christians, and any other authority figure). <br/><br/>It really could have used some of that period-lacerating satire that ""The Simpsons"" or ""That '70's Show"" does so well.

","now this is a hilarious film that reminds me of how some people i know are. seems like a really low budget film, but is the best low budget comedy ever! all the characters are hilarious in their own way, and the bathroom scene is so funny your gonna hold your stomach while laughing. probably the only film i could watch religiously for a year. the music is great, and it's well directed. if you love comedies like bad santa, ace ventura 1 and 2, i HIGHLY recommend this movie to anyone. Although it does lack a certain element that most comedies have, it's still a great one. Way better than that stupid animal house, A lot BETTER.<br/><br/>May contain spoilers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's about 4 kids who are dying to go to a kiss concert, and jam, one of the kids's mom, burns the tickets, so they figure that's not gonna stop them, they keep going after Trip win's a radio contest.... this is highly funny as they encounter random events and strange people.. i loved it! 10/10"

","""Detroit Rock City"" is a film about fans of the band KISS. The film follows four high school students (Hawk, Trip, Lex, and Jam) on their quest for tickets to the KISS concert at Cobo Hall in Detroit, Michigan. When I first saw the trailer for ""Detroit Rock City"" I was so excited. I have always been a huge fan of KISS and had high expectations for this film, and the film successfully met all those expectations. Having never grown up in the 70's I've always wondered what it would have been like to see KISS then and to see America at that point in time. This movie is a great trip back to the 70's. It shows KISS during their huge run on the Love Gun tour. To me this film was funny and it perfectly captured what it's like to be a huge KISS fan. I give it a 10 out of 10."

This is a movie you will want to see more than once.<br/><br/>Edward Furlong is AWESOME as Hawk. He is also very hot, and I love him in this role. He spews off some of the movie's best lines and you gotta love when he kicks the disco lovers ass. James Debello is VERY funny as Trip. He may be really stupid sometimes you grow to love him. He's an aquired taste. Sam Huntington is good as Jam. He was my last favorite of the four boys, but i LOVE when he says ""uh..whew...just gettin' a little sunshine"". Sam did a really good job with SAM. Giuseppe Andrews has a really ugly face but He's funny in this movie (and sorta cute when he comes face to face with the dogs).

","I am what you could consider an Edward Furlong fan, since I rent or tape any film of his I come across. This does not mean though that I'm a die hard fan with articles and posters and stuff. I just think that he's a pretty good actor who chooses his projects wisely. He certainly did so in choosing this film, for Detroit Rock City has a lot of quality. It is funny, it has good rock tunes and the story also holds a few surprises. This is not to say that everything is good here. Sometimes the film is a little bit over the top and I did not like the ending very much (too predictable contrary to the rest of the film), which was somewhat of a bummer for me. The rest is good though if you can appreciate rock music (hear out for some REAL rock classics) or if or if you enjoy Jay and Silent Bob films, for this comes very close to being one. There might not be as much sex talk as in a Jay and Silent Bob film, but experience-wise it sure comes in the vicinity of those films. Imagine a mixture Mallrats and That 70's Show and you've got DETROIT ROCK CITY.<br/><br/>

There may have been some errors as pointed out by others, but these are so few and far between, that they don't make any discernible impact on the film.

This movie is specificly about these four kids and their hopes, dreams and escapades. Take away the Kiss factor and you still end up with a good movie.

","Detroit Rock City works on me as a cross between Suburbia and the Wizard of Oz.  The Story and script was pretty good by having a 4-some of gross-out teens in 1978 going after their Oz, KISS.  Like the Wizard of Oz, they run into a lot of trouble, including the equivalent of the wicked witch (a conservative Catholic mother played well by Lin Shaye).<br/><br/>
But not all the elements are in place here for a comedy (actors like Furlong and Andrews aren't the best at comedy), and though there are a few laughs here and there, it doesn't pack a bang like I though it would (KISS which I like doesn't appear until the end).

","It's 1978. Hawk (Edward Furlong), Lex (Giuseppe Andrews), Trip (James DeBello), and Jeremiah ""Jam"" Bruce (Sam Huntington) are four Cleveland high school kids in KISS tribute band Mystery. Beth (Melanie Lynskey) secretly likes Jam. When his mother finds their KISS concert tickets in his pocket, she destroys them and transfers him to a Catholic boarding school. The boys win tickets on the radio but it's Detroit radio. They rescue Jam from his school and set off for the radio station. The DJ reveals that Trip hung up before actually getting the tickets. The boys split up and have little more than an hour to get into the concert.<br/><br/>The writer Carl V. Dupré seems to be more adapt at horror and that's probably where the problem with this movie starts. Adam Rifkin's directing skills may not be the best either. There are plenty of attempts at slapstick comedy. It's trying to be a rock and roll high school comedy except the comedy part is under-served. It's got the rocking music. The comedy is broad and irreverent. There are a lot of interesting young actors who are capable of doing good work. The strip show is kinda funny.

","This movie was what I expected of it, and that's really the only reason why it's at a lower rating. It's pretty typical and what you'd expect, at least if you watch the trailer first. There were a few things that were left unanswered, but it doesn't really affect the rest of the movie. One issue I had with this movie was in the beginning, since they didn't address the subject at any other time, was the fact that the main characters were concerned with the fact that rock music dominated other genres. It's not necessarily true, but when Christine (Natasha Lyonne's character) mentioned something along the lines of ""It's just music... I find disco a lot easier to dance to..."" I couldn't help but agree more. Again, it's typical for the archetypes of the main characters to be pretentious in that way, so good job on those details. Minus some of the more lewd scenes (and a really uncomfortable one), the movie was entertaining. I probably wouldn't watch it with parents, older folks, or alone, though. It'd be funner to watch with a group of your friends."

","Caught bits and scenes of this movie on YouTube and thought I would give it a try, as I tend to like anything that gives you retro pop culture and guilty pleasure pop songs in the mix. Other reviews I've read about it said that it could really only be enjoyed and appreciated by a true Kiss fan. Meh, I tend to disagree. I'm not what you would call a fan of their music. I was unable to remember the band's real names during the radio contest scene. But to say this is a movie about Kiss and for it to be treated as a movie about Kiss is like saying Wayne's World was a movie about Alice Cooper, as you only see the band perform on stage for a few minutes out of the whole movie. No, this movie is about four boys who are die hard fans of Kiss and go to great lengths to finally see their heroes live. Overall, I found it entertaining enough for an evening of mindless movie watching. It helped that Eddie Furlong was cute as hell in this one. Like the lady in the It's Raining Men club, I also saw him as a perfect example of one of those teenage boys who will make an older woman want to get a hot young man's ""coming-of-age"" started on the right foot, lol. And if you watch the movie, you will see that the previous was an unintentional pun on what happens in the key scene between Eddie and that lady. If you want to laugh, watch this. And if you're a die hard Kiss fan also, you'll probably enjoy this. If you like 70's pop culture references, then you'll be in heaven."

","I am not a KISS fan, but I have been to their concert a few years ago and must say that they do a great performance. So I sure can see why four teenagers who actually are fans of the band will go through all of this to get a ticket. The movie was made in 1999 when all the teen comedies like American Pie came out and goes by the same formula of a light, crude, silly comedy. My problem with this movie is that I really dislike the overacting. I don't blame it on the actors themselves, they are just doing what they were told to, but it kills the fun for me. In a lot of scenes I felt bored, most entertainment came towards the end. I really liked how they ended up getting the tickets, the scene where they came up with the idea and are doing it was hilarious. I won't say exactly what happened because I don't want to spoil the fun for the ones who didn't see it yet. Many famous faces in this movie. It is kind of sad to see Edward Furlong nowadays knowing that this was his last decent movie and he became a B action/horror movie actor after. Too bad, he had so much potential and was great in American History X. A part of me wonders if this movie ruined it for him. It was a pleasant surprise to see Melanie Lynskey in it. The soundtrack is really good. Speaking as a metal and rock fan I really liked it at all. When it comes to soundtrack I would give it 10/10. I don't want people to think that the movie is bad based on my rating. 6/10 just means that it isn't very good and lacks in many parts, but it is still above average and provides some entertainment. KISS fans will love it. It will also appeal to the following groups: teens, stoners, fans of 70's rock, fans of silly comedy, but not all of them will remember this movie forever and place on their top list. It will still give them some laughs."

They have four tickets that Huntington's Jesus freak mother burns, leaving them desperate, yet intent on making the concert.<br/><br/>If you had Great Expectations for the film (co-produced by Gene Simmons and ""authorized by KISS"" - meaning authorized by Simmons and Stanley), then Love 'Em and Leave 'Em. Director Adam Rifkin seems able to construct good visual sequences, but doesn't go All The Way, opting for prosaic slapstick in place of comedy. Sounds like a case of... ""rock and roll pneumonia! We're gonna have to call out... the Doctor."" The opening sequence is promising, as Rifkin gives us a montage of '70's iconography that places KISS in perspective with the times. It's powerful, it's heady, it's nostalgic - and ultimately the best part of the movie, which then goes downhill like a Baby Driver.<br/><br/>The first KISS song we hear is the first cut of 1977's Love Gun, the frenetic I Stole Your Love, a few moments later, the first song on Side Two, the title track, over the montage.<br/><br/>How do I know all this? Full disclosure: didn't go near Google for this info; a deep, abiding knowledge of all things KISS since they decorated my bedroom walls and ceiling. But I never did scrounge up the incentive to send away for the membership paraphernalia because, as Gene's own philosophy about marriage sagely advises, if I really loved them, I didn't need a piece of paper or a jacket back-patch to Shout It Out Loud that I did.<br/><br/>But enough about my laundry.<br/><br/>Soundtrack is righteous '70's rock - UFO, Nugent, T-Rex, KISS, AC/DC, Bowie, Sweet, Ramones - which gives a false impression of the film's quality, because though you feel that surge of bounteous rock stardom when you hear Lizzy's Breakout or Cheap Trick's Surrender, you're still watching THIS film.<br/><br/>Paul Stanley: ""To call it a KISS movie does it a disservice, because it does a disservice to the KISS fans, which is what it's really about."" KISS don't appear in the film until the final few minutes - and then in an annoying composite of the renowned KISS stage antics (blood, smoking guitars, fire-breathing) within one song performance, Detroit Rock City, apparently the one and only song they're going to perform tonight, as they do their closing shtick after this song - drums rise, smash guitars, etc.<br/><br/>The most bemusing factor of this 1999 incarnation of the band is that (except for Frehley) they look exactly like their 1978 Hooligan selves. And they've dressed the stage show in '78 lighted-stairs period, which gives us that nostalgic twitch. That's The Kind Of Sugar Papa Likes (there's a deep cut for you, fans!). We just grimace at the way director Rifkin handles the concert.<br/><br/>I can't quite figure who this movie is aimed at. Actual fans would be turned off by the wholly unconvincing performances and naïveté of the filmmakers (film hits Rock Bottom when one of the guys sneaks in backstage by carrying a kick drum with a KISS logo amongst a group of roadies - I can't even begin to deconstruct the stupidity of this scene). Fence-sitting fans are not shown enough KISS to be convinced, just pummeled with the fanaticism of the fans (who all seem to be rednecks). On YouTube, it seems this movie's fan base are those who profess to be ""not into KISS, but like the movie anyway."" <br/><br/>There are chicks named Beth and Christine, which would mean something to even the most peripheral were-kisser. And Shannon Tweed (Playmate of the Year 1982, and Gene's squeeze) makes a cameo as a MILF hot for guys who've been pursued by Terminators and brought their pets back to life.<br/><br/>""Well, aw yeah!

","If ever there was a movie that involves a certain rock band that I like and 4 teenagers who are willing to do anything to get to the concert of their lives, 'Detroit Rock City' would be it.It is a movie that knows how to turn rock n'roll into an hour and a half of entertainment that you possibly can't miss.Let me ask you a question: Just how far would you go just to go to a concert that you think is the most important thing that can ever happen? Would you put shrooms in a priest's pizza just to break your friend out of a Christain school? Would you beat up a little kid for his tickets for the concert that you really wanted to go to? I didn't think so.The fact that the main characters in this movie do these exact things makes 'Detroit Rock City' a really fun surprise.<br/><br/>This movie will pull the trigger on your.....Love Gun!"

","^^^***LOTS OF SPOILERS!***^^^<br/><br/>Detroit Rock City is a definite must-see motion picture for rocks fans. Kiss is one of my top favorite groups so this movie keeps me entertained all the way through. This film takes place a few years before I was born. After the phenomenal success of the Kiss Worldwide Reunion Tour, someone hatched out a brilliant idea for a movie concept featuring Kiss as the spotlight band. During their heyday in the 1970's, Kiss was one of the biggest and greatest bands on the face of the planet. This movie gives a depiction on something that could have happened back in 1978, or at any point during the group's initial peak period. The results are magnificent.<br/><br/>Friends Hawk, Lex, Trip, and Jam are four high school students who are avid rock fans; they are a garage/basement band named Mystery. The guys are gearing up for a Kiss concert in Detroit. Unfortunately, Jam's mother thinks that the group is like a force of pure Santanic evil, as she is a devoted church goer. She burns their concert tickets and opts to send her son off to a brutal boarding school. Defiance is everywhere here in this astounding piece of entertainment. Elvis, the high school's sinister hall monitor, is out to capture the gang after loitering in the hall without proper passes. They escape his wrath and decide to ditch school. The fellas borrow a car belonging to Lex's mother and head out to Detroit after Trip wins four new tickets on a radio contest. The road trip officially begins once Jam is rescued from the moronic institution located in the next county. On the highway, the gang fouls up with a slice of pizza and a couple of macho, selfish, judgmental fools, Kenny and Bobby, are out to make them pay the price for getting their car windshield messy. These two jerks are avid disco music fans and once they hear Kiss from an 8-track they throw it out into the street, where it gets crushed by a fire engine. Hawk kicks Kenny in the crotch and the boys knock Bobby out. The Guidos are tied up and tortured while their car is creamed with mud. When they make it to Detroit, things go wrong again when they lose their concert tickets from the radio station; Trip hung up too soon when he was participating in the contest. As a result, the boys temporarily disband so they can get new tickets some other way. They are very determined to see their number one favorite rock band perform in concert. Jam's mother is leading a protest again Kiss and their music. She sees him and takes him into a church. Lex tries to sneak past security at the concert venue but is pursued by a fat, loud, and arrogant guard. Hawk manages to get into a strip club and perform for money. Trip initially tries to steal tickets from children at a convenience store but is threatened by a muscle-bound buffoon and his cohorts. To avoid getting hit by this psycho, Trip must rob the store so the goons can have some extra cash. He eventually battles is out with a real store thief and manages to win the heart of the gorgeous gal who is running the register. Lex is caught by the hot-tempered guard and is thrown into a pile of garbage, where he is cornered be vicious dogs. He gradually escapes this situation and the dogs no longer try to attack him. After that he finds his mother's car at a repair shop that is run by two sleazy mechanics. They are also holding Christine hostage. Christine is the girl whom the boys picked up after defeating the Guidos on the highway. Lex wins them over and he shows more respect for this girl in distress. Meanwhile, Jam chooses to stand up to his egotistical mother and tells her that she sucks at being a parent. He tells her good, she deserved every bit of it! When the four boys reunite, still without tickets, they beat each other up so that they can hopefully get into the arena to see Kiss perform on stage. It all works out and the boys have a rocking' good time."

","One of the great things about movies that look at times past is the way they poke fun at individuals who didn't get into popular culture. In this case, four friends in 1970s Michigan worship KISS, but one's mother is a fundamentalist Christian who believes that KISS stands for ""Knights In Satan's Service"".<br/><br/>In a way, ""Detroit Rock City"" is sort of an excuse to be crazy. Whether it's the scene where the four friends hide out in the girls' bathroom and listen to the girl in the neighboring stall, or the part where they finally arrive at KISS's concert, this movie has something for everyone.

"vertigo_14","7","0","1","26 March 2005"," The ""Rock N' Roll High School Forever"" for the 90s. (spoilers)
","Though done with more of an absurdist comedy touch, this movie is nearly the same thing as the 1978 Ramones vehicle, ""Rock N' Roll High School Forever,"" in which the garage punk ethic then (and here, straight glam rock n' roll) symbolized the teenagers true revolutionary spirit against rule-abiding, dogmatic adults. In ""Rock n' Roll High School Forever,"" the revolt against ""the system"" was mostly characterized by a student-led war against an uptight, out-of-touch school principal. Here, it is basically any adult authority trying to keep a bunch of teen KIZZ fans from getting to a much-desired concert in town.<br/><br/>With structural similarities to the 1978 comedy, 'I Wanna Hold Your Hand' (involving Beatles fanatics trying to nail tickets for the 1964 Ed Sullivan Show premiere of the Fab Four), ""Detroit Rock City"" is about four high school friends who basically have their own separate adventures and misadventures in the course of one desperate day, attempting to be there to see their favorite band of all time perform, fighting off relentless security guards, paranoid religious followers condemning rock music, gorilla bullies, and more. Put together, it's a great movie that offers a few laughs (especially if you can relate)."

","As soon as this film began, you knew it wasn't going to win any Oscars, but you didn't mind as the film is so enjoyable from start to finish and is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. <br/><br/>Set in 1978, the movie centres around a quartet of male teenagers from Cleveland, Ohio, that are fanatics of the rock band KISS, and have tickets to see them in Detroit. <br/><br/>Hawk, Lex, Jam and Trip are the foursome hoping to rock out at the concert, but after Jams 'god-bothering' mother finds the tickets, she burns them much to the horror of our four hero's. Deflated and depressed, the Guys then win tickets to the concert via a Detroit radio phone-in, and head out on the highway for the night of their lives. <br/><br/>After an altercation with some disco loving stella's a guido's, they arrive in Detroit, to find that the tickets were not won after all as Trip, (the undisputed arsehole of the group),hung up the phone bfore the DJ could take his details. Once again without a ticket to the concert and with their car stolen, The four are at a loss, knowing that their favourite band are within spitting distance.<br/><br/>The teen rockers decide that it's now every man for himself between now and concert time with each then having their own hilarious adventure. I personally can relate to this story as it was only a few years ago that a similar scenario happened to me i.e another city/band playing/no ticket.<br/><br/>The acting is great, with Edward Furlong giving a brilliant performance as Hawk. Blessed with the looks of a young Michael J Fox circa Back to the Future, Furlong carries the lead role with confidence and believability. James DeBello, is hilarious as Trip, the true stoner of the group, and his moronic ways of thinking makes you laugh out loud. Lex, was played well by Guiseppe Andrews, though his character did seem superfluous to the proceedings at times. Sam Huntington as Jam gives us probably the strongest performance of the four leads. The character of Jam is a troubled one, and the audience, watching this movie, will love him, pity him and at times want to strangle him too, but the scene where he finally confronts his dominating and narrow-minded mother is the best acting in the whole film. Lin Shaye's portrayal of the mum from hell cannot go overlooked, and she is certainly one of the best character actors ever.<br/><br/>If you like your rock music, or if you remember being a teenager that liked rock music, or even if you just like 'hold your gut laughing' teen-comedies, then Detroit Rock City should almost certainly be on your 'to watch list'. Oh! and by the way, This movie has one of the best Kick ASS soundtracks I've heard in a long time, comprising of Kiss (obviously), Black Sabbath, Thin Lizzy, Van Halen, Styx, The Sweet, UFO, AC/DC, Blue Oyster Cult and erm Popcorn by Hot Butter.<br/><br/>Enjoy!!!"

I was a bit younger than our 4 intrepid heroes at the time when the movie is set so I could relate to the culture they represented. It was sort of a trip down memory lane to recall my days in Jr High. The soundtrack was one of the greatest compilations of 60's & 70's rock (and a little Disco) that I have ever heard. Joe Flaherety stole the scene when they got him stoned on ""Magic Mushroons"" I was ROFLMAO in that scene. Seeing Porn legend Ron Jeremy as the MC at the strip club was a hoot too.

DETROIT ROCK CITY may not be the best thing to come out of their existence, but it sure is better than KISS VS. THE PHANTOM OF THE PARK.<br/><br/>DRC is not a particularly good movie, but I can't say I didn't laugh my butt off quite a few times. The scene in which Edward Furlong drinks too much, then vomits into an empty beer pitcher to the tune of ""Boogie Shoes"" was the funniest vomit joke I've seen since the ""Autumn Years"" segment from MONTY PYTHON'S THE MEANING OF LIFE. The scene in which the boys are hiding in a girls bathroom while they listen to a cute girl crap her brains out in the next stall was another sophomoric but funny moment. And a scene in which they get a priest high on mushrooms to break their buddy out of parochial school brings tastelessness to a new level.<br/><br/>This movie is proof that you can be stupid AND funny, just as long as you are indeed funny. A lot of comedies think just setting up a stupid/tasteless situation will automatically provide laughs, then do nothing to make the joke work. DETROIT ROCK CITY works. It might be dumb, crude and immoral, but it made me laugh. That's all I ask."

","Detroit Rock City was surprisingly enjoyable film.  The storyline was solid, as we follow the 4 teenagers trying to get to a KISS concert, while everyone of them has their own version of coming into adulthood, confronted by their biggest fears and dreams.  Not enjoying KISS didn't ruin the film for me, though I surely would have enjoyed it more without that music blasting throughout the film.  Edward Furlong also proved to me, that he is an actor worth watching, and hopefully we will see much more of him in the future. The only downside for me was when their stupidity took over, especially during the driving to the concert, and couple of rather unrealistic scenes which I felt were unnecessary.  The story had such a good base and comedy in itself that it didn't need to resort to some silly scenes to be funny. 7/10"

","As a huge Terminator fan I always watch out for other films the cast have made. I found out about DRC quite a while back and was desperate to see it. However, a limited cinema release here in the UK meant that I did not get to see it on the big screen. It was not until July 2001 that I saw it for rental on DVD and that's when I decided to get it. At first glance it looked awful - the security guard Elvis, the numerous cliches like a spotty geek student but after a while it grew on me. There are some genuinely funny moments, namely the toilet scene which has only been bettered in American Pie. It also becomes quite sad later on as we see the four boys relationship fall apart due to the fact that they cannot find any Kiss tickets.<br/><br/>
Having bought it on DVD two weeks later, I found that I liked it even more. The humour, the acting and the set pieces are all excellent with the ending the only weak spot. <br/><br/>So - if you like rock music then by all means buy this. However, if American Pie or Road Trip is more your sort of thing then I'd only reccomend renting this. Overall I give it 7 out of 10."

","The past few years there has been a lot of movies about teenagers in the 70's. All of which are pretty dull with the exception of this one. It's about four teenage boys, Hawk [Edward Furlong], Lex [Giuseppe Andrews], Trip [James DeBello], and Jam [Sam Huntington]who are all die-hard KISS fans. Before they can attend a KISS concert in Detroit, Jam's mom [Lin Shaye] burns their tickets. But being the die-hard KISS fans that they are, they steal Lex's mom's car and head to Detroit. It may sound like a road movie and a part of it is, but it's not just a road movie. It's a teen movie, a comedy movie, an adventure movie, an action movie, and most of all it's a KISS movie. All this in one movie. Together, it makes the perfect for everyone [except young kids], especially KISS fans. This will be known as a comedy classic for generations to come!"
"Anonymous_Maxine","7","0","4","15 February 2001"," It's not exactly aimed toward the thinking public, but Detroit Rock City delivers more than its share of laughs.
","To put it in Eddie Furlong's own words, there won't be any Academy Awards here. But who cares? This isn't the kind of movie that makes a person expect a brilliant script or spectacular acting, so they can get away with a little cheesiness. The scene early in the film when `Jam' (Sam Huntington) gets tangled up and winds up getting hit in the face with the phone is one of the funniest parts in the movie, despite the fact that it was totally unrealistic. I would normally have no sympathy for someone who didn't just bend their foot a little bit to get the spring off and thereby remove any danger, but I refuse to believe anyone who says that they didn't laugh when that thing pulled him back across the floor. Huntington stole every scene he was in, particularly that side-splitting scene with the phone, as well as a hilarious scene in the classroom when one of his classmates (Beth) tries to tell him that she has a crush on him. <br/><br/>Guiseppe Andrews was also very good as Lex, the long-haired rock n' roll fanatic, and James DeBello as Trip fulfilled the early `Cure' type role. Furlong, on the other hand, doesn't seem to be doing so great. Remember how huge he was after Terminator 2? Sure, 90% of all of that hoopla was because the movie was so good, but you have to admit that Eddie delivered a quality performance in that film. Now, in Detroit Rock City, we have him playing a geeky high school kid in 1978 trying desperately to make his way into a KISS concert. I think that he did a god job in this role, but it's the type of role that is a drop in quality for him, at least from the tremendous Terminator 2 days. In Detroit Rock City, there's a scene where Eddie does a strip tease at a male strip club, trying to win money with which to buy tickets, and he reveals to the world that he has grown into the soft physique of a thirteen year old kid. And this is the guy that was on the cover of every teen magazine you could find only a few years ago.<br/><br/>
Natasha Lyonne appears in the small and fairly unenviable role of a dreaded disco girl, but she fills the role very nicely with her quality acting. She plays the part of one of the girls with whom all four of these high school rock n' roll geeks eventually find romance, which is probably the only part of the story that the movie could really have done without. On the other hand, the entire film plays like every high school kid's fantasy. These guys receive no respect whatsoever at school, yet on this trip to see KISS, they all end up being heroes in the most outrageous ways. Normally I don't like stuff like this, but you just have to let that go in order to enjoy the movie, because if you do that, it's really funny and really entertaining. Another character that is worth mentioning is the notorious hall monitor who, judging from his appearance, probably should have been named ""Wolverine"" instead of ""Elvis.""<br/><br/>Detroit Rock City wasn't made to go down in film history. It was made to make people laugh and to entertain, and I think that it did that on many levels. I'm also glad that the actual band didn't overshadow the film, because if they had played extensive roles, it could really have taken away from the film as a whole. This is a unique adventure story, however unlikely, about four kids who just want to go see their favorite band and encounter every setback imaginable. Never mind trying to figure out who the target audience is, just enjoy Detroit Rock City for the goofy comedy that it is."

My friends and I went dressed up in full KISS gear to the 8:00 show on opening nights. There were only two other people in the theater.

","Detroit Rock City is a movie that should be seen on DVD for a number of reasons, most specifically the special features, including 3 full-length commentaries, including one with the members of KISS. Now, I was never a KISS fan--but had many friends in 1978 (my late junior and early senior year in high school) who were. This movie more than anything captures the SPIRIT of KISS fans. Even the actors and crew admit on one of the commentaries that the film tried to take things a bit ""over the top"" in the way some scenes were portrayed, but too many critics of the movie (and they are mostly negative--and strongly so) miss the true heart of this movie. This movie does have HEART, and it has nothing to do with KISS (sorry, guys). The heart of this film are the Galahad boys who are journeying toward their own Holy Grail (in this case, a KISS concert, but more generally, their own independence or rather self-dependence).  The main four characters, especially Sam Huntington's (Jungle 2 Jungle) character and Giuseppe Andrews' (Independence Day) character stand out, as do those two actors. And as with many good films that have been misunderstood, it's even better the second (and third) viewing. If you want a film about KISS, buy a music video. If you want a movie about real people, get this one."

","I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised!  Detroit Rock City was very entertaining, and I'm not even the biggest Kiss fan.  The good thing is, you don't have to be.  Kiss only plays a minor part in this film, more thematic than actually physically present.  Instead, what you have is a coming-of-age comedy with a wicked pace, loud visuals and a soundtrack to match.  Adam Rifkin does a great job directing, and while the script sometimes falters into stereotype-ville (Ã  la ""all adults are morons""), the film shines when it deals with the four main characters (led by Ed Furlong, who like Leo deCaprio will always look like a 16-yr. old).  The protagonists are well developed, and endearing.  On the sidelines there are some neat little cameos from Natascha Lyonne, Joe Flaherty and Ron Jeremy among others.  And the film has a wicked bite too - adolescent raunchiness is captured nearly perfectly in many of the film's scenes.  It's not nearly as subtle as Richard Linklater's masterpiece, ""Dazed and Confused,"" but it's a great summer movie, and it's a lot of fun."

It's something many people who were ever teenagers can relate to, becase there had to have been a time where you wanted something so bad, and it doesn't matter if you're not allowed to do it, but your'e gonna do it.  While watching the movie, not only are you cracking up, but you're also frusterated for the 4 main charecters in the movie because they have so many troubles just getting into a KISS concert.

","DRC is just another teenage-comedy like we've seen a lot lately. The same corny style humour like in American Pie and Road Trip, only slightly less funny. But it is one with a twist. I personally doubt wether kids today will even KNOW the band KiSS, let alone think it's cool they're in this movie. However, the topic is of all times, lot's of moms are worried sick about the weird en loud music their kids listen do. (KiSS could be easily replaced by Marilyn Manson or KoRn in this movie, it would appealed to more kids that way). Viewers that are a bit older may enjoy the cool soundtrack of old rock songs (that doesn't even feature that much KiSS-songs, mind you), but probably will be taken back by the befor metioned corny humor. (But they might just laugh at remarks like 'Take COOL A.T. GANG FOR INSTANCE, NOW THAT'S SOME REALY GOOD MUSIC!!!' hehehe)<br/><br/>
Anyways, as I said, a teen-com with a slight twist. It's enjoyable, funny at some parts and how it all works out in the end is okay. Definatly worth a trip to the videostore if you're into some corny stuff, great rock music and don't have high expectations to begin with. And oh yeah, DISCO does SUCK doesn't it."

","For me, Detroit Rock City was THE movie of 1999.  I thoroughly enjoyed everything about it.  Being a teenage musician with rock band idols, I could easily relate to the main characters. Perhaps the most shocking part of seeing this film for the first time was finding that it isn't 'the kiss movie', like so many reviewers (who probably didn't bother WATCH it) have dubbed it to be.  Leave your 'Kiss Army' i.d.s at home, because a kiss movie it's certainly not, but rather a celebration of what being a teenager with a dream is all about, and it captures every aspect perfectly.  Every scene is scored with great music ('Frankenstein', 'Godzilla', 'Blitzkreg Bop' and dozens other amazing 70's rock tunes). Bottom line: It's a great, innocent-spirited (though in no way innocent), comedy aimed at a younger audience than it's R rating would allow in to the theatre ($4,000,000 at the box office? What the...), but for the older people, it's a great 70's - teenage rock 'n' roll nostalgia movie."

","'Detroit Rock City' was the coolest movie I saw in '99. I was shocked to see it only grossed $4 million at the box-office, which makes it the lowest grossing movie I've ever seen i the theaters, that I know of. But who gives a damn!!!!<br/><br/>Of course, it's pretty popular to make a raunchy teenage-boy movie starring 4 teenage best friends. But this time, instead of the boys searching for a dead body, trying to rid their football coach, lose their virginity, or drive cross country to intercept a sex-tape, their trying to get into the biggest concert of the year. But what I liked about this movie over the other raunch fests is that this took place over 20 years ago, in a time of teens I knew so little about. I heard the original production plan was to set the movie in present-day, and have the guys going to Detroit to see Kid Rock AND Eminem. That would have been a HUGE mistake. One wannabe-black white guy is bad enough, but two is enough to make me wanna go on a killing spree, terminating all white guys who think they're black.<br/><br/>But enough about poseurs. I saw this movie with my friend, my brother, and my dad. If my dad thinks one of my favorite movies is funny, it's funny. After seeing it, I just wanted to go out and start my own band, which I've already tried several times, unsuccessfully. I hope Edward Furlong, Sam Huntington, James DeBello, and Guiseppe Andrews go on to bigger projects, but hold this movie as the most underrated, coolest gem of the '99, right up there with 'SLC Punk'."

The language could have been toned down.  people didn't cuss that bad until now.  And the way they were dressed in my eyes was mostly 80's heavy metal style instead of 70's.

At first this bothered me, then I got used to it.  It reminded me a lot of ""Rock & Roll High School"" in that aspect (although it is far inferior to the Ramones MASTERPIECE...that's right...MASTERPIECE!!!! LONG LIVE ROGER CORMAN!!).  Both movies meld Rock n' Roll fantasy and reality together.  Initially I was expecting a ""Dazed and Confused"" rip-off, but luckinly the only obvious lift was the Trip character who was pretty much a copy of Slater from the Linkletter film. I'm not quite sure where all the Catholic bashing came from, I thought it was very extremely misdirected.  The whole Mother character was rather stupid also.  The other three leads more than made up for the lack of a coherent script and some rather silly plot devices.  The kid who played Jam was very enjoyable and I really wanted to get to know his character more. Edward Norton and the other guy showed a lot of enthusiasm.  They looked like they had a lot of fun making this movie. The whole ticket search part of this movie reminded me Zemickis' wonderful ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" which chronicles five kid's looking for Beatles tickets in Feb. '64 for the Ed Sullivan show.<br/><br/>The biggest surprise was seeing Melanie Lynskey as Beth.  I absolutely fell in love with her in ""Heavenly Creatures"" and had no idea she was in this movie.  Hopefully she will show up in more movies in the future.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you have nothing better to do and want to see a pretty good Rock Comedy, you could do worse than this movie.

Dazed and Confused is the most vivid 70's movie I've seen. This one is entertaining in its own silly way, but doesn't quite get it right in some areas. In the 70's, many of us considered KISS to be a joke, and those kids who were into KISS were basically dweebs who were trying to be cool...most of the kids who really wanted to rock liked Led Zeppelin, Aerosmith, Nugent, UFO, etc. And who could forget Van Halen's debut album. But that aside, this movie is not so much about KISS, but about rock fans in that era, and the excitement of going to one of their concerts, whoever the band might be. The film does capture that goofy excitement, like pulling up to the concert hall and seeing the marquee outside, and the crowds, like one big party. The story is basically of four friends trying to score tickets to get in the show, who have comical, but far-fetched experiences in trying to obtain them. One other thing the movie does touch on, and it was a big 70's thing, was the rock and roll vs. disco scene. I remember me and my friends HATING disco, and those guys hated us, but we didn't care."

It focuses on the efforts of four friends to get into a KISS concert after one of their moms destroys the tickets originally purchased. <br/><br/>Most of the comedy in this one is of a physical nature, although there are a few lines that are pretty good.  Edward Furlong returns in this one to play Hawk, leader of the group of friends, as well as lead singer for their rock band Mystery.  He plays a ""burnout"" type character well, and is pretty funny during his efforts at striptease to win money for tickets.<br/><br/>The rest of his friends are stereotypical with one exception: Sam Huntington as Jeremiah ""Jam"" Bruce.  The band's drummer, he is shy and sensitive. Although constantly badgered by his nagging mother (a wonderfully over the top Lin Shaye), he manages to be not only rebellious enough to be your typical teen, he exhibits a heart and feeling missing from most teen characters.<br/><br/>Once again, Natasha Lyonne is woefully underused.  Her character of Christine (KISS fans will realize that the two main teen females are named for songs:  Christine Sixteen, and the ubiuqitous Beth) is basically a disco loving tart, dressed in short skirts and acting as if she is better than you.  This, along with ""American Pie"" really could have utilized this talented young actress better.  <br/><br/>Speaking of Beth, Melanie Lynskey plays that character.  She is hopelessly in love with Jam, and due to a disturbance from his mother on her last day at Robert F. Kennedy High may be unable to tell him how she feels......or will she?.............. Ms. Lynskey does an admirable enough job with her part, Beth is the girl next door, the one everyone just loves.  She comes across as both shy and vunerable.  Good job.  <br/><br/>Now on to KISS themselves. (SPOILER ALERT!!) They appear only in the final scenes of the movie to play the title song, albeit an abbreviated version. While they recreated a 70's era show, complete with set and costumes, that appears to be the only real effort put into this movie by them.  This movie is clearly focused on the fans and their loyalty to the band.  While it pains me to say this, as I count myself proudly among the ranks of the KISS Army, it didnt give enough of a thank you to the fans.<br/><br/>""Detroit Rock City"" is not meant to be taken seriously, nor is it Oscar material.

For those pre-disco KISS fans this is a movie not to be missed, and for those who were around in the KISS heyday and were not fans, but knew those who were, it should be a must-see as well. Coming out soon on video the studio is unfortunately not marketing it very well as KISS does not even appear on the box art and one fears that by simply looking at the box many of those who might enjoy the tape will miss out!"

","When I saw this movie, it reminded me of I WANT TO HOLD YOUR HAND. (Another movie about kids trying to get to see their favorite rock group-The Beatles)<br/><br/>It has a few inside jokes for KISS fans, a look back at what it was like in the 70's and liking heavy metal especially KISS.  If you're a child of the 70's growing up on KISS or the music of the times, you like it as you remember what it was like to be told that KISS were Satan worshipers.<br/><br/>See it, rent it do whatever you can if you love the music."

"AlWhite","8","0","1","27 August 1999"," Another fine Rifkin film.
","Detroit Rock City really exceeded my expectations.  There's some great scenes in this film and they come together in a suprisingly cohesive way. The script was actually very funny - once the movie gets past an initial string of physical comedy bits that the actor can't carry that well (and shouldn't be expected to) there are some very funny lines and situations.<br/><br/>Special mention has to go to the soundtrack - most of the songs in the movie aren't on the disc (there must be 45 songs in the film).<br/><br/>Overall I thought it was a great summer movie, and I noticed a lot of Adam Rifkin/Rif Coogan signatures in the direction which added to the hilarity. If you liked this, be sure to check out The Invisible Maniac, which is in the same vein of humour (although in much worse taste in some ways)."

","I don't really like KISS at all, but this is a really funny movie. A group of my friends saw it on opening night and my best friend was like, gotta be there an hour early or it'll be sold out. Yeah right, we were almost the only ones in the theater! The film is hysterical! We all liked it. Lex (Andrews) and Trip (DeBellos?) had the kewlest ""endings."" The only part that wasn't too good was the part with Hawk in the car with the older woman... he could have had a much better ""ending."" Otherwise it was all quite enjoyable."

"Brigance","Null","0","2","17 July 1999"," ""The Last Cool Movie of the Millennium""
","I've seen what is pretty much the completed version of this film, and let me just say that I can't stop watching it. The film is basically a road trip/adventure film about four guys who would do anything to get into a sold out 1978 KISS Concert.<br/><br/>What's cool about this movie is that it isn't trying to show off to anyone. The dialogue and ordeals are genuine and believable, yet fun at the same time. For example, when the leader, Hawk (Eddie Furlong) is forced to battle stage fright and endure a drunken striptease before hundreds of drooling old ladies. You find yourself rooting for the characters because, there's a lot of them in us. Whether we wore long sideburns and skin tight shirts in the seventies or are Pearl Jam fans of the Nineties. There's a unity to the characters in this film that the audience will truly bond with.<br/><br/>For a film that's been labeled ""the KISS movie"", there is not that much KISSTORY here. The four guys in the movie are on a quest to discover KISS. Their devotion for the band helps to shape their characters, but it does not encapsulate them. What is present in the characters is the ""attitude"" of KISS. The belief that ""there is no such thing as failure, only quitting.""<br/><br/>The best description I can give of this film is that it's a 50/50  split between ""Stand By Me"" and ""Dazed and Confused""; Two incredible films. The connection works. The film is not flashy and Adam Rifkin's direction plops us into the adventure in a way that doesn't bring light to the fact that it's ""just a movie."" He creates a wonderful blend between originality and creativity. A KISS fan his whole life, Rifkin and the rest of the cast and crew understand the motivation that drives the four main characters through their car chases and convenience store hold-ups.<br/><br/>The marketing campaign for the film has mentioned the line that one of the stars, Natasha Lyonne once said; ""It's the last cool movie of the millennium."" Believe it. We live in a society of post-modernism. I, for one, sort of enjoy it. Go see this film in the theatres. See it for four true and honest performances from the young cast. See it for a hilarious scene in the girl's washroom. See it for the kickin' song list that adds everything to the feel of the film. Most of all, see it because when we were kids, all of us, there were no such things as consequences."

","I saw the movie on opening night. I had to drag some people from work to see it. By the way everyone was laughing during the movie I knew they loved it (esp. the puke scene, the bathroom scene and the mini-mart). Anyone who had half of an interesting time as a teenager can see this and remember the exciting times you went through. This movie is about life and some of the things you WISHED you had the guts to do. I haven't laughed like this is a very long time."

I give this flick 9 out of 10"
"Aissa","9","0","1","15 August 1999"," A surprisingly fun, entertaining film!
","I am not a KISS fan at all, so I expected to be bombarded by cliche teenage rock n' roll fantasies.  Instead, I throughly enjoyed this film, which was filled with pop culture images, comedic twists, crafty visuals, and well-placed audio effects and music that kept the mood of the film exciting and fun!  Like a cross between ""The Blues Brothers"" and ""Rock 'n Roll High School"", I highly recommend this film!"
"greenie","7","0","1","14 August 1999"," Remember going to your first rock concert?
","For many of us growing up, the experience of going to your first BIG concert is an unforgettable, fantastic experience. In many cases it's not the concert itself that we remember, rather the days and hours leading up to the concert, the excitement of the crowd, and sharing the experience with your friends. Perhaps the most memorable experience however, was the simple fact that you made it to the show, a true coming of age for many teens.<br/><br/>DETROIT ROCK CITY reminds us of all these obstacles and emotions with a 1978 rock-and-roll backdrop. While the KISS concert may be the ultimate goal of the four friends in this movie, the band (and thankfully, its music) takes a backseat to the characters themselves, and what they're willing to go through to make it there. KISS becomes little more than a piece of scenery, really.<br/><br/>While this movie will be enjoyed by anyone who has experienced this -- or are currently -- those who grew up through the 70s will enjoy it the most. Exceptional attention to 70s detail is everywhere, with particular attention paid to 1978 itself. The soundtrack is full of songs released in 1977-1978 (and almost entirely non-KISS) and the selection works well to supplement how the characters feel and the situations they encounter.<br/><br/>While no movie may ever compare to DAZED AND CONFUSED when it comes to capturing the life of a teenager in the 70s, DETROIT ROCK CITY is a very welcome, funny, and enjoyable addition to this genre."

","One of the best overlooked movies of the 90's. While it lacks any standout scenes, or particular moments that would have you rolling on the floor with laughter, it remains consistantly fun, entertaining, truthful, and maybe even a little reminiscent."
"BlackDiamondRing","Null","0","1","11 April 2002"," Fun for the fans, if maybe no one else
","This movie really isn't for mass consumption: it's for fans of KISS, or people with friends who are fans of KISS, and thusly are forced to watch it. And contrary to the opinions of the last reviewer, we DO exist, and there are millions of us.  And I am one of the most militant KISS fans in existence, which most people find humorous since I was born ten years after ""Alive!"" came out.  That being said, I enjoyed the heck out of this movie. There are fan-only in jokes, such as the drummer's girlfriend being named Beth.  It's just a load of fun, as I may be in a minority among the people who can actually relate to the characters: a teen aged male musician.   And the obsessive characters are alot like me:  knowing all of the band's birth names, for instance.  I laughed like a madman the whole way through, particularly during the scene in the strip club.  This is supposed to be an over-the-top scene, but actually makes Edward Furlong's character more relatable- the first time I sang with my band in front of a largish audience, I had to fight not to throw up.  This scene shows you the extremes of what stage fright feels like.  But probably the greatest point in the movie is the ""looking down the massive tongue"" shot during the concert.  As a huge fan of Gene, that one shot made the movie.  The only real problem I had with the movie was the tendency toward historical inaccuracies. AC/DC's ""Highway to Hell"" plays at one point, although the film takes place in 1798 and that song wasn't released until 1979, and KISS didn't start their sets with ""DRC"" in '78.  Gene wasn't even playing the right bass. But those are things that probably only I would've noticed and thusly don't really effect the film.   Also, the main character in the movie is the drummer.  This only bugs me because I'm a bass player, and the bass player in MyStical is the one who screws up and hangs up too early in the first place. But anyway, if you're a KISS fan, I don't need to tell you to see this movie since you probably already have.  If you aren't a KISS fan, you probably shouldn't bother.  But, whether you like the band or not, buy the soundtrack.  With the exception of Marilyn Manson's horrid rendition of ""Highway to Hell"", it's gold from first track to last."
"Lumberjackyl","Null","0","2","13 April 2002"," The best coming of age comedy to date. Hysterical film!
","While growing up, I was always a huge Kiss fan, and when I heard that they were making this film, I was a little skeptical. After seeing the God awful Kiss Meets the Phantom (even me, the mega-fan can't get into that one), I didn't know what to expect. <br/><br/>This film shocked the hell out of me. It was well written, well acted, and just plain hysterical. Pure comic greatness. There is not enough good things to say about this film.<br/><br/>The film takes place in 1978, when Kiss were on top of the world. Four friends decide to take a trip to Detroit to see their heroes in action. As they travel, they have many different adventures, all very funny and exciting.<br/><br/>This film bombed at the box office, and it was a true shame. When I saw this on opening night, there were only five other people in the theatre. Even if you are not into Kiss, give this movie a chance, as it really does entertain, and does a good job of re-creating the late 70's."
"katie_marie87","10","0","2","19 February 2002"," um?
","Detroit Rock City is absolutely the greatest movie ever made.. (Other than Fight Club and American History X, they are my other two favourites). Edward Furlong and all the others were great in it, just trying to have fun and not worrying about all the acting.  Mystical sucks, but they had to learn everything in a month or so.. So I do give them credit.  This movie is hilarious (especailly when Elvis falls on the football field screaming), and also a great film for anyone to watch.  (I've gotten a few people addicted to it also) I love the Volvo! Edward Furlong is definitally the hottest person in the world, and all i have to say about this movie is that it KICKS ASS."

It was so well portrayed.  Can't remember how many fights I got into HS against the Disco folks :)<br/><br/>Of course the movie itself is funny but not a masterpiece.

"bcali","Null","0","1","4 April 1999"," An entertaining physical teen comedy
","I saw this movie at a sneak screening a little while ago.  It's a funny comedy about 4 teens trying to score KISS tickets back in the late 70's. The movie follows the 4 boys and demonstrates what they're willing to do to obtain the tickets.<br/><br/>There are a lot of familiar faces in the movie and the story moves along at a nice pace.  A large part of the comedy is physical, along the same lines as that found in There's Something About Mary.<br/><br/>Overall, a good movie that will be liked by the under-21 age group, doesn't do much for the older generation even if it attempts to sway them into the theatre by mentioning KISS.<br/><br/>My biggest problems with the movie, the script could have been funnier, relied less on physical comedy and more on the screenplay.  Second, its suppose to take place in Detroit but it wasn't shot there.  If you're going to shoot the film in another city, try to make it a point to avoid capturing their famous landmarks in the scene. Hopefully in the final release, these landmarks aren't so obvious and noticeable."
